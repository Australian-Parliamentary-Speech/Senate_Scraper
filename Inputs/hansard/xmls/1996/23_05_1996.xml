This amount was included in the revised Budget estimates for 1995-96 released by the Treasurer on 12 March 1996. Passage of the legislation prior to 30 June 1996 is necessary to meet this commitment.

        The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Offshore Minerals Act 1994, the Wool International Act 1993, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion and Organisation Act 1993, the Poultry Industry Assistance Act and the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment to the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 is required to preserve the integrity of licences granted under the Act the boundaries of which might be affected by changes in the location of the territorial sea baseline. At present the section only applies where changes to the baseline might be caused by natural processes as tides or storms. The amendment expands the section to apply it to changes in the location of the baseline resulting from acquisition of new data or reconsideration of existing data. The amendment has been made necessary by a recent case where the integrity of licences has been brought into question by a change in the location of the baseline caused by reconsideration of old data.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the amendment does not proceed the result may be that the relevant Western Australian and Commonwealth offshore exploration licences may be declared cancelled. The current licence holders would then be required to lodge fresh applications with the possibility of any delay leading to legal proceedings for compensation against the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Wool International Act 1993 set the debt component of the wool tax by regulation, expand Wool International's trading powers and terminate voluntary (additional) contributions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill will facilitate setting the debt component of the wool tax to zero with effect from 1 July 1996. It will provide an important income boost for the wool industry which is currently experiencing serious difficulties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A delay in the provision for expanded trading powers for Wool International would limit the risk management instruments producers have available to them to counter volatility in the market. In the current depressed market environment this could seriously affect the future of the industry and generate considerable pressure on Government to assist the industry's recovery in other possibly more interventionist ways. It is also likely that future privatisation will also be delayed and will delay the opportunity for producers to choose a cash payment over shares in a privatised Wool International.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The above measures must be in place by l July 1996 at the start of the new wool selling season and any delay would put the industry under much greater adjustment pressure and potentially jeopardise its future recovery. It could also lead to increased pressure on the Government to further assist the industry through other mechanisms.

          —As the new Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I would like to report very briefly on the first meeting of the committee for the new parliament and to also pay tribute to the previous Chairman, Senator Colston. As honourable senators are aware, the committee scrutinised each disallowable legislative instrument tabled in the Senate, of which there were more than 2,200 last year, to ensure compliance with high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights.

         The committee takes this task very seriously. At its last meeting during the previous parliament, it resolved to recommend to the Senate that it disallow the whole of a particular regulation if the minister did not undertake on that same day to amend it. Fortunately, the minister did this, and I will shortly present a formal written report on the committee's actions in this matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the present, however, I will outline the matters dealt with by the committee at its meeting this morning. The agenda of the committee included consideration of some 43
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          letters from ministers of the previous and new governments and, because of the caretaker period before the recent election, from departmental officers. These replies illustrate the extent of the committee's interest and influence. In them ministers confirm that five acts had been or would be amended to meet our concerns, including one retrospectively; that another act had been applied to a territory and another enabling act had been repealed. In respect of the legislative instruments, ministers advised that provisions of two were void; that in respect of a third, in delightful Sir Humphrey style, that on the one hand the instrument could be considered void, while on the other hand it could be treated as valid; and in respect of a fourth, advice that an instrument that was not void was couched in such terms that the committee resolved to approach the minister again. Two more instruments, the committee was told, were inoperative—whatever that means. Ministers also undertook to amend at least 21 separate instruments to meet our concerns. I say `at least' because one undertaking was to provide AAT review for all portfolio charging decisions. A number of these 21 instruments will be amended in respect of multiple defects; in the case of one ordinance, nine separate sections will be amended. These 21 undertakings to amend include only substantive improvements and not undertakings merely, for instance, to avoid invalidity or to improve citation and numbering.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The replies also included explanations of the apparent administrative or legal defects raised by the committee. One reply gave reasons for an eight&amp;hyphen;year delay in complying with a mandatory legislative duty, while another advised that a statutory authority had mistakenly paid $350,000 in payroll tax. The committee was not satisfied with six of the replies and resolved to ask ministers for further information.

I will point out that such quality is one of the hallmarks of good government. In conclusion, I believe that the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances will continue to justify the confidence of the Senate, which it has enjoyed in the past 65 years of its operations.

        The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is a very simple bill. It proposes just one amendment to the principal act. That amendment is to section 20 and it ensures that the act continues to apply for a further two years until 1 January 1999.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section 20 of the principal act, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, is a sunset clause. It currently provides that the act ceases to have effect on 1 January 1997. This bill proposes changing that date to 1 January 1999.

        The principal act provides assurances of education quality and financial protection to international students studying in Australia. It does so by registering providers of international education and training, based on state or territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        These objectives remain relevant. This is not just the government's view, but the universal view of industry representatives expressed in recent national consultations by an independent consultant. This is an industry which currently earns Australia $1.9 Billion in export revenue annually. It warrants proper protection and this bill allows that protection to continue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The act has included a sunset clause since its making in 1991. The original provision was for a three year sunset period. This was to allow development of complementary state/territory regulation and to ensure that the regulation of many small and medium sized businesses did not continue without review. Unfortunately, states and Territories have still not implemented legislation which would allow withdrawal of this act. Following review and extensive debate the act was strengthened in 1993 and the sunset date was extended by another three years to the current 1 January 1997.

        Consistent with the government's push to limit unnecessary business regulation, it is appropriate to retain a sunset clause in this act. The bill before the house seeks to extend the sunset date by only two years, because this is considered sufficient time to allow further industry consultations to develop simpler, but still effective regulation in this industry.

        The industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major part of our growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade and diplomatic links, in addition to the $1.9 Billion in export revenue annually.

        This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The difference between the estimated Budget and Consolidated Revenue Fund outcomes (estimated at about $2.8 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96) arises because appropriations from the CRF include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the budget outcome. These items include superannuation payments made by the commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and, if necessary, to reimburse the Consolidated Revenue Fund for certain non&amp;hyphen;defence expenditures. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the loan fund.

        Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $0.2 million for 1996&amp;hyphen;97, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or currently before, the Parliament. I emphasise that the bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the parliament.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        When ATSIC came into being, a little over six years ago, it was recognised as representing a unique experiment in public administration. Nothing like it had been tried before, in Australia or overseas. A review by ATSIC of the operation of the ATSIC Act was completed in early 1993 and a number of significant recommendations for change were made as a result of that review. Amongst those recommendations were recommendations for a reduction in the number of regional councils and for the commission chairperson be elected by the elected zone commissioners, rather than being chosen by the minister.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The recommendation to reduce the number of regional councils was aimed at increasing management efficiency and enabling better servicing and resourcing of regional councils.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The recommendation to provide for an elected commission chairperson was based on the notion that this would be consistent with the principles of empowerment, self&amp;hyphen;determination and self&amp;hyphen;management which were the basis for ATSIC's establishment. Nevertheless, the commission's report containing this recommendation did acknowledge that the question of appointment of the commission chairperson was a complex issue. The report expressed that, in many ways, the chairperson is the primary link and source of day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day advice between the commission and the government. It went on to say that the chairperson must be a person in whom the government may have total confidence, at the same time as having the confidence and trust of, and the ability to represent, all
        <break page="980" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The former government accepted both of the recommendations for amendment to the ATSIC Act at that time. Consequently, a 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act provided for a reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. The reduction in the number of regional councils took effect for the round of regional council elections conducted on 4 December 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act also included amendments which provided for a fully elected Board of 17 ATSIC Commissioners, with the members of that Board to elect one of their number to be commission chairperson. However, these amendments were expressed to be effective from 1 July 1996 and were therefore intended to affect arrangements for the next Board of Commissioners following the next round of regional council elections, due to be held later this year.

        Following completion of the 1993 round of ATSIC regional council elections and the subsequent zone elections, an independent panel was convened under section 141 of the ATSIC Act to review ATSIC's boundaries and electoral systems. The Review Panel conducted consultation meetings in 20 locations throughout the country. Its report to the former minister on its review of electoral systems was completed in March 1994 and was tabled in the House and in the Senate. One of the recommendations of the Review Panel was that the size of regional councils be reduced.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Currently the number of members on a regional council is dependent on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of the region and ranges from a low of 10 for regions with an estimated population of less than 1,000 people, to a high of 20 for regions with an estimated population of 10,000 or more. The Review Panel proposed that the act be amended to provide for regional councils to be comprised of 8 members for regions of less than 1,000 people, increasing to a maximum of 12 members for regions with a population exceeding 10,000 people.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The initiative was seen as one which would facilitate more effective and efficient operations by regional councils. In essence, it was the view of the Review Panel that the larger a regional council is, beyond an optimum size, the more unwieldy it is and the less effective it is in the performance of its functions. The Review Panel's report included advice of concerns that:

        The government accepts the recommendation of the Review Panel to reduce the size of regional councils and the basis for the recommendation. The proposed amendment will contribute to greater efficiency in regional council operations and reduced administrative costs associated with the operation of regional councils. It will also help to ensure that membership on regional councils is gained on the basis of a more appropriate level of community support.

        Regarding selection of a commission chairperson, the government acknowledges the importance of democratic principles in assisting the achievement of greater self&amp;hyphen;management and independent decision making. However, the government maintains that it must retain an appropriate degree of control and accountability where large amounts of government funds are being administered. Selection of a commission chairperson by government is central to the achievement of this objective.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although the ATSIC Board of Commissioners opposes selection of a commission chairperson by government, it is clear that there is significant division within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on this issue. Arguments put forward by Aboriginal people who oppose election of a commission chairperson include reference to the special range of skills required of a commission chairperson and the lack of any guarantees that those skills will be possessed by a person who gains office through the ATSIC electoral processes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The requirements for an effective commission chairperson are seen to include that:

        It has been contended that the people who have the range of skills to handle the job of chairperson are in employment already and would not consider leaving their positions to take a chance on being elected through the representative levels to the office of commission chairperson.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government accepts these views and considers that selection of a commission chairperson with the appropriate range of skills is fundamental to the future success of ATSIC.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Currently the Board of Commissioners is comprised of 17 elected commissioners and 2 commissioners chosen by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The minister is required to appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be commission chairperson.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment proposed in this bill would have the effect of retaining the current arrangements so that, following the next round of zone elections, the 17 elected commissioners would not elect one of their number to be commission chairperson. Rather, a further 2 commissioners would be appointed by me and I would then appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be commission chairperson.

        Another significant area addressed by the bill is the improvement of accountability arrangements for regional councils. In the interest of greater public accountability, the bill includes amendments to make regional council meetings open to the public and to give the public an entitlement to inspect a range of regional council documents.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the proposed arrangements, regional council meetings will generally be open to the public but will be able to be closed in certain circumstances, similar to those in which local government meetings can be closed. Such circumstances include where commercial&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;confidence and personal privacy issues are being discussed, and where it is necessary to deal with disruptive conduct. Additionally, the public will have an entitlement to inspect regional council codes of conduct, written procedures for meetings, management plans, written policy documents relating to the payment of expenses and provision of facilities to regional councillors, minutes of meetings (except where the meeting or the minutes are closed in relation to the exceptions I have mentioned) and other documents which would otherwise be accessible under Freedom of Information legislation.

        This bill also allows for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an administrator to ATSIC or to the Torres Strait Regional Authority in the event that the minister is satisfied that the administration of public money by ATSIC or by the TSRA involves fraud or gross mismanagement. The minister would also be able to appoint an administrator should ATSIC or the TSRA breach a direction given to it by the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         minister. In this regard, I recently issued directions to both ATSIC and the TSRA requiring that proposed grants and loans be subject to the scrutiny of a Special Auditor.

        This power will enable the government to oversee the administration of public money by ATSIC and the TSRA and to act quickly to stop any misuse of taxpayers' money. Of course, I would expect that the appointment of an administrator would be resorted to only in extreme circumstances. I am confident that the use of the Special Auditor mechanism will improve accountability and proper financial management and I am hopeful that the appointment of an administrator will not be necessary. Nonetheless, the government must have the power to ensure that public money is being spent properly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Once appointed an administrator would assume control of the organisation's property and affairs and perform the powers and functions normally undertaken by ATSIC or the TSRA as the case may be. The organisation would continue to operate with the administrator making decisions which would otherwise be made by the ATSIC Board of Commissioners or TSRA members. In this way the provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would proceed with minimal disruption while whatever problems identified are examined.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The administrator will be able to conduct reviews and recommend changes to the structure and operations of ATSIC or the TSRA. This would ensure that the difficulties which led to appointment of the administrator can be remedied during the administrator's appointment and will not be repeated in future. In this way, the elected representatives would be in the best possible position to resume control when the appointment of the administrator ends.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ability to appoint an administrator will be a useful and essential tool in the government's programme of ensuring proper administration and accountability in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

        The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1996 will provide legislative authority for measures required to give effect to a substantial restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. It will also provide for the abolition of related legislation, namely the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965 and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990.

        The proposed restructure is the same as that envisaged by the previous government. As such, the bill that I am now presenting is virtually identical to one which was introduced by the former government late last year and passed by the House of Representatives on 24 October 1995.

        The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established as a statutory authority just over thirty years ago to meet a structural deficiency in the highly regulated financial environment which existed at that time.

Furthermore, to enable the company to attain the minimum credit rating required for mortgage insurers by state legislation, it would, in the absence of this guarantee, be necessary for the commonwealth to commit significant additional capital resources to the new Company, over and above what is already proposed.

        The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Offshore Minerals Act 1994; the Wool International Act 1993; the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Act 1993; the Poultry Assistance Act 1965; and the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988. The bill will also repeal 3 acts and make consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 because of the repeal of these acts.

        The bill contains an amendment to section 15 of the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 to preserve the integrity of licences granted under the act the boundaries of which might be affected by changes in the location of the territorial sea baseline. At present the section applies only where changes to the baseline might be caused by natural processes such as tides or storms. The amendment expands the section to apply it to changes in the location of the baseline resulting from acquisition of new data or reconsideration of existing data. The amendment has been made necessary by a recent case where the integrity of licences has been brought into question by a change in the location of the baseline caused by reconsideration of old data.

        This amendment to the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 is required following a change in the representative organisation of the egg industry and a subsequent request from the industry for acknowledgment of the recently formed Australian Egg Industry Association (AEIA) as the representative industry organisation on matters requiring industry consultation in place of the former industry body—the Australian Council of Egg Producers (ACEP). The AEIA now needs to be acknowledged in the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 to provide it with a legal basis to make recommendations on behalf of industry on levy related matters.

        The act imposes a levy in respect of laying chickens hatched and  provides regulations for the purposes of levy rates, with the amount of levy as recommended by the now defunct ACEP. Funds raised under this levy currently reside in the Poultry Industry Trust Fund (PITF) established by the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965. This act needs to be amended to facilitate the transfer of funds from the PITF to the egg industry development fund administered by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation for research and development on the egg industry. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 along with the Egg Industry Research (HEN Quota) Levy Act 1987 and Poultry Industry Levy Act 1965 will be repealed once the transfer of the funds has been made.

        The AEIA has also requested an increase in the research and development component of the levy from 1 july 1996, subject to legislative amendment to the Laying Chicken Levy  Act 1988 acknowledging the AEIA as the representative body for these purposes. The egg industry has not increased its contribution to research and development for a number of years and the proposed increase will have the effect of maintaining the real value of its research and development activities. It would be appropriate that any amendment to the act facilitate future changes in industry representative organisation status in a manner similar to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 (PIERD Act) eliminating the need for legislative amendment for any future changes in industry representative organisation.

       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this bill is to give effect to the Government's pre-election commitments to repeal the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 and the Ships (Capital Grants Act) 1987. These measures will save Australian taxpayers about $52 million over the next four years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Coalition strongly opposed the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill when it was debated in Parliament last October. I remind the House of how this scheme developed from the deal made by the former Prime Minister and his senior ministerial colleagues, with the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia, to end the shipping strike called by the MUA over the sale of ANL Limited and ANL's shareholding in Australian Stevedores.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For its part of the bargain, the MUA undertook to give serious consideration to supporting the Government's proposed sale of ANL and negotiating an industrial agreement with shipowners to deliver significant cost savings. Well we all know the story on ANL—the MUA opposed the sale tooth and nail and forced the Government to back off from selling the Line to P&amp;O, the only prospective buyer. Needless to say, ANL made further
        <break page="987" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         losses which continued to be a drain on the Australian taxpayer.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As for the industrial agreement; the so called Maritime Industry Restructuring Agreement, or MIRA, was duly negotiated and was supposed to produce cost savings of some $200,000 per ship per year. However, the MUA has largely failed to deliver on its commitments, with the result that the promised savings have simply evaporated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the key elements of MIRA was for the industry to reduce the crewing factor from around 2.13 seafarers per berth to 2.0 by changes in work practices, improvements in safety and cutting out workers compensation rorts. However, the quarterly survey by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics shows that over the 12 months to December 1995, the crewing factor worsened rather than improved.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another key element of MIRA was for a peace accord to maintain an environment to minimise industrial disruption. Yet late last year, at the behest of its mates in the ACTU, the MUA took national strike action in support of a few mining industry workers at Weipa. In short, the MUA, despite the peace accord, was happy to damage its own industry and the nation as a whole in a political gesture to the power brokers of the ACTU, who would rather have the MUA flex its industrial muscle than use the proper processes in the Industrial Relations Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The evidence is there for all to see. The international shipping grants package has not delivered its complementary MIRA reforms; it has simply provided a windfall gain of $19 million to existing operators.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I now turn to the repeal of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. This scheme was introduced in 1987 with an intended five year life. In the words of the then Minister, the Hon Peter Morris, when introducing the bill, the legislation was to assist Australian ship operators to acquire modern, technologically advanced ships which could be operated at lower crewing levels. The scheme was subsequently extended another five years to June 1997. Hand in hand with this grant scheme went a generous accelerated depreciation tax concession.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to these generous subsidies and tax concessions, there has been the financial assistance to the industry through the previous Government's shared funding of early retirement and voluntary redundancy packages for MUA members. The total value of all these measures over the past nine years is estimated to have been in excess of $320 million.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the crew levels on Australian ships are now equivalent to international standards, the crewing factor of around 2.13, which is largely accounted for by the most generous leave system of any
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The industry is also saddled with a costly and inefficient pooled employment system for MUA members, which gives employers no right to select the most suitable, appropriately trained, ratings for their shipping operations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This pooled labour system, more fitting to the 1920s than the 1990s, also denies employers the opportunity of creating a strong company ethos among staff.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These factors, coupled with the high wages paid to Australian seafarers, means that Australian shipping is no nearer to being internationally competitive than it was nine years ago.

       This motion ensures that the Commonwealth government continues to have a role in the export of some of Australia's most important commodities and, of course, that important mechanisms for protecting the environment are retained within the national government's purview.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The opposition believes that the Commonwealth government's export control over alumina, bauxite, coal, ilmenite concentrates, leucoxene concentrates, monazite concentrates, rutile concentrates and flour, xenotime concentrates, zircon concentrates and flour,
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        and liquefied natural gas should not be abandoned lightly. The removal of export control over these commodities deserves the community's proper consideration and should only occur once the Commonwealth has considered more effective ways to ensure that the national interest can be guaranteed.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       While accepting that there is a need to develop better processes, the opposition rejects the removal of export controls over the minerals that I have mentioned on, fundamentally, three policy grounds. Firstly, there have been a number of incidents in the past where the Commonwealth powers over export licences have led to improved prices offered for our exports, particularly coal. At various times, previous resources ministers have secured better returns for Australia's minerals by refusing to approve licences until the industry obtained a better price.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Secondly, the opposition believes that there is a very important role for the Commonwealth government in resource planning. In our view, it is not in the national interest to have these matters and responsibilities entirely in the states' hands. There must be some level of input from the Commonwealth government. While we concede that export control powers are a clumsy mechanism—and I have often conceded this in this chamber and publicly—we believe that they are better than no mechanism at all. So until the government develops an alternative means of providing the Commonwealth with a role, the opposition will not be supporting the removal of these minerals from export control.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Thirdly, the removal of Commonwealth export controls over these minerals has enormous consequences for the management of Australia's environment. These, I believe, are consequences which the government either has not considered or, alternatively, is not interested in considering. If the latter is the case, then I think it is a very poor reflection on the government indeed.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       This coalition government is very keen to extol the virtues of its so-called Telstra environment package. We heard a lot about it in the first few sitting days of this  parliament. We have heard the government continually condemn non-government senators in
       <break page="990" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        this chamber for not supporting the partial sale of Telstra. In fact, they even had the hide to question our environmental credentials. I believe this is a motion which clearly identifies those in the chamber who have a real commitment to the protection of the environment in this country.

       The debate on the motion will also demonstrate which senators consider the environment to be a mainstream issue—in other words, not the sort of issue that becomes some sort of convenient policy tool to blackmail senators into supporting the partial privatisation of Telstra. The link between the partial privatisation of Telstra and the environment policy is holding environment funding in this country hostage to the privatisation of Telstra and has been exposed from day one by the opposition, the then Labor government, and is something that we will continue to reject.

      <para first-indent="16">
       The government's amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations (Amendment) are a clear indication that the government is only willing to pay lip&amp;hyphen;service to environmental issues and environmental protection. After all, it appears that the government does not actually realise that it was the Commonwealth's control over the export of mineral sand products which enabled another conservative government, the Fraser government, to ban sandmining developments on Fraser Island in Queensland. It is precisely those export controls that this coalition government wants to abolish.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Under the government's policy, the Commonwealth would have no power to step in and act as it did in the case of Fraser Island unless some other piece of Commonwealth legislation—such as the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act or the Australian Heritage Commission Act—happened to apply. That is limited in itself. For example, the Australian Heritage Commission Act can be effective only if the Commonwealth minister, a Commonwealth department or agency is involved, and only if the relevant proposal satisfies the criterion `might affect to a significant extent part of the National Estate'.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think most of us would appreciate—certainly those who have some involvement in these issues—that it can be very difficult to prove that criterion prior to the commencement of a mining activity. The World Heritage Properties Conservation Act is also limited because there are currently only 11 properties that are inscribed on the World Heritage list and it is limited to protecting those areas. Of course, these are areas of very great and unique environmental significance in this country.

        I really do believe that here we have clear evidence of the government's lack of commitment to the environment. That is being exposed. On the one hand, we have heard, ad nauseam, the benefits of the government's Telstra environment package but, on the other hand, when it actually gets a chance to do something about the Commonwealth government having a role in protecting the environment, the real colours of the government are shown.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They stand absolutely exposed on this issue. The attempt to try to sneak these regulations through the parliament should demonstrate to any interested observer the real commitment of this coalition government to protecting the environment in this country. As far as the opposition is concerned, we are wise to these sorts of tricks, this early sleight of hand from the government. Community organisations and the community are pretty wise to them also. We are not going to accept a situation where an important Commonwealth power is discarded by a government which really is on about very little else other than considering the environment as a trinket to be traded for supposedly the more important prizes, in this case the partial privatisation of Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On this issue, the government stands exposed. If it really has a commitment to the protection of the environment, if it really has a commitment to the Commonwealth government using its powers to protect the environment in this country, it would not have acted in the way it has. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate so the Senate can take the responsibility in this manner that the government clearly refuses to do.

       I would like now to turn to the hypocrisy and duplicity of the opposition on this matter. The opposition proposes to disallow the regulations on the grounds they would weaken the federal government's environmental powers—that was the main thrust of Senator Faulkner's push. A recent article in the

       The export controls power was the only power available to the Commonwealth government to stop sandmining on Fraser island.

       Why would the Commonwealth be taking away powers it's traditionally used successfully to protect significant parts of our environment?
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to expose the full extent of Labor's hypocrisy, and it might also assist Dr Lawrence, who is renowned for her amnesia. Let me briefly outline the history of export controls. Export controls were originally applied to all minerals by the Whitlam government in 1973. In fact, for the interests of senators in this place, I was heavily involved in that particular process. They were imposed at that time because of concerns about the capacity of business to negotiate fair price outcomes on international markets. It was at a time when there was fairly massive expansion in the development of our commodity products, particularly the coal industry.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In the 1960s we saw the very rapid growth of the iron ore industry, and then the oil crisis occurred. Coking coal was the area that attracted most attention at the time. I saw the coking coal price rise from about $12.50 to $18 to $27 to $50 over a period of two or three years simply because of the oil crisis. It was a matter of demand and supply. It always is a matter of demand and supply in the market. If you do not believe me, look at
       <break page="992" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The important thing—we should remind Dr Lawrence and Senator Faulkner of this—is that export controls were introduced before the passage of all Commonwealth environmental legislation. The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Endangered Species Protection Act and the world heritage legislation were all passed after the original introduction of export controls. Since then, most of the export controls have been removed—some by the Fraser government, but more recently by the previous Labor government—on such things as salt, copper scrap and iron ore. The previous government lifted those controls.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I ask: what is the difference between coal and iron ore? You would have to argue that there are much wider markets for coal, because it is such a diverse commodity, than there are for iron ore. To argue that it is a matter of pricing mechanisms is ludicrous and wrong. The net result is that export controls are now relevant to only five commodity groups: uranium, coal, bauxite alumina, LNG and mineral sands.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As I indicated, the government made it clear that controls will remain on uranium for safeguard, environment and heritage purposes. The thrust of the opposition's motion is therefore directed at only four commodities. What about all the other mineral commodities that I have mentioned? Why does the motion apply to a select few? What about iron ore? What about gold? What about lead zinc?

        Let me go back to the original purpose of export controls. Senator Faulkner referred to it. It is price. In my view, this was never a valid concern, and certainly not in today's highly competitive international market. I mentioned at the outset that I can speak with some authority, because I was involved in the coal industry for so long. Since 1973, the government has exercised export controls on coal at varying levels of intensity, ranging from engaging in negotiations directly with buyers to the system inherited by the Howard government; that is, light controls. They paid only lip service to this part of it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For Senator Faulkner to say that government intervention in export control mechanisms lifts prices is crazy. I can give you a personal example. Even in the days when they claimed that this system was effective, you would still negotiate prices overseas. There was the old story—we have heard it all before—of joint buying by the Japanese. It was pretty well accepted by the industry. It beat the hell out of talking to 15 buyers because, instead, you were talking two, who went under the name of coordinators. There were different coordinators for different countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It always came back to the market. Even though some companies criticised the outcomes of some of those negotiations, the first place they wanted to make their contracts with was Japan. Do you know why? Because the best price out of all countries came from Japan. It still does.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I can recall arguing with a former head of trade and resources in Canberra for two days not about the price that we had achieved but about what was the form of words that would be acceptable. That is why I say the thing has always been a charade. It was ludicrous.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the period, prices have risen and fallen in accordance with normal commodity market cycles. These export controls have been in existence since 1973. In the period of the two
        <break page="993" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         oil crises, the price of coal went up. The reason was obvious: it was market driven; it was concerned about supply, and so on. Those export controls have still been exercised throughout the eighties when the prices have kept coming down. You cannot artificially effect the price by government intervention. Despite government efforts, you cannot—and will not—defy the market.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, I would challenge anyone to prove that the exercise of controls has really changed the outcomes of any major price in any commodity. It has never happened. The market has always been the determining factor. In an international market, you are competing with people. I don't care which raw material you are talking about. If you are talking about iron ore, you are competing with India. If you are talking about coal, you are competing with Canada, the United States, Poland and a whole range of other countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is clear evidence that export controls have had a detrimental effect. They introduced into the minds of buyers uncertainty about reliability of supply. There are a lot of countries which do not have at their disposal the source of raw materials. It forced countries like Japan to make protective investments in Canada—the two examples are Bullmoose and Quintette—following intervention by the government on export control in the seventies.

        There was also Korean investment in the United States. None of those investments was good to those people. But that was the cost they were prepared to pay for diversification, because of the uncertainty that a government may come into this country at one time and cut off their supplies.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In my view, having seen the industry's history, export controls over the years have cost this country billions of dollars—not millions—in lost investment. I saw it happen with Korea, where at one time they would buy material for their steel making purposes at a percentage as high as 70 or 80 per cent. That figure is now down to around 40 or 50 per cent. I might be wrong. That was because of that uncertainty. There were other factors—I will be the first to admit—such as uncertainty about industrial relations strikes and all that sort of thing. But this was a very major one.

         I plead with honourable senators to think of the best interests of Australia. We are now seeing similar investments by our own buyers in Los Angeles to allow access to coal for power generation from western US coal fields. The existence of export controls has had an adverse effect on market perceptions about the extent of government influence on the market. As I mentioned earlier, this relates to the reliability and certainty of supply. Australia is the only major coal exporter that imposes export controls. Can't we grow up? Aren't we a mature country?

         It is totally absurd to suggest that the removal of export controls on LNG will lessen the ability of the Commonwealth to take adequate account of environmental considerations. The regulatory provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act apply to all offshore operations in Commonwealth waters, including the north-west shelf project and any new offshore developments, including pipelines to shore. This provides the Commonwealth with the necessary authority to consider environmental significance under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 requires this environmental consideration to include all associated onshore operations to produce liquefied natural gas for export.

         Therefore, removing the price controls on LNG has no impact on the Commonwealth's ability to protect the environment. Indeed, the only effect of maintaining export controls on LNG is to encumber our industry. Isn't it about time people on the other side started to think about Australia and put Australia first? This sort of decision is simply to the benefit of our international competitors. Maybe that is what senators opposite want.

         The removal of export controls does not mean that the government will cease to have an interest in prices received for commodities. Voluntary arrangements have already been negotiated with the coal, bauxite, alumina and LNG industries to keep the government fully informed on market developments and prices. In the case of bauxite and alumina, a voluntary agreement between the industry, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the tax office is being negotiated to address transfer pricing concerns which were the prime purpose of controls on those particular commodities. In any event, the powers of the Taxation Office are sufficient—some would say more than sufficient—to address the government's concern about fair and reasonable prices.

          The bauxite industry was a little concerned about the removal of controls because they felt they could allow the taxation department to go too far in the determination of prices on the transfer pricing issue. Therefore, it was at their request and our agreement that the department would continue to stay in there as the honest broker so that there was agreement on what was fair pricing in regard to alumina and bauxite.

          The Commonwealth will therefore have adequate information with which to scrutinise the prices obtained through the sale of LNG in overseas markets.

          Let me return to the thrust of the opposition's case. It argues that it is necessary to retain these controls as a means of providing a legislative trigger to force miners to carry out environmental impact assessments. That is one of the thrusts. I have demonstrated that this is a flimsy argument because export controls are only relevant to four commodities. As I indicated earlier, what is the difference between coal and iron ore? What logic is in that?

          I debunk the myth that this government is not concerned about the environment. The environment package which we have developed—Senator Faulkner referred to it—conditional on the sale of Telstra, represents the most comprehensive environment package ever developed by an Australian government in history. Let me remind senators that the Commonwealth environmental powers are not the only ones. Under our federal system the prime responsibility for land management, including environmental matters, rests with the states and territories. The states have extensive and effective environmental legislation to protect the environment, including mineral development.

          This is something that people should listen to very carefully. The effectiveness of state environmental processes was recognised by the Labor government when it initiated the
          <break page="995" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           intergovernmental agreement on the environment with the states. This agreement provides for full faith and credit to be given to state environmental processes and aims to streamline the process and remove duplication, an action by the former government which I totally support. One of its few good decisions was to enter into that intergovernmental agreement on the environment.

          What the Howard government wants to do is honour the commitments which the previous government made under the IGAE to accredit state processes. That has already been acknowledged. In many cases, Commonwealth environment processes for mining rely on state processes. Senator Faulkner, when he was environment minister, acknowledged the state processes in relation to the assessment of Queensland coalmines. You were the one, Senator Faulkner, who recognised the state processes for environmental matters affecting coalmines.

          At the time, the Environmental Protection Agency had conducted an environmental assessment of Queensland coalmines in consultation with Queensland authorities and the relevant coal companies.

          The opposition spokesperson on the environment, Dr Lawrence, has argued that export controls provided the trigger for the Commonwealth to intervene on Fraser Island. I think I have discussed this. Given the purpose for which export controls were originally produced, this was an abuse of power. I saw in the seventies how export controls were used to stop mines because a bureaucratic attitude was taken that the minerals should be kept in the ground. In other words, there was a view taken that they knew more about demand and supply than the people involved in the market. Mines were stopped. I should make the point also that had there not been a proposal to export, there would have been no Commonwealth trigger and sandmining could have occurred. This is the case for all export
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           control powers and it highlights the inconsistency across all mineral commodities.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For these reasons I have outlined, it is simply not in the national interest to maintain export controls on a handful of minerals. We should accept that the state environmental controls over our mineral industries are more comprehensive and equitably applied than the selective approach on export controls on just four commodities. Used properly, the intergovernmental agreement set up by the previous Labor government should provide much better protection for the environment through greater consistency in environmental processes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government believes that environmental protection is better achieved through cooperation, consultation and agreement with the states rather than the partial lever provided by export controls. The removal of export controls was a clear commitment by the coalition during the election campaign. It was endorsed by the Australian people and, in my belief, the amending regulation should proceed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Just in conclusion, the whole basis for removal of export controls is simply to assist our commodities in an internationally competitive export market. It is to make sure that we maximise the sale of our commodities to markets, and particularly in the growing areas of South&amp;hyphen;East Asia. Export controls send the wrong signals. I have indicated that it is beyond doubt that the existing export controls have been to the detriment of this country. When I say to the detriment of this country, I mean in regard to things like investment, wealth creation and employment. If senators are interested and wish to promote this country and not give some sort of benefit to our competitors overseas, they should not support this disallowance motion by Senator Faulkner.

The Tasmanian government refused all requests of the previous Labor government and simply bulldozed the road through to give access to loggers.

        The minister, Senator Parer, accused Senator Faulkner of abusing the legislative process for narrow electoral interests. I find the kinds of epithets that are thrown out at the beginning of speeches extremely interesting because they often reveal where the party making those epithets is actually coming from. In this case in his speech the Minister for Resources and Energy revealed his motivation. I believe that is an even narrower electoral interest than he was attributing to Senator Faulkner. Basically he said that industry would be very disappointed. Dear me! The federal government cannot possibly disappoint industry! They have made a commitment to industry to give it open slather and said, `We won't interfere. You can have your way. Just elect us. We will then devolve our power to the states. You can negotiate with them.'

        It has also given the states great confidence because it allows the states to make whatever kind of environmental impact assessment they wish of the proposals. This is not recognising that the states may have a vested interest which severely compromises their capacity to look at that. You cannot actually win both ways. The double standard was shown in Senator Parer's speech. He was saying, `We don't need these export controls. The former government let some of them go. We are just letting the rest go except uranium. We do not need them on alumina, bauxite, coal, ilmenite, monazite, leucoxene, rutile, xenotime, zircon or liquefied natural gas. We do not need those.'

        The previous government considered export controls to prevent the Western Australian state government from mining three of its largest national parks. National parks are a national asset and it is up to the federal government to protect them. Yet this government is seeking to escape that obligation through this amendment. It is seeking to do it when the environment in Western Australia has the greatest need for export controls. Ironically two of the national parks that were protected by the previous federal government's involvement are again under threat. One of these is Rudall River and the other is D'Entrecasteaux National Park.

         As I said, the mineral sands industry is implicated in other areas that this federal government has a responsibility to consider. This present government made a great show of rejecting French nuclear testing before the last election, and waxed lyrical that the Australian uranium it intends to mine will be used for peaceful purposes. By regulating to escape its responsibility for mineral sands exports, this government is muzzling its own power to select end uses for Australian mona zite, zircon, ilmenite and rutile concentrates. Primary end products of these minerals in the international market are fuel cells, fuel cladding and control rods for nuclear reactors. It is essential that the Commonwealth maintain its jurisdiction over these materials. To remove this power would be parallel to deregulating controls on uranium exports.

He gave lots of economic reasons which he believes justify the present moves. He said that export controls have cost us billions. But, Senator Parer, what giving them up will cost us is beyond price. Instead of foreign debt, we are building up an enormous environmental debt that future generations can never repay, which money can never repair. The Greens (WA) are thinking of Australia's best interests, and we are not prepared to allow these things to go by without making it totally obvious to the community at large that this federal government has no environmental credibility if its primary concern is to placate industry, the resource extraction industry in particular, and the states and their willingness to sacrifice our precious environment and the national interest component of that.

        Removal of export controls does not necessarily mean that all mining projects will cease to be subject to Commonwealth assessment. A large proportion of mining projects also require foreign investment or other Commonwealth approvals, for example, leases over Commonwealth land, and will be subject to the Commonwealth's environment assessment legislation.

         —There are so many options open to the Commonwealth. It is unnecessary to have these export controls as well. So you go through a balancing process. Are they necessary to protect the environment? We are satisfied they are not for all the reasons that I have set out, which is not abdicating environment responsibility; it is ensuring that there is otherwise adequate protection. You then balance that against the benefits that can come to the community from freeing up these business opportunities and therefore creating growth, greater wealth within the community and all the benefits that can flow from that to the total community. On that basis, being satisfied that there will not be any loss in terms of environment protection, we oppose the motion that has been moved by the opposition.

        —I thank the minister for his words. They are extremely interesting in light of the fact that, in the last few days, Senator Chamarette and I have asked questions in relation to the government's commitments to agreements that have been made in very recent times. This government has quite clearly said that it does not keep to the agreements that it made only a few months ago. Isn't this interesting? This government is saying that, on the basis that the states will fulfil their provisions, it does not need to maintain a power. Yet in the last few days—for instance, in Western Australia—this very government has said that forests that are already considered to have a heritage value do not have to have a moratorium, because the government is free to break any agreements that have been made in the past.

       Senator Hill has been hoist with his own petard. He has said that the Commonwealth will be quite free to remove a head of power, to remove the basis of any possible intervention, on the basis that he is quite happy with current agreements. Quite frankly, most of us would think that the current agreements are totally inadequate. But on the basis of current agreements he is saying we then quite adequately stand back from the potential of the use of a power that exists at the moment because somehow or other we have some
       <break page="1003" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        agreement that nobody will ever go back on. This is total nonsense and this government has proved that it is total nonsense because, without even making an announcement, it has already broken agreements that were made between the Commonwealth and the states. It is saying that, on the basis of current agreements that may or may not be signed between states, they can give up a power that exists now on the assumption that whatever state governments exist now or in the future will always do the right thing. What a load of nonsense.

       I rise to support this motion for the disallowance of regulations 47 to 50 relating to the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations because those four new regulations effectively eliminate all items within schedule 7. These are minerals, effectively of three classes: sources of aluminium; products of mineral sands; and two energy minerals—coal and natural gas. The government is giving away a substantial Commonwealth power in regard to these industries. It is eliminating virtually all of the Commonwealth's role. Why? It is not as though having that power has massively restricted mining. We are the world's largest exporter of both bauxite and alumina and the largest exporter of coal. In no way can the fact that the Commonwealth has this power be seen as a restriction.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       So why have these powers? One of the primary reasons is so that the Commonwealth has some power in regard to the companies—mostly global transnationals—that are involved in these industries. Having these powers ensures that companies do not engage in mining which the states might allow but which the Commonwealth sees as environmentally inappropriate. That power is not often used, but it is a check when it is in place. It is a check on the states, where they may be pursuing some economic objective which disregards the environment. For example, there may be implications for greenhouse. There is also the fact that we do not care how much coal we send off to other countries: we are assuming that we are on a different planet.

        The Commonwealth may have some residual powers in regard to World Heritage areas, or wetlands listed under the Ramsar conven tion. But if this particular provision goes and, for instance, Australia is at some time asked to fulfil its international obligations in regard to greenhouse, it becomes very difficult if the states do not think that they have any obligation to participate. Senator Chamarette has already adequately covered a number of areas involved with the protection of the environment.

       Having some power over the ability of mining companies to export gives the Commonwealth a bargaining chip with these companies. Such a power could allow the Commonwealth to ask that a company takes into account some of Australia's interests. An example of an area where this can be important is in ensuring that a mining company has at least has some of the downstream processing of a mineral here in Australia.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I have heard ministers and members and senators on all sides of politics stress that primary production is important but that Australia needs to be getting into downstream processing. This can be as simple as ensuring that we do not export woodchips and import paper or, more appropriately to this measure, that we do not export alumina and import aluminium. It does not make any difference to the corporations involved—Reynolds, Kaiser, Alcan, Pechiney or Alcoa. They do their work all over the world. They get no inherent advantage from ensuring that the part of the process where most of the value is added occurs is in Australia. They get no advantage from any of it being done here. Fundamentally, they are not in the business of looking after the national wellbeing; they are in the business of looking after their bottom line. Many, like Alcoa, are more than happy to comply with environmental or economic requirements, but are quite open in saying that it is not in their interests to initiate such measures. They say, quite rightly, that it is the job of government to set the framework and requirements.

       I would like to deal with the coyness governments have in using a power in relation to the environment. There is no coyness in using a power concerning almost any other element of corporate Australia, whether it be tax, auditing requirements, et cetera. We have
       <break page="1004" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        seen it all in this chamber. Why is there coyness about having some head of power only in relation to the environment? Why do we continually single out the environment as being something that we ought not to be involved with or as something that has a separate category, such as linking it to the sale of Telstra? I would say that is done because of the importance that this government is setting on the environment. The environment is an also&amp;hyphen;ran. It is not attached to anything else that we do and the government thinks that it will not have any other impacts on our economy, let alone on the ecosystem in which we live and breath.

       Coal is simply exported, but the aluminium ores are processed. We do process some aluminium here, but only a minimal amount. That has occurred only because we have bent over backwards and used all the powers we have—including extensive and expensive power subsidies—to get that production here. The states have been involved in that kind of luring as well.

       Many of the mineral sands have the highest values added at the downstream stages. Yet in most cases we export, at best, relatively low value semi&amp;hyphen;processed materials. We do some processing to zircon and zirconia in Western Australia, but this is the exception. Mostly, we export these rare earths—and export them cheaply—of which we are one of the major world sources, while we import all the expensive final products incorporated into other products. Because we do not actually have the final materials produced here, it is difficult to have industries based on use of those final materials made here.

       By contrast, some of the applications of zirconia, which is a high quality ceramic used in applications from mining bearings to hip joints, are likely to be made here. I am not certain where it is at with production but I know that several prototype final products were produced here a few years back. This emphasises that it is not just a matter of producing a bit further downstream. Having final materials allows the establishment of manufacturing while having to import final materials—the materials that are used as industrial feedstock—means that it is difficult

       In giving away this schedule we are giving away an important tool in negotiation with large transnational primary producers. Likewise, it raises the issue of price differential for materials at different stages of processing, and that includes the issue of transfer pricing.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Transfer pricing involves situations where a corporation, a global transnational, can produce one stage of a product in one nation, then pass it on to its owner plants in another nation. This can occur where a company is in joint venture with an Australia company. For instance, Alcoa—which is in joint venture with Western Mining, as was required many years ago—can sell alumina to Alcoa somewhere else even though the foreign Alcoa may be in another joint venture or a solely owned subsidiary of the parent Alcoa, an acronym for Aluminium Company of America.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Hypothetically—I am not making an accusation here—Alcoa Australia could sell alumina to Alcoa in the United States or the Philippines, and sell it at a very low cost. It does not matter whether it makes a profit in Australia as long as it makes an overall profit. If the tax regime in the Philippines is different from that in Australia, it may be more profitable to create its profits in the Philippines. It may make even more sense to ship the cheap alumina to Singapore, sell it to itself at a low profit, raise the price creating a profit under the tax regime of Singapore, then sell the high priced alumina to itself in the Philippines to minimise the profit here.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As I said, that example is hypothetical. Alcoa is perhaps less likely to do such things than Reynolds or other companies which are generally characterised as being far more in pursuit of their own interests. But the principle is the same. That is the sort of consideration that led to the formation of the International Bauxite Association, an association of bauxite producing countries which came together in an attempt to get a fair price for their bauxite and alumina, which has nearly always been exported.

       The price the corporations place on the bauxite and alumina, which they essentially
       <break page="1005" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Where there are questions about whether we get the true benefit of the value of the resources we export, alumina is still an issue. We have consistently undercut efforts by our IBA partners to obtain a reasonable return on the actual value of bauxite and alumina. There are also questions about the price of some of our coal, especially where the coalmines are operated by Japanese companies which sell to companies in Japan connected with themselves. Certainly, the entire mineral sands area seems to have a disproportionate part of the value adding occurring in the final steps in processing. There are still export barriers against some high value downstream products.

       There is also the issue of trade management. To some extent, this is the realm into which international trade is moving, with nations limiting imports and exports and attempting to manage trade with trading partners. This is particularly relevant to Asia. Australia, as it does in many areas of trade, seems to take the attitude that if it wipes out all its powers, all its bargaining chips, all its leverage, it will create some sort of moral force that will make other nations open their borders. There is no evidence that this strategy has any beneficial effect. So I ask again: why do we give away some of the few powers we have?
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Another area of concern is the protection of resources. This is most pertinent in regard to natural gas. Australia has a limited supply of oil. The Bass Strait oil field has peaked and is now in decline. The Barrow Island supply has peaked. We have some supplies of natural gas but that too is limited. If we do not convert to a renewable energy source—something to which almost no energy or funding is being given at present—we will be stuck importing oil.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Globally, oil supply is on a downturn even though oil is at historically low prices. But oil fields in many eastern nations have peaked and are in decline. Several years down the

      <para first-indent="16">
       The fact that we have not used these powers to deal with this issue is probably why they will become a huge problem in the future. It makes sense to have the power to protect our gas supply because it is the only viable alternative to oil, being another high energy, easily transportable fuel. Ripping off all the controls on exports may be great for Japan, which, already being the primary importer of our gas, would be happy to continue to import it, but it would do nothing for our national interests.

       Senator Chamarette mentioned that the states in their push for revenue are willing to overlook environmental consequences. They like mining because it provides revenue from sources such as royalties which do not have to be returned to them in the form of states grants from the Commonwealth. They can get direct benefits so they are willing to overlook environmental restrictions, overlook their own laws, lower standards and allow mining in parks like D'Entrecasteaux. They want that royalty money and are willing to push down standards and protection to get it.

      <para first-indent="16">
       All the areas I have mentioned—downstream processing, the overall economy, transfer pricing, balance of trade, maintaining strategic resources—are issues which are not really the province of states at all. States do not have the power to effect these things and are not used to thinking in those terms. It is clearly an area for the Commonwealth to manage. With this measure, the government is simply suggesting giving away most of the Commonwealth's power to do so.

        There are a few other means of Commonwealth control. The Foreign Investment Review Board has some power over foreign investment but not over companies that are seen in some way as Australian, even when they are clearly global transnational corpora tions operating without a national interest or a national perspective. I will include BHP here along with the likes of Alcoa Australia. I will also point out that the Foreign Investment Review Board is under attack by the United States through the trade related investment measures, TRIMs, within the World Trade Organisation.

       What this is really about, at the bottom line, is a pursuit of a corporate trade agenda. Corporations would like to see all nations stripped of any power to regulate industry or corporate investment. They would like to play fast and loose, globally, and play nations off against each other to ensure that they can move in, do what they like, and export both product and profit to wherever they can make the most money out of it.

       That is fair enough. Corporations are out to make money, but nations are constituted to look after the interests of their citizens.

         This is an important motion because it deals with a number of aspects of the government's commitments in relation to industrial relations. Quite clearly we have spelt out our agenda in this area carefully over many months. Indeed, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Reith, has spent in excess of 30 hours in consultation with the various parties. That process has enabled quite a number of points of difference to be identified. I think it has led to a fairly close examination by many people of precisely what is involved.

         As a matter of principle, it is our position that there is every good reason for bills to be referred to Senate committees in order that they can be given proper scrutiny and consideration by the parliament and the community at large if they are invited to make submissions. There is, therefore, no reason why that should not occur in this instance. If it was suggested that 17 June was somehow too short a time to report back, even though it is over three weeks away, we would have no objection to the time being extended to 24 June, which would give you well in excess of a month to report back.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the normal course that is followed. The standing orders make it abundantly clear that there is provision for bills to be referred to the relevant Senate committee. Without exception, and ever since we have had this dichotomy between legislation and references committees, the relevant Senate committee has been the legislation committee. That is precisely what standing order 25 says. Therefore, it is quite apparent that this bill ought to be referred to the legislation committee.

         There has already been one instance of parliamentary vandalism in this very week. It would be an absolute tragedy not just for the government's legislative program but also for the Senate if the processes of this parliament were again to be misused by the bill being referred clearly to the wrong committee. I say this in anticipation of the views of those on the other side of the chamber, the opposition
         <break page="1008" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          parties as they now seem comfortable to be called. If there is any attempt to amend this motion to refer this matter to the references committee, as we have already seen on one occasion this week, it will be a clear act of parliamentary vandalism. It will make it abundantly plain that these opposition parties are not interested in the proper processes of government and are simply determined to vandalise the system as much as possible.

         I would like to refer to remarks made by Senator Ray on 24 August 1994, prior to the establishment of this two&amp;hyphen;track system. He said:

         The first of the proposals in standing order 25 lists the eight committees. It basically says that there will be a government chair and majority on the legislation side to deal with legislation, estimates and annual reports. On the reference committees there will be a non&amp;hyphen;government majority and a non&amp;hyphen;government chair, with the sharing of chairs between the opposition and the Democrats.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, making it perfectly clear that the only purpose of establishing this two&amp;hyphen;track system was to enable legislation and other matters such as estimates and annual reports to be dealt with by the legislation committee and for other matters, and one can envisage a range of other matters such as issues of concern that might arise in the community that might be debated in the chamber, to be referred to references committees. To the extent that an issue is of overwhelming public importance, matters can be referred to a select committee established for the purpose.

         Since the establishment of that new system in October 1994, until this week, a bill has never been referred to a references committee. In other words, this parliament has scrupulously followed the clear intention of the standing orders as laid down by the Senate. I can remember being lectured time and again by Senator Ray on this very subject. He always used to say that the government had the responsibility to govern, that the government was entitled to keep control of its own legislative program, and it was therefore important and necessary for the government to have the majority on the legislation committees and for those committees to do the tasks they were assigned to do.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In asserting that claim, he was also acknowledging that there were legitimate rights for the opposition to pursue in relation to other matters. Therefore, the government accepted that the opposition parties should have the majority on those references committees. I am sure those on the other side would say that it was a workable arrangement. Indeed, it was followed scrupulously from October 1994 until the change of government in March this year.

          Let there be no doubt that if you are once again going to seek to refer this bill to a references committee you are ripping up the rule book. You are making it abundantly clear that you do not accept the verdict of the people on 2 March. You lecture us incessantly about the Industrial Relations Commission being the umpire but you are not prepared to accept the verdict of the people, you are not even prepared to accept your own standing orders and you are not prepared to follow the rules of the game.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If that is the approach you want to take, you will be making it very clear in due course that you are not interested in following the proper processes and that you are not seriously interested in legislation being examined by legislation committees but that you are simply in the business of frustrating the proper purposes of government. For example, if you do what you did a few days ago and not only refer this bill to a references committee but also compound the felony by extending the report date until, say, 20 August, once again you will be making it clear that you are not seriously interested in a proper examination.

The extended point is that the way to approach a committee, if you are genuine, is to see what the level of community concern is as reflected in the submissions and then decide, if necessary, that you cannot accommodate them within the existing time frame. It is not an unusual approach to come back to the Senate and say that it was referred out for, say, a month, which is what we are proposing, which gives everyone ample opportunity one would have thought, but you can always be wrong. If it turns out you are overwhelmed, you then come back and say, `We'd like an extension.' Consistent with that principle, I would have thought your chances would be pretty good.

There is no doubt about it at all; it is crystal clear. We are now seeing a determination to rip up the rule book. That is what we are objecting to.

I really do think that we have heard one of the most monstrously hypocritical contributions we have ever heard from a coalition senator in this chamber.

        This is not parliamentary vandalism, as Senator Alston says. This is good parliamentary process. It is one of the range of options that is available to the Senate to take on legislation. It is true, as Senator Alston says, that the Senate has a capacity to refer the bill to a select committee. The Senate could do that. It is also true that the Senate could refer the bill to a legislation committee. It is also true that the Senate could refer the bill to a references committee. It is also true that the Senate could do nothing. There could be no committee inquiry and there could be no formal parliamentary committee scrutiny until the bill came back to the parliament in the budget sittings as a result of an order of continuing effect that was proposed by the coalition.

No non-government senator in this chamber has seen the bill—no&amp;hyphen;one.

No-one has seen it, yet we have this proposal from Senator Alston to conduct a debate in relation to its progress in this chamber. It is a bit hard to work out, really, where these characters are coming from. Before we even got here for the commencement of this session, we all got a memo from Senator Hill, the famous `Hill memo'.

There is a bit of a dispute going on between Senator Hill and Senator Alston. I think we know why, because we understand that Senator Hill is under a bit of pressure from Senator Alston, who has his eyes firmly on Senator Hill's back. There is not very much doubt that Senator Alston is after Senator Hill's job. But now Senator Alston comes in here and tells us that it is okay.

Working conditions affect the ways in which parents can care for their sick kids, the length of time that families have together on annual leave and on public holidays.

He put forward his points of view, knowing full well that governments change, the parties in power change.

It may well be that legislation committee members may be called to order by wishing to talk about legislation in other countries or by wishing to look at the provisions of legislation in the state of Western Australia. In particular they may wish to look at how they might compare the provisions set out in this bill. That is the important thing.

        I would like to put something else into perspective. Whether or not this is the correct method of dealing with this bill and whether or not the Senate is doing something which it should not be doing, what seems to be happening is that we are getting rather inane messages from the government saying that somehow or other dealing with this is not the right thing for the Senate to do and that it might even be considered, as you have mentioned on Telstra, a failure to pass.

        The High Court, in the case of Victoria v. the Commonwealth in 1975, held that the Senate had not failed to pass a bill simply because it adjourned consideration of the bill to the next period of sittings. The question whether the Senate failed to pass the bill does not become ripe for judicial determination until a bill has been passed under the whole

        If this is what you are planning for—and this has been said on a number of occasions by this government—that is the abuse of process. If you decided to take the Australian public along this road, you would find very quickly that if you then decided to say to the Governor&amp;hyphen;General, `The Senate has failed to pass because we have done our proper process,' the bill would be thrown out of court.

        The legislation committee, let us face it, usually has about four sets of witnesses. A Friday legislation committee has about four sets of witnesses on two days. That is the basis of it. For a Friday committee it is, in effect, the committee chair and the committee secretariat who choose those witnesses. That is not the way to go in such important proposed legislation. The Greens are committed to the community having the ability to participate in a process of such complexity and such importance. That is why we joined with the other non&amp;hyphen;government parties to get together reasonable terms of reference for when the bill does get to the Senate, when we will have the ability to come to a sensible process to deal with what the bill looks like, how it interacts and how it will affect the community. The reference committee is the most appropriate process for this bill.

          the Senate send the bill off to a committee for further examination of the consequences of its passage. I am pleased to say that yesterday we saw the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and also the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, agreeing with that proposition that a reasonable thing to do would be to send this matter off to a committee. I was pleased to see that because this bill—as far as we know, from what we read and the drafts that I have received, and we have not seen it in the Senate—includes such matters as an attempt to resolve the problems that we now have with unfair dismissal legislation as it is, to remove the opportunity for discrimination on the grounds of union membership or non&amp;hyphen;union membership.

        As a matter of fact, I am reminded that some of these matters are in the list of 23 matters of agreement, or at least matters where there is indication of agreement, that were listed by Senator Kernot at the very beginning of this session of parliament. We had thought that the new coalition government may seek to take advantage of them and get a few runs on the board because we, the Democrats, were quite prepared to accept some of those. One of those has been knocked off. That was the decrease in the provisional tax uplift factor. They were too stingy, of course, to note and acknowledge that the Democrats had supported that and were prepared to indicate that support from an early stage. Even before the election, even last year, a proposal exactly the same as that which was moved was put up by the Democrats but stingily rejected by the government.

         the implications that may arise from whether there is any conflict or relationship between those two areas.

So the responsibility of any committee which is to comprehensively examine this would be to examine what

        The other concern I have in the way the bill relates to other portfolios is that Dr Kemp assured me last night that in the area of his portfolio he would endorse and continue to see the relevance of and continue to promote the concept of competency based training, and the articulation of training in one form and in one institution into another. Yet we see in this set of proposals to industrial relations that that trend will essentially be abandoned. I cannot see how those priorities can possibly coexist. I wonder whether there has been sufficient coordination and cooperation between those two ministers. I would find it quite interesting to invite Dr Kemp to come to the references committee and perhaps give us the benefit of his perspective on what the implications of this bill would be on training.

         —I rise to speak in this debate on the Dairy Produce Levy Amendment Bill 1996 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1996. I want to speak in this debate because it goes to part of the general concern that the Greens (WA) have had about the Uruguay Round of GATT and the impacts that has had on industry. The so-called benefits of GATT are an elusive waiting game. The dairy industry is one of those industries which are still waiting. It is waiting for an increase in dairy prices which it was told to expect from the implementation of GATT, as was everybody. Even the National Farmers Federation said, `Everyone will benefit but those who do not should be compensated.' The logic of that escapes me.

        We were told to expect that the implementation of GATT would open up markets for Australian dairy products and reduce the amount of subsidised dairy products, especially from the United States and the European Union. With the advent of reduced subsidies, industry has to wait for domestic consumption

        The benefits of GATT to the dairy industry have been quantified at an increase of $210 million per year in annual exports. This requires a 10 per cent increase in exports of dairy products. How likely this is will depend almost solely on the actions of the United States and the European Union. Both show little indication of markedly dropping their high rates of subsidies, while Australia slashes its own. Surprise, surprise! Australian dairy farmers are still waiting for the so-called benefits to come via GATT. The short&amp;hyphen;term increase in prices for Australian dairy products has been more to do with market conditions, such as shortfalls in supply in Eastern Europe and lower volume in Australian product, with increasing demand from Asia.

        Also, farmers now have to contend with the Hilmer reforms. Dairy farmers have suffered much change in the wait for the elusive benefits of Hilmer and GATT. The number of dairy industries has halved in the last two decades. Farmers will fight Hilmer because it will leave them worse off. They want an exemption from the changes to the pricing and quota system. At present, the farm gate price for milk protects farmers' income to an extent because it is based on the costs of production. However, this is not allowed under competition policy. Hilmer reforms and GATT changes are cutting further into farmers' milk margins. The price rises are not getting back to the farmer in the form of returns. Meanwhile there is more and more pressure for farmers to increase exports, but this becomes a vicious cycle, because they are not getting the returns to reinvest in increased production. Many other industries were told to shut up while this Uruguay Round of GATT debate was taking place.

         —I have a keen recollection of its contents. It arises from advice tendered to the government in January of this year by the Office of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to the effect that the calculation of the tariff to be applied in the case of the oil industry may—I emphasise that—be open to challenge over its efficacy. No&amp;hyphen;one has yet challenged it but, in a prudent exercise of monitoring the law, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's office has drawn this matter to the attention of the government, and it is prudent action by the government to correct any defect and put beyond doubt the provision. That is what this bill does.

        The other element of the bill that is interesting from a legislative point of view—I am almost giving a second reading speech—is that the government is proposing to make the application of this amendment retrospective to l985. That is a great degree of retrospectivity. The observation I make about that is that retrospective legislation has been the subject of considerable debate in this chamber over the years. Often, the perspective of the participants in that debate has depended on where they sit in the chamber. In other words, where you stand depends on where you sit; whether you are in government or in opposition. I took the trouble to go through
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        to check what the now government, then opposition, members have said about tax law and retrospectivity and I uncovered a number of inconsistencies which, if trotted out on this occasion, would be a tad embarrassing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The position this opposition takes on retrospective matters in tax law—while this is a tariff bill it is embraced under the broad head of tax law—is that there should always be a willingness by government to legislate retrospectively to wipe out tax evasion and gains achieved by tax evasion. If a government stands strongly, saying it is prepared always to do that, tax cheating will have no future because as soon as the tax cheats are uncovered and their loopholes are identified, a government can legislate to close off the loopholes and retrospectively remove their gains.

       <break page="1023" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         If that were done there would be no haemorrhage to the tax base, no future in tax avoidance or evasion, and the ordinary battler, who carries the burden of taxation, would not be penalised simply because some smarties who have the wherewithal to get away with tax avoidance and evasion succeed in doing so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Tax law retrospectivity and the willingness to legislate retrospectively are matters that government should be very clear about. On this occasion, I hasten to add, no&amp;hyphen;one is suggesting an evasion or avoidance. This is simply a prudent measure taken by an administration. Had we remained in power we would have proposed it for enactment. I have no difficulty at all in supporting the government on this amendment bill.

One of the reasons we do not have any problem with that is that there are no adverse effects one way or another. There are no revenue implications. As Senator Cook quite correctly pointed out, this was just simply a measure on advice from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department to transfer a by&amp;hyphen;law definition into the act.

When he mentioned the figure that might be in doubt, one very quickly listened to the advice.

         —The way some people speak about it, it is theological, more like a religion in opposing it. Others might just be ideological but I believe that one has to be sensitive about retrospectivity. If the parliament is to govern properly, from time to time retrospectivity in legislation will be required and this is one of those cases. I note here that when I was minister, I put issues of retrospectivity before the parliament, and they were strongly opposed by those opposite. Even the coalition will have to accept that retrospectivity is going to be needed for the good governance of this country, and preserving $1.9 billion dollars of revenue without equivocation is one of those occasions.

        If this was ever challenged, and it was successful in the court, one can only imagine that those who got the $1.9 billion back—namely, the oil companies—would then pass that $1.9 billion on to their consumers in savings by dropping the price of petrol a few cents a litre for a year or so. I think one would have to believe that pigs would fly before that would occur. I think we should remember, in any balanced argument about retrospectivity, that the consumer would not get the benefits—if there was a windfall gain to anybody at a company level—because the company would keep it. I think we would find that they would not be very enthusiastic about passing it on. Though one may oppose retrospectivity, in this case, if it was knocked over, if it was lost, the benefit would not go to the consumer who has already paid it, it would go to the companies who are in the petroleum and the oil business. I note that this is another piece of government legislation that has come from my desk, as minister at the end of last year. I am glad I was able to help the government—

        As to the question of operational matters, having served some considerable time on the National Crime Authority committee, I can assure Senator Ray that I do understand the very difficult problems associated with law enforcement and the need in some areas to keep operational matters confidential. That is why, of course, the National Crime Authority act and the joint parliamentary committee set up to oversee the authority have clauses exempting operational matters. It is one of the reasons why the committee has, over the years it has been established, had, in my personal view, some difficulty in performing the role that those who set the committee up actually thought they would be able to achieve. For quite rational reasons, operational material is exempted from the committee's purview, and that does lead to very extensive debates as to what is operational material.

        It has been said that you could ask a question of a National Crime Authority member and the answer might come back, `I can't say.' You might subsequently then ask, `Why can't you say?  Is that an operational matter?' The answer might come back, `Well, I can't say.' In other words, the very exemption requires an enormous amount of trust that the law enforcement officers who are declining to give information are not simply identifying something as operational material which some of us looking at it on a completely non-political basis would conclude had ceased to be operational and should now be available under the purview of those people who want to oversee that particular law enforcement agency.

         In conclusion, I do not have a list of all the questions that have been asked. I am not in a position to concur or disagree with Senator Ray's assertion that operational material has been sought. He may well be right. It would take some time, I think, to go over a series of questions that I understand might have been asked, but most certainly Senator Ray identifies a very difficult area of parliamentary accountability. We do not ever want to get to the stage where we let law enforcement agencies do as they choose and have no accountability, but at the same time there needs to be obvious protection for some operational matters.

That grew, in nominal terms, by a further 115 per cent. So we had revenue out, but deficits out as well, and Commonwealth debt out to 115 per cent.

        This budget deficit would have been more justifiable if it was incurred to fund capital expenditure, but the Labor government of course incurred it to fund consumption. In fact, capital expenditure has fallen as the Commonwealth debt has skyrocketed. Capital expenditure as a proportion of total outlays declined in nearly every Labor budget. The money was spent on consumption, not on capital. In 1983-84 it was 12.8 per cent total outlays, capital in nature. In 1994-95 it was down to 2.3 per cent. In 1995-96 the figure actually went negative—minus 2.3 per cent. Labor gained more from asset sales than it spent on new capital expenditure.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Instead of incurring debt to fund capital, Labor put Australia into debt to fund consumption. Even the claimed surplus in the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 budget was only achieved by selling capital assets to once again fund a significant amount of government consumption expenditure. In other words, Labor's way was to sell the family silver to fund regular expenses. The silver—I remind you, Mr President—can only be sold but once; the recurrent expenses continue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The contrast is with the approach of this government. We wish to fund capital in terms of the natural environment. But we, in contrast to Labor, have a way of raising capital to do that, and that is in terms of selling one-

         third of Telstra. That would enable us not to get into the financial mess that Labor got into because we would be selling part of one capital asset and reinvesting it in part of another capital asset, and that is the Australian environment. Certainly we would hope the $7 billion expended in reducing public debt would part remedy one of the failures of Labor and that the $1 billion also reinvested in Australia's natural capital would help to make up for another area of deficiency of this last failed Labor government.

         —I thank Senator Knowles for her question. It is becoming very clear that the Labor Party, in opposition, is, as it was in government, all at sea when it comes to budgetary policy. I think it is even worse in opposition than it was in government, but it is not surprising given the pathetic record on fiscal policy when it was in government.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The answer to your question, Senator Knowles, is: yes, I am well aware of Senator Cook's comments on Tuesday night. Senator Cook said in this place that the $8 billion black hole is, to use his words, a `fallacious assertion'. The facts, of course, are this: the $8 billion black hole is not a creation of the government or its imagination; it is, in fact, the best available forecast from the Treasury based on the Labor Party's own policies when it was in government. It is a figure that was given to the incoming government two days after the election. It is, therefore, a figure that must have been known by the Labor government before the election at a time when it was parroting to the Australian people and deceiving the Australian people by saying that the budget was in balance and was moving progressively into surplus.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, the Labor Party was quite prepared to stand by the Treasury's independent forecast when it suited it. On 1 February, just before the election campaign started, the now Leader of the Opposition and then finance minister, Mr Beazley, said, `As far as we are concerned, the Treasury estimates we had in connection with the last budget'—and they were Treasury estimates—`stand for good and we stand by them.' Now Labor, by denying the existence of the Beazley $8 billion black hole, is trying to walk away completely from the forecasts that it used to say it stood by. We, unlike Labor, are consistent. We do stand by the official forecasts that are there on the record, but Senator Cook absolutely refuses to accept the black hole that has now been revealed.

       <break page="1027" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The absolute hypocrisy of the opposition on this matter quite astounds me. They deceived the Australian public by relying on forecasts that they knew were out of date which, with just a phone call before the election, could have been updated and released. They could have come clean and been honest with the Australian public. They refused to take their medicine then and they are refusing to take it now.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On Tuesday night, Senator Cook also said that the government was using the black hole as a trigger for `ideologically inspired' spending cuts, and Senator Sherry said a similar thing in the first MPI of the year. Nothing could be further from the truth. What the government is about is responsible economic management that leads to higher sustained growth and lower unemployment. We are not about getting unemployment stuck at 8&amp;half; per cent like Labor. We are not about record high current account deficits. We are not about putting the government's hands into the jar of national savings and running down national savings at a disgraceful rate. We are not about giving this generation great advantage at the expense of future generations. We are about fairness and equity in the finances of this nation.

Mr Keating did not believe it and Brereton only came up with it to assuage their concerns because for the first time in that previous government's history they were on the verge of being dealt a hand they did not like.

        It is a great pity that Mr Keating did not have the courage of his convictions, and it is a great shame that others who purport to be interested in industrial relations reform rather than in just tidying up the edges did not concentrate on the bigger picture. So the package that we will put forward will address all of

Between 1983 and 1996 Commonwealth grants to universities grew in real terms by 67 per cent. It is interesting to note that over the same period, however, road funding—another vital area of national infrastructure—was halved. To come closer to the knowledge generating infrastructure, CSIRO funding remained stagnant. Senator Ellison is certainly correct in his assertion as to the expansion of the higher education sector.

         —The facts are that Labor pressured universities to expand student loads, despite the obvious strain on key infrastructure such as lecture halls and libraries in many universities. The growth of the universities was a very handy form of political largesse to distribute, which Labor did—and some would say at the expense of the higher education system. As a consequence of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that, the higher education sector is left with the following problems: continual focus on expansion may well have come at the cost of other goals; and falling demand resulting from demographic change and, more recently, improved labour market conditions may well present problems for both government and the universities.

        Irrespective of what the level of resources to the higher education sector is—and understandably there has been significant debate about that in the pre&amp;hyphen;budget context over the last couple of weeks—the process of distributing those resources needs to be looked at. It does limit flexibility for universities to respond to both needs of employers and students.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The level of resourcing for universities is very much enmeshed in a political process in which political power may well carry more weight than issues of either equity or efficiency. As members opposite will well know, there are huge differences in the resources of some institutions resulting from previous funding arrangements and private endowments that are available to some of the older universities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some older universities are much better placed to cope with change than new universities. The level and distribution of research funds are a very contentious issue in higher education, one that has not been adequately resolved after 13 years of Labor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of particular interest amongst these other matters is the fact that, despite Labor's espousal of equity issues, people from lower socio&amp;hyphen;economic levels and non&amp;hyphen;metropolitan regions still have less access to higher education. This is particularly evident with regard to access to postgraduate education. Under the Labor government, universities have become much more commercial but of course need to fall back on this government when they make mistakes.

        I well remember when Mr Beazley, the then Minister for Defence, was required to take on a junior minister, namely Ros Kelly, as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel because he was so concerned about battleships and bombs that that he had no interest in the people he was investing in who were supposed to operate the equipment and defend Australia. Consequently, the opposition at that time, of which I was a part of course, finally pushed for an inquiry into defence personnel issues. A joint parliamentary committee made masses of recommendations, and what happened?

So do not talk to me about administrative arrangements. Your government had 13 years to get that right and failed absolutely.

        In response to threats to the ongoing viability of white box ecosystems in New South Wales, representatives of the New South Wales Farmers Federation, Charles Sturt University at Bathurst and the World Wide Fund for Nature have joined together to address this issue. The project will firstly identify remaining stands of white box woodlands on the western slopes of New South Wales, and then work with individual landholders and managers to develop practical mechanisms for their protection. The great strength of this project is that it brings together a diversity of interests, all of whom are committed to the ecologically sustainable development of the rural landscape, and it is likely that it will form a model for similar conservation activities on agricultural land.

The answer lies in the Natural Heritage Trust that we are seeking to set up, to be funded by a $1 billion contribution from the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra. Out of that, we have in mind to appropriate a sum of $318 million over five years on a major national vegetation initiative, which will help preserve vegetation which otherwise might be cleared and will also help in revegetation.

        I wish to raise with the chamber a very important question. If, for example, the government is going to deny to migrants for any period of time, whether it be six months or two years, access to the parenting allowance, is the government then going to provide a tax rebate? The parenting allowance is, in effect, a cash rebate and these people are going to in fact be paying tax. You cannot have it both ways. They are in double jeopardy in that particular regard.

        I do not know that I have seen anything in the literature on this that has adverted to that particular fact. I appeal to the government in respect of this matter.

You cannot deny migrants the parenting allowance and then continue to tax them.
       </para>

        Let us go back some years when the parenting allowance was in fact a spouse rebate. It would be then saying to these people, `When you put in your taxation form you will get another bill because you will not be entitled to the spouse rebate.' It is ludicrous if you look at it that way. To put it another way, if you were actually looking at the question of allowing migrants to forgo eligibility for these sorts of payments, you would need to restore the tax allowances for children and for the parenting allowance because they are actually income transfers, recognising the transfer of moneys within that family to the whole of the family dependents.

        To date we have not seen what is, by the government's own description, the most radical industrial relations legislation this century. But we are expected to pass that legislation in the House of Representatives by the end of next week and in the Senate by the end of June. The new government has said, `You've got to get it passed in four or five weeks or you are naughty boys and girls and you don't get to go home.' That is a quite extraordinary approach! In my six years in this place I cannot recall that on any major piece of legislation—

Unfortunately, Senator Short did not know anything about that, and he is the minister responsible for superannuation.

        As I said earlier, I do not recall at any time in the period of our government such a major piece of legislation being pushed through the Senate and the House of Representatives in three weeks. What did the Liberal government do with the Telstra legislation in the House of Representatives last week? There was some debate on the second reading but when the official Labor opposition wanted to put a range of amendments to what is the second largest privatisation in our history, the government moved the gag. It said, `You can't put your amendments.'

        I have news for the government in this chamber: we will certainly be debating this legislation, examining it thoroughly and putting some amendments in the committee stage—not in an attempt to frustrate the government but because over the next 10 to 12 weeks this Senate can quite reasonably examine the most radical industrial relations proposal of the last 100 years. It is not reasonable of the government to force those proposals through in three or four weeks.

        I support what we are proposing to do. I think it is appropriate that it go to a Senate committee; I think 22 August is appropriate. The economics committee is the appropriate committee. There is a range of issues dealt with in the legislation, but they are primarily economically focused, by the government's own admittance. We are doing the right thing. We are not trying to frustrate the government. We want to deal with this legislation, but we want to have adequate debate and an input into this legislation and we want to allow the community—not the industrial relations sector that has been drip fed by Minister Reith—to also have an input into this legislation.

The legislation came into the House of Representatives and a fortnight into the hearings we were presented with over 200 amendments from the minister's office. The committee dealt with those. It had to call witnesses back and the legislation then came back into this place.

I do not have the hearings in front of me right now, but I can remember people who appeared from the union movement saying, `Hey, boys, we want a few more amendments.'

In putting this before us today, you have actually tried to perpetuate a lie about what occurred. This is almost identical, if you want to be precise, to what occurred back in 1993. You have only to look at the public record. That proves me absolutely and totally right. The difference between this legislation and the Brereton legislation is that we will not be running down here from the House of Representatives with over 200 amendments and saying, `Hey, boys, fix it up. We have our riding instructions. Fix it up for us.' That is what occurred at that particular time.

         —by leave—I wish to speak to Senator Alston's amended motion. I apologise to the chamber that I want to speak on the motion now, but I promise to speak only very briefly. I think a number of honourable senators do realise that this particular matter came on quite suddenly and that it folded equally as suddenly. Of course, I was caught short, and I apologise for that.

        But I do intend to say this. I supported the amendment, as you saw, and the amendment is now the motion. One of the matters that is to be referred to the committee is the question of the constitutional validity of the bill as a whole or any part of the bill. There are other aspects of the reference which perhaps go to the propriety of the legislation in the context of the government policy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I just want to say this: the government should realise that, if it suggests that it has a mandate for what it is doing in the bill that I have seen, it really should consider that question against the greater mandate that is in the constitution in respect of industrial relations; that is, the conciliation and arbitration power. That power is well founded, and it requires this parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of this country with respect to consideration and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one state.

        When the committee has a look at this legislation, and I am sure the committee will do that thoroughly, it will see precisely—I hope it does anyhow—how this bill fits in with that sort of obligation—`obligation' is probably too strong a word—that is upon us, which is put there by the constitution. The principal pillar of the legislation, as I see it, relies on the corporations power. I will be

       In speaking on this motion, I have only to draw the Senate's attention to the daily barrage of comments from vice-chancellors, from members of the university communities, from students and parents and from other sectors of the education portfolio which all reflect upon the same problem. That is, why does the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) have no view of where she is going and no view of where this portfolio is going other than to say that there have to be indiscriminate budget cuts which, as I contend, would have a major detrimental effect upon this country as a whole in terms of its economic, social and, of course, international reputation; a reputation which at the moment stands very good in terms of the quality of education provided in this country.

       One could not find a better example of the minister's attitude than what she exhibited here today. In answer to a question put to her regarding education funding, the minister herself indicated that as far as she was concerned education has had it too good for too

        long. That was the view she expressed here today. That is the view she expressed at the National Conference of the Australian Association of Education of the Gifted and Talented at the University of Adelaide on 6 April. It is a view she has expressed in a number of forums now. It is a view which is essentially predicated upon the assumption that education can be cut back, that services can be reduced, that the quality of education can be reduced and that Australians will not particularly care about it.

       The little speech she gave on 6 April at the University of Adelaide is very interesting. She indicated that even though she had been a minister for only six weeks she knew nothing about the gifted education area. This is the view that is being faxed all over the country by way of e&amp;hyphen;mail.

       Since becoming a minister, the most important decision that has been made by her was that the letterhead should be black to save confusion when changing trays of the photocopier. Here we have a multi&amp;hyphen;billion dollar portfolio, and this is the way in which it is treated. She says, `I'm not a very bright person.' What an extraordinary proposition, where she indicates that the fact that she might have two degrees is not of much account. That has essentially been interpreted as a very anti&amp;hyphen;intellectual approach that she has taken and which reflects the general level of outrage that has been expressed in terms of responding to that sort of proposition right across the sector.

       We have seen not one but just about every vice&amp;hyphen;chancellor in the country indicating intense hostility and outrage at the propositions that have been put to them and  have been canvassed quite freely by the minister in such a way as to indicate that she really does not care about the consequences of her speculation in terms of the effect of these budget cuts.

        It is no good saying, `Well, it is only a matter of speculation.' It is no good suggesting that it is only a question of scare&amp;hyphen;mongering, because as I read it, the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet has already made the decision that there should be a reduction by up to $1.8 billion. That is a massive 22 per cent of the targeted $8 billion which this government is seeking to extract from the public accounts of this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In their drive to implement their Fightback agenda, what they are saying is that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs ought to provide some 22 per cent of the $8 billion in funding cuts. That is despite the fact that education constitutes only about 11 per cent of outlays; so a disproportionate share of the funding cutbacks that this government is proposing are coming out of education. This reflects the minister's view which I suggest is the government's view—deep down—that education has had it too good for too long.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister indicated this afternoon that the Labor government had expanded funding to education quite dramatically. Well, she couldn't have been more right! She was wrong to this extent: she said it was 67 per cent; in fact, it was 69 per cent. What we saw was that in the period from 1983 to 1997 in terms of the triennium process, there was an increase from $3.1 billion to $5.3 billion in expenditure on education, and higher education in particular.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There would have been some four per cent increase in 1997 in terms of the funding per student from $12,110 in 1983 to $12,530 in 1997. That increase does not seem to me to be an exceptionally large amount of money per student. But what you see is the massive expansion in education funding in this country which saw a revolution in higher education. We saw it move from an elite system whereby only a very, very few could participate, to a mass education system—where you see the whole country transformed in terms of its impact, in terms of the capacity of ordinary Australians to go to university or to participate in higher education as a result of the Labor government's programs.

         What is under attack here? It is that philosophy: that ordinary folk ought to be able to go to university, ought to be able to enjoy the benefits of higher education. With that flows the benefits of a higher income and a higher standard of living. That is not what this government is about. It is about reducing opportunities. It is about making sure that the education system in this country no longer serves the clever country, but it serves a small elite. It serves a small group of people who enjoy the benefits of exclusive private schools, then exclusive universities. That is their notion of what an education system is all about.

         You would not necessarily get that directly from the minister because, quite frankly, I do not think she has even worked that out herself yet. Because when asked the question, `What is your vision?' in this chamber, and outside, she has no idea. She has absolutely no idea. She is more concerned with whether or not the letterhead should be black to save confusion about changing trays of the photocopier. That, for her, is the major educational issue that this country faces. She is more concerned with the proposition, as she says, `Education has had it too good for too long.' Frankly, that is a despicable attitude for an education minister to maintain.

         The minister is, and ought to be, as far as I am concerned in terms of the proper processes of this parliament, an advocate for this sector. But what is happening here is that this government has imposed upon this sector a minister who regards it essentially as a second prize, as a booby prize. She has told the liberal councils in South Australia, as I understand it, that she regards it as a `poison chalice.' She does not want the job. Is it therefore any wonder that she cannot and, I suggest, will not seek to be an advocate for this sector? She will not seek to understand the values and aspirations of this constituency, because she does not want to. She has no understanding essentially because she regards this is an area that she believes she should not really be a part. So when it comes to understanding what the implications of her budget cuts are, is it any wonder that she takes such a callous disregard for this industry and for

When it is put to her and is complained about, she says, `Well, of course, they're not up to it, are they?' On the one hand she says, `I rely upon the advice of the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors.' These are the people that ought to know what is going on. When the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors give her and give everyone in Australia that advice, what does she say?: `They're just scare&amp;hyphen;mongering.

Fees and personal expenditure by the 50,000 international students in Australian universities generate over $1.3 billion. This is twice that of forestry products and comparable to the $1.5 billion in export dollars earned by wheat sales and $1.4 billion from steel and iron. That is the sort of dimension that we are talking about here.

        —In responding to this motion today there are a number of points I would like to make. The first is that this government does recognise the value of the higher education sector. I have said in this place before, and it bears repeating, that there is value to Australians who get the opportunity to participate. Synergies are developed from that, as are export dollars. I would not want to get to the stage where we look at the universities as nothing more than that. I have made the point that it is not only the universities in the tertiary sector that are providing the export income; it is the TAFE sector as well. The higher education system is undoubtedly one of the most valuable pieces of social and economic infrastructure we have. Let us make that abundantly clear in the first place.

       The second point I make is that no-one should be deluded by the relative calmness of Senator Carr's voice today. I say `relative calmness' because it has not been that quiet,
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        but it has been significantly quieter than when he chooses to yell and get close to screaming point in question time. Nobody should be deluded by that relative calmness. The moving of this motion indicates that Senator Carr himself has little care for the higher education sector and little care for the students and staff in it. If he did, he would not be moving a motion in the Senate, which I regard as the more superior of the two federal houses, claiming that there is massive disruption in the higher education system and adding fuel to a fire which he contributed to setting.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Senator Carr well knows that it is because of the ineptitude of the previous government, of which he was a member, although then not in the ministry—because of their overspending and because of their deceit in failing to open the books prior to the election so that Australians could see what the budgetary situation was—that this government is now faced with an $8 billion black hole.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What is expected of this government? Are we expected to walk away from that problem? That was the mistake the previous government made. It hoped everything would get better. With significant years of growth it still ran a budget deficit. That is not a record any government could possibly be proud of.

       Putting the budget back into the black will very much make a contribution to some people in my portfolio. Those are the most disadvantaged: those who are either inadequately skilled or who for some other reason are at the moment looking for a job. I have an obligation to them as well. The government has given a very high priority to the creation of real jobs, especially for young Australians. One part of tackling that task is getting the economy healthy again, getting the budget back into the black.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Senators opposite and the Democrats may, for whatever reasons, rather that we sit and hope that it gets better, but enough is enough. We have had year after year of growth and still we are running deficits. The problem has to be fixed in the interests of the nation as a whole, but particularly in the interests of those less advantaged than people who have the opportunity to go into higher education—
       <break page="1051" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

      <para first-indent="16">
       Senator Carr's moving of this motion today is a clear indication that he has in this case, if he does not always, put politics above whatever interest he may have in higher education. He knows the extent of the overspending by the previous government. He knows that they failed to bring the budget back into the black and he knows that achieving that will make a contribution to generating real jobs, especially for young Australians.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Despite knowledge of the devastation on the budget left by the previous government, of which he was a member, he says, `Don't do anything about it.' That must be the consequence of the comments he has been making.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       How can I come to that conclusion? Very easily. I know, and Senator Carr knows, that no decisions in this matter have been made. He knows full well that on two occasions I have accepted invitations by the vice-chancellors, once to their board and once to the committee as a whole. On both occasions I have done a number of things. I have made it clear that we face an enormous budgetary task as a nation and that we will not turn away from that task. That is the task of government: to face up to the problems that a nation has and to do what must be done to fix those problems.

      <para first-indent="16">
       We will not walk away from that as Labor continued to do with their spend&amp;hyphen;spend&amp;hyphen;spend policy. That necessarily means that a whole range of departments are going to have to continue. Undoubtedly, every minister and everybody associated with each section within each portfolio would like to say, `Not this area.'

       It seems that senators opposite are not prepared to acknowledge a problem. They seem to think this problem will just go away. We do not say that. We say that something has to be done about it. Even if they were prepared to be sensible and say, `There is a
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        budgetary problem and something does need to be done about it,' what Senator Carr is saying is, `But not this area.' So would every other area prefer to be in a situation where these changes did not need to be made. Every area would prefer to be in that situation. Every minister would prefer to be in that situation.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The sad fact is that we are not in that situation. We have been left with an enormous budgetary hole created by Labor's overspending which we wanted the Australian people to know the full extent of. We asked for the books to be opened, but they refused to open them to let us see. So the raising of this motion here today makes it abundantly clear that Senator Carr is either rejecting the fact that there is a budget deficit or he is saying, `Don't worry; ignore your responsibilities as a government. It might be a problem, but let's just hope it goes away.' Or he is, as every other minister would want to be, in the position of saying, `Well, you might have a problem and you might have to do something about it, but not in this area'. That is completely irresponsible.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is worse than that. The framing of Senator Carr's motion is quite inflammatory and designed to cause more concern. He refers to the turmoil engulfing Australia's universities and goes on to comment on indiscriminate funding cuts. What kind of responsibility does he take upon his shoulders for bringing a motion to this chamber referring to indiscriminate funding cuts when, firstly, no decisions have been made and, secondly, when the very purpose of going to visit the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors on two occasions, the very purpose of talking to the unions, was to say, `Look, you are quite specially placed to offer some advice on the best way to undertake this task; we don't want to go about this in an indiscriminate way, we want to include you in the loop and take your advice'?

       The wording of the senator's motion clearly indicates that there is nothing but politics behind it. He wants to fan the fires. He wants to create more concern than there need be. He

        wants to suggest that cuts will be indiscriminate when he has heard time and time again in this place that the government values the higher education sector, and in particular very much values the advice of key stakeholders in it, and that on several occasions it has sought the advice of vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors to put their views as to the most appropriate ways to make the changes that need to be made. But Senator Carr ignores all that and proceeds in any event with his motion. To conclude on that point, I say that no&amp;hyphen;one need be deceived by the relative calmness of Senator Carr's voice today.

       Secondly, Senator Carr seems to have the view—often held by members of the Labor Party—that if you spend more money on something you are necessarily doing a good thing, that you are necessarily achieving better outcomes and making improvements. I make the obvious point—which I think, from my perhaps limited knowledge of yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you understand—that more money does not necessarily give you a better product. There are serious decisions to be made with respect to higher education, and they do not relate simply to fiscal priorities. They relate to how to better spend those resources that are available, how to better distribute those resources that are available and how to give universities more flexibility to save them from being strangled by the central control system set up by Labor. These are the sorts of questions that need to be addressed, rather than having Senator Carr rush in to move a motion to fan the fires of concern.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The next point I want to make is this, Mr Acting Deputy President: I unequivocally tell you that I have never said, and I never would say, that the higher education sector has had it too good for too long. It seems that such is the emotive position of senators opposite—or perhaps I should say political motivation—that they will say anything. They will not permit a reasoned debate on this matter. When one wants to tell the truth and point out—as Senator Carr himself acknowledges—that higher education has had increases in funding, someone feels entitled to say, `Oh well, you obviously think it has had it too
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        good for too long'. If you want to point to other infrastructure—not the knowledge generating and collecting infrastructure—the area of roads, for example, has seen its funding halved. If you want to come closer to the question of universities—that is, more to knowledge generating infrastructure—the funding to CSIRO has remained stagnant.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Apparently, when you point out these things, it allows Senator Carr—and others, I accept—to put words into your mouth so you are seen to be saying that you obviously think that the higher education sector has had it too good for too long.

       I do not think that is right. I think the higher education sector is suffering under a system that is strangled by Canberra. I think the funding that went in was not commensurate with the student numbers that went in. That is why we have students spilling out of lecture halls and inadequately resourced libraries. They are the problems. This government is the guilty party that kept overspending, that kept thinking, `If you just tip more money into something it will be better', but it did not give adequate thought to the infrastructure universities need. That is why students are spilling out.

       Does anyone want to deny that students are spilling out of lecture theatres? Does anyone over there say that libraries in universities are as they should be? Does everyone over there say that the funding mechanism for universities is as good as it could be? Is this what you say? Does everyone over there say that the higher education sector under its current design of funding is the best it could possibly be? Surely you are not prepared to say that. I look forward to future speakers standing up and denying that students have been spilling out of lecture theatres, denying that libraries are under&amp;hyphen;resourced, denying that the universities want more flexibility. Get up and say it; tell us that you think what you did was perfect; tell us that you had the right design, and then let us see what people have to say about that.

Nobody thinks highly of what your government did. Nobody thinks highly of a guilty party that kept on spending, spending, spending. That, might I suggest, is one reason why you were tipped out of office. It is perfectly understandable that the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors, who—I have said time and time again—are in the best position to advise a government with respect to higher education and obviously take the future of the higher education system to their heart, would be distressed to find that the previous government's budgetary lack of control has now put them in a situation where they have to make some savings.

       Why would one want to make savings? Why would one choose to do that? The ideal situation is: you did not need to do it. The reality is that it is a national task that has to be done.

That is perfectly understandable.

       The fourth point I want to make, and I touched on briefly earlier, relates to the allegation contained in Senator Carr's motion that there is some notion of indiscriminate cuts with respect to universities. I will repeat the point once more. Yes, there is a budgetary savings task. Yes, all portfolios have to make a contribution in one way or another. Yes,
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        one would expect higher education to make a contribution to that.

Some vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors are prepared to come forward and give some advice to the government on the best way to do this because they recognise the national imperative in getting the budget back into the black and they recognise that they would rather have a hand in shaping the future of higher education than allowing savings to be made in which they had not had the opportunity to make a contribution.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Something that could have happened under Labor which the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors would have been even more entitled to be hostile about would have been if their advice had not been sought. If this government were setting about achieving a national savings target and had gone to universities on 19 August, the day before the budget, and said, `Guess what? We've made some decisions and we have made them without consulting you,' then the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors would be entitled to complain. They would be entitled to be very, very annoyed because they are in the best position to offer advice. If they had been locked out of the loop, if their advice had not been sought, if on budget night all of this was a surprise to them, they would be entitled to feel outraged, not just hostile. They would be entitled to feel that the minister who is meant to represent their interests had completely misled them.

       On the point of a minister misleading the higher education sector, Senator Carr, I took the opportunity to raise the question of the pay claim in higher educational institutions. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may not know this but some time last year the former minister, Mr Crean, had consultations with the higher education sector and gave a commitment, as I understand it, that the pay claim would be met. He said that he had it all fixed up. Then when he got to cabinet he could not deliver.

You do not have to be very bright to say to yourself, `Why would a number of academics get together a month later and put together a precis of a speech and distribute it right in the middle of some discussions on higher education savings or cuts?'

I told those at the conference that I have never perceived myself to have been particularly bright. That comment was paraphrased as: `I am not a very bright person.' Judge for yourselves the contrast between what I told you I said and the paraphrased version of what I said. I have great confidence in regard to this.

        I went on to point out in my speech that when I left school I chose not to do tertiary study. In hindsight, that was a mistake. I realised it was a mistake and I then enrolled. Having chosen to have gone into the retail industry, I learnt that people who did degrees in law and medicine and whatever else had a lesser attitude towards people who went into the retail industry. I thought that people representing unions would understand this. Day after day in this place, I hear that the Liberal Party is the party that does not understand the value of people who work in industry, the value of the worker.

Anyone who has got a law degree will tell you that there is an enormous misconception that if you get a law degree, you must know everything about every law.

Before that was introduced, every time a minister chose a fancy letterhead to pander to their ego, the poor public servant had to get up and change the tray in the printer.

Over the past few weeks the relevant groups in the higher education sector—the Australian Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellor's Committee, the National Union of Students, the National Tertiary and Education Union—have raised a lot of concerns. Those groups, and political groups like the Australian Democrats, have been accused of scaremongering.

        Earlier this week, in this place, the minister decried the fact that the AVCC and other vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors had failed to react positively to her comments about funding cuts to the sector. She was disappointed that the sector has not responded in a positive fashion or come up with other proposals for sustaining budget cuts. Of course they are not responding positively. They are absolutely terrified that this government is about to rip the very heart out of the higher education sector, which is what funding cuts of 12 per cent amount to.

        I have to take issue with Senator Carr's figures. Budget cuts of 12 per cent are the equivalent of something like five to six medium&amp;hyphen;sized university campuses being closed down. With consequences like that, is it any wonder that the sector is feeling a little down in the dumps at the moment? What is worse, this government, when in opposition, gave a black and white commitment, promising they would not cut operating grants to higher education institutions.

        In your own policy statement, not only did you give a commitment that operating grants would not be cut, you actually decried the fact that the former Labor government had underfunded the sector. You claimed that it required more funding. It is a furphy for the government to turn around now and claim that just because something has more money spent on it, it does not mean that quality is enhanced. That was the logic spouted in your document, in which you claimed that under Labor's rule:

        The expansion of the higher education sector was not matched, however, with a commensurate increase in per capita student funding. In fact, since Labor's election in 1983, universities have experienced a 13 per cent decline per EFTSU—

         this. We do not think that the Labor government can hold their heads high today. But if the coalition were angry at the fact that funding had been reduced by 13 per cent over 13 years, what impact does it think a 12 per cent funding cut in one budget will have on the sector?

        . Let's look at the impact that cuts would have on quality, diversity and choice. You would lose quality. You cannot make funding cuts without restricting diversity. And the only choice this government is giving institutions when it talks about funding cuts of this magnitude is to increase student fees, cut staff numbers or go bankrupt.

        I understand that the minister has given an assurance that student load will not be affected. I am not sure anymore how much faith I place in assurances made by this government but I am wondering how it intends to fund a student load that remains at current levels while funding cuts will be drastic for overall operating grants. I think we can expect a dramatic reduction in EFTSU funding.

        Again, I have to take issue with Senator Carr's figures. I would not mind clarification on this, but I think he said that EFTSU funding has tripled since 1983. In fact, we are looking at something like a 6.5 per cent increase in EFTSU funding since 1988. We are only just getting back to 1983 levels in real terms.

         I would like the government to tell me how they intend to fund student load, if it is to be maintained at current numbers, when the budget has a massive black hole in it. I suspect that the government has no overall plan for the sector. Senator Carr was right. On Monday, the minister was given the opportunity to articulate her vision for the sector and she failed to do so. I suspect that this government is operating in a higher education policy vacuum. And I suspect that those are the views not only of parties like the Demo crats but also of sector representative groups such as the AVCC and NUS.

        Interestingly, I do not think the minister has worked out, at any stage, the economic impact of cuts. The government does not seem to realise that it actually costs money to implement budget cuts in the university sector, especially at such late notice. It actually costs money to phase out courses. It is a costly exercise planning for funding cutbacks and subsequent course changes. There is no use telling universities and their administrators that they have to wait until August to find out the extent of budget cuts. It  demonstrates an absolute lack of understanding by the minister and the new government as to how the higher education system works. Not only do administrators of universities need more time to plan than that, but the community, current students and potential students need more time to plan. That is logical.

        In regard to the fourth point that the minister made about indiscriminate cuts, what is important is not simply the fact that this government has failed to outline where the cuts would be coming from, but the fact that it has failed to take into account that the sector needs time to plan for those cuts. In fact, one Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Chubb from Flinders University, has estimated that, for every dollar the government cuts in the higher education budget, $2.50 will be required to implement those cuts. We have heard enough today about hostile vice-chancellors. I reiterate: why would they not be feeling down in the dumps when they are facing their sector being destroyed in the course of one year?

Yesterday they were eating dog food in the streets. I don't expect that the minister would have enjoyed watching that little escapade.

Senator O'Chee, being a good National Party senator, you might be able to enlighten us. I know that you joined with the Liberal Party on nine occasions to vote against the Democrat move to remove assets testing for farming families, but you did go to the election with that particular proposal.

         Let us move back to the issue of looking after access and equity in our institutions. For the benefit of the minister, I will provide a definition of what constitutes a tax. Maybe Senator O'Chee would like to enlighten us as to what he considers a tax. According to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Macquarie Dictionary

        <para first-indent="16">
         HECS is a tax; a pre-election promise is a promise. In the interests of furthering access and equity in our institutions, and also given that this coalition government has pledged not increase taxes, I suspect that one option available to this government, in order to finance its budget cuts—that is, the option of increasing user pays education in this country—has been ruled out. It is a good thing too. There are many other promises that the coalition made during the election campaign, in what I consider a blatant attempt to woo students. I just hope those promises are going to be honoured.

I suspect that Senator Vanstone does not know this, because I think it was a commitment made by her predecessor, Senator Robert Hill, but it is interesting to note that the coalition promised to settle the wage claim when it met with the NTEU. It promised to give it top priority and to settle that wage claim when it got into office. Of course, that action has not happened yet.

We now have a government minister talking about making real jobs when, quite frankly, the government has in mind to cut Working Nation funds. In reality, the unemployment rate in Tasmania would have been far higher were it not for the

       On the issue of higher education, what an extraordinarily vague piece of doublespeak the coalition's pre&amp;hyphen;election policy on higher education was. Now we know why. It was full of sectoral jargon such as quality, choice, access and diversity but contained, deliberately it now seems, very little substance. Those members of the community who were lulled into a false sense of security over the future of higher education in this country are now waking up, and they are waking up with a vengeance.

       Warnings given by Labor as to the true nature of the coalition's agenda as it affected higher education have now proved to be spot on. The previous Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean, said on 20 February this year that, while the coalition's policy endorsed much of Labor's position on higher education, important commitments were conspicuous by their absence. There was no commitment to maintain the key equity features of HECS—for example, tying the repayments to average weekly earnings. There was no commitment to all Australian undergraduates for access to HECS and there was no commitment to salary rises for university staff.

       It now appears that the coalition feels under no obligation whatsoever to fulfil those promises. Senator Vanstone made that quite clear from her comments over the much debated dinner with vice-chancellors in Canberra last Monday. In a somewhat unorthodox manner, Senator Vanstone let the assembled heads of our prestigious universities know that cuts were in store. Whether those cuts will be in the order of five per cent
       <break page="1061" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        or will be as high as 12 per cent, we do not know. Not only does she plan to tease the Australian community until the budget in August, but the last dispatch had Senator Vanstone referring to the vice-chancellors as fearmongerers.

       Let's turn now to what these cuts will actually mean. Cuts of this magnitude will, quite simply, rip the heart out of higher education in this country.

       A 10 per cent cut to the University of Tasmania's operating grant would reduce the total available operating funds by about $10 million. This is out of a total budget of $116 million.

       One of the coalition's few specific pre-election announcements on higher education was the promise of a $129 million funding increase to research infrastructure.

       When you consider the coalition's pre-election promises and its post&amp;hyphen;election actions, the more likely scenario is that the funding for research will be drastically cut severely reducing universities' capacity to undertake basic research and putting in jeopardy the positive relationships between universities and industry partners. It has long been accepted that universities need to attract a proportion of their research dollars from external sources. This is fine as long as it is balanced by a high proportion of public funding.

There was certainly a threat to research capacity when not enough money was provided to the universities for research. There was certainly the reality of a decline in quality of service as the numbers expanded and the money spent did not match that expansion.

What happens to quality of service if the buildings keep running down and there is not sufficient money to maintain them? The University of Sydney says that it needs $150 million to fix its buildings.

It had this objective, for the good of the country, to expand student numbers in the universities. That was not its objective at all. It had a much more cynical objective. That cynical objective related to the huge unemployment queues in this country.

       The former government asked: how can we get the numbers in unemployment queues down? It was the so-called official rate of unemployment. `How can we reduce that?' The government said, `We can define people off the unemployment list. We can create programs of study that do not lead anywhere and students can become unemployed again. We can put more people into the TAFEs. We can put more into the universities. That will get the unemployment numbers down.' This very cynical government, as part of a way out of the embarrassment over the huge level of unemployment it created as a result of Keating's recession that we had to have, stuffed huge numbers of students into universities without increasing the funding for buildings, for research, for staff, for libraries and for computer technology to match the number of students who came into the system.

       Point (ii) of Senator Carr's motion refers to the threat to the university research capacity and course options. The whole basis of good research in a university, no matter what the discipline, is having a good library. If you are going to do research in an Australian university and use its library, how are you positioned? A 1986 report on libraries said that university libraries are in crisis and that the funding position, under the former government, has gone down, since 1986, from that point.

       Gough Whitlam had a great dream for higher education: it was all going to be free. Labor governments are good at this: everything is going to be free! Of course, someone has to pay in the end, but Labor governments do not seem to understand that. That is why they keep getting into budget deficits. As a matter of fact, every Labor government that this country has had in the last 20 years has
       <break page="1066" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        sent its administration broke, and our $8 billion hole is an example of that.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       This sort of thinking was the thinking that created no fees in the university system. It is a great idea: everyone goes along free. What was the reason? It was to change the socioeconomic balance. What was the outcome? It did not change anything. The socioeconomic balance stayed exactly the same before free higher education and after. Your government was eventually forced to change it. Why? You were forced to change it because you just could not run a university system properly that way.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I was in the system at that time. What we found, after Whitlam's marvellous free higher education, was that we were subject totally to the federal budget. What that federal budget did year after year was cut things back. We started with student to staff ratios of 10:1; they went to 12:1 and 14:1. When I left, under your administration, it was 18.5:1. The usual lecturing darg when I went in was about 10 per week. It went to 12, 14 and 16, and when I left it was 18. Marking loads kept going up because the number of students we had kept going up. What sort of effect did that have on morale? Senator Carr talks in this motion about a threat to morale. Let me tell you the reality. Over your 13 years of administration, there was a great decline in morale.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Subparagraph (iv), if I may come back to the morale issue in another way, also relates to what your government did to the structure of higher education. John Dawkins woke up one morning and had a bright idea. He said, `I will put all these institutions together.' There was no consultation. Some of the earlier speeches mentioned consultation. We woke up one day and discovered we were going to amalgamate with the institution next door. There was no consultation; it just happened.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       You should have seen the effect of that on morale. People who were brought into institutions to be teachers because they were excellent teachers suddenly found they had to be researchers as well. Administration systems that had developed separately over 30 or 40 years suddenly found they had to harmonise. Staff suddenly found that there were overlaps
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        in jobs, so jobs had to be rationalised. The structures of the departments of the universities had to change because there were two being brought together. You would not believe the wasted time in the system caused by this Dawkinisation.

       What was the outcome? There were 37 universities; there was no longer a CAE sector. There was also no longer a diploma system in the country. That little move left a gaping hole in higher education.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The second thing that you left was a lack of capacity of the system to respond properly to the demands on it because you did not fund it properly. If you create 37 universities, you have to fund 37 universities. But you people kept funding levels at a lower level for these newer institutions. You did not take into account the fact that they had to be established as research institutions. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ballarat still complains to me that he never got an establishment grant when it became a university.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The whole thing was done on a shoestring. The universities of regional Australia, which one of your speakers was referring to earlier, were left with a lower funding base. They still have a lower funding base. Per student they get less at Charles Sturt University in Wagga than they get at Sydney University. What is the basis for that? They say that it will cost them too much money. Again, you were doing things on the cheap.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What about research in these newer universities? They created something called mechanism B. Mechanism B was supposed to make up this gap over five years. What a joke! You cannot suddenly change an institution that does not do research to one that does research over a five-year period. The funding was not kept up to what was required.

       Traditionally, universities have a teaching function and a research function. It seemed as though the Department of Employment, Education and Training had actually given up on this matter at estimates a few years ago when I asked them whether a university could take on a purely teaching function with no research at all. The senior officer at the table said, `Yes, we would be happy with that.' What do you have with that? You have the
       <break page="1067" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       I turn to this whole question of international reputation, which is the first point of Senator Carr's motion. He talks about the threat to Australia's international reputation and higher education export industry. It is amazing that it has done as well as it has, given some of the decisions of this government over the last 13 years. When I came into this parliament the educational export industry was worth $800 million. It has now doubled to $1,600 million and it is set to double again to $3,200 million.

       Over recent years a number of the measures of your government have put a brake on the capacity of this system by damaging our reputation overseas. This has been done in two ways. Firstly, by the decline of resources that I mentioned earlier, you have damaged our institutions in the way that I have previously indicated, and that has spread overseas. The second way you have damaged it relates to your so-called quality assurance mechanism. This was brought in to try to approve quality, teaching and research in universities by creating systems of measurement and just seeing if universities are coming up to the mark. There is nothing wrong with that; that is a great idea.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What you then did through bad judgment was create a system where you actually ranked the universities. Senator Schacht and I have had some interesting conversations on this in estimates committee hearings. If he stopped reading his newspaper, he might want to contribute now. With that quality assurance mechanism, universities with a very high standard were given rankings, from one to five initially. Some universities with excellent potential were ranked five or six. Some of those universities had first-class faculties. If you were ranking faculties, they would get a
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        ranking of one, two or three. But because you ranked whole universities, they got a ranking of five.

       Guess where most of these lower ranking universities were? We had members of the then government opposite bleating about the problems that we were rumoured to be causing in regional Australia. Boy, did you cause some problems in regional Australia when you did that because most of the five and six ranked universities were in regional Australia. These are the ones who are trying to establish educational export markets. They go overseas and what happens? People say, `What was the ranking in the quality assurance round?' They say, `Well, we were actually six out of six.' What will that do for your business? It was one of the stupidest things that has happened in higher education in this country and it has done enormous damage.

       Let us look at the overall legacy of what Labor has claimed to do in higher education and what actually happened in the end. The expansion which they laud as being a great initiative and done on the most altruistic grounds was really a cynical exercise to try to keep people off the job queues. How successful were they in doing that? When I came into this place 50,000 students were turned away from universities. Fifty thousand students were qualified to get in and you could not let them in. That is the equivalent of all of the University of Sydney and all of the University of New South Wales put together. That is how much the system was under capacity. Over recent years it has dropped back to 20,000&amp;hyphen;odd. That is about the size of the University of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong. You left government when it was short that much.

        —The Greens are also strongly opposed to the government's threats to the higher education budget. These cuts are taking place with no consultation and in secret. There are rumours going around, but there are also areas that have already had indications of frozen funding. Unfortunately, they tend to be in areas like Aboriginal tertiary education support.

       There are areas already being picked off, even before any budget. We are not getting any details of these. We have been told that we have to wait until the budget, but there are priorities being picked out now and there are no announcements about it. It is what they have learnt from the previous government. You cut in between budgets and do not announce it. In fact, it is being very dishonest not to say what those are at the same time as they are happening.

       Moving to higher education specifically, the coalition's strategy has been their usual autocratic style of imposing policy from above, with little consultation and no information about what they are going to do, to completely disarm people fighting for their hard-won gains out of the public sector. Amongst these groups are students, whom the coalition governments at both state and federal level are trying to decimate through their ability to organise and create a separate voice through political activism, guild activities and student newspapers.

       On top of the attacks to students coming in the form of voluntary student unionism, the coalition has also turned their attention to decimating the higher education sector, threatening the massive loss of places, staff and research and infrastructure activity, which is meant to be expanding in the sector to meet demand.

        These all go against the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the higher education budget would not sustain cuts of more than the general efficiency savings and Senator Hill's promises that the current HECS system would not impose up-front fees for Commonwealth funded undergraduate places, that they would not impose a voucher system and that Austudy would be retained as a financial support mechanism.

        We have heard many horrific rumours about what the coalition would like to cut, but there has not been anything much forthcoming from the minister, other than the rough figure of five per cent to 12 per cent cuts, which could mean cuts of up to $1 billion. There is no responsible attempt to even talk about what would be targeted or what should be ruled out. We know that HECS increases look most likely, even though that breaks one of the coalition's rarely stated fundamental pre&amp;hyphen;election promises. There is rumour of a possible doubling of HECS for expensive courses with a minimum $1,000 increase for all students, no matter which courses they are studying.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The policy of differential HECS is very harmful on equity grounds. Not only is higher education mainly accessed by the middle class because of the disincentives of debt and sustained poverty during the study period from a lack of government financial assistance, but differential HECS will also exacerbate this trend of higher education pandering to the privileged. If our most expensive courses of law and medicine cost the most to working class students, this is yet another obstacle to students taking up those courses—or science and engineering in the second proposed tier, for that matter. There will be a general move away from the higher education system for those students who find the prospect of debt too much.

        It will also be a problem for those people who actually think that going to university is something they should do for the benefit of community.

         The area of debt moves us into the area of Austudy and what is appropriate student financial assistance. Austudy is already only 68 per cent of the poverty line. Prior to 1983, the Fraser government was about to impose a loans system through banks at mortgage rates to totally replace the student assistance scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Austudy loans have been increasing under a Labor government to meet the same ends. These loans actually increase the debt load far more rapidly on students than HECS does. In fact, these loans are the most attractive to the poorest students who cannot knock back what they realise is not a good deal because an extra couple of thousand dollars a year is crucial to their survival, even if this means they have to sacrifice a large amount of non-refundable Austudy to get this loan. Often it is the richest people who can afford the cheapest options in these cases.

         The area of student assistance and debt needs to be revisited by a coalition government if it is at all concerned about access and equity. These policy areas are integral to a system in which massive student numbers would further reduce the number of students able to access higher education.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If these student places are cut, it is absolutely essential that student assistance and HECS are reconsidered in light of removing the obstacles to disadvantaged groups, low socio&amp;hyphen;economic groups and mature age students accessing the university system. It is not good enough to say to these people that open learning and external study are the only options available.

         Scholarships for the poor are not a policy solution to improve equity where the cost structures of higher education block general access.

These are the inherent structural problems about equity that scholarships cannot solve.

         The Liberal rhetoric of choice is being used pretty strongly in this debate about diversity in universities, diversity in courses, a possible voucher system and fees for undergraduates. I would like to say that this notion of choice goes to the heart of the government's reconstructed notion of higher education in order to treat it like any other commodity which should face cuts where the government can abrogate its responsibility and give it over to the private sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The notion of choice is about treating people as consumers instead of citizens. If the government respected people as citizens, it would respect that higher education is a right not a privilege, and the government has a responsibility to fund a decent public sector education for all those people willing to put in the effort to gain a tertiary education.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In consumer terms, education is treated like a cost, not an investment, and education is seen as an individual benefit instead of offering a whole range of its benefits to the community and to the society as a whole.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The notion of having to develop choice in the higher education system is codswallop. Students can already exercise choice in the higher education sector. There is great diversity in the different universities and courses available, the teacher&amp;hyphen;student relationships, quality and construction of course curriculum, teacher quality, campus life, guild services and the image of the university among different university and community sectors. These are all issues which enable students to make an informed choice about where they want to study.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is mobility for students willing to change states if need be if there is not a course that suits them or a university will not accept them. Diversity means that the profiles of universities can be as flexible as they are now but universities still have the opportunities to develop strengths in areas such as research excellence, which for the newer universities takes more time and resources than for the well established privileged, traditional universities, such as the well known group of eight—or G8.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          More funding cuts from such a sector would not lead to diversification but instead to consolidation of hierarchical positions in the university sector. This means that those with well developed research faculties would concentrate on this and leave teaching aside. Other universities could not compete on this level and would actually limit choice for students studying at other universities who would have to move to access a particular type of research strength. The government should not confuse polarisation with diversity. We have an excellent, world&amp;hyphen;class higher education sector. We need now to do our best to keep it.

          I would like to say a final word about the massive number of academic, tutor, administration and staff cuts. Staff are already stretched with the number of students they have to teach. It is absolutely critical that staff can spend time with students, teaching, marking, consulting and giving feedback to improve the quality of tertiary education received by the students. Quality education is already suffering because of the pressure on staff. Government members must recognise the limits to this narrow view of productivity. They do not realise that they are actually already surviving on the good will of a lot of the staff, who are already taking on increasing workloads for no increase in pay with huge amounts of unpaid time for organising lectures, tutorials, giving advice, marking and assessment.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like to say that the Greens support the work of the NTEU in fighting for academic staff to gain a 15 per cent raise in their wages. The Greens believe that such work is integral to retaining the best staff in Australian universities and to delivering the best teaching and academic services to students and to the sector as a whole.

        —With respect to this motion on higher education as moved by Senator Carr, we have had two members of the government participate in this debate. Firstly, we had the minister, who really does not want to be the minister for education, Senator Vanstone, and then we had Senator Tierney, who would like to be the minister for education but did not pass the test.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       If you look at what was said by both speakers it is interesting to note a number of very glaring contradictions. Firstly, Senator Vanstone pointed to the fact that expenditure in the higher education sector had increased by 67 per cent in real terms. The clear implication in her remarks was that this was far too much, and she sought to contrast that with other areas of government expenditure such as road transport. Senator Tierney, however, throughout his entire contribution, claimed that the government had not spent enough.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       When it came to the issue of regional universities, Senator Vanstone gave us a lengthy lecture on how costs will vary from campus to campus around Australia and how flexibility is needed in looking at these issues and how you should not adopt a centralised global approach in higher education. Yet Senator Tierney stood up and complained that the funding per student varied from campus to campus, asserting that the funding was lower per student in regional universities than it was in Sydney.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Senator Tierney also got up and complained that too many students were trying to get into university and that there were not enough places. What we are clearly going to get from the government's proposals is that the opportunities for students to get into universities will be dramatically reduced—slashed.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       One of the reasons why there are dramatically more students going into university, into higher education, and more students applying to get into universities is because of the ALP's tremendous record when in government with respect to school retention rates. When we came to office the retention rate for students going on to years 11 and 12 was in
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        the 40 per cent range. When we left office it was approaching 80 per cent—double the number of school children taking up that opportunity to go on to year 11 and 12, which is an essential requirement to get into university education.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is ridiculous and total hypocrisy for Senator Tierney to use the fact that there are a lot more school students seeking to go on from school to university or other forms of higher education as some sort of a criticism when it has come about because of the tremendous achievement, one of the most significant achievements of a long list of achievements, of the Labor government with respect to education in this country.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What separates the Australian Labor Party from the coalition is the importance that we place on the value of education and the contribution that education makes to the economic and social well-being of this country. You can look back in history, and Senator Tierney referred to the Whitlam era. The achievements of the Whitlam government even in that short period—three years—in terms of education in this country are a lasting testament of what the Labor Party did then and continued to do in more recent governments with respect to education.

       We ensured that there would be a national focus on education and that there would be far greater opportunities for young people in this country, from whatever socioeconomic background, to get a decent school education and to have an opportunity, if they so desired, to a world class, high quality higher education. I am proud to say that I was a beneficiary of the achievements brought about by the Whitlam government processes. So were people like Senator Vanstone, who graduated from university with law and Senator Herron with medicine.

       At a broader level, Australia's balance of trade is much healthier because of our universities. In fee and personal expenditure paid by the 50,000 international students attracted here, higher education exports now generate over $1.3 billion a year. In export dollars earned this is comparable to sales of wheat ($1.5 billion) or iron and steel ($1.4 billion), and twice that of forestry products.

       They are the sorts of earnings higher education is bringing into this country because of a world class system that is able to attract students from overseas, particularly from the Asian region.

       A 10 per cent cut in funding, translated through to student load, would reduce exports by over $130 million. That is just the direct effect. Export earnings lead to increased spending and produce additional ripple effects. Regional economists estimate this multiplier to be approximately two, so an initial fall in exports, or a worsening of the current account, of $130 million will translate into a reduction in national income of about $260 million. That corresponds to a loss of some 11,000 jobs and a loss in government tax revenue of around $55 million.

       What is the minister's approach when asked a question about this analysis by one of the country's leading academics, the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellor of one of our major universities? I point out that Professor Niland is not noted for his adherence to, or longstanding support of, the Labor Party. The minister's response is to talk about black holes. We have been hearing about black holes ever since this government was elected in March. Just about every time we ask a question in the Senate, we get this rhetoric about the black hole—the so-called $8 billion deficit which, of course, has been

       This government has already withdrawn the approved funding for the telescope. We will have more and more cutbacks in funding for university research. The government has even indicated that it is looking at removing the 150 per cent tax deduction for research and development undertaken by the private sector. As each day goes by, what do we get from this government?

       I will briefly comment on the threat to regional universities. When asked a question today about that issue, the minister again declined to specifically answer the question.

I would like to know what National Party members think about what is likely to happen to regional universities.

Under Labor the catchcry was that everybody must get a university degree. They were boasting about the number of law students. The problem is, we have as many people studying law as we have practising it.

There is what appears to be an employment agreement signed by Ms Ferris on 18 March 1996—a document which reinforces the view that there was a working relationship with Senator Minchin.

       Of continuing concern here is not just the fact that Ms Ferris was appointed for employment. The employment agreement document that she signed, under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, was dated 18 March 1996. In a letter to the Secretary of DAS, Mr Graham Semmens, advising him that Ms Ferris did not want to proceed with the appointment, Senator Minchin says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I refer to a proposal which was made to the Minister for Administrative Services for the appointment of Ms Jenny Ferris to my staff as an adviser.

Ms Ferris has now advised me that she does not wish to take up the appointment, and I now formally advise you accordingly.

       So there was a period of some four weeks, at least, where this employment arrangement was in effect. These documents reinforce the validity of the opposition's concern. We will revisit this issue next week.

         The issues that come to mind relate largely to access to justice. I ask a number of questions. What are the problems of running a trial as a bankrupt? That is important for anyone. Is there any difference if the bankrupt is someone like Alan Bond, somebody who somehow is able to manage to get the very best of legal representation, the very highest quality of legal assistance, even though, on the surface, they seem to be in straitened circumstances? What choices do people in those positions really have?

          This is more complex when, as a bankrupt, you are in a situation of acting against the Commonwealth. When are delays really your fault in these circumstances? It would appear that there are delays in putting forward peti tions to the court. Because of your bankruptcy, you may find that the delays mean that you have trouble putting petitions in on time, and you may end up changing your legal representation, for various reasons—for example, you cannot guarantee funding, or you have complained about something they have or have not done in the past. People later on at various times will say, `Why haven't they complained?' It begins to add up and compound. If they have complained they have sometimes lost their counsel, and if they do not complain we then have it on record that they have not complained and they therefore have no case. It is difficult in those situations, and the law can be overwhelming for many people.

These are all compounded; these are all problems of legal aid funding.

         It is an ongoing problem which needs to be reviewed, and perhaps one of the most important outcomes from this committee is the recognition that there are problems. I believe law is often like a poker game, with the powerful able to purchase justice and the less powerful beaten into submission. Unfortunately, in our society we see—for instance, in environmental cases—a proliferation of slap suits. Big corporations know that even if they are in the wrong they can wear the other side down—whether it is a community group or an individual—by continuing legal action. It is like the person who blinks. I personally know of a number of instances where community groups have fought for years and gained standing on a particular case, and then gone back to another Supreme Court hearing and found their standing challenged again. All the time, it has been those people who have had

         This is an ongoing problem that is compounded in cases such as this where there is a perception that government is defending a case as well as reviewing the legal aid. Certainly, the committee was asked to look at whether there was clear evidence that the government had acted improperly and the outcome of this inquiry was that the committee could find no evidence that the government had acted improperly in running the case. In doing that, I believe the committee served a very important function. Due to the time elapsed, it was important that we could take the time to find out that there was not a case to say that the government had acted improperly.

         I now want to refer to another major point. Over time, we are likely to see that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department, which is meant to be the epitome of good legal practice, as with most departments, will become more and more privatised. We found difficulty dealing with the many issues involved with this particular case but how much more difficult will it be in circumstances where there is a privatisation of Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's? How will we sort out the more complex conflict of interest issues? I think we ought to be very wary that we do not put ourselves in a position in the future, despite any recommendations from this kind of committee exercise, where we face an almost impossible conflict of interest when we have consulting legal advice from departments such as Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's on more and more of those issues.

         I believe the circumstances that the Faulkners found themselves in were not entirely of their own making. Obviously, any actions that one participates in contribute to the outcomes. I think the way that justice works, and the circumstance of bankruptcy, the circumstance of not being able to run your own case and the circumstance of uncertainty were very big factors in the Faulkners' level of unhappiness. It is very sad to think that so much difficulty was encountered over so many years in gaining even basic information about the running of their case.

The fact that this was a committee that came up with a good result—a good result in the sense that I think it was a fair and equitable result—and the fact that this committee came up with a result that came at the end of a long consideration of evidence that was brought before it is a tribute to the committee itself, including Senator McKiernan; Senator Spindler, who is here; Senator Margetts, who was a participating member but who assiduously attended the hearings; and Senator O'Chee, who is here too. I think those members of the committee and those who are not here deserve praise. As Senator Margetts has said, tribute ought be paid to the Chair, Senator Chris Ellison. I do so, and I am sure—

         I thought it was a high risk strategy sending this off to the committee and it was only the personnel at every level who saved what could have been quite a disaster. As it was, the committee found that the officers of the Attorney-General's Department had acted as they should—ethically—and that there was no criticism that could be aimed at them, except perhaps in respect of the way one or two of them expressed themselves in keeping notes about what had happened. But there was no suggestion that the notes in any way revealed anything that was untoward or that indicated in any way that they had not acted in the best traditions of lawyers or legal officers employed by the Attorney-General. If notes are made in a light or half jocular way, I think that is understandable, and I certainly would not criticise them for that.

The Faulkners felt, as many litigants feel, that they had not received the justice they deserved. They felt, as many litigants feel if the result of the court case goes against them, that the system is wrong. That is not to be held against them any more than it is to be held against many litigants who have suffered the same fate as they have.

         I thought there was some criticism—muted criticism or perhaps implied criticism—of Dr Greg Woods, the senior counsel acting for the Faulkners. My review of the way he acted leaves me with the conclusion that he acted properly in the best traditions of the bar. A litigation is, according to our system, a litigation that is decided according to the adversarial mode of proceedings. I think it is time now to look at whether or not those sorts of proceedings should be the proceedings that are adopted in every case which comes before the court. I think it is time that we looked at other ways of resolving disputes. But, given the fact that this case was decided according to the adversarial system, I thought Dr Woods acted with propriety in every way.

I thought he lived up to that reputation, and I think it proper I just note that as I take my seat.

         . Senators may recall that during the last election campaign the then Prime Minister said, `You've never had it so good.' He seemed somewhat puzzled that people did not appreciate that statement, despite the fact that wages were rising at a rate of about 5.3 per cent per annum and that all financial indicators were in reasonably good shape.

         It is a worthwhile reminder of the fact that there is more to life than the current trade figures and the balance of payments.

         This is not the first time in the Senate that social indicators were dealt with. Somewhat earlier, in 1979, a report was published by a Senate committee entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Through a Glass, Darkly
         </emphasis>
         . That inquiry was chaired by former Senator Peter Baume. I remember it well because at that stage I had just come out of working on the Australian Assistance Plan where the topic of social indicators was of great importance. It is worth while noting that even at that stage a Senate committee thought that social indicators, indicators other than financial indicators, were important.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is true, though, that since then there seems to have been a hiatus in Australia at least in developing and using indicators other than financial figures. Perhaps the major work in this area has been done by various United Nations bodies, in particular the United Nations Development Program, UNDP, which has published five reports—

         It is appropriate at this stage to also mention briefly that international fora sponsored by the United Nations are placing increasing value on the collection of indicators as a tool for developing social policies. Thus, a resolution at the human rights conference in Vienna included this sentence:

          The project was not without its difficulties, including the need to define citizenship. The committee came down on the side of what I believe to be an excellent solution. It said that citizenship is a function of one's interaction with the community and, as a result, the quality of one's life experience, thus distinguishing it from citizenship as a legal concept which is only available to those who have acquired citizenship in the legal sense and have the capacity to carry a particular passport.

          In that connection, I wish to acknowledge the assistance the committee has received from Professor Alistair Davidson, who is an acknowledged expert in this particular area and who, I believe, is now joining the citizenship project at the Centre of Urban and Social Research at the Swinburne University, thus strengthening that team.

          At this point I should also acknowledge the significant assistance the committee has received from Mr Michael Salvaris, the senior researcher at the Swinburne University and at that centre in pursuing the citizenship project.

          I should advert very briefly to one other difficulty, and that is the problem of how much one can summarise into one indicator the performance of any one nation. Once again, the committee has come down on the side of saying that the summary indicator is difficult to use in a reasonable fashion and that we must rely on a range of individual indicators and benchmarks. Benchmarks are derived from indicators, measuring the stage of social development a nation has reached

          In the remaining minutes let me advert briefly to the recommendations of the committee which suggest that the Australian Bureau of Statistics should be resourced to carry out a two-stage audit of its collection of statistics, and that the gaps identified should be remedied with the help of other institutions. Two of these gaps have already been quite clearly identified during the work of the committee; these are the areas of social participation and political participation. The collection of data in these areas is strongly recommended.

          Clearly that is what we, as a committee, were looking at. Above and beyond the simple statistics of how much people learn, et cetera, we were looking at what actually makes them happy and content. As we all well know, if we read the glossy magazines, all the stars seem to have all the money in the world, all the fortune—all the economic statistics are in their favour—yet their lifestyles and personal happiness leave a lot to be desired.

Let me simply conclude by saying that, whilst economics clearly is an important part in human wellbeing, it is not the only part, and we have  to be reminded of that from time to time. I hope and trust that this report will do exactly that.

         I also take up the themes set by Senator Spindler and Senator Abetz, and thank the secretariat. But I come to this question of what we are hoping to measure. Senator Abetz talked about values, and indeed it is time we, as a parliament, thought in terms of values other than economic values. I am not saying—and I agree with Senator Abetz in this—that we should not concentrate on economic indicators; it is absolutely essential to do so, and indeed we would be failing in our duty to the people if we did not do that.

I think the great importance of this report, which has been pointed out so well by Senator Spindler, who was the inspiring force behind it, which has been pointed out by Senator Abetz, is that it gives us the tools by which we can measure whether or not we are performing as a good society should, whether we are looking after all the citizens of our community in the way that any decent community would look after its citizens.

As Senator Abetz just said, it was not one of the cleaner legal type inquiries that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has had in the past. It had very wide terms of references. That caused the committee secretariat some difficulty in framing and developing a draft report, which has been accomplished with panache and finesse. The main person who developed that report is Steven Bull. The committee and the Senate itself are indebted to Steven and the other members of the secretariat.

I would hope that the will of the committee in trying to keep the report and the number of recommendations as concise as possible will encourage the new government to act quickly and speedily on the recommendations that the committee has put forward to it.

         —While most senators would applaud the move by the major banks to grow their businesses overseas, recent calls from Mr Don Argus to restrict the number of large banks by amalgamation are unlikely to lead to any benefits for the average Australian bank customer. In recent years the major banks have moved to make consumer banking less appealing for many Australians through the application of an increasing range of fees, very low interest rates on traditional passbook accounts and the closure of many of the smaller branches, particularly in the country. These decisions have led many people to move to the more user friendly, and perhaps less profit&amp;hyphen;driven, regional banks, credit unions and building societies for their everyday banking needs.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the major banks are to continue to attract patronage from their traditional customers, I believe that their present approach to service and fees will need a serious reappraisal. In the past bank growth has been built on service to customers, not an unholy focus on enriching shareholders. The recent approach of amalgamation amongst the big four smacks of greed at the consumers' expense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Generally, the banks have not been good innovators. In fact, the new players in the financial spectrum have developed niche financial markets from time to time, often at the expense of the traditional banks. Down the track the traditional banks have actually subsequently sought to recover ground by acquisition of the many successful entrepreneurs.

        This debate gives me the opportunity to congratulate Professor Fels and his team at
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for encouraging competition, taking firm action against collusive pricing arrangements and ensuring fair play and honest trading. I think it is interesting to note that there is no unanimous endorsement of the National Bank amalgamation or merger proposal.

        Mr Don Mercer, the chief executive of the ANZ bank, for example, doubted whether in the short term there would be any mergers between the four large Australian banks. He said that all the top four in Australia were currently among the world's top 100 banks and he believed they were large enough to act independently in the global scene.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, I do believe that the banks have a very legitimate concern at the possible loss of franking credits to domestic shareholders as they expand overseas. I will explain the concept of the franking credits, particularly streamlining. Franking credits are reduced with the decline in the home or domestic income as a proportion of total income in circumstances where we have a large increase of overseas income, as we would have with the expansion of the large Australian companies, including the banks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a solution, and quite a simple solution. That solution to this tax impediment is to allow selective and restrictive—I use these words very carefully—dividend streaming. To use an example, in the National Bank of Australia case a United Kingdom shareholder could receive dividends earned and paid by the National Bank's subsidiary, say, from a Yorkshire bank or one of its other UK subsidiaries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other important feature of dividend streaming is that it would encourage companies to keep their central management and control in Australia. We have a situation at the present time where the taxation arrangements could lead companies, like Amcor and others, maybe well down the track to transfer their head offices overseas, to the detriment of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In a draft report not yet submitted to government on offshore investment, the Industry Commission recommends that some tax issues be further examined. They include
        <break page="1084" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the possibility that dividend streaming might produce net economic gains for the nation. I believe this is certainly something we should pursue much further.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The lack of streaming opportunity effectively raises the United Kingdom cost of equity to the Yorkshire subsidiary, using the example that I give—and there are many others. The United Kingdom tax provisions, without the dividend streaming arrangements, are complicated at the present time. As such, they do not encourage United Kingdom shareholders to participate in the ownership of such shares arising from the Australian acquisition, in this case in the United Kingdom, because it does lessen the opportunities of Australian companies to be able to go abroad if the local shareholders have not all that much interest because of the lack of streaming facilities in Australia to go down that path. I think this is unfortunate. After all, we are told we are living in a global economy and our tax systems must keep up to date.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In summary, I think there is much to be gained and little to be lost. I have to acknowledge that the tax office will be concerned at the possible loss through avoidance. But if we draw this legislation very tightly I believe we can achieve what is in the best interests of the country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I say to the minister representing the Treasurer here tonight that I believe this is a great opportunity for this new government to show vision and leadership in encouraging Australian companies to retain their headquarters in Australia and to aggressively expand their overseas markets. Otherwise, we will see pressures for amalgamation and reduced competition here in Australia, which I do not believe is in the best interests of the country. I therefore encourage the government to introduce appropriate dividend streaming in the manner I have described that will not lead to tax avoidance.

        My reason for speaking in the adjournment debate about all of this is to mark the spot. We are concerned as an opposition about any diminution of this scheme because it is one of the foundations upon which Australia's competitiveness is built.

        As Senator Watson said a moment ago, we are now a globally integrated economy. The ingenuity of Australian industry, business, science and technology gives us an edge in the global marketplace. Industry does need an incentive such as this scheme provides in order to take advantage of it.

        In the OECD list of BIRD—business investment in research and development—Australia now ranks 15th of the 19 countries surveyed; that is, it is the 15th lowest expender on research and development in the private sector. We came up from 17th under Labor government incentives to lift private sector investment in research and development. I might say in parenthesis that, in public sector investment in research and development, Australia is No. 4. Only the Scandinavians spend more than we do and they have a much higher tax base to draw from. In the public sector, Australia has done well. The private sector is performing better. This incentive is needed in order for it to continue to do so. The recovery on R&amp;D expenditure is fragile. To interfere with it now would break that and undercut the competitiveness of this nation.

        In the circumstances of all these developments today, something quite bizarre happened. This is the point that I want to come to in this adjournment debate. I got a phone call this afternoon from a young woman whose immediate approach to me was to criticise me for my performance as industry minister. She can join the queue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        She criticised me in error. She cited a press release that I had issued with the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, on 6 December 1995, announcing, during the course of the innovation statement this government brought down, that there would be some changes to the focus of the R&amp;D tax concession. She said that this meant that the present government was positioned by us in government to go about demolishing or whittling down this scheme. Nothing is further from the truth.

        My investigations today have turned up a rats nest of interest. I asked her where she got this information from. She declined to say, but it is now obvious to me that it is more
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         than likely to have come from within the government bureaucracy itself. The press release to which I refer issued by me and Minister Willis on 6 December was headed `Refocusing the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession'. The so&amp;hyphen;called offending part of it reads:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These changes will have the effect of making it clear that the activities claimed must be part of R&amp;D activities systematically undertaken by firms and which involve high levels of innovation and technical risk in the particular field for which the activities are claimed.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the face of it, there is nothing very interesting about that. But the word `and' before `technical risk' rather than `innovation or technical risk' is what this debate revolves around. It seems that some in the bureaucracy are intent on arguing that industry must meet both qualifications, that is to say, industry must have innovation and technical risk in order to claim. It is not as we in government contended—innovation or technical risk—and they can claim if they have one; they do not necessarily have to have both.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My understanding is that the debate that is raging is that in the cost cutting mentality of this current government in the ERC context it is being argued that the word `and' in place of the word `or' means that we intended to go down the road that apparently the government has set its cap at now. We did not. I have checked the documents and references that I had as a minister at the time, the documents that stand behind this press release. I can prove conclusively that that was the position of the government.

        The countries that succeed in the future will be those that understand and master new technology and are able to turn scientific ideas into products and commodities that consumers and industry buy. That requires a country to have a strong research and development base. This incentive has put Australia in the front rank of countries. A survey I had conducted shows that Australia is by cost, by quality and by timeliness of delivery the most competitive R&amp;D country in the world. We can attract a large swag of the global R&amp;D investment because the circumstances are right for us to do so, very much like we attracted a large number of regional headquarters to this country because of our competitiveness.

At the outset, let me say it has a very onerous task and I believe it does a very good job.

        However, my eye was caught by the 61st report which dealt with possible false or misleading statements to the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. As is my usual wont, I go to the back of the report to find out what the finding was. The Privileges Committee determined that there was no finding of contempt, nor should there be, and I agree with that finding.

I am no longer a partner of it, nor associated with it, although it still bears my name.

        At paragraph 2.22 the report tells us that the bank submission has, however, contradicted itself in relation to one element. It claimed that `all senior management were assessed' while it then stated only `a variety of senior personnel was assessed'. By way of brief
        <break page="1087" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         background, somebody complained that they had been dismissed from the newly formed Trust Bank because they were a whistleblower. The Trust Bank then responded to that allegation. It was alleged that the Trust Bank had misled the Senate.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I then had a look at the submission on behalf of the Trust Bank and sure enough at pages 115 and 116 those two statements are made. But the terms `all senior management' is only part of `a variety of senior personnel'. Senior personnel is a different category of people to senior management. The senior management strata of which this person was a member—all of them—were assessed, whereas not all senior personnel were assessed. But there is, I would respectfully submit, a clear distinction between saying `all senior management were assessed' and saying `a variety of senior personnel were assessed'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the benefit of honourable senators, the dictionary tell us that `personnel' is simply the body of persons employed in any work or undertaking, whereas `management' deals with the act or manner of managing. Therefore, you can clearly have somebody who is part of the senior personnel who is not actually involved in the management of the bank. I think that is an important detail and once that important detail is explained, as I have just explained it, I believe that the conclusion which the committee came to, that the bank was not as precise as it may have been, is not an appropriate comment to have made in the circumstances.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me also say that the person who made this complaint against the bank at the end of the day made complaints, as I understand it, not only against the bank but also against the Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Fraser. Everybody was in his gun range. A letter from Mr Bernie Fraser dated 29 December 1993 to the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The two main assertions in the submission are that: I was responsible for, or contributed to, the individual's dismissal from Trust Bank; and I and the bank did not take seriously the individual's allegations concerning the management of Trust Bank. I have to say that on both points the individual is sadly mistaken.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In his letter to the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases, on which I was privileged to serve, this particular individual wrote that the Trust Bank `has wilfully and mischievously misled the Australian Senate'. It is quite clear from the finding, with which I agree 100 per cent, there was no misleading, let alone wilful or mischievous misleading, as alleged by the individual concerned.

        In my respectful submission to the Privileges Committee—and I started out my comments by saying that I accept I have made slip&amp;hyphen;ups in the past and I will undoubtedly do so in the future and I have nothing but the highest regard for the Privileges Committee—on this occasion there was an unfortunate slip&amp;hyphen;up in that the bank, I believe, was precise and did provide the information as required.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For all intents and purposes, for what was a gratuitous comment in the conclusion that the bank was not as precise in all aspects as it might have been, I would have thought the onus was on the Privileges Committee to ensure that it looked at the preciseness of the words used before it came to such a conclusion. On this occasion, I have to side against the Privileges Committee on the basis that the terminology `senior management' is a clearly different category of people from `senior personnel'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not wish to be critical of the Privileges Committee in this regard but, unfortunately, in my home state of Tasmania the Trust Bank has become somewhat of a political football. Undoubtedly certain elements in the community will be taking some delight in the conclusion drawn by the Privileges Committee and will want to rub their hands and say, `Sure, the Trust Bank wasn't found guilty of misleading the Senate, but they weren't quite as precise as they might have been and the bank owes a greater duty than that.'

The concluding comment of the Privileges Committee is not supported by the evidence and the close examination of the terminology employed. I therefore trust that nobody will use the conclusion in this report as some way of getting cheap publicity against the Trust Bank, which has served the people of Tasmania with great distinction.

Honourable senators would be aware that I have been a parliamentary representative on the Council of the Australian National University for many years. I am not currently a council member because my term expired in March this year. Nevertheless, I expect to be a member of the council again shortly when recommendations are passed to the Governor-General. Until my new appointment is official, the council has permitted me to attend its meetings and meetings of the finance committee, of which I was also a member; to participate in the council's and finance committee's deliberations, but not, of course, to vote.

        The ANU is a direct Commonwealth responsibility, but I regret that I have to report that at present it does not have sufficient funds to carry out proper maintenance and is falling into disrepair in many areas. The sector known as the Faculties is deeply in debt because it has been required to use its operating grants for capital purposes. This debt has the potential to affect the quality of teaching at what should be the premier university in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why has this occurred? It is my understanding that an arithmetical error made by the former Department of Employment, Education and Training has resulted in underpayments to the Australian National University. With regard to the capital roll&amp;hyphen;in component of that university's operating grants, there was no dispute between the ANU and the former

         DEET over the formula which was used to determine that university's capital roll&amp;hyphen;in component. DEET recognised that the ANU was different from other universities in that it consisted of two distinctly separate parts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ANU was originally established as a postgraduate institution to provide high level research and, similarly, high level postgraduate training. This part of the university is called the Institute of Advanced Studies. Later, the sector known as the Faculties was added to the university, providing opportunities for undergraduate studies similar to those provided in established universities throughout Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was little difficulty in applying the normal formula for capital roll&amp;hyphen;in for the Faculties because, to a large extent, it mirrored other universities. For the Institute of Advanced Studies, however, DEET took into account the fact that there were fewer students in the institute, because they are all postgraduates, but on a per student basis they required more resources and accommodation than did undergraduates. DEET therefore decided that a special loading should be provided to take into account the unique circumstances of the Institute of Advanced Studies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In making the total calculation of what should be the university's capital roll&amp;hyphen;in, however, a basic arithmetical error was made. I understand that DEETYA generally agrees that the ANU's capital roll&amp;hyphen;in for 1996 should be about $10.8 million, compared to the actual roll&amp;hyphen;in component of $7.197 million allocated to the ANU for this year. The actual shortfall because of this error is about $3.6 million for this year alone. The ANU has also lost funds in previous years because of this error. If this anomaly for 1996 is rectified and the ANU is reimbursed for those funds which it has also lost in the past, it would go a great way to reducing the debt within the Faculties and allowing proper maintenance on what should be an institution of which the Commonwealth can be proud.

         —Mr President, I rise in this debate on the adjournment to talk about the issue of job cuts. We have a government which went into the election on a platform of employment. In Canberra, they campaigned with the promise that there would be no more than 2,500 job cuts in the public sector, with all of them to be voluntary redundancies. We now find that the coalition had no intention of ever honouring that promise and that they are using what I call `Costello's con' to create a false justification for some very ruthless cuts.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is obvious that the Fightback agenda has re&amp;hyphen;emerged. The contents of the coalition's industrial relations bill prove that we are dealing with a government that has abandoned all commonsense when it comes to employment and managing employment relations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also have a government which, I believe, has abandoned any notional commitment to the welfare of individuals and families. This has been demonstrated no more clearly than here in Canberra where, through the current program of administrative cuts, thousands upon thousands of jobs in the public sector have gone.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When you cut that many jobs out of the public sector in Canberra there must be an effect on the private sector. The flow&amp;hyphen;on effect, be it in relation to consumer spending or real estate prices, is something that will do permanent damage to the local economy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact that these cuts cannot be justified in any honest or sensible way emphasises the personal trauma felt by those who are now unemployed as a direct result of the coalition's actions. It makes it that much worse for those individuals and their families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to put on record the cuts to date, as far as I have been able to ascertain them, using actual job numbers, not statistics. We are talking about individuals, and for every
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         individual who has been put out of work as a result of these unjustifiable cuts, anyone who has contact with those individuals—children, parents, whole families—is also affected. The coalition is willingly and knowingly putting people out of work, and that is just not acceptable in any way, shape or form.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let's look at the cuts department by department: 1,400 in Treasury and its various agencies; Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's, 220 people out of work; Communications and the Arts, 20&amp;hyphen;plus; Environment, Sport and Territories, around 240; DEETYA, around the 1,800 mark, which is 1,800 families affected; Defence, 1,200 mooted civilian personnel cuts; Finance, 150; Administrative Services, close to 500; Foreign Affairs and Trade, 70; Health and Family Services, over 500; Veterans' Affairs, close to 100; Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, over 200 people; Industrial Relations, around 300; Industry, Science and Tourism, 460; Primary Industries and Energy, 285; Prime Minister and Cabinet, close to 500 people; Social Security, 1,300 families affected by these cuts; and Transport and Regional Development, around 30. That comes to a total of well over 9,000 individuals who will lose their jobs as a result of these cuts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have to add that this situation is not confined to Canberra; it is right around the country. We are affected hugely here in Canberra because of the concentration of departments but the effects will be felt right around the nation. It will be felt not only by people directly affected and their families but also by those Australians who will suffer a loss in services as a result of those job cuts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The time has come for this government to accept full responsibility for the hardship that they are directly causing these individuals. They need to stand up and be honest about their imaginary justification for these cuts. We
       </para>
       <break page="1090" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para>
         are dealing with a government with no regard for individuals and their families, no regard for the rights of everyone to employment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With this program of cuts, and with the industrial relations bill and other measures, we are seeing a total lapse in commonsense about how Australians operate—how we are and what we are. We are a nation of proud working people. We do not expect a government, especially one elected on a platform of making employment the No. 1 priority, to turn turkey and do us over by putting us out of work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to congratulate everyone who has been putting up a fight over these cuts, particularly those who attended the rally in Canberra organised by the CPSU. Those people need to know that there are many others not affected by the job cuts who still care about what is happening—they care about them and their families' welfare, and will join with them in their struggle for dignity, for jobs and the right to earn a decent living.

       (1) No. Under its terms of reference GMAC does not `approve' the release of genetically manipulated organisms (GMOs).

       Statutory responsibility for approving the release of GMOs rests with State and Commonwealth Government agencies, depending on the end&amp;hyphen;use proposed for the product. For example, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals would be responsible for approving the release of a GMO that had pesticidal properties, or acted as a vaccine in animals; the Therapeutic Goods Administration would be responsible for approving the use of a GMO as a vaccine in humans; the National Food Authority would be responsible for approving a genetically manipulated novel food.

       (3) As stated in (1), GMAC does not approve the release of GMOs. However, many of the GMOs GMAC has assessed contain `marker' genes encoding resistance to antibiotics; these genes allow selection of the transgenic organisms from non&amp;hyphen;transgenic organisms. The antibiotic resistance genes are those for tetracycline, kanamycin, neomycin, rifampicin, spectinomycin and streptomycin. The organisms containing these genes are plants and microorganisms.

       Most of the organisms containing antibiotic resistance genes that have been reviewed by GMAC have been plants.

       (8) The proposal was not considered to pose a public health risk and so public health authorities were not consulted.

       (9) GMAC assessed this proposal as not posing significant risks because many precautions were in place to safeguard against accidental release of the organism. However, an eventual general release of the genetically modified Pseudomonas fluorescens would pose issues different from those in this trial. These issues would be considered as part of any risk assessment process for a general release. GMAC consults with public health officials when a proposed release might have significant public health consequences. I have asked GMAC to continue to ensure that it consults in this way so that public health interests are given the fullest consideration.
