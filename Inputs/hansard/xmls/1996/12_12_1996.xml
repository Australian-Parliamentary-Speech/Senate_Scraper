        In my August ministerial statement, Reforming Employment Assistance—Helping Australians into Real Jobs, I outlined the government's vision for the most radical changes to employment services since the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1946. Since the release of that statement, the government has undertaken extensive consultations about the government's proposals with interested groups in the community across Australia.

        In this sitting I am introducing a package of legislation to provide the statutory framework for implementing the government's reforms to employment services.

        This package of legislation would provide for reforming employment services in a way which is largely consistent with the feedback we have had from the community in that consultation process.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Fisheries Administration Act and the Fisheries Management Act came into effect in February 1992 and the proposed amendments seek to correct minor anomalies in them that have been identified over the last 4 years, streamline their administration and generally improve the efficiency of fisheries management.

        As far as the Fisheries Management Act is concerned, one of the most significant amendments gives effect to the government's policy announced before the last election to provide greater security of long term access to fisheries. The purpose of these amendment is to protect the fishing industry against changes in government or administrative policy which the revocation of management plans might otherwise entail. This will give greater security of investment to both fishing operators and financiers. Under the amendments, where a management plan for a fishery is revoked, any subsequent plan that covers all or part of that fishery must provide that holders of statutory fishing rights at the time of the revocation will have first option on a proportional basis to similar rights granted under that subsequent plan.

        Other amendments to the management act seek to improve arrangements for the registration of interests and dealings in statutory fishing rights and administrative arrangements in respect of fisheries which are managed by a fisheries joint authority under commonwealth law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Fisheries joint authorities provide one type of arrangement for achieving co-operation between the commonwealth, the states and the northern territory in the management of fisheries. Joint authorities are bodies consisting of commonwealth and state or territory ministers responsible for fisheries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As things stand, the ministers in the joint authority may delegate powers to AFMA, but AFMA has no intrinsic powers in the management of joint authority fisheries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The philosophy of the management act is to divorce the commonwealth minister from day-to-day management decisions and, to this end, the primary function of the minister in relation to commonwealth fisheries is to accept plans of management determined by AFMA. This is not the case with joint authority fisheries and, after due consultation with the states, the amendments seek to rectify this anomaly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill therefore amends the management act to create the same relationship between AFMA and joint authorities as it has with the commonwealth minister in-respect of other commonwealth-managed fisheries.

        One of these amendments relates to the powers of officers to enter land or premises specified in a fish receiver permit. Currently, an officer may enter such premises only with the consent of the holder of the fish receiver permit or under a warrant.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is proposed to amend the act to enable officers to enter premises subject to a fish receiver permit for monitoring purposes at any time without the requirement for either consent or warrant and to secure property pending the obtaining of a warrant. However, the power to seize property or documents will still be conditional on the officer having a warrant.

        Tn other circumstances, where a warrant is required for a search to be conducted, there has been criticism that the obtaining of warrants under section 85 of the management act is cumbersome compared to obtaining warrants under the Crimes Act 1914.

        Section 95 provides for various offences which, with the exception of offences relating to foreign boats, are dealt with summarily and attract maximum fines of $10,000. This level off penalty is inadequate when the commission of single offences can net the offender in excess of $100,000.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Amendments to section 95 increase the level of penalties, those currently at $10,000 to $25,000, those currently at $5,000 to $12,500 and those currently at $2,000 to $5,000. Maximum fines applicable to certain offences involving the use of foreign boats are set at $50,000 and there is no intention to raise these penalties. However, in line with commonwealth criminal law policy as expressed in the crimes act, opportunity is taken to express all penalties as penalty units, currently with the value of $100 per unit. This enables a change to the unit value in the crimes act to have effect in all commonwealth legislation in which penalties are expressed in these units.

        The bill proposes a number of amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to correct drafting errors, remove redundant provisions and effect a number of substantive changes. In particular, the bill makes changes to s.38J to clarify upon whom obligations are imposed in relation to the discharge of waste in the Marine Park, with particular application to Defence vessels and aircraft, to avoid an unintended result. Presently, discharges from Defence vessels and aircraft for the purposes of combating pollution incidents or saving lives are not lawful under the operation of s.38J. The provisions in this section were originally not intended to apply to Defence vessels and aircraft, because their activities are closely controlled by Marine Park Zoning plans. The correction of this anomaly will not have an adverse effect on the Park itself. The Zoning Plans allow for the conduct of defence operations in the Park, subject to the reasonable directions of the Marine Park Authority. The Marine Park Authority has worked closely with the Australian Defence Force on matters concerning the Marine Park. This means for example that the Navy's operational guidelines dealing with discharges of waste exceed the standards required of tourism operators. In addition, the Royal Australian Navy has spent around $50 million upgrading existing shipping to meet the requirements of Annex 4 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 known as the MARPOL Convention, even though the element of the MARPOL Convention which deals with the discharge of sewage is not yet in force internationally. Given that the Zoning Plans are binding on the Commonwealth, there is already sufficient control over discharges from Defence vessels and aircraft, justifying their exemption from s.38J.

       In moving these two motions together, and recognising that there is only 10 minutes for my contribution this morning, I say that the opposition sees these two government proposals as indicative of the mean spirited approach they are taking to students in the whole education sector. We are talking here of proposals such as these coming as part of a package of an attack on the education sector, which has led to some $1.9 billion in cuts and, in respect of students, some $800 million being taken out of their pockets over a short period.
      </para>

       What the government has sought to do by the regulations that are subject to the disallowance is to increase the age of independence and, in doing so, to reverse an important reform of the previous government which
       <break page="7270" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        brought the age down from 25 to 22 in three annual steps starting in 1992. The presumption that people up to their mid&amp;hyphen;20s have a relationship of financial dependence on their parents is patently untenable. Before we reduced the age limit, it was very much one of the two top priorities of student organisations in their annual budget submissions. To reverse it now, to try to argue that students in their mid-20s should be presumed to have a financial relationship of dependency on their parents, is patently untenable.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What we have here, basically, essentially and starkly, is a grab for cash. It is a baseless excuse to try to argue that students are dependent. The real agenda here can be exposed to be the fact that the original decision in the budget papers would have saved some $242 million from students' pockets over the course of the forward estimates. That decision has been amended slightly. What we are talking about now is savings of some $210 million through the forward estimates.

       The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), in the budget statement, referred to this measure targeting the well&amp;hyphen;off families. This is double speak. It comes from the minister for double speak. Essentially, the families we are talking about here are families that have very modest incomes. Remember, Austudy starts to taper off at a joint family income of some $22,650.

       We are also talking here of a growing number of people who can be classified as being Howard's losers. Some 14,000 people will have their payments reduced and some 12,000 will become totally ineligible for payments. So it is a grab for cash. No matter how the minister tries to justify it, no matter how she tries to describe it, no matter what language is used in the budget statements in terms of targeting well&amp;hyphen;off families, we are talking here of ripping some $210 million from students on the pretence that they should be presumed to be financially dependent on their parents until they are in their mid-20s.

       The second motion goes to regulations which are, I think, particularly mean spirited and particularly devastating in their impact. I have had a number of students come to see me over my years as a member of parliament—students who cannot live at home, students who have been forced out of their homes for one reason or another, and students who are very keen and have been very keen to continue with their secondary education.

       You get some real heart wrenching cases. Time and time again, you look at their statistics, you look at their income, you look at what they need to keep them at school, what they need to basically realise their ambitions of finishing year 12 and going on thereafter, and quite often it is a little amount of assistance that is needed to either buy the books or give them the capacity to stay at school. If they do not get that assistance, they are forced into taking unemployment benefits or they are forced into leaving school and seeking work.

      <para first-indent="16">
       It is a vicious circle that they find themselves in. Quite often, I have gone through situations with young people and tried to work out with them their income and how we can top up that income. What the previous government did was to introduce a schooling incidentals allowance. It is an allowance which is paid to homeless secondary students, an allowance which cost some $11 million over four forward estimate years, which is what we are arguing about here, and a measure which is assisting some 8,500 students—students living basically on the breadline. What the government is seeking to do is to take away this financial assistance of some $300, payable at the beginning of each year, to help homeless Austudy and Abstudy students complete their secondary education by assisting with such expenses as books, equipment and course costs.

       This measure was going to have full effect from the beginning of this year. It is obviously justified as a measure that helps young people at critical times. It is much more important to them than it is to the budget revenue outlays. It is much more important

        for individual students. I just cannot understand the logic behind taking this particular measure away from young people, who find it quite critical. The government says that it will be abolished subsequent to a review of 1995-96 budget measures. But there really has not been a comprehensive review about this. Once again, the minister for double speak is coming in here and saying, `Well, we have reviewed it and it should go.'

       In essence, we are talking about depriving people of assistance—people who critically need it. We are also talking about a self-defeating measure. You force kids out of school, they have to go on unemployment benefits, they have to seek work and at the end of the day it costs government more by withdrawing this sort of measure. This is the same group that will be hit by another exceptionally mean budget measure—that is, the cessation of case management of secondary students who are on the student homeless rate of Austudy or Abstudy. That measures saves $14&amp;half; million. The government says, `Oh no, we are going to maintain or re-establish the job placement employment training program. That will cost us $11 million.' You are still talking about a big reduction of funds—some 25 per cent—as opposed to the previous measure that was in place.

       I just cannot work out how a minister for education can deprive young people—people on the borderline—of assistance in this particular instance. Case management of young students is basically geared towards achieving family reconciliation, assistance to them and working out their particular needs. That measure has gone. With it has gone the supplementary measure, which is quite critical. We are talking here of $11 million over the forward estimate years. As I said, it means nothing in terms of the budget bottom line but it means a hell of a lot to young people who are forced to make hard decisions based on, quite often, less than $100 that they need to keep them at school.

        —The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motions put forward by the opposition today. On many occasions we have expressed our concerns and our opposition to the increase in the independent rate age—that is, from 22 years to 25 years. Senator Bolkus is quite right—the matter of the age at which students are eligible for the Austudy independent rate has been one of the top priorities for student organisations for many years. Indeed, I remember lobbying Senator Bolkus on this very issue quite a few years ago as a student. The ALP certainly took its time to reduce the age of eligibility. It had actually reached a point where it was 22 years. We supported that, although we continue to have concerns about the lack of parity between the Austudy benefits level and that of unemployment benefits.

       The Democrats also oppose what Senator Bolkus has described as a mean-spirited measure, but certainly one that we consider quite callous—that is, the proposal by this government to remove the schooling incidentals allowance. It was only introduced this year, providing $300 to secondary school students receiving the homeless independent rate of Austudy. Senator Bolkus pointed out that this was a measure designed to assist students in that category, with the purchase of books and equipment.

       one that people in this place may be aware of—that was released this week.

This report called on schools and governments to become more caring institutions. Certainly that caring element is not reflected in the measures before us proposed

       The removal of a one-off grant—$300—for books, paper and all the other requirements that a student needs at the beginning of the school year, we consider quite miserly and mean-spirited. It is certainly not the act of a caring institution. In light of the radical and unfair changes to the higher education sector—the changes that passed this place within the past week—we must remember that student financial assistance, be it in the form of Austudy, Abstudy or TEAS, its predecessor, has proven that it has been shown to be a key factor in ensuring that traditionally disadvantaged groups, particularly young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, have had a shot at education, at a TAFE level, at secondary school and at a tertiary level.

       What we are talking about here is something quite fundamental to ensuring a degree of access and equity in our higher education and secondary school systems. We are talking about removing one of the very props that assist those students to enter education at a number of levels. We consider the removal of the schooling incidentals allowance, combined with the increase in the independent rate age, to be two promises not only that the coalition has broken but ones that will have a devastating impact on current students as well as aspiring students. It is worth remembering that the coalition government went to the last election promising that they would maintain Austudy. They certainly made a lot of promises in the education sector, which have since been broken. I plead with the government that this is one area in which you should certainly not be breaking those promises.

        Again I ask the minister—this is a question I have asked before and in estimate committee hearings—is it still the case that the eligibility for the independent rate will be assessed at the point of enrolment?

I have had no satisfactory answer to that question.

We can also assume that a substantial proportion of the 16,269 students over 25 years of age in 1996 and who started their course prior to turning 25 would be deemed still dependent on their parents' income under the proposed new rules.

She is going to ensure that men are also recognised as being unable to think for themselves, act for themselves and be independent until they get to the age of 31 or 32; they are still tied to the parents' strings at home and should not be getting any recognition for independent means or assistance to be independent.

They have often lost contact with or the support of parents and frequently have come from abusive households. They are out on the streets or they are certainly away from the supportive family background that gives people the full right to opportunity.

        The government—at the same time it was considering cutting this paltry $2.8 million per annum spending in the interests of that $10 billion black hole that Senator Vanstone speaks about so much—was also considering cutting $800 million a year out of tax rebates to the major mining companies like BHP, MIM and CRA. That is the diesel fuel rebate. The miners did have access to this place. They were able to twig the ear of a compliant government. They got their $800 million a year restored. For what?

This allowance is a one&amp;hyphen;off payment of $300—the princely sum of $300. What is this money used for? It is payable to secondary students who are receiving the homeless independent rate of Austudy—that is, they are unable to live at home with their parents, they are orphans, refugees or state wards, or have parents who cannot exercise parenting responsibility.

About 12,000 people—nearly 6,000 females and 6,000 males—will also lose benefits. This device is aimed at attracting savings of $62 million in the first year.

In the scheme of a budget which is seeking to take some $4.2 billion out of this portfolio, it might be insignificant. But, for the individuals, I think you can say it is very significant. I repeat that we are talking about $300 payable to secondary students receiving the homeless independent allowance—that is, they are unable to live at home with their parents, they are orphans, refugees or state wards, or have parents who cannot exercise proper parenting responsibilities. This $300 is used for school books, equipment and other educational expenses. In the scheme of things I do not think this government is going to be bankrupted. I do not think the budget is going to be blown apart if the Senate accepts these propositions. But, for the individuals, it means a considerable amount.

       I want to draw attention to the annual report. The annual report indicates that the proportion of dependent beneficiaries on low incomes is some 96 per cent of dependent Austudy beneficiaries. Some 96 per cent of persons are on low incomes. The number of beneficiaries whose family incomes are in the lowest 40 per cent of all Australians are on special assessments. These are not necessarily wealthy people.

Amongst these expectations is the expectation they are entitled to have: that the government will provide assistance to them in the form of decent educational facilities so that they can be active participatory members of our community. In turn, they give back huge benefits to our society by their capacity to contribute fully when they are fully trained and skilled. I think it is wrong to suggest that persons who are 25 years of age have to be dependent on their parents.

       The Greens disagree with raising the age of independence back up to 25. It was 25, however, and it has been progressively falling to 22. We support 18 as an end goal in the definition of independence. We do not believe that anyone who is 22 or 25 and is independent should be deemed to be on their parents' income. The notion is ridiculous. It smacks of compulsory families—I think that has been the theme of the budget in general—and increases the financial burden of children on parents.

       The government has not been honest in saying that 25 is the top end of the age of independence, because the definition is applied to age upon initial enrolment.

It is a sad state of affairs when the government has to make up a whole lot of rubbish about rorting rich families just to cover up its massive Austudy cut to needy families.

        —As I understand the budget, the government has taken this action as part of its budget measures. My approach to budget measures is that of course the Senate should not be merely obstructive, but that we should exercise our functions of scrutiny and review—this is what we are doing now—and that certain principles should be applied. Once those principles are applied to the budget decisions, if those budget decisions conflict with those principles, then of course the principles should prevail.

       Having got that off my chest, I would like to simply say that there are certain principles which are offended by this particular measure. I will deal firstly with the question of raising the age of independence from 22 to 25. That assumes that the parents will be paying for the cost of the education of those persons from 22 to 25 years of age. The government assumes that, but the taxation department does not assume that. The taxation department assumes that the parents pay not one cent for those students—not one cent. That is a matter of considerable concern to me.

       Indeed, I remind the chamber that, at the end of the higher education debate, it was a principle that I was concerned with as well, only on that occasion the principle was that expenditure on self&amp;hyphen;education should be tax deductible. I remind the chamber that everybody—except Senator Colston—voted against that matter. Had the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Australian Labor Party voted for it—had that principle been applied—the burden on tertiary students and graduates who had become eligible for repayments would have been reduced by a third.
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Now you come into this chamber and virtually support the principle by saying that you propose to disallow the government's proposal, based on the assumption that the parents have to pick up the tab. But, as I have said, the taxation department does not make that assumption.
        <break page="7278" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         The government should have a look at this. It should realise that its tax threshold ceases to apply to people at the age of 18. I applaud the government for its actions on the family tax initiative, but the tax threshold for children still ceases at age 18. So it is even more important for the government to relook at this matter.

       In addition to that issue, it is very important for the government to look at the sibling concession, which was abolished by the previous government.

       Take the example of a family with three children in tertiary education who are receiving Austudy, and the parents' income is getting close to the stage where it would be affected. Under those circumstances, the concessional rate was 25c for every dollar earned by either of the parents, so the Austudy would have been reduced by 75c. That was the result of tightening the Austudy income test for families by removing the sibling concession, which was done in 1992. The effect was that, if you had three children on Austudy, you would have lost three times 25c—which equals 75c—in Austudy for every dollar earned by a parent, either by the primary earner or by the secondary earner in the family.

       That is the substance of the issue that goes to the community at large, that a family such as that would in fact be able to get Austudy in the absence of the actual means test.

       I have a couple of points to make. Caring and listening is what you assert to be, but there is nothing caring and listening about
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        these particular proposals. One thing about all programs, whether it is this one or any other, is if you look at the exception and the unintended consequences and base your policy on them, you will have no programs at all. If you look at the assistance that Senator Newman's husband might be getting, for instance, and pay to everyone else income support on the basis of that, you could deprive everyone across the country. What you have to do is look at the areas of need and, if there are unintended consequences like Melanie Howard getting benefit, it is very easy to fix that up. Just ring her father and say, `Listen, your daughter should not be on it.' See what answer you get.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We really need to look at those areas of need. As Senator Carr pointed out very succinctly earlier, if you look at the number of dependent Austudy beneficiaries on low incomes, you are talking about people who are basically in the lowest 40 per cent of all Australian family incomes as being those targeted by Austudy assistance. For instance, 96 per cent in 1995-96 was the proportion of dependent beneficiaries on low incomes. They are the sorts of people these programs are targeted at. This 96 per cent of the 275,000 or so are the ones that you will deprive of assistance, not the odd Bond daughter or Melanie Howard. You could easily target them.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In terms of targeting, let us also remember that Austudy starts to taper off at a joint family income of $22,650. It would be very hard for Melanie Howard, given her stated dependence, to avoid that particular provision. Mention was also made of the JPET scheme. The argument used by Senator Vanstone is a bit bogus. That scheme has been reintroduced, and it has taken the place of a scheme which cost a lot more money and which provided case management, individual student by individual student, to basically assist them and give them some career support. To argue that that is a subsidy I think is inadequate.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In terms of the incidental allowance, I have listened to the debate this morning very closely. No-one has come up with an argument against the allowance. Senator Harradine has suggested that there are other people in

        need who could also be assisted by a similar scheme but no-one has actually put forward any evidence to say that the allowance is not assisting students who are in a situation of need and crisis. So there is an argument for perhaps extending it but not an argument for doing away with this particular scheme as it now operates.

This was at a time when company tax was paid at 49c. Average tax paid per person in this category dropped by 70 per cent—and this was because dividend income was effectively tax-free income.

The bill implements the coalition's election commitment to double the FBT minor benefits exemption to $100.

        The government has delivered on its election commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from Labor's eight per cent to six per cent. The superannuation contribution surcharge will make the superannuation system more equitable for all Australians while ensuring that superannuation remains an attractive option. I understand the Labor Party supports the concept of the surcharge.

        Senator Sherry made comments on debt forgiveness. I wish to make two brief comments on his remarks. Labor did announce this measure in the 1995 budget. Legislation was not introduced until November 1995, and the bill lapsed because of the election. The provisions were incomplete. We did not delay the measures. The measure was to commence on 9 May; however, the bill containing those measures lapsed. The change of government created a situation of uncertainty, given that full details of the new rules were not available. In response to these business concerns, we decided to make the rules apply prospectively.

        In addition, Senator Margetts raised some issues in relation to the use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes. I think Senator Margetts has a copy of the letter that we have received from the Privacy Commissioner on that issue. We have consulted widely with the Privacy Commissioner. The purposes for which the tax file numbers can be used are limited to locating, identifying, amalgamating and transferring superannuation accounts. Some of those issues may be explored further in the committee stage.

        The central objection to an AMT is that it would impair equity and efficiency in the taxation of companies. For example, all deductions, including carry-forward losses, allowances, rebates and other concessions available to companies are deliberate policies, the product of tax laws considered and passed by parliament. If parliament were to leave those tax laws as they are but at an AMT, the availability of concessions would be determined arbitrarily. A company's tax assessment would not be determined by anything which could specifically entitle it to the concessions but by the operation of an arbitrary ratio. In short, an AMT would be an arbitrary and unpredictable limit on the availability of tax concessions.

        I have actually spoken about this amendment to a certain extent. Our amendment effectively changes the dividend imputation from 100 per cent to 50 per cent. This is worked out by a formula in section 160AQT. That relates to the assessable income related to franked dividends. A 50 per cent imputation is arrived at by halving the franked amount in the formula.

While the total income in the over $500,000 bracket grew by 13 times, the average tax paid per person in this category dropped by 70 per cent. This is because the dividend income was effectively tax free. In the following year the company tax dropped, so they got it both ways. The tax free status of dividends ended and these people, who were very wealthy by any standards, suddenly shifted their income base and dividend income dropped back to around 12 times the pre-imputation levels while tax paid per person more than doubled.

        We believe that dividend imputation results in a massive benefit for the wealthy. With this amendment, as with my earlier one, I seek to address this balance. One hundred per cent dividend imputation is not fair, just or equitable. It is entirely anti-progressive and has been used as a rort as much as any other legal means of tax minimisation. I would rather see this rort closed, since it is aimed at the top end of income earners. I would rather see this than some of the mean spirited cuts that have been made as a result of this budget because the government said they had no choice. Well, they do have a choice, and so do the opposition. In this sense we are giving that choice to the Senate. I urge the Senate to support this amendment.

         —Labor will not be supporting the amendment moved by the Greens to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. Currently, under existing tax law, companies can pass on the full benefit of having paid tax on company benefits by way of franking credits on dividend distributions to their shareholders. This was introduced by Labor to end what was, in effect, the double taxation of company dividends. The Greens amendment could see this effectively halved.

        One important point to make about such a move is that it would have a very significant effect on superannuation funds and, therefore, on superannuation fund beneficiaries. Many superannuation funds invest in companies that pay franked dividends in order to take advantage of the franking credits. According to the tax statistics of 1993-94, super funds receive $1.7 billion in gross dividends and claimed $548 million in franking credits to help offset the payment of the tax on superannuation fund earnings, which is entirely legitimate.

         Under this proposal, there would be a shift of hundreds of millions of dollars from the accounts of superannuation fund members into the government tax collection coffers. We believe that the more money people can save for their retirement, the better off they are. Unfortunately, this amendment would only undermine the savings of superannuation fund beneficiaries by shifting money from their accounts into Treasury.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not the only reason why we oppose this amendment. I just highlight that as an undesirable consequence of Senator Margetts's amendment. The other reason, broadly, is that we do not believe it is appropriate to significantly write the tax acts in an unconsidered way in dealing with an omnibus taxation laws amendment bill, which is what this is. It is a very inappropriate manner in which to consider what are very important taxation measures. For those reasons, we will not be supporting the amendment.

        The amendment moved by Senator Margetts would halve the imputation or the franking rebate available to resident individuals and superannuation funds for franked dividends. Senator Margetts would be aware, as would Senator Kernot, that the dividend imputation system removes the double taxation of company income that applied under the classical
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         system of company taxation. Full imputation represents an equitable rather than a concessional treatment of dividend income by ensuring that in most cases company income distributed to resident shareholders bears the same total tax as other forms of income.

       <para first-indent="16">
        A substantial behavioural response to the introduction of partial imputation would be likely, which would erode some of the revenue gained from such a measure. Companies would obviously look for tax minimisation and tax shifting opportunities because of the reduction in franked dividends to shareholders compared with the situation under full imputation where they may well retain rather than distribute profits. The proposed amendments would reduce the franking rebate available to residents by not affecting non&amp;hyphen;residents, who would continue to be exempt from dividend withholding tax on franked dividends.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The substance of the argument of Senator Margetts and Senator Kernot—and I notice that Senator Kernot is not supporting the amendment, but she clearly has some sympathy for the sorts of views that were put forward by Senator Margetts—seems to be based on the assumption that the dividend imputation only has impact on high income earners.

        Many taxpayers with low or middle incomes have shareholdings in an indirect form, as Senator Sherry said, through superannuation and life insurance or have shares in companies which have undertaken large floats with widespread participation by the public—for example, Woolworths, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. A move to partial imputation would diminish taxpayers' effective returns from these sources. We will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Margetts.

         —Senator Kernot, I have looked towards my advisers to see whether I can give any further comment on the figures that you have put before the committee. I do not have that advice available to me, but this debate will continue. I think that we will have to agree to differ on this issue. As I have said, the divided imputation system removes the double taxation of company income that previously applied. The government supports the current system.

          this time. We have two major concerns on the issue, and they have not been addressed. The first is the slippery notion of `voluntary', used by the government. When you say, `You don't need to give the number but, if you don't, you'll be taxed at the highest marginal rate of 47 per cent,' this may fulfil guidelines, but it is hardly voluntary in the ordinary meaning of the term. In fact, it probably fits the legal definition of coercion.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We are particularly concerned that proposed section 299Q would assume that employees have agreed to provide a tax file number when their employer provides it. When we brought this up with government advisers, the response was that 299P allows the commissioner to set an approved manner for quoting tax file numbers, and that this would or could require employee permission. We have got no assurance that it will. There was some indication that there would be a form to fill in, but that is not part of this bill, obviously.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are also worried that the rhetoric of permission may be legally fulfilled by a note on a form saying that, in supplying an employer a tax file number `voluntarily', an employee is taken to have authorised the employer to pass that tax file number on to the superannuation fund. Legally, there may be an implication that the employee, having read this note, can decide to prevent the employer from passing on the number to a superannuation fund by refusing to supply it to the employer, and of course paying punitive tax.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have suggested a statement that there will be a separate line requiring a separate signature, without which the employer is not authorised to pass on a tax file number to a superannuation fund. We have just received a draft version of such a form specifically authorising an employer to pass on a tax file number to a superannuation company. I was going to seek leave to table it, but I guess the government is in a better position to table it than I am. Perhaps the government could table it. If I could get an assurance that such a form will be provided, this may go part way to addressing my concerns.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="7292" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The second issue is that access to tax file number data goes well beyond what is re quired. I understand that there are restrictions on using data for other purposes, but I cannot see why superannuation funds even need access to non&amp;hyphen;relevant information included in the tax file number database. It would seem a reasonably simple matter to provide some sort of filter so that the Australian Taxation Office makes available only relevant information—that is, address, phone number and information about other superannuation fund moneys. No other information should really be necessary. No other information should really be accessible to the commercial sector. If we could get an assurance that measures would be put in place to prevent access by superannuation funds to other information, it would go some way to addressing our concerns, although we retain major reservations.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The issue at stake is that tax file numbers are increasingly used to collect and integrate a broad range of information, including economic information about major purchases, bank accounts, wages, superannuation and so on. It includes information from social security. Since anyone receiving family payment of home child&amp;hyphen;care allowance—which is a broad cross&amp;hyphen;section of the population—receive it from Social Security, those with access to the tax file number database have access not only to existing commercial and economic information, but a range of personal information as well.

        I can see why there is a greater pressure on various departments to have access to this number, but it was never said to be designed for this purpose. It certainly was not what Mr Keating said when he introduced it. He said that this would not be a de facto Australia card. Guess what? That is exactly what it is becoming.

Senator Margetts raised a number of questions. I will respond to those. I think one of the questions was why tax file numbers are required. They are required for four reasons: firstly, to reduce the numbers of loss beneficiaries in the superannuation system; secondly, to reduce

When they cannot find a job because there are no jobs to find, they will be subject to hoops and hurdles to get the income support they and their families need. In a decent society like ours, this is not acceptable.

        These bills seek to give effect to almost all of the social security measures—largely harsh ones—announced by the coalition government in the 1996 budget. If passed, they will see the safety net that was built and strengthened by Labor in government seriously compromised. They go a long way in turning our social security safety net into a social security tightrope.

        The overwhelming majority of these arise not from good policy but rather from an ideological zeal on the part of the government to slash government spending. These measures are a long way from meeting the coalition's election promises. These bills are another demonstration of the coalition's betrayal of the Australian people. They have broken promises and revealed their true colours on so many issues of importance to Australians.

        Labor's response to this legislation and, indeed, to all the measures announced in the 1996-97 budget is based on how the measures weigh up against three principles: does a measure betray a promise, is it equitable and does it contribute to national savings? When we looked at these bills in detail, we discovered that in a great many respects the proposed legislation falls sadly short of meeting these three principles. It does betray many promises; it is inequitable; and some of the measures proposed will certainly not contribute to national savings.

Schedule 3 of the budget and other measures bill seeks to abolish the minimum rate of payment to under&amp;hyphen;18-year-old sickness allowance, newstart allowance and youth training allowance recipients. The Labor Party will be opposing the measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. The government is proposing to introduce a youth allowance from January 1998, merging all major forms of income support for young people.

Abolishing the minimum rate of youth training allowance and cutting under&amp;hyphen;18&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds off payments on the basis of parents' income opens the door to doing the same for young people up to 25 years of age.

The requirement to provide proof of an attempt to rectify a situation with the employer where the work conditions constitute a risk to health or safety, self-employment or a move away from home and communities to look for a job which may not exist places unreasonable obligations on job seekers to negotiate with prospective employers despite their not having the knowledge, skills, confidence or capacity to do so.

        People will have to use their savings before qualifying for an unemployment payment. The conditions on receiving a payment will be substantially tightened.

And all this is set against a background of $1.8 billion over the next four years being cut from Labor market programs; programs designed to help the unemployed return to the work force. In other words, as a direct result of government policy, it is going to be harder to get an unemployment allowance, harder to stay on that allowance and harder to get off the allowance and back into full-time work.

He believes that we are adopting a system that divides middle income earners and the unemployed as the deserving verses the undeserving poor; those in true need and those not quite in need; those that we should support wholeheartedly and those we should be suspicious of.

         A 1994 article by community lawyer Jude McCulloch noted that despite these figures the policing of social security recipients is far stronger than that for doctors. McCulloch made a number of observations. Firstly, the system of paying Medicare claims to doctors remains essentially an honour based self&amp;hyphen;assessment scheme, while Social Security utilises stringent personal identification requirements, data matching between government departments, regular customer reviews and other compliance measures.

         Secondly, while DSS seeks prosecutions through the courts for all those committing welfare fraud, doctors are more likely to be required to undertake counselling and conciliation by a group of their peers. In 1991-92 DSS undertook more than 2&amp;half; million reviews and prosecuted more than 2,000 people. In that same year, despite the enormous amount lost through Medicare overservicing, just four doctors were prosecuted. Finally, while little public attention has been devoted to fraud by doctors the concerns about social security fraud have in McCulloch's words `taken on the dimensions of a moral panic.'

Social security recipients are `rorters' and `cheats' while doctors have merely been `practising inappropriately'. Regrettably, what we are seeing is a hardening of the community's attitude to social security recipients and an encouragement of the suspicion of the unemployed about which Robert Fitzgerald spoke. Genuine social security recipients are being made to feel that they are a drain on the community, and there is little acknowledgment that many of them are out of work due to circumstances over which they have no control.

         It is in this climate that the government has introduced the bills we are looking at today. They are bills that will give the department the power to force the unemployed to move to another town or lose their payment; prevent around 2,500 widows each year from receiving the widows pension; impose grossly unfair penalties on unemployed people who fall foul of the rules; force disabled people on to

         The Democrats are disappointed to see this legislation  brought on. We totally reject the philosophy which underlies it. It is a philosophy that says it is everyone for themselves and, if you are unemployed, you deserve to do it tough. It is a philosophy that says that unemployment is the fault of the individual, that there are jobs and that unemployed people simply need to be pushed harder to look. It also says that people should be reduced to poverty before the government has any obligation to support them. The Democrats will not be supporting the tougher aspect of these bills.

         I will finish with an analogy. One thing that this government has done in order to support its attack on the poor is to employ scapegoats. I will tell the Senate where the word `scapegoat' comes from. It comes out of the ancient Hebrew sacrificial system. The scapegoat was a real goat. The goat was paraded in front of the assembled nation and before the people. It was then identified by the high priest laying his hands on its head. The confession of every sin of all the people was then transferred to the goat so that the people were thereby absolved of their sin. The goat was then taken into the desert and released. The fate of the goat was of no further concern to the people. The idea was that it should never return.

          It is easy to see how that idea was adopted and adapted to become part of the English language and culture. Other cultures have similar concepts. In our culture, a scapegoat is one who is identified in the mind of the community as a focus for all that is wrong in society. That person is vilified as one to whom blame for all the community's ills should be attributed. The community is thereby absolved of responsibility and guilt. The scapegoat is in a position of weakness and, therefore, has no power to resist. It is driven out to the edges of society, where what happens to it is of no further concern to the community. All sense of guilt for the scape goat as a victim is transferred from the community to the scapegoat as the burden bearer for the community's sins. This government has clearly identified the poor as the scapegoat that it will drive to the outer edges of this nation.

They used to sit on the opposite side here, you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, and say that the Keating government was increasing the gap between rich and poor, and so it was, because it was set down this economic rationalist pathway. The parameters showed that, and the then opposition—the coalition—were able to bring out the figures. Having complained about that direction being taken, what do they do when they get into government? They tread on the accelerator. They move to turboprop and they will be moving to jet thrust in the future where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the social cohesion that we have taken for granted in this country gets swept away as we move to an American style social set&amp;hyphen;up where there will be people begging on the streets.

They will have no income and they will be left to turn to neighbours, to friends and, the minister has said, to the Salvation Army. She is going to give more money to the Salvos and to other charitable groups to help with handouts to the new destitute that this government will create. The reality is that that is not going to cover the lot of them.

        Panhandling in the United States, where there are 35 million people living in poverty because of similar social attitudes to the one inherent in this legislation, is the better side of it. The worst side of it is the huge numbers of people breaking through windows, getting in back doors, invading other people's cars and stealing things, and creating a black market so that they can live. In New York, 25 per cent of the economy these days is black market, due to gangsterism and corruption, but also due to the fact that there are millions of people who just do not have enough money to make ends meet in increasingly expensive life circumstances.

         —This government's budget has been one of broken promises, betrayal and lies. Nowhere is this more demonstrated than in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill that is before the Senate today. Just three days before the election, the then shadow Minister for Employment, Training and Family Services, David Kemp, wrote to the Australian Early Childhood Association saying:

        There must be a lot of people out there in the community child&amp;hyphen;care sector who wonder very much about the real commitment of this government to what they call their mandate. Part of a mandate is not only carrying out actions that you have promised and were

        The government's first budget has cut more than half a billion dollars from child care over the next four years. That is really a tragic situation. This includes the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres, cuts to child-care assistance, means testing of the child-care cash rebate and the withdrawal of funding for 5,500 new community based centres that were scheduled to be built in the next couple of years.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government says that it has cut the operational subsidy to put the private sector on the same footing as community based child-care centres. But the fact is that all over Australia local government bodies are finding that they have less money to provide the child-care places than they had before. Just as one example, Gosford City Council wrote to me when they first became aware of this issue and said that, for their seven long day child&amp;hyphen;care centres, they will lose $287,000 each year from the taking away of this operational subsidy. This is repeated over and over again in each local government area across Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There were 380 submissions to the community affairs committee which examined this legislation, and only five argued for the abolition of the operational subsidies. Even in these submissions, it was acknowledged that there needed to be transitional arrangements for these sweeping changes. It was also recommended that operational subsidies be extended to private sector centres to meet specific objectives such as quality or educational standards.

        There is an overwhelming picture out there in the community that fees will rise by approximately $25 a week per child.

        To those people who do not have to struggle to make ends meet, who do not have children in child care, who have never had to face those difficulties, it may mean little to you, but the fact is that the cuts to these operational subsidies will mean that a lower standard of care is provided. It will mean that those centres will receive less cleaning and they will not be able to provide the comprehensive educational training that they do at the moment. In some cases, they will not be able to provide the hot cooked meals that they are at the moment.

        Most importantly, to those who really have sought child care in the general community, if you have a child between the ages of zero and two, you are not going to be able to find a place for that child within the private sector. For children above this age, the private sector is particularly good. But, because of the cost difficulties of providing that service for young children, if you want child care for a very young child, the only place available is in community based care. If that were the only reason—and it is not—to preserve the operational subsidy, I think that in itself would be enough. I want to express very strongly my

        In Hobart the axing of subsidies to the Lady Gowrie Child Centre, which provides child care to 354 families through two centres, would cost Lady Gowrie $110,000. That will force fees up by about $20 a week. Of course, it will force many parents into unregulated backyard child care. That is the fate awaiting many people—this means many children below school age—as a result of this money-getting exercise, again, by the government, at a time when it is able to afford hundreds of millions of dollars through the diesel fuel rebate and through the failure to pick up on tax avoidance schemes to the rich and wealthy in this country.

Unemployed parents and students there take advantage of the children's playhouse for their children. It may have to close. It is faced, as are many similar centres around the country, with closure simply because many of the parents whose children use these centres do not have the extra money in their pockets for the extra fees that will have to be charged.

        It is pretty incredible that this government should be truncating the opportunities for everybody to access the sorts of facilities that they are so used to. Instead, the government is handing child care across to a profit oriented system which will not primarily be interested in the struggling, the disadvantaged and those children who come from the most difficult backgrounds. It will aim at improving facilities for those who already have the money to make sure they get the best for their kids. It is unfair, unnecessary and I think it is a pretty appalling delivery of social policy. The Greens are totally opposed to this legislation.

         —I rise in this debate on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 because community based child care is important to the community in which I live in Brisbane. It has been non-profit and it has been developed over a period of time since 1970. It has always ensured high quality, affordable and accountable child care, predominantly for those who are least able to afford child care.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The predominant feature has been the parent involvement in community based child care in the management area, whether it be in the staffing arrangements, funds management or responding to community needs, as opposed to the private sector, which has limited the role of parent involvement primarily just to fundraising. They are distinctly different groups. Of course, the community based child care has in itself developed a real ethos and a real spirit within the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The operational subsidy has been very important to community based child care because in some ways it recognises the large amount of voluntary time spent by parents. This countervails the private sector, where the people who run those establishments draw salaries and are profit driven. Community based child care has, in effect, offered choice—a choice that has been extremely warranted for those who are less fortunate. Community based child care has turned any surplus after cost to the centre rather than to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         profit. So the ethos of these centres is very important and, of course, it builds a community spirit.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The loss of the operational subsidy will mean either a cut in services or increased fees or both. To examine this, I looked at a centre in one of the electorates close by me—that is, the federal electorate of Bowman. I looked at the Bayside Community and Child Care Centre at Wynnum. The loss of the operational subsidy at that centre will mean that $39,000 per annum will be taken away from that centre. The number of places at that centre is 43; the number of families affected is 65. One in three of the places at that centre are occupied by full-time children in child care and two out of three of the positions are occupied by children in part-time care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result of what the government is proposing in that particular centre sees that centre changing its fee structure from $126 per week to $141.50 per week. That is an increase of $15.50. Whilst it does not reach what we expected would be the limit, it nonetheless is a very significant increase for parents at that centre. The loss of the subsidy will, in effect, mean that the loss per place at that centre will be $17.44 per week. Therefore, there is an amount to be absorbed in the whole process. The amount to be absorbed will be in the order of $1.94 per place, which does not sound a great deal. When you convert it to a weekly amount, it is $83.42 or $4,337.84 per annum, which will not be covered by the fee increase which has been put into place in the Bayside Community Child Care Centre at Wynnum. That $4,337.84 has to be found somewhere or, in this case, it will mean a cut in the services or some other sacrifice within the operation of that particular organisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst it does not sound an enormous amount in terms of the budget of this parliament, it is a very significant amount in terms of a small organisation, such as the community based child&amp;hyphen;care centre at Wynnum. This has undoubtedly meant an increase in cost for families. They are absorbing part of the increase—$15.50 per week. Put this together with other government initiatives which are attacking child care, and you will find that
        <break page="7306" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The importance of community based child care is that it is more likely to accommodate infants under the age of three, children with special needs—particularly those from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds—and those with disabilities. It seems that the government, in trying to create a level playing field for community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres and the private sector, has overlooked the fact that we are not comparing apples with apples. What is coming to the fore is more of the economic rationalist pragmatism of the government, and we see community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres being caught up in the ideological battle that the government wages. It is very hard to tell people in the disadvantaged groups that there is a level playing field when, in effect, child care is going to cost them more.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other side of this debate that interests me is what is going to happen in rural and regional centres. I understand that, in the portfolio budget statements that came out, the government did give certain undertakings in respect of country centres. But I have looked at a list of 16 towns in Queensland and I wonder what their fate will be, even with the government undertakings. Whilst there is some undertaking to maintain some subsidy or some element of subsidy where there is disadvantage, what we are going to end up with, if that is the case, is two different classes of community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres: those that have an operational subsidy, and those that have no subsidy whatsoever.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That then raises the question of what will happen if those particular centres that are given some exempt status now are, in the future, faced with a private competitor. That is a concern, when you look at the range of centres that currently in Queensland rely wholly and solely on community based child care. They may be exempt today in some country centres, but they may be out of business tomorrow, because from what I can see there are no guidelines from the government at this stage for the support of rural and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         regionally based child&amp;hyphen;care centres, which are the sole providers of child care in those places.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has offered some money to assist community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres to purchase the financial management ability to enable them to restructure. Basically, this money will go to accountants and consultants who will know about the economic imperative of running some of these community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres but will not know about the social imperative of the underlying social ethos that occurs in these places.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe the department has already written to a number of community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres, advising them of the list of consultants, even before this legislation is passed. That is very pre&amp;hyphen;emptive at best, and tacky at worst. I question the value of this change and of the assistance that has been given. While the assistance will nonetheless be important in these centres, when you look at the turnover of personnel in the community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres over a short period of time, you can see how that assistance, which is confined to 12 months, really needs to be given over a longer period of time. I have looked at the second reading speech, and it is devoid of any real detail as to who will get the assistance, how long they will get the assistance for, and the criteria to be applied in the case of regional and rural community based child care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other fear that has been expressed to me in this debate is this: whilst the operational subsidy is in focus today, is it going to be the capital works grants that will be in focus tomorrow? This manic, driven desire to reach a level playing field may well cause the capital works grants to become the focus in years to come, although not currently. The government's move to remove the operational subsidy to community based child care is ill timed and ill conceived, and it ignores completely the community spirit in the community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres. It is something that is completely unwanted by this child&amp;hyphen;care sector, which is so important in our community today.

        I have said in a number of debates that, if that was the promise and the argument being put to the people of Australia in the run&amp;hyphen;up to the election, a lot of people in the community could feel extraordinarily cheated as a result of this government's actions immediately it had won the election. The government has absolutely savagely attacked the community based sector. There is no commitment to expand the community based child&amp;hyphen;care sector. All further development of this area has now ceased.

        The operational subsidy to the community based sector has been an ongoing concern for a long time, particularly in the debate about how to get some kind of equity between the private child&amp;hyphen;care centres, which do not get the operational subsidy, and the community based centres, which do. It is not the first time that there has been discussion or debate about this. But it certainly is an extraordinary move to abolish it completely in one fell stroke and to not really address, with any serious dollars, what it is that has made the community based sector deliver a different sort of child&amp;hyphen;care centre and, in very large manner, to justify the operational subsidy dollars.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe it is going to be very critical for government to establish some kind of close monitoring, perhaps even more than the accreditation program, of the quality between the two sectors—and, in particular, of the ongoing quality within the community based sector—as a result of these dramatic changes. I cannot argue it any better than the back of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the explanatory memorandum, which points out, under the heading `Financial impact', that the savings from removing the operational subsidy will be $108.8 million over the first four years—that is net, as I understand it—after taking into account $10 million for support for children with high additional needs, especially children with disabilities.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I presume that that is an amount of money extra to the supplementary allocations, which presumably will not be changing—but I do not hold my breath on that. There will also be $8.3 million over two years for advice to services, and $4.1 million per year for supplementary grants for severely disadvantaged areas. A lot comes out—$108.8 million net in savings—as against something like $22 million going back in. It is laughable that you could possibly expect that centres that are going to lose $108 million will be able to seriously continue with anything like the same sort of quality child care, when they have so much less money to assist them.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I suspect that there is always room for efficiencies in child care, as there is in schools, in parliament and everywhere else. You should never rest on your laurels by thinking that you have got it perfect. But this is way beyond any ordinary understanding of what might be efficiencies in the system. I am very concerned because, as my colleagues have explained, the fees will rise very dramatically.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Most centres have indicated that their fees will rise from 1 January because that is going to assist them with spreading the increased costs over the year. It is also, of course, when parents are more likely to join up for child care and it makes good sense for centres to set their fee rise from that time. I am not sure that all centres will do it, but I certainly have advice that many will.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That means that, as of 1 January, while parents are getting their $4 tax handout in one hand they will be losing at least $20, if they have littlies in child care, from the other. It lends a whole new flavour to the notion of a fistful of dollars: while they are giving you money with one hand in the front, they are picking your pocket around the back—and taking far more than they are giving. Families

        I appreciate that a lot of the arguments are directed at the impact on working families. Some of my colleagues have also highlighted that the increased fees will not only hurt working families. They are going to hurt families who are preparing to go back to work, where somebody may be studying or training and simply cannot take up those opportunities if they do not have child care; at that stage, they may well be receiving no extra income. So, for the benefits for their family, all they will see will be an extra $20 going out per week, and that is with just one child. I am giving a ballpark figure; according to some estimates, it could well be much more than that.

        There is also a great concern in this place that child&amp;hyphen;care centres were—to quote some of those opposite in times past—dragging children out of the home, taking them from mothers' breasts and putting them into the hands of the state. I think we have passed that kind of rhubarb nonsense, although there are a few from the Lyons Forum who probably still use that sort of language. But the real problem is that there is a failure to recognise that many people using child care use it for occasional care. They use it for appointments, for visits and voluntary work, and to take a break, to get some respite, from the pressures of littlies. They are going to have those opportunities in the balance because of increased fees. For many families it just means that they will no longer participate.

The one strong word coming out of child care, just as much as it comes out of families, is that it is the quality of care that is provided to our children that matters. What child care has been doing all along, at least from the Labor Party's point of view, is assisting families in the invaluable work they do in rearing children. It has not been supplanting them; it has been supplementing them. For

How does that fit with a national plan for child care? Will we be seeing private child&amp;hyphen;care centres taking up whatever further requirements there will be for child care?

         One of the harsh things for me is to have seen, over three years, a significant coming together of the two sectors of child care—the private and the community based. Indeed, I am very struck by the powerful combination of those two sectors now working very closely together to see the continuation of viable child care. I do not believe that this piece of legislation will assist the development of child care. It will not assist families—in fact, families will be the most injured. It is also important to note that the number of people employed in child care will now be under significant threat.

         This legislation is a major concern to me, especially when I look at this piece of legislation in conjunction with the industrial relations changes. The commitment to equal remuneration has gone, and the award protection for part&amp;hyphen;time and casual work has gone. Eighty per cent of workers in those areas are women. When we look at the changes for part&amp;hyphen;time work—the lack of protection and ongoing income security—and now this increase in child&amp;hyphen;care fees, we can make only one conclusion, and that is that this government would like to see a significant move of women in the work force out of the work force and back into the home. I do not believe that this supports the choices of families. Also, asking families to take $4 with one hand and pay out $20 to $25 with the other is not assisting them. This piece of legislation should be defeated.

        I want to touch briefly on the issue of women in the work force, and particularly their struggle. I bring to this debate experience from the trade union movement, from a union which represented a significant number of women who were employed in many occupations in the work force, including women working in child&amp;hyphen;care centres. I bring to this debate the experiences of a great many women who work in many industries and also the direct experiences of women who work in child&amp;hyphen;care centres, particularly in Tasmania.

        I can say that with regard to the women who work in the centres I have not met a more dedicated group of women, young and old, and my organisation worked to see that they were properly represented with respect to pay and conditions. They are not a militant bunch of people. They are very dedicated, like nurses and other of the caring professions, to the duties that they have.

        Those centres that we have visited operate in all of the areas of the state of Tasmania, from the west coast, north&amp;hyphen;west coast, rural and remote areas, and Launceston—the city that the minister resides in. We heard earlier mention of the Ravenswood Centre, which will be threatened by these measures, as will many centres in Hobart and in the surrounding environments. All of those centres exist for one reason, and that is because there is a need for care. They do not exist because there is a government policy that there should be child&amp;hyphen;care centres. They do not exist because there is funding. They exist because there is a need for care, and, predominantly, the care is provided for working families.

        If child care is not affordable then, firstly, as has already been stated, people will forgo child care. They will either withdraw from the work force, or they will seek inferior, perhaps backyard, options. But the withdrawing from the workforce will be a significant event for many of the women who use care. Many women go to work because there is an economic necessity. But they work also because they want to be a contributing part of their household. They want their skills recognised not only in the home. Many of the women in

         the workforce contribute skills and their time and work very hard in the home, as well as performing an occupation. Affordable child care has been an important aspect in making that possible and dealing with the aspirations, as well as the living standards, of working women in the community. Without that provision, there will be a diminution of the quality of life and the expectations of a lot of women in the Australian community.

        I want to draw senators' attention to the repeated word `choice' that time and time again this government has bandied around. I refer senators to the address to the coalition women's forum on 23 June 1995. Mr Howard then said:

       <para first-indent="16">
        They have the choice to pay exorbitant fees for quality child care, or they have the choice to use backyard child care, or they have the choice to leave work because affordable child care does not exist. Probably, some will have the choice of moving to another child&amp;hyphen;care centre because some people cannot afford choice, and the first centre will close because it becomes economically unviable. A centre like Ravenswood, in particular, will be affected. That centre has been struggling because it is in a high unemployment area and the provision of care in that area has made it difficult to keep the centre economic. If more people withdraw from it, then I have no doubt that the Ravenswood centre will close, unless there is money handed to it, which seems to me to be rather contradictory to the intent of this bill.

        That is obviously not true. It is, in fact, yet another non&amp;hyphen;core promise that was fed to the voters of Australia. The coalition promised many things to working parents of Australia. Dr Kemp, on 28 February this year, said:

         —I rise to speak to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The primary justification for the abolition of the operational subsidy for community based child care is to encourage services to become more efficient and cost competitive with the private sector. Taking that into consideration, and when I have visited community based long day care centres located in the townships of Tasmania, I have always been vigilant about any inefficiencies in a particular long day care service. Not on any occasion, to date, have I, after visiting and speaking to the dedicated coordinators, committee members, staff, volunteers and parents, come away with the view that a particular centre does not do its utmost to provide a service second to none.

         Centre very well because it is where my office is situated—epitomise the picture that was presented to the committee of despair and unhappiness on the part of centre operators faced with the abolition of the operational subsidy. The Ulverstone centre, established 22 years ago, is licensed to care for 56 children. It is currently providing a quality service to approximately 200 children from families living within the town and outlying areas, with some families travelling up to 40 kilometres for care.

        The present fee charged is only just affordable to parents, due to the fact that the area remains economically depressed—and I think Senator O'Brien touched on that. Many of the parents work in rural industries on a seasonable basis. Many are undergoing retraining or studying, or they are looking for work. Almost 50 per cent of parents utilising the centre are in receipt of the maximum child&amp;hyphen;care assistance. Many other parents receive child&amp;hyphen;care assistance at a very high level.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In recognition of the clients they serve, the committee, in conjunction with the local government, has always been conscious of operational costs and has ensured that staffing, which makes up 80 per cent of the budget, has been as flexible and yet as workable as possible. They roster their staff on and off at times when it suits the people who leave their children there. The centre has maintained a commitment to those families in the district and to ensuring that they remain receptive to the wants and the needs of the parents. The operational subsidy has been central to the maintaining of a high quality child&amp;hyphen;care service to these many parents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The centre has operated, year in and year out, as a break&amp;hyphen;even proposition, with no money being set aside or invested but, rather, with money being pumped back in to provide, for example, much needed care in the district for children under the age of two. I understand there are only limited places in family day care for those two years old and under. The committee has advised that a fee increase for parents of between $22 to $24 a week is expected with the loss of the operational subsidy. Care for children under two will probably go altogether. A private centre has
        <break page="7312" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Since this debate began, that scenario at Ulverstone has been repeated to me from Circular Head Child Care Centre, which is in the far north&amp;hyphen;west of Tasmania, to the Rosebery Centre on the west coast, from the Children's Playhouse at Ravenswood in Launceston to the Blackmans Bay Centre in the south of Hobart. East, west, south and north—all of Tasmania's community based long day care centres are up in arms about this bill.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The unhappiness being experienced by the hardworking staff and volunteers is well&amp;hyphen;founded. They fear that, with this measure, an option will be taken away from some parents and others will have to suffice with poorer quality child care. In many respects what is so irksome for staff and volunteers is the knowledge that, with the loss of operational subsidy, they have to wind back the level of service that they have striven so hard to achieve over the years in ensuring that they remained the No. 1 long day care centre in their region.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They cannot come to terms with this measure as many have heard the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) state, in justifying the abolition of the operational subsidy, that 70 per cent of long day care places are provided by the private sector and 30 per cent by the community based sector. That is not the case in Tasmania, where the reverse is true. Seventy&amp;hyphen;three per cent of child care in my state is community based; the remainder is so&amp;hyphen;called private. However, a number of these private services are not, in fact, true private or operated for profit services as they are sponsored by schools or hospitals. So operators of centres in Tasmania are saying to me that the level playing field argument of the economic rationalists has no relevance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many in Tasmania see the abolition of the subsidy, which was introduced with no prior consultation, as a national measure mooted by the National Commission of Audit with no regard to what may have been the position in Tasmania. There has been no effort by the government to explain to the centres and parents in Tasmania why they have to become

        Tasmania is getting the rough end of the stick on this matter, at a time when parents cannot afford the impost of a fee increase, let alone the dismantling of a system that was working perfectly well. An argument may be raised with regard to the cost&amp;hyphen;competitiveness of long day care centres in Melbourne or Sydney, but the economics arguments do not hold water in Tasmania. There would not be too many economic rationalists in Tasmania. I have not yet heard any speak. I appeal to the government to look very carefully at the Tasmanian situation and take into account that, as I have already stated, our percentage figures are very different from those in the rest of Australia.

I have two young children currently enrolled in a community based child&amp;hyphen;care centre and, as a result, I benefit from the payment of the operational subsidy to that centre, the Subicare Centre in Subiaco, which receives in the order of $40,000 per annum to help meet its operating costs.

Their interest and their contributions have made out the case that the removal of the operational subsidy cannot be justified. We are particularly concerned as this measure is just one of a number of measures which the government introduced in the budget which represent a widespread attack on child care in our community. They also therefore represent an attack on the ability of women to be able to work and to know that their children can be placed in quality child care, if they choose to take that option. It does, as Senator O'Brien pointed out, remove the choice that is open to families.

         I have spoken with, and have been written to by, hundreds of Western Australian women and by men. They are all concerned about the government attack on child care funding; about what it will mean in increased costs to them; about what it means for the quality of child care in Australia; and about what it means for the values that they hold as being important in the provision of child care. It is some of those issues regarding values that I want to address in a few remarks today, because some of the other arguments have already been well put by my colleagues.

         I am an advocate of community based child care. Over the past 20 years, those centres have performed an excellent job in providing high quality child care for young children in our community. They grew from voluntary community action; from groups of people in our community seeing a need and working together to establish, as a community initiative, centres that would provide a resource for working families and their communities. Their objectives had educational and philanthropic aspects. The centres have become part of their local communities—an important and integral part—and they help to build our society and our communities by contributing positive values and positive aspects to people's lives.

         Their priorities have become a benchmark for the industry. Child development principles; the use of quality, trained staff; support for parents: all have become priorities of the whole industry, as the private sector has sought to try to emulate the standards set and the values that community child&amp;hyphen;care centre staff brought to the job that they did. They have been very crucial to the building of the child&amp;hyphen;care industry in this country and to the building of the values and the ethos of that industry.

         They are providing Australia with what is, as I understand it, one of the best quality child&amp;hyphen;care industries in the world. The work of the community based centres has helped shape the whole industry by providing a positive contribution and positive values to our communities. In addition, as other speakers have said, they have provided specialist services to disadvantaged persons and to children with disabilities, and they have filled

        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the great concerns I have about this measure is that I suspect that it will lead to an enormous shortfall in places for children aged zero to two in child care in Australia. The community based centres have effectively used the subsidy to provide staffing in child&amp;hyphen;care rooms which provide for children under the age of two. It is an area where private providers have not been keen to provide places because of the extra staff and the resources required in providing care for those younger children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As someone who has placed both his children in child care before the age of two, I think that people are more apprehensive about this prospect when the children are so young. They are very concerned to ensure that the quality of care is of a high standard and that all the facilities are provided. So, it is a labour intensive and costly exercise. It is a fact of the history of child care in Australia that the community based centres have provided a lot of those places because of the unwillingness of the private centres to take on that work and because, as I say, of the ethos of community based centres.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government really needs to answer the question as to what is to happen to those places. How is it going to ensure that those places for children under the age of two continue to be provided as community based centres start to deal with the fact that they have a large section of their income withdrawn by the removal of the subsidy? They will have to make hard decisions, and those decisions will go to the question of numbers of trained staff, provision of places for disabled children, places for children under the age of two, and to some of the other quality issues that have become a feature of community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not want to labour the point, but I do want to make the point that the government has no mandate for these changes. The government wrote to concerned groups prior to the election saying that it would not remove the subsidy. It committed itself to the maintenance of the subsidy. So, parents and
         <break page="7314" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          women, in particular, around this country are angry because the government misled them and reneged on its undertakings in making this enormous attack on child care and, particularly, in its attack on the community based centres.

It is not driven by a view of how we can reshape the industry, or how we can reorganise or redesign the payment of operational subsidy to ensure that the values of the community centres—high quality staff and community values being represented within the centres—are maintained. I think there is an equity issue that has to be addressed.

         —The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 that we are considering introduces two of the major changes to child care which were announced in the budget: the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres and the introduction of means testing for the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate. This government justifies abolishing operational subsidies for community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres on the basis that it will force these centres to compete on an equal footing with privately operated child&amp;hyphen;care centres. That is, this government believes that by abolishing operational subsidies it will create a level playing field—one of the most overused and misused phrases in the English language—within the long day care sector and that this will lead to more efficient child&amp;hyphen;care provision.

        The Democrats do not believe that the government has fully considered the effect this decision will have on many families. That is reinforced by the extensive number of visits I have made to child&amp;hyphen;care centres, both private and community based, and by the many deputations I have had from individuals and peak bodies. We are not convinced that leaving the future development of long day care centres to the mercy of market forces is necessarily a desirable or realistic thing to do. In fact, we would say that it is simply saying, `Our children are commodities to be split up, bargained for or auctioned, if you like, in the marketplace.' That is really what we are saying when we say that market forces will sort it out.

         I was very interested to read the majority report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee's hearing on this issue. What intrigued me most was to see how closely that report followed the official coalition party line on operational subsidies. I have been in the Senate long enough to know that political considerations usually take precedence over most other things. However, even given that qualification, I find it very difficult to under stand how the majority of members on that committee could reach the conclusion they did when only five out of 380 submissions voiced any support for this course of action at all. Mathematically, it makes the mind boggle.

        The committee members who signed the majority report are members of the coalition. I guess that is probably not all that hard to understand after all. But while I accept that the old adage `It's quality, not quantity' may ring true in some situations, I really think that giving that much weight to five submissions out of some 380 does draw a very long bow. Let me remind the Senate that the commitment to abolishing operational subsidies contained in the majority report flies in the face of the coalition's pre&amp;hyphen;election promises—but that does not seem to be a consideration these days.

        That is plain enough, I would have thought. Since the budget was handed down in August, I have had thousands of letters—and I mean that quite literally—from parents and community day care workers expressing concern about the possible impact of abolishing operational subsidies and the impact that will have on the cost and quality of child care.

        Some of the concerns which have been raised with me include these: fees in community based centres will rise by up to $20 per child per week; some community based centres will be forced to close because parents will not be able to meet the increased fees; some families, particularly poorer families, will be forced to withdraw from child&amp;hyphen;care services; and the standard of quality in some community centres will be compromised. Whether or not all of these fears eventuate remains to be seen. But we need to underline in this chamber that the state where this will

        The Democrats do not believe that this government should be taking such a drastic step as abolishing operational subsidies without first undertaking a comprehensive review of the role this funding plays and determining what will be the likely effect abolishing operational subsidies on families. Perhaps such a review would confirm that operational subsidies no longer play the role they were originally intended to. Perhaps a review would also confirm that operational subsidies need to be better targeted. But until such a review has been undertaken we cannot know. We will oppose this section of the bill today and we will remain firm in our opposition to the abolition of operational subsidies until the government undertakes a full and comprehensive review of this whole area.

        The Democrats deplore the way this government has attacked families. We believe that increasing the costs of child care, of medicine, of tertiary education, of home and community care services—and the list goes on and on—makes a mockery of this government's pledge to make things better for families through the much heralded family tax initiative. There is little doubt that, for many families, the additional cost of living which will result from this government's policies will far exceed the amount this government is giving them through the family tax initiative. This bill is really about a very massive experiment in radical social engineering. It is a change from community values to profit based child care, as though children have no value unless it is a dollar value.

        I will now turn to the second major change contained in this bill: the introduction of means testing for the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate. After weighing up all the arguments with regard to means testing this benefit, the Democrats have decided to support the government on the implementation of this measure. I would like to point out, however, that this was not a position that we arrived at either lightly or easily. I want to acknowledge that there is a strong case for not means testing this benefit.

         However, the case against the introduction of means testing for the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate hinges on the view that child care is a legitimate work related expense and that all families should be entitled to some recompense for the cost of work related child care. Those who support this perspective draw comparisons between child care, which is not tax deductible, and other work related expenses, such as union fees, stationery items, uniforms and protective clothing, which are tax deductible. In an ideal world, the Democrats would be happy to support this position. However, we do not believe we can justify not means testing the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate when so many other crucial programs, in areas such as unemployment, health care, aged care and disability services, are also facing such brutal and significant cuts in funding.

        Of course, if you look at what Alan Ramsay had to say, there is a very big lesson here for a lot of people on your side of politics. He said:

        Even so, Oppositions don't often lose as sourly as Labor is doing in the Telstra debate. The whingeing, moaning, fingerpointing, confected outrage and all&amp;hyphen;round bad&amp;hyphen;mouthing in the Senate since last week's vote has been a thing to behold.
       </para>
       <para>
        He said that there were two unassailable facts about the Telstra debate—they are both very instructive. The first thing is that, if there is one thing that is absolutely crystal clear, it is that John Howard had a unequivocal mandate to proceed with this. Mr Ramsay also said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second fundamental truth is that, unlike the Democrats, Labor doesn't have a shred of credibility when it comes to the issue of selling public assets. It was as opportunistic in opposing the sale of Telstra last election as it had been for years in government in flogging just about anything of any consequence, including the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas.

Not once did he acknowledge the benefits to Tasmania—indeed, he didn't even look at the problems in Tasmania. He is not interested. He spends as much time as he can on the mainland. It is typical of the Labor Party.

The figures that were provided by the department to those researchers to do that study were provided prior to the changes that were made to the government's intentions vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis Austudy. As you well understand, the regulations that have been successfully, if you like, passed this morning, if I can put it that way, will mean that someone between the age of 22 and 25 who otherwise might have got Austudy next year—we are not talking about existing students; they have been grandfathered—living at home and from a wealthy family, will not get Austudy.

        We have taken a fiscally responsible approach to income support. We have maintained a grants scheme. You do not need to believe what you read on the Democrats' home page, which says, `Fight the campaign to turn Austudy into loans.' That is not true, and everybody would have understood that from 9 August. Senator Stott Despoja, if she was not busy doing other things, would have recognised that. Because the Democrats want to keep the you-know-who's honest—as they always do—they would have taken that off their home page and not pretended that we were trying to turn Austudy into loans.

        Even you, Senator Carr, who might disagree with a lot of things that my side of politics would do, would not engage in such a disgraceful misrepresentation as the one Senator Stott Despoja has engaged in on the Internet. As I have indicated to you, the department provided that material to the researchers. The figures relate to the plans for Austudy prior to the changes we made, which was that, as soon as someone has turned 25, they will get Austudy irrespective of whether or not they have completed their course. That is the change that we have made.

        It is interesting, though, that you have raised the question of the socioeconomic stratum that would be affected—or which the study indicates would be affected—by these changes. It clearly showed that, by far, the greatest majority of people who would be affected are those who live in middle and upper income socioeconomic stratum postcodes—by far the greatest majority. So the percentage of people who are going to be hit by shifting the age of independence from 22 to 25 for future students is about 85 per cent.

Why did the government facilitate someone with an obvious vested interest attending that meeting which approved the 12-fold increase?

        The labour system under the previous government relied on a very rigid and inflexible structure. The government's targeting of labour market assistance for disadvantaged groups recognises the special circumstances that these people face. For example, we will make assistance available through the community support program in helping people who are not ready for employment at this stage to access services designed directly to address their needs and difficulties.

         For people on that program there will be a relaxation of the job search activity test while they are receiving this assistance. This will enable them to return to direct labour market assistance once their particular difficulties have been overcome. In working out the program details, we will work very closely with community groups who in fact raised this problem with us and with whom we have been consulting since the announcement of these changes.

         There are people who face multiple barriers to employment. There are groups of unemployed persons who have a combination of difficulties in returning to employment but whose disadvantages do not preclude them getting and holding a job, provided we give them some assistance. The government has recognised the difficulties these people face as well by providing significantly greater incentives for the successful placement of people in this group into employment compared with other unemployed persons. There will also be an extension in the period of time available for case managers to assist people in this group, from a maximum of 18 months to two years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Disabled Australians also face difficulties in returning to work. A disabled person unable to return to work on a full-time basis will be able to take advantage of the incentive structure facing contracted employment placement agencies. The full outcome fee will be paid to an employment placement enterprise for placing a disabled person into employment for the amount of hours per week that the person is assessed as being capable of working. That is, they do not need to return to full-time employment if they are not capable of it. But if they can be placed in the equivalent of what their capacity is, then the full outcome fee will be paid.

         Young people, particularly because of the youth unemployment rate, face a particular problem in getting jobs. For that reason, the employment placement enterprises will receive the highest possible outcome fee for a young person returning to full-time education or training, which is the first foot in the door to getting a job or a better job.

As he said, it was the policy before the last election of this government to produce a white paper on sustainable energy with a 25-year time frame. In developing this critically important policy for the future, the government is intent on effective consultation with the community to give all interested parties—industry, environmental groups and individuals—a chance to provide their views. The government will therefore release a green

        The green paper draws attention to the high growth in demand for energy expected over the coming decades, especially with the economic growth forecast for the developing countries within our region. Globally and for Australia, energy consumed is likely to increase some 40 per cent between now and the year 2020. The green paper identifies some of the key influences which will impact on Australia's energy future. I point out that the green paper will not be a statement of government policy. That will come in the form of a white paper after the government has consulted with the community. Rather, the green paper is intended to stimulate the community's thinking about energy policy and to encourage informed debate on the issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To help keep in touch with community views, the government has established both a ministerial and business round table and an energy policy forum to obtain views from principal stakeholder groups, including business, environmental groups and energy users. State and territory governments will also be fully consulted in the process of developing the white paper. We have allowed ample time for the community to prepare submissions in response to the green paper, and the closing date for receipt of submissions will be 31 January 1997.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The pervasive character of energy, its importance for industry, commerce, transport, households and recreation, means that getting the policy right is essential for our ongoing wellbeing. The expenditure on energy consumption in Australia is of the order of $35 billion per annum. Our  exports of energy commodities—coal, gas and uranium—generate some $12 billion per annum in export earnings. Our exports of energy technologies are worth over a billion dollars per annum. This means jobs and a very significant contribution to our standard of living.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has been estimated that up to 20 per cent improvement in energy use efficiency may be
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         achievable in Australia. This translates to a saving for this country of some $6 billion or $7 billion per year. Even if only half of this is realised, it is very significant. The electricity and gas microeconomic reform process is already achieving major benefits. We are seeing the increasing development of cogeneration, and this is bound to continue.

        The commercial energy services industry, which drives efficiency and conservation through various technologies, is becoming more robust and more mature in this new environment. The essence of a sustainable energy policy, therefore, is to integrate economic, social and environmental objectives so that the welfare of the current generations of Australians is advanced while protecting the options available to future generations. The government's aim is to release the white paper setting out its policy in the first half of next year.

        Senator Cook also referred to disputes. The advice I have is that almost 90 per cent of franchisors and franchisees claim to enjoy a healthy commercial relationship. On average, 70 per cent of franchisees are happy with the system and would recommend it to prospective buyers. The minister is aware of claims from the opposition that there has been a significant increase in the level of disputes.

        Why has the government on International Human Rights Day closed the doors of the three Queensland offices of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission this morning?

       <para>
        The answer to that question which I have been provided with is that the existing cooperative arrangement with Queensland expired on 9 December 1996. The Attorney-General had put a broad proposal to the Queensland Attorney-General in June this year to negotiate a new arrangement consistent with the national approach and where contributions are reflective of the work done. This was followed up by one meeting of officers in August and then a number of Queensland press releases claiming that the Commonwealth had withdrawn from the current arrangements. That was not the case.

        In the majority of states where cooperative arrangements have been in place—Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia—the commissions are run by the states. In respect
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of complaints brought under federal law, the state body acts as agent for the Commonwealth and those bodies are paid by the Commonwealth for so acting. This is in line with Commonwealth-state arrangements for service delivery in many other states. Such a national approach to cooperative arrangements was recommended by the review of HREOC, which was established by and reported to the previous government.

        The arrangement which had existed in Queensland operated under a reverse arrangement. The Queensland commission, established by the federal government, acted as agent for Queensland in respect of complaints under Queensland law. That was despite the fact that approximately 80 per cent of the cases were state cases and 20 per cent were Commonwealth ones. Under the arrangement that has now expired, Queensland contributed only 50 per cent of funding for 80 per cent of the commission's output. This funding arrangement was clearly inequitable and was aberrant in terms of the funding arrangements that exist in other states.

       In fact, the amendment moved by Senator Margetts would have required a consequential amendment to the related income tax legislation, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Act 1996 (the Rates Act) to maintain consistency between the tax law and the social security law. Section 20D of the Rates Act refers to the `income ceiling of the breadwinner's partner', which is an amount calculated by reference to Table E in point 1070&amp;hyphen;E5 in section 1070 of the Social Security Act 1991.

        This motion represents what is best described as a rolling guillotine. It is important to place on record that it is a guillotine not enforced by the government on the Senate. The opposition, for its own part, may well take a very different view of a guillotine that was proposed by the government, if the intention of such a guillotine was, in our view, to improperly restrict debate. What this particular motion represents is a cooperative attempt to deal with a heavy legislative program in a very limited time frame.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The guillotine means that each measure that the government has granted urgency for does receive an appropriate amount of time for perusal by the Senate. I think that is an important principle—not that we just move and see a range of very important bills dealt with without debate. That is one of the strengths of dealing with legislation in this way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition was happy to take this initiative. I must say that it is something that we would have liked to have been able to achieve in government. We would have
        <break page="7335" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         supported it when we were in government for the same reasons that we support it now. I must also say that this is something that the coalition would never contemplate when they were in opposition. We do hope that when we are on the government benches again we will see the same approach adopted by the coalition when it is in opposition.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I suggest to the Senate that this is a commonsense resolution, a sensible way to deal with a difficult situation before the Senate. On that basis, I take what I think is the unusual step, as Leader of the Opposition, or as a senator representing a non-government party, of proposing a guillotine. I suspect it is probably unprecedented. But  I think the arguments for this cause of action are strong. I commend the motion to the Senate.

        So it is not surprising to me that the government today does not actually want to move this guillotine, but they are very happy to accept it. It is a very generous offer from the opposition. We support it. We are glad to have been part of the consultations. I hope the government at least has the graciousness to say thank you for something they are not prepared to do but which they really want us to do anyway.

         Following the 30 June 1996 report of the Australian Broadcasting Authority `Investigation into the content of on&amp;hyphen;line services', the government is considering a national regulatory framework for on&amp;hyphen;line services. A response to the Select Committee's reports, Regulation of Computer On&amp;hyphen;Line Services (Parts 1 and 2), is being held over so that it can reflect the outcome of this consideration. As an interim measure to assist government consideration of a regulatory framework for on&amp;hyphen;line services, an amendment to section 171 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 has been introduced in the Senate to ensure that the Minister's power to direct the Australian Broadcasting Authority to conduct investigations can extend to further investigation of the future regulatory arrangements for the on&amp;hyphen;line industry. This amendment is currently in the Senate awaiting debate.

         The Committee received 40 submissions from a range of individuals and organisations, including community groups, government departments and agencies, peak industry groups, garment companies and from the ACTU and the Textiles Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia. The Committee also received one petition, signed by 522 people.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In an effort to reach migrant outworkers, the Committee advertised in relevant community newspapers in 10 languages and on SBS radio. In addition, the Committee established a dedicated 1800 telephone line with a translator service for receipt of oral submissions. The Committee held public hearings in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra, and visited a number of garment manufacturing companies and outworker homes in Sydney and Melbourne.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Outwork in the garment industry means sewing clothes in a private home. The number of outworkers has increased dramatically over the last decade as a direct result of recent major restructuring in TCF industries. Outworking is now so prevalent that it is not just a characteristic of the industry, the entire garment manufacturing industry is structured around it.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         With the addition of a large outworker labour force and their associated intermediaries, the chain of garment production has lengthened. In some instances, as many as seven parties may be involved. Because the chain of garment production is so long, it has become easy for responsibility to be passed off from one element to another along the chain.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While there was debate about the absolute number of outworkers, with estimates ranging from 5O,000 and 330,000 people involved either on a full-time or part-time basis, the Committee concluded that there are sufficient people involved in the industry for concern about them to be warranted.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Most outworkers are migrant women, aged between 25—35, who have young children at home. Some are assisted by their husbands. Most have very poor English language skills and are thus unable to find work elsewhere. Elderly people and children assist in many outworker families with ancillary tasks.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Problems experienced by outworkers include: low piece rates which translate to low hourly rates; impossible deadlines for completion of work; late payment, underpayment, non-payment for completed work, rejection of work and unreimbursed expenses; physical and verbal harassment from intermediaries, including blackmail, threats, coercion and bribes; substandard working environments; and worries associated with combining work with
         <break page="7346" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          family responsibilities. In short, outworkers are isolated, unseen, unorganised, non-unionised, and ignorant of their employment rights. For these reasons the Committee believes that outworkers, as a group, require special consideration.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Through the availability of the various clothing trades awards, mechanisms exist for outworkers to be paid wages equivalent to factory employees, and some outworkers are paid award wages. However, the structural complexities of the garment manufacturing chain, and resultant ease with which various parties can shed responsibility, mitigates against full award compliance and it appears that the majority of outworkers are not paid award wages. Some outworkers are seriously exploited. In this context, the Committee notes that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 will change the circumstances under which outworkers may be employed by providing for individual Workplace Agreements with scrutiny of such agreements available through the Employment Advocate. It is the Committee's view, however, that in accordance with the nature of outwork and past experience in the industry, it is probable that most outworkers will not be required to sign any contract and will continue to be employed in the same manner as they have been in the past.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee notes that occupational health and safety of outworkers is a neglected issue. Although the magnitude of occupational and secondary stress induced health problems is not known, the Committee is concerned that because outworkers are treated as contractors rather than as employees, the ultimate cost of accidents and illness among them may be being borne by the public sector. A number of recommendations were made to the Committee by Worksafe Australia and the Committee has endorsed those recommendations.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Evidence indicated that children are involved in outworking and the Committee concluded that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that some children are involved to an unreasonable extent. However, the Committee concluded that the situation endured by exploited children will only be ameliorated through an improvement in the employment conditions experienced by their parents. The Committee thus suggested to the Government that, having regard to Australia's international and national obligations to protect children from exploitation, consideration of this matter was warranted.

         The issues of taxation obligations and eligibility for welfare benefits were found to be of concern to some outworkers, particularly those who may have been coerced into infringements. As evidenced by the introduction of the Reportable Payments System and the Social Security amnesty for outworkers, these issues were clearly also of concern to the relevant government instrumentalities. The Commit

          tee concluded that both schemes had merit. In particular, the Committee concluded that the Australian Taxation Office could take greater advantage of the Reportable Payments System to fully investigate taxation avoidance in TCF industries. In terms of the social security amnesty, the Committee has suggested to the Government that it consider its reinstatement.

         The Committee noted that a grant by the previous Government to the Textiles Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia for outworker related activities, which had resulted in a number of beneficial outcomes, had been cancelled by the new Government.

         One of the overwhelming findings of the inquiry was that special consideration is required with respect to the difficulties faced by outworkers in the garment industry, both with respect to the potential number of workers involved working within the industry and the overall treatment faced by workers.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst the Workplace Relations Act will introduce individual contracts across industries and some protections will be available to workers who would come under individual  contracts, the committee felt that they are unlikely to reach outworkers, given the nature of past regulation and the ability to enforce
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that regulation amongst outworkers. Award provisions, for instance, have been very difficult to enforce and often only by the department relying upon union intervention. In some respects that intervention will be restricted by title provisions on right of entry. I am sure we are all aware of this, given that we have debated it in the past in the workplace relations bill.

         I would like to highlight the various forms with which outwork is exploited in the garment industry. It is not only in relation to the workers themselves but in the wider community that many difficulties can be highlighted. Outwork may be exploited by the garment manufacturing companies directly and indirectly in several ways. There is a table on page 34 of the report which highlights many of those ways. They include non-payment of award wages, reduced payments for acceptance of cash and complete non-payment of wages in some instances, all of which contribute to a reduction in the wages component of a garment manufacturer. When you calculate that to an hourly rate, there was evidence before the committee that in some cases that could be as low as about $2 per hour.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Other difficulties include non-payment of outworkers for time spent on ancillary tasks such as unbundling, learning design and cutting threads. Costs normally paid by the manufacturing factory can often be borne by the outworkers—for example, cotton, thread, electricity, machinery repair and the leasing of machinery. Also, the deeming of outworkers as contractors often results in a shift in cost from the manufacturer to the outworker over such things as superannuation and insurance premiums. The payment in cash and inaccurate record-keeping results in losses in taxation revenue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unregulated hours of work results in overwork, with consequent health and safety problems among outworkers, the cost of which is then borne by the public sector through Medicare claims and welfare benefits. Also, the use of intermediaries to keep the work force one or more steps removed from the manufacturing companies allows the shedding of many of the responsibilities. In
         <break page="7348" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          some cases, these are picked up by the social security, taxation and health systems.

         The other problem which was identified by the committee and which we hope will be resolved by further attention in this area is the exploitation of children. Families under pressure carrying out work at home can, according to some evidence before the committee, involve an inordinate amount of work by children in order to complete tasks in a hurry. This was found in some instances to be far from reasonable.

         The Committee notes that an important additional benefit of the Reportable Payments System is that it will assist in identifying all parties involved in the garment manufacturing chain, particularly those at the level of intermediary. In addition, the Committee notes that information gained from the Reportable Payments System is able to be used by the Department of Social Security to investigate welfare benefits fraud.

         A further recommendation of the committee is that the government should look at further ways of facilitating voluntary regulation from within the industry. I would like to note at this stage that, during the inquiry and perhaps to some extent arising from the inquiry, some improvements were made in the relations between different parties within the industry in how the difficulties and the problems could be regulated.

          The committee found that there are two basic ways in which actions can be taken to improve conditions under which outworkers perform their work: legislative and voluntary. The union had proposed legislative action for the enactment of sale of clothing legislation. In contrast to this, both the union and the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia have promoted voluntary deeds of cooperation or an industry home workers code of practice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee was mindful of the arguments put forward by both parties and concluded that voluntary action should be supported in the first instance and, in particular, that the proposed industry code of practice should be fully embraced by all parties involved. Should voluntary action fail to have any effect, then legislative action may need to be considered.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee recommended that an industry home workers code of practice be adopted by all participants in the garment retailing and manufacturing process. However, we regret that further progress had not been made at this stage. A couple of weeks before the conclusion of this report, negotiations had broken down. It was with disappointment that only a few retailers had become party to either an individual deed of cooperation or the industry code of practice.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Therefore, the committee has undertaken that we should review in 12 months time both this recommendation and several other recommendations within the report to see if further recommendations are required, particularly what progress has been made in relation to voluntary regulation within the industry.

It was impossible for us at some stages to identify the intermediaries involved in that chain of production. They are the people we would really have liked to get at, because they are the ones who we think were putting some unnecessary pressure on home workers and outworkers at, one might term, the bottom end of the scale. I am very sorry that at some stage during the inquiry we could not identify some of these middlemen or intermediaries who were mak ing life for the outworkers or the home workers in the industry as difficult as it appeared to be from some of the visits we made.

         Outworking is an exceptional problem. It is on that basis that I want to draw attention to it. We fail to take action on outworking at our peril because of the social issues that are involved. Some of the salient features of outworking are worth while repeating: low piece rates, which translate to low hourly rates; impossible deadlines for the completion of work; late payment or underpayment or non-payment for completed work; rejection of

         On 19 November the Senate resolved to continue a reference of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 to the Parliamentary Joint Committee for further consideration.

         The issue at stake for the continuing reference and the issue that is the focus of the seventh report concerns the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (RDA). That is, do the proposed amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 (NTA) offend the RDA?

          that clear this year in statements to the parliament. Further, the Prime Minister has confirmed the Government's commitment to Mabo and the preservation of the integrity of the High Court's decision. The Committee has re&amp;hyphen;examined the amendment proposals from the perspective of the RDA to ascertain whether the RDA would be overridden by the amendments: that is, whether the amendments are inconsistent with the Prime Minister's assurances. The Committee's seventh report clearly concludes that the amendments supported by the Committee's sixth report are not inconsistent with the RDA.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Reasons for the Committee's conclusion are quite transparent. The Native Title Act was regarded as a `special measure' under the RDA; the Preamble and Prime Minister Keating's Second Reading speech make this clear. Special measures may be provided to disadvantaged racial groups without breaching the principles of racial discrimination. The Attorney-General's Department advised the Committee that the traditional legal position in Australia has been that any laws covering racial matters must provide either `formal equality' or be a special measure. The benefits endorsed under the Native Title Act are special measures.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Importantly, special measures are endorsed out of a political judgement that they are justified. Being provided by the legislature, special measures can also be withdrawn or modified without inconsistency with the RDA. Nevertheless, the Committee has not taken the approach that special measures may be modified at will. Rather, the Committee's sixth report acknowledges that the right to negotiate is a valuable asset and should not be extinguished wholesale without sound reason.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In its examination of this matter the Committee heard an alternative view to the effect that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the RDA require `benign discrimination' or measures ensuring `substantive equality'. The Committee's seventh report argues against this alternative view. Not only is it confronted by the fact that the courts have not adopted such a view, but it depends mainly on a footnote to a page in the High Court's judgement in Western Australia v. the Commonwealth (1995). The Committee cannot accept that the High Court relied on the alternative view in that case. It also cannot accept the argument of the alternative view that it is likely to be adopted by the High Court in the near future.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If the Convention and the RDA do not require substantive equality but only formal equality, and if special measures may not only be endorsed but also modified, then amendments to the NTA affecting existing statutory rights are possible without inconsistency with the RDA.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Where the NTA has proven unworkable, to the disadvantage of indigenous and other parties, then it arguably should be amended in the national interest. In the Committee's view this is possible without overriding the RDA.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is one further matter that deserves mention. The Committee has carefully considered the first minority report's proposal to amend the NTA by giving precedence to the RDA. The generality of the proposed clause would entail its unpredictability in the unlikely event of a conflict between the amendments and the RDA; this makes for bad legislation. Even more importantly, there is an implied admission in the minority recommendation that the RDA clause could apply in an uncertain fashion. If the minority was confident in its judgement of ways in which the RDA might be offended by the proposed amendments, then it should identify them and argue the case. The minority's RDA clause would result in a request to the courts to make sense of the amending legislation. It would abdicate our responsibility to unelected judges, and compound the scope for litigation. I enjoin the parliament, in consistency with the RDA, to fulfil its obligation to legislate for a more workable Native Title Act and I commend the Committee's seventh report to the Senate.

         The instrument in question is the Crimes Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 7, made on 24 January 1996. The Regulations were quite short and had only one purpose, which was to exempt the Australian Securities Commission from provisions of the Spent Convictions Scheme. That scheme provides for important personal rights whereby, if a person was convicted of an offence more than 10 years ago, was sentenced to less than 30 months imprisonment and has not reoffended, then the conviction is spent and the person is legally able to claim, on oath or otherwise, that they were never convicted of the offence. Also, other people who are aware of the offence must generally not disclose the conviction without the consent of the person affected and must not take the conviction into account in any decision making process. The enabling Act, however, provides for the Regulations to prescribe exemptions from the scheme. The Crimes Regulations in question exempted the ASC from the Spent Convictions Scheme in regard to all offences for the purposes of considering whether to prosecute, making submissions as to sentence, and assessing the suitability of a person to be employed by the ASC.

         The Committee scrutinised the Regulations and noted the advice of its Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, that the parent Act provided for the Privacy Commissioner to receive applications for exemptions from the Scheme and to advise the Minister on whether an exemption should be granted. The Committee noted that neither the making words of the Regulations nor the Explanatory Statement even referred to this requirement, much less that it had been observed, or to the substance of the Privacy Commissioner's advice, the obtaining of which was mandatory. The Committee assumed that this was because the matter was routine in nature, with no unusual or unexpected features. Nevertheless, the Committee wrote to the Minister on 15 April 1996 asking for confirmation that the Privacy Commissioner was consulted and, if so, of the result of those consultations.

          his statutory duty to provide such advice. The concern was compounded by the fact that, as a consequence of the delay in replying and of the making words and the Explanatory Statement omitting any reference to the Privacy Commissioner, the Committee assumed that there was nothing untoward about the Regulations and did not give a protective notice of disallowance. Also, importantly, the incomplete Explanatory Statement also meant that individual Senators with an interest in legislation affecting personal rights were not alerted to a matter of interest.

         The Committee emphasises that it did not draw any conclusions about the desirability or otherwise of the substance of the exclusion of the ASC from the Spent Convictions Scheme. The Committee was concerned, however, that the important questions which the Regulations raised were concealed, whether inadvertently or not, from the attention and scrutiny of the Senate. In this context I add that the non&amp;hyphen;partisan Committee stays well clear of policy issues, but does attempt to ensure openness and accountability so that Senators should have every opportunity to take whatever action they see fit in respect of individual instruments.

         After receiving this startling advice from the Minister the Committee replied, setting out its concerns and suggesting that, in the circumstances, it may be appropriate for the Regulations to be repealed and remade, with a complete Explanatory Statement. The Committee noted that this would preserve the options of the Committee and the Senate but would not disrupt the present arrangements pending informed parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee also advised that it would write to the Privacy Commissioner and, after considering his reply, decide whether it would be appropriate for members of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department to attend a meeting of the Committee.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Privacy Commissioner subsequently advised the Committee that he was not aware that the Explanatory Statement failed to refer to his views on the exemption and that he appreciated the continued support of the Committee in seeking to promote a more open approach by agencies in relation to differences of view with his office, particularly where legislation is concerned.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Minister then replied to the Committee advising that, in his view, the Explanatory Statement was adequate because it set out the provision of the Act under which the Regulations were made and general background, even though it did not mention the statutory obligation to receive advice from the Privacy Commissioner, or the result of that adverse advice. The Minister also advised, however, that he was prepared to adopt a practice under which the views of the Privacy Commissioner, if not included in the Explanatory Statement, would be communicated to the Committee at the same time as any
         <break page="7353" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The Committee then met with officers of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department to discuss the matter. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for releasing these officers. The Minister also advised that the delay in replying was unfortunate. In addition, a member of the Minister's staff wrote to the Committee advising that the Minister was conscious of, and regretted, the delay.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         After considering the Minister's reply and the discussions with the officers, the Committee advised the Minister that it remained concerned at the way in which this matter was handled. The Committee advised that, in its view, any suggestion that the Explanatory Statement for these Regulations need not advise either that the enabling Act expressly required the Privacy Commissioner to receive and examine relevant requests for exclusion and to advise the Minister on whether an exclusion should be granted, or that the Privacy Commissioner in this case recommended against exclusion, but was overruled, is not supportable. In the present case the Committee considers that it is a breach of parliamentary propriety.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee also advised the Minister that his offer to communicate the views of the Privacy Commissioner to the Committee at the time of tabling of any future Regulations, if they were not included in the Explanatory Statement, would not be a satisfactory solution. This was because Senators would not be informed of relevant matters. Individual Senators give many notices of disallowance which may not be directly related to issues raised by the Committee. For instance, Senators may wish to disallow an instrument, or a provision of an instrument, on policy grounds. The Committee, on the other hand, does not raise matters of policy and operates in a non&amp;hyphen;partisan fashion.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         In this context the Committee advised the Minister that it noted that present Commonwealth drafting practice for legislative instruments appears to be to include sometimes lengthy recitals in the making words that statutory consultation requirements have been met. The Committee gave instances of such recitals. In the case of another instrument, which the Committee understands was drafted by officers of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department, the making words actually recite that the instrument was made after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee advised the Minister that it supports this practice and assumes that if the relevant consultations or advice led to results which were unusual or unexpected, such as a decision to override the Privacy Commissioner, that this would be explained in the Explanatory Statement.

         With regard to the delay of three and a half months in replying to the Committee's first letter, with the result that the Committee did not give a protective notice of disallowance of the Regulations, the Committee advised the Minister that it accepted the advice that he regretted the delay.

         The Committee also advised that it would write to the Minister responsible for the Federal Executive Council Handbook, asking for the Handbook to be amended to provide for Explanatory Statements to advise of any mandatory consultation. The current edition of the Handbook expressly refers to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.

         At this point I emphasise again that the Committee made no finding on whether the ASC should or should not be exempted from the Spent Convictions Scheme. This is a matter on which informed and well intentioned people may differ. It is, however, also a matter affecting the personal rights of those who come within the scheme and as such it is a matter upon which the Senate should have been fully informed. It is, as I say, a matter of regret that this was not done and a breach of parliamentary propriety.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised the usual large number of disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate, made under the authority of scores of enabling Acts administered through virtually every Department of State. Almost every legislative scheme relies on delegated legislation to provide the administrative details of programs set out in broad policy in enabling Acts which authorise such delegated legislation.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they conform to the same high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights which the Senate applies to Acts. If the Committee detects any breach of these standards it writes to the Minister or other law&amp;hyphen;maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          As usual, by the end of the sittings Ministers have given the Committee undertakings to amend many provisions in different instruments or enabling Acts to meet its concerns, reflecting a continuing high level of cooperation from Ministers in its non&amp;hyphen;partisan operations. The Committee is grateful for this cooperation.

          During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 889 instruments. Of these, 192 were statutory rules, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series of delegated legislation. The other 697 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.

          Each of the 889 instruments was scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders.

          Legislative instruments are invalid if they subdelegate legislative power without express authorisation in the enabling Act.

          legislative instruments may, in general, only incorporate material as it exists at the time the instrument was made, not as the material exists from time to time. In one case, the enabling Act expressly authorised some material as amended to be incorporated, but not the actual documents as amended which the instrument purported to incorporate. Another enabling Act authorised the law of a foreign country as in force from time to time to be incorporated, but the instrument incorporated material as amended which did not appear to be part of that law. Another instrument purported to incorporate amended material for which there appeared to be no provision in the enabling Act to affect the operation of s.49A.

          Under s.48(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act delegated legislation generally ceases to have effect if not tabled in both Houses within 15 sitting days of making. On 3 December 1996 the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Bill O'Chee, made a detailed statement to the Senate on recent failures to table. Earlier in the present sittings, however, two legislative instruments ceased to have effect because they were not tabled in time. The sole purpose of both instruments was to provide for the payment of money from one Commonwealth agency to another and this was validly done within those 15 sitting days. The Committee points out that this procedure is undesirable because it means that the Senate is not given an opportunity to scrutinise such instruments.

          There were other problems affecting validity. One instrument was neither signed nor dated. Another had insufficient information to identify who made it, the date of making or the authority under which it was made; some of this material was included in a covering letter, although part of this information was wrong. The Explanatory Statements for three instruments included errors which, if correct, would have made the three instruments void. A Note to another instrument advised that, to avoid doubt, the instrument commenced on making, while the Explanatory Statement advised that it commenced on gazettal; if it actually commenced on making it would have been void for prejudicial retrospectivity. One instrument provided that it would take

One instrument included a report on a matter while the Act required a record of the matter. Another instrument did not effect its legislative intent. A number of instruments did not comply with an earlier undertaking by the Minister to ensure that the instruments complied with the requirements of the enabling Act. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that it would be administered according to what its provisions were intended to be, not what they actually were.

One instrument, not amended since 1984, included references to provisions of Acts repealed a decade ago. One instrument, providing for the imposition of tax, operated with four years retrospectivety.

Another provision required notice in writing of a decision to be given but not, as appeared appropriate in the circumstances, for a statement of reasons for the decision. Another expressly advised that a decision maker could take into account the commercial reputation of an applicant, but there was no requirement for the applicant to be made aware of any adverse material or to respond to it. Another provided subjective criteria for a decision maker to apply, including the criterion of any other matter which the decision maker considers relevant. One instrument, which was made partly to provide for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, reduced the existing rights of competitive athletes selected for drug testing. Another instrument provided an international organisation with a 10 months retrospective right to sue. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that it removed an existing right because legal advice was received that the enabling Act did not provide the authority for such a right; the Committee asked if the Act would be amended to provide such authority.

Another instrument increased an allowance for Commonwealth public servants by 40 per cent, four years after the previous increase. Another instrument had the potential to operate unfairly in respect of the recovery of medical and dental costs from members of the Australian Defence Force. One instrument provided only a Canberra telephone number for inquiries from everywhere in Australia from athletes selected for mandatory drug testing, but the number was not a free call. One instrument provided that agents must keep separate accounts for those whom they represent, but there was no requirement that the separate accounts be trust accounts.

One instrument provided for discretions relating to compliance by miners with mandatory requirements. Another granted a power to withdraw accreditation of commercial premises, with only subjective criteria. A number of amending instruments provided for unreviewable discretions although the principal instrument provided for review of similar discretions; one of these included a number of decisions affecting the commercial operations of a casino operator. One instrument provided a discretion to recover the costs of an inquiry into a business operator. Another provided a discretion to release commercially sensitive information. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised of review rights in respect of a discretion, but it was not apparent what these were. One instrument provided a discretion to exempt certain containers and packs from mandatory standards. The Explanatory Statement for another advised that a discretion was intended to operate as a sanction for a certain commercial decision. Another instrument provided a discretion relating to the operation of a pharmacy.

        With euthanasia, the patient gives up all control to the doctor. John Stuart Mill insisted that one could not in the name of freedom sell oneself into unfreedom. This is why we maintain that people cannot freely sell themselves into slavery. This is why our laws reject consent to bodily harm as a defence in a court.

        Euthanasia involves quality of life judgments by the doctor about the patient. If a physically well person is suicidal, we provide them with counselling and care. Witness our response to the tragedy of youth suicide. If an ill person is suicidal, the Doctor decides that care is no longer required. In the doctor's mind, death becomes an option.

        Indeed, Professor Singer has extended his principle to the conscious, but handicapped infant.

        Proponents of euthanasia already argue that a lethal injection can be given to a person incapable of consenting.

It means that, if the banks are not paying them interest at what is called the deeming rate, they are taxed on that interest anyway. So they do not get the money, but they are taxed on it. This will recoup an extra $40 million for the government. Meanwhile, Newcrest, a big mining corporation, is to be handed $53 million through a rebate of its taxes on diesel fuel.

Meanwhile, in a three&amp;hyphen;year period, Mt Isa Mines has had $63 million handed to it on a platter in tax rebates. So $67 million is to be taken out of the hands of those people who are struggling to get a job—money which would help give them a bit of advantage in getting that job rather than staying unemployed—but $63 million was handed across to Mt Isa Mines—no questions asked, thank you very much. Similarly, CRA has been given $124 million over three years. But, in the coming four years, rent assistance for single people in shared accommodation is going to be cut by $110 million. The government will rip it out of the pockets of young folk in particular, simply because they are sharing accommodation with somebody else—young folk who are struggling to make ends meet and who will be down to $40 or $50 to live on—but hand it across on a platter to one giant mining company that has executives on more than a million dollars a year.

I wish to make some comments specifically about one grossly unfair measure for elderly Australians. This relates to the matter of deeming the earnings of superannuation for people who turn 55. In commencing my remarks, I would like to quote—this is an unusual procedure—the words of the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, Senator John Watson. He is not a Labor senator, very obviously. Senator Watson provided the best summary of the magnitude of the uncertainty and instability that schedule 1 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 has caused. Senator Watson said:

Yet you are asking our elderly citizens to look at rearranging their affairs.

        On budget night, the Liberals announced the removal of the means test exemption on superannuation assets and rollover funds for people aged 55. In announcing this measure, the government stated that people aged 55 and over who have retired and who will have poor prospects of returning to work should
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         use all the assets at their disposal, including superannuation assets, to provide for themselves before turning to the community for support through the social security system.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This measure will immediately and directly affect 67,000 Australians who are currently aged between 55 and the age pension age using income support payments in order to survive. The Liberals' claim, certainly initially, was that this measure will catch rorters and double-dippers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sadly, for the 67,000 Australians who will be affected by this measure, it is a vastly different story. Of the 67,000 Australians affected, about half are currently in receipt of a disability support pension. And of the 67,000 Australians, less than seven per cent—and I emphasise this: less than seven per cent—have over $200,000 in superannuation or rollover funds. These are not the wealthiest members of our society. For many of the 67,000 Australians affected, their only real chance of long-term security and stability is the superannuation asset or rollover fund they will have when they turn 60 or 65.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Liberals speak of the 67,000 Australians directly affected by this measure as being effectively retired. Yet the people that I spoke to and those who provided evidence—there have been many, many hundreds of people who have written to the Labor opposition about this matter and there were at least five or six who gave direct evidence to the committee—want to work. They want to be able to provide for themselves. They do not want to rely on income support payments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many of the 67,000 Australians affected have been retrenched and are unable to find new employment, for a range of reasons. We all know that the work force has undergone dramatic and radical change over the last decade—dramatic structural change, technological advances and trends towards casualisation and much greater mobility—for example, contracting out. These trends are well known in the employment market.

         Demographically, what is interesting about the 67,000 people who will be affected by this measure, those in their late 50s, is that, overwhelmingly they are white men who have lost their job, usually as a result of redundan cies or retrenchments as a consequence of structural changes in our economy. It is structural unemployment. It has also been shown that, for the majority of the men retrenched or made unemployed in this age bracket, the likelihood of finding new employment is extremely low.

        We had some heart-rending evidence given to us by a 55&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old former rail worker from Port Pirie in South Australia who cannot get another job. We had some heart-rending evidence provided by a bank employee from Launceston, in my home state of Tasmania. At the age of 55 and single, he can get another job, on occasions, but certainly not as a bank employee. He is supporting and putting his two children through university. We had the heart-rending story of an electrician who was made redundant by the Victorian Liberals. He is 55 and cannot get another job. This is fairly typical, unfortunately, of many people in this age bracket.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The cynics would suggest that this effective retiring of unemployed people at the age of 55 is a means for the Liberals to appear as though they are tackling the problem of long-term unemployment, because it will certainly reduce it by some 60,000-odd people. As I have said earlier, half of these 67,000 people, 35,000 Australians, affected by this measure, are currently on the disability support pension. These are people who are sick or disabled and therefore incapable of working. To require these people to draw down on their superannuation is a sign of a government without compassion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I remind the Senate: where was this measure in the Liberal Party's election manifesto? Where was it in Meeting our Commitments? You can search it, but you will not find this particular harsh draconian measure on aged Australians anywhere in the Liberal Party manifesto. The government wants people who have turned 55 and who are on government benefits to retire and use their superannuation so it can claim that it has tightened the social security net and made net savings on the budget.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are two points to be made in this context. People will have to formally retire—that is, never again seek work in excess of 10
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         hours a week—so they may access part or whole of their superannuation assets or rollover funds. These individuals will have to sign a statutory declaration, having turned 55, stating that they are no longer seeking work—even if they want to—and will not seek work in future so that they may access their superannuation funds. They have no alternative. They have to access their superannuation because their government benefit—be it unemployment benefit or disability pension—has been cut. Once they cease to look for work, they will no longer satisfy the activity tests for jobsearch or newstart allowance, rendering them ineligible. At this point, the only money they will have to survive on will be their superannuation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, what will happen when, in 10 years time, these people have used a part or all of their superannuation and they are totally reliant on the provision of the age pension? Gone will be the dream of many Australians to have a comfortable and relaxed retirement and old age. They will be rendered completely dependent on the continuing provision of the age pension. Some Australians will have to live in relative poverty that has haunted—and been a great fear of—their parents and their grandparents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor introduced the superannuation guarantee charge in 1992. Labor introduced universal superannuation so that all Australians would have the opportunity to have a comfortable, relaxed and secure retirement. What this government is doing is effectively delaying social security expenditure. The more people who are dependent on the age pension, the bigger the drain on the budget. By forcing people to fund their own sickness or unemployment benefits at the age of 55, the government is making all future Australian taxpayers fund the baby boomers' age pension requirements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was interesting that, when we took evidence from the department, it did not show the effect of requiring people to take their superannuation in part or in whole when they reached the age of 55 and what the extra costs will be in five or 10 years time when those people reach retirement age and are collecting in part or in whole a higher pension.
       </para>
       <break page="7363" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation asked the Department of Social Security about modelling showing the effect on the budget and on national savings. The department was told the committee had not undertaken any modelling, nor had Treasury and Finance. That is, there are no figures that show how this measure will affect the budget over the longer term, and there is no modelling as to the effects of this measure on national savings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It will undoubtedly increase costs to the budget longer term in respect of pensions, and the department admitted that. It will undoubtedly reduce national savings—again, the department admitted that. But they could give us no specific figures because they had carried out no specific modelling. Remarkably short&amp;hyphen;sighted!
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, this measure will actively discourage Australians to save. The irony of this measure is that it directly discriminates against the 67,000 Australians who,  over the last 10, 20 or 30 years—under both Labor and Liberal governments—have decided to forgo income, to sacrifice recurrent expenditure and to put money away in superannuation for their retirement. They were actively encouraged by both this government and the former Labor government to do so. They were told that it would be available for their retirement years. Now, when they need help to continue work or need to be cared for during sickness or disability, they are being told they will have to use their retirement savings nest egg—their superannuation—when they reach the age of 55.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          As ASFA and the Retire Investment representatives informed the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, this measure has caused massive uncertainty and instability in the general community over the purpose of a retirement savings policy. It does not just concern those people who are very close to the age of 55 or who are already 55. About 900,000 Australians are currently aged between 50 and 55. There are 1.2 million Australians aged between 45 and 50 who are now asking themselves: was it worth putting money aside—in many cases voluntarily—and sacrificing expenditure for the sake of super annuation? Again, we could get no modelling from the government on this matter.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is likely that over the next 10 years the figure of 67,000 people affected in part or in whole by this very harsh measure will grow to 300,000, perhaps to 350,000 or 360,000. They will be required to draw on their superannuation asset when they are 55 because they cannot access unemployment or disability benefits in part or in whole.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This measure will affect so many Australians over the next two years because of the effects of the superannuation guarantee contribution. As I said earlier, Labor introduced this measure in 1992. It is currently at six per cent, growing to nine per cent. There is the possibility—I say `possibility' because I think the government will renege on this promise—of an additional three per cent employee contribution and a three per cent government co-contribution. So the moneys in superannuation accounts over the next decade is going to rise exponentially.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, members have an average of $38,000 in superannuation. I know the minister is very fond of quoting this figure.

         The level in superannuation is currently $38,000. It has doubled over the last five or six years because of the effect of the superannuation guarantee charge.

         —Schedule 13 of this bill revises the disability impairment tables used in assessing a person's eligibility for the disability support pension. Impairment tables were first introduced by the ALP in the late 1980s to stem the growth in the number of people claiming the invalid pension and long-term sickness allowances.

         The introduction of these tables was one of the first steps in a very strong push to move people with disabilities off income support and into the work force. This was also a driving force behind the ALP's decision to replace the invalid pension with the disability support pension and its associated policies in 1991 and it is one of the driving forces behind the revised disability impairment tables that we are considering today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To qualify for a DSP, a person must meet three basic criteria. First, they must have a physical, intellectual or psychological impairment. Secondly, that impairment must be assessed at the rate of 20 per cent or more under the current impairment tables. Thirdly, their inability to work must be a continuing one. These criteria will not change under the new legislation, but the revised impairment tables would make it harder for people to qualify for the DSP.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason these new impairment tables will make eligibility harder is that they lower the ratings attached to many impairments and they do not allow the department to take into account non-medical factors which might impact on an individual's work related abilities. As a result, many people who currently receive the DSP will be thrown off this benefit if these tables are adopted. They will also become ineligible for the many programs which are specifically designed to help them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An estimated 34,000 people will lose their eligibility for DSP if these tables are adopted, and a further 5,000 people a year who would previously have been eligible will no longer qualify. These people will have to move over to other forms of income support, principally newstart. They will have to look for work and they will have to meet the relevant activity test, with any breach of this activity test being punishable by the withdrawal of income support for extended periods of time. Clearly, schedule 13 of this bill has the potential to leave many people with disabilities without any form of income at all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Democrats believe that there are a number of problems with this bill. These include the fact that once people are deemed ineligible for the DSP they will have reduced access to employment programs specifically
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          designed to help them. People who are currently receiving the DSP will be forced to compete with 8.7 per cent of unemployed Australians for jobs which we know do not exist. Meeting the activity tests applicable to newstart and other benefits may be very difficult for some  people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities and mental illness. People who breach the activity test associated with newstart will be left for extended periods without any income and no real support to help them get a job.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Democrats simply cannot see how throwing people with disabilities off income support and other programs specifically designed to assist them can be either a positive or a desirable thing to do. I am not saying that there is not a very real place for encouraging and assisting people with disabilities to enter or re-enter the work force if that is what they are reasonably able to do, nor am I saying that people should be able to get the DSP without having to meet some kind of criteria, but there is a need for policies and mechanisms which ensure that people are not able to abuse the system in this area. However, when it comes to addressing the needs of people with disabilities, there is also a need to fully recognise the additional burdens that many of these people face.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us be brutally frank here: people with disabilities are still amongst the most disadvantaged groups of people in Australia today. That is because they face isolation and discrimination which comes from public ignorance and misunderstanding, and it is because there has been an acute reticence on the part of state and federal governments in this country to take the issues which affect them very seriously.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These revised impairment tables have more to do, I think, with the bottom line than with creating a better system for people with disabilities. As far as I am concerned, that is nothing less than deplorable. The tables contained in schedule 13 of the bill measure the impact of the person's impairments on their ability to work from a purely medical and, I believe, completely isolated perspective.

        <break page="7366" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the major flaws with these new tables is that they do not take into account the wider factors which may exacerbate a disabled person's work related abilities. This is in stark contrast to the disability impairment tables introduced in the late 1980s which were based on the concept of a whole person approach. A person's eligibility for the pension was determined by adding together a number of factors which included their disability, their age, their previous work experience, their ability to speak English and the availability of the type of work a person with those characteristics might reasonably be able to perform. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Let me remind the Senate that the Democrats opposed the ALP when they moved to cut back on these additional factors as well.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We do not believe that the revised disability impairment tables are acceptable in their current form. Nor do we believe that in their current form they will do anything to improve the lives of people with disabilities. We believe the adoption of these tables would leave many people with disabilities a great deal worse off. As a consequence, we will be moving a series of amendments to this section of the bill which we think will go a long way towards rectifying some of the most glaring shortfalls of the bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill itself includes the artificially low impairment ratings designed to get as many people as possible off the DSP, the lack of recognition of the greater effects caused by multiple impairments, the absence of a table to assess chronic pain and fatigue based illness. Our amendments were put together with the help of people who are experienced in the disability area so that they would reflect the real needs and experiences of people with disabilities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, I would like to stress that the Democrats have very real concerns about the effect that these impairment tables will have on the lives of people with disabilities. I urge all those senators who share this concern about the plight of disabled people and the effect of the revised tables to support our amendments to this section of the bill.

         —The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill deals with mainly two issues. One is the government's decision to include superannuation entitlements for the purposes of social security income and assets tests where a person is between the ages of 55 and 65. This was dealt with quite extensively by Senator Sherry and I do not intend to deal with it any further. The second item that is contained in the bill is a reduction in the maximum rate of rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation. I would like to speak in detail about this matter as to date we have not dealt with it, except in a fairly minimal way.

        Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the maximum rent assistance which is available for single people in shared accommodation. The bill reduces the rent assistance available for single people sharing accommodation by a third of the maximum rate that is normally applied. Within the proposed new subsection 5A(1), the definition of a person who is single is: someone who is not a couple, has no dependent children and who shares with one or more people at least one major accommodation area, for example, a bathroom, kitchen or bedroom.

        What is the government's reasoning behind this issue? The government believes its measure ensures greater equity in rent assistance between couples and single people sharing. It believes economies of scale means a person living in shared accommodation will have reduced costs and this should affect the amount of rent assistance a person receives. But this logic is inherently flawed. It misses the entire point of what rent assistance is about.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Rent assistance is not about buying food. It is not about assistance with school books or the general expenses of life. Rent assistance is what it clearly states: it is about assistance with paying rent. Existing arrangements already take into account economies of scale. Currently, eligibility criteria ensure that where enough people are sharing a house and the rent for each person drops below a designated level rent assistance is not payable.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The Tenants Union of Queensland said in its submission that single people sharing accommodation will still pay a minimum of 30 per cent of their income on rent before they receive any assistance. If rent payable drops below this level, then they no longer eligible for rent assistance. The concept of economies of scale where people will share additional costs is presumptuous about what share household living is about. The Tenants Union further noted that couples will share a  range of household expenses but people in a share household who are not couples, who are not intimately involved, often cover their own individual expenses.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">

         The Housing Assistance Service also remarked in its submission that share house holds are not usually happily bonded environments, particularly when they live in adverse economic circumstances, where each of them is not very well off as they often rely only on social security.

        The Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants Federation said in its submission to the committee that older renters are very serious about keeping their affairs private, and they will often not share expenses and therefore achieve any sort of economy of scale. The maximum rent assistance a couple can get is $70.40, and for a single person it is $74.60 a fortnight. A single person must pay $71.40 in rent before he or she is eligible for rent assistance, and a couple must pay a minimum of $116.20.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A couple occupies one bedroom and a single person occupies one bedroom. The amount of rent is therefore not reduced in proportion to the number of people sharing a household, as rents go up with the number of bedrooms within the house. Only the other living costs are reduced if they are reduced at all by sharing. A single person living alone and paying more than $68.90 a week can get more rent assistance than a person who pays the same amount but lives with other people. Is that fair? What this government is doing with the stated objective of resolving one inequity is creating another glaring inequity.

It is very hard to find single accommodation. There are very few one bedroom flats or similar accommodation in cities, particularly large cities such as Melbourne and Sydney. The rental market is simply not geared towards providing this sort of accommodation. Young people, as I have said, will be most hurt by this situation, as 65 per cent of 15&amp;hyphen; to 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds that live away from home live in shared accommodation.

They may be seeking employment in these difficult times or they may still be students. But the end result is that they are some of the poorest paid members of our community, and they are a group that certainly are at risk of suffering the most under these changes.

        Rents in Sydney are so high that sharing accommodation is nearly always the only alternative available for young people. The National Youth Coalition for Housing points out that in Adelaide, where rents are lower, people will not be affected as much by this measure.

It creates a situation where they may have to move from cheaper accommodation where they are sharing to an area outside the main centres of the city. They may have to move to areas where support mechanisms are fewer, where transport is less available, where services are fewer and where in most cases job opportunities are fewer.

        As I have said, the second group most affected are pensioners. A 1995 report by National Shelter into housing costs found that women over the age of 60 spend nearly 40 per cent of their income on rent. The Australian Council of Social Service says that this measure may provide an incentive for people such as the frail, the elderly or disabled to continue to live alone, particularly in circumstances where they really should not, where they would be better off sharing with others. So the end result is that hundreds of people currently sharing accommodation will suddenly face a one-third drop in their rent assistance.

        The impact on many people's sharing will be dramatic. As I said, many will be forced to move into areas where there is less employment or where rents for individual homes are higher and infrastructure is poorer. The Department of Social Security will also have extensive paperwork and a nightmare in collecting detailed information. There will be more than they have ever had before. They will have to collect data not just on people's income and assets but on the more intimate details of their lives. They will need to know where people are living, what sort of homes they are in and exactly what portions of the house they share, be it bathrooms, kitchens or a different room. The department will need to ask these questions to comply with this new legislation. People will have to fill out quite a large number of new forms to make sure that recipients are entitled to the amount of rental assistance they are claiming.

        In conclusion, I am continuously surprised by this government's failure to appreciate the damage that they are doing to pensioners and young people in this community. When we were in government and this present government was in opposition, I was quite well aware of the difference in principle and policy between the two parties. However, I must confess that I was not aware of the extent of the harshness that would be visited on people in our community, especially those whom this government mouths platitudes about protecting, such as the elderly and the young. It is extraordinarily sad. I hope during the Christmas cheer which those opposite will experience overseas and here that they will examine their conscience and reconsider.

         —I also rise to address these two bills, particularly the rent assistance legislation. Before moving to it, I want to highlight two other items that are being included in this legislation. One is the abolition of the earnings credit scheme. This scheme was introduced not a great number of years ago to encourage people to take part-time work or casual work. It offered them a buffer to protect them from sudden changes of income that they would experience when finishing temporary and casual work, such as itinerant fruit picking. This is now gone and it will impact upon people.

        The other item is amendments relating to debt recovery. People will now be forced to repay debts that they may owe the department even when it is the department's fault that overpayments have been made. People are going to be penalised not because they have made a mistake but because the department has made a mistake. It is one of the most cruel, callous, heartless and uncaring things that you could possibly think of.

        I want to deal with the rent assistance legislation. I dealt with this in a fair degree of detail in estimates, endeavouring, as Senator Neal pointed out, to get some facts and figures on the table. I wanted to find out the number of people who will be affected by this. I wanted a breakdown of the types of people, the situations in which they were living and how they would be affected. I am sorry, afraid and saddened that the department could not give me that information. They do not know how many people with disabilities in shared accommodation and in receipt of rent assistance will be affected. They do not know how many people in boarding and lodging places in the inner city, particularly in the city I am aware of, will be affected. It seems very sloppy that the government can bring in legislation and say in the budget and the estimates how much they think they will save, yet when you actually peel away the layers to find out why they think that, you do not discover it and it is not there.

        I will quote one letter that appeared in the carers newspaper from the New South Wales division of the Carers' Association. It is a story of a mother and daughter. The daughter has worked for many years of her life and is now in receipt of a carers pension. The mother is an age pension recipient. They both get rent assistance because they are renting a two bedroom unit. You do not rent anywhere in Sydney and have much change left over on that income. Rents in Sydney are very high, despite what the national averages might be. The averages are distorted as far as the Sydney rents are concerned. You cannot say there are any similarities.

Unless somewhere along the line the people involved, I and everybody else have been reading incorrectly, this mother and daughter—the daughter is on a carers pension to look after her mother—will have their rent assistance cut. Before anybody starts saying that they are not paying sufficient rent to get the maximum rate, let me say that they are paying sufficiently high rates of rent to be in receipt of the maximum amount of rent assistance. As the story goes, they are. I suggest that you look at these cases.

         I also want to know what will happen to people who live in those grotty, awful boarding houses in inner city Sydney. They might be called boarding and lodging houses, but the tenants do not get any food there. The only things that move on the benches in these places are cockroaches. The tenants are each paying over $100 per week in rent. They are sharing the most squalid kitchens or kitchenettes and bathrooms.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From my understanding of this legislation, and from what I have been told previously, these people are affected as well because there is no meal component to the moneys they are paying out and they are sharing a kitchen or a bathroom. From my reading of this, that makes them subject to the cut to rent assistance. Many of these people are elderly, aged and frail. They may be people with disabilities, both physical and emotional or psychiatric. You cannot tell me the number of people involved in that. I ask you to talk to St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other organisations to see what the numbers are and to see what their comments are, because they are servicing their needs, along with the community health centres in the area. I will bet nobody has been to have any consultations or discussions with them.

         I also asked about the situation for people with disabilities living in shared accommodation. We have had this one shoved and pushed from pillar to post.

          shared supported accommodation type arrangements who are in the private rental market. The department and minister should not tell me that they are boarding and lodging, and therefore they will be caught in the net because there is a boarding, a meal, component. When these people have supervision for 10 hours a week in their accommodation and they are on individual training programs and part of that program is to teach them how to be independent in their own home, to be able to cook their own meals, to be able to buy their own food, which is all part of their independent training program, do not tell me that is a board component. I have a lot more questions to ask about that, because I do not think the department and the minister have looked at the issues. I do not think they have identified the number of people who are going to be affected or where those people are.

         These are people who cannot just take any accommodation. They have to take accommodation that may be able to cover and help them with their physical needs, if they have physical disability. In a country area that I am aware of, public transport services are inadequate, so they have to be living in accommodation that is in the central area of the town or the city. Because there is no public transport system, they have to be somewhere where they can walk to their employment. These are the sorts of issues and cases that should have been thought through before this legislation was introduced.

         The other issue that relates to accommodation is that people on low incomes do not have any discretionary funds. They do not have the ability or the wherewithal to save enough for the bonds if they want to move. That is why they are forced into these grotty flatettes. That is why they search for accommodation that is within their means and is cheap. With some of the changes to this legislation, you are actually going to be forcing these people to stay in higher costing accommodation, because the cheaper accommodation is probably where there are no jobs. They are really caught in a cleft stick. They can go hungry and stay there and get a benefit—maybe get a benefit—or they can move somewhere to accommodation that they have more chance of affording, but they will lose their benefit.

         —The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 seek to implement an important part of the government's budget. These measures reflect the fairness and responsibility of the government in the budget as demonstrated by the overwhelming public support for the budget measures. These budget initiatives follow a number of key objectives of the government—keeping necessary commitments to the poor and needy, asking people with their own resources
         <break page="7381" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to rely more on those resources rather than seeking assistance from fellow citizens and taxpayers, introducing greater simplicity in our very complex social security system, treating those in like circumstances in a consistent manner, and stopping rorts.

        The 1996 budget continues the proud coalition history of social policy. In this budget, we have provided extra assistance to around two million families, including sole parents, through the billion dollar family tax initiative; we have, for the first time, set aside money in the budget forward estimates so that we can keep our commitment to maintain pension payments at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings; and we have listened to the welfare sector and sought to introduce some of their suggestions for reform.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Despite what the opposition has claimed, the government has largely kept its commitments to the poor and needy. Major concerns were expressed by ACOSS before the budget about possible budget cuts; none of those have been introduced by this government. This is a caring government for the poor. We accept that there are a number of measures we may have preferred not to introduce if we had been in the situation of inheriting a balanced budget.

       <para first-indent="16">
        But we all know that the previous Labor government, of which Senator Faulkner was a senior cabinet minister, misled the Australian people before the last election. We had a need to pay off that Beazley bankcard. The social security recipients have been treated very fairly in this process, while we have had to make much more substantial cuts in other portfolios.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the last five years of the Labor government, social security outlays grew by 35 per cent in real terms. The social security budget measures in total will reduce social security outlays by less than one per cent. This compares with the reduction in social security of three per cent by the Labor government in 1987 on that rare occasion when they were reducing government expenditure. These measures put in place our election commitments to provide extra assistance for carers, enhance voluntary work for

        There are also many fair measures in these bills which were announced by the government in the budget. These include taking greater account of the leave payments received by people leaving a job and the savings that they have before they can access social security payments. Redundancy payments are not affected by these provisions. People will also be able to use their savings to pay off debts without disadvantage. The proposed compensation arrangements are fair. Age pensioners receiving delayed settlements should have these taken into account in working out their payment. They will be treated fairly according to the individual circumstances of economic loss which they are compensated for.

        The proposed change in the devisor, away from $564.60 to the single pension cut&amp;hyphen;out point of around $400, will introduce a devisor which is closer to the earnings of the average Australian worker receiving compensation. This is fair. The activity test tightening measures will fulfil our election pledge to tighten up arrangements in this area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to have activity test arrangements which are respected by and, more importantly, complied with by the unemployed. This is essential to having a system of unemployment payments respected by the public at large and by the taxpayer who funds the payments. Opposition parties sometimes forget about the taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A critical element of the activity test system is penalties for non-compliance which act as a sufficient deterrent while at the same time being reasonable and simple. Unemployed people and DSS staff find it very difficult to understand the very complex system of penalties introduced by Labor several years ago. Labor should recognise that that mess they introduced needs changing—with sensible changes, as we are proposing. We have listened to the welfare rights campaigners, as they have acknowledged, so as to introduce a payment reduction rather than a complete
        <break page="7382" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         loss of payment as at present for administrative breaches, which comprise 50 per cent of all breaches.

       <para first-indent="16">
        With respect to activity test penalties, we are proposing to standardise the first activity breach at six weeks for all, which is the same as the current breach period which Labor imposed on long-term unemployed. We have then constrained the second and subsequent breach at 13 weeks rather than the non-limited compounding arrangement recently put in place by Labor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At this point, I will address the proposed second reading amendment from the Labor Party. I presume that they agree with the government that some tightening of the activity test provisions is warranted. It is quite different from what you put forward to the Australian people in the last election and even from comments from the shadow minister over recent months. If this does represent a recognition that the government was right all along in pointing out existing deficiencies with the activity test, I recognise your belated conversion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The community should be aware that the previous Labor government never provided labour market assistance for all long-term unemployed or other disadvantaged jobseekers. They cannot use this as an excuse for the complex system of activity test penalties which they put in place. Further, they just do not have the courage to admit the failures of their very rigid system of assistance with low job success rates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition is continuing to provide substantial labour market program and training assistance to the unemployed with greater regard to achieving job outcomes for the unemployed rather than simply recycling them through programs, as many people who have been unemployed will testify. We reject the Labor Party approach to link activity test requirements to the overall funding of labour market program assistance. It is a nonsense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have also recognised the need to be compassionate about activity testing for those who face extreme difficulties in the labour market. We will be relaxing the activity test for those very disadvantaged people unable to participate in labour market assistance. People
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         generally need to meet the activity test because they are receiving taxpayer funds in the  form of unemployment payments—no more, no less. This is what the Australian people and the vast majority of unemployed themselves accept, and it is what the government is seeking to introduce.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has taken a fair and reasonable approach to the activity testing provisions, with staff of the Department of Social Security having significant discretion to ensure that it is implemented fairly and with existing review and appeal mechanisms in place as added protection. These provisions do not require unemployed people to negotiate changes to the occupational health and safety conditions or training for the prospective job. They are simply required to raise the issue with the prospective employer and seek to come to a suitable resolution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The proposed abolition of the earnings credit, employment entry payments and education entry payments for allowees only still leaves social security recipients with significant work force incentives through the income test, particularly as a consequence of the July 1995 changes for allowance recipients. The $500 payment advance arrangements and assistance for new job starters available from the CES still enables social security recipients to meet equivalent employment and education entry costs, which they may face.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor Party also needs to face up to the fact that, despite their extensive efforts to publicise these measures, the take&amp;hyphen;up is very low and the intended impact on work force incentives has not eventuated. Where measures are not working, we believe it is appropriate to consider alternatives. These are already available in other forms, as I have explained.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The changes proposed for widows and partners are sensible, compassionate and would lead to a significant simplification of existing income support provisions for older women who face considerable difficulties getting a job. This also implements our election commitment to provide access to the widow allowance for those widowed, separated or divorced after age 40.

         We have sought to implement changes to the disability support payment impairment tables, picking up the results of the process of change started by Labor when they were in government. The previous Labor government recognised that there were some problems with the impairment tables which they introduced in 1991. In this bill we have merely sought to introduce the expert advice provided to the Labor government on the tables which they had not yet implemented before the last election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would caution the Senate about trying to go back to the pre-1991 arrangements, where disability payments were provided to many people who did not have medical impairments. The Labor Party was correct to move down that track. The changes in this bill simply propose some necessary refinements following the experience and some identified problems over the last five years, which the Labor government was moving to address.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another measure which the government recognises as necessary is the proposed changes to debt recovery. At the moment DSS can recover overpayments in a number of circumstances, such as when people lose qualification, when people are pre-paid and when their income estimate is wrong. In these and other circumstances there may be no fault or blame on the part of the customer in terms of informing the DSS, and the debt is still recoverable according to their capacity to repay. We are seeking to extend this principle to all overpayments, with the recovery process still dependent on the capacity of the individual to repay the debt.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such a change would increase the accountability of the Department of Social Security, as now they would be required for the first time to keep track of and report on all of these overpayments which are currently not recoverable. The reporting requirements would provide substantial incentive for the department to reduce these overpayments year by year, aside from the additional resources it costs DSS to raise and recover overpayments as opposed to getting the decision right in the first place. The government is willing to consider placing a reasonable time limit on the department to raise these debts.

          As I have mentioned before, this bill includes measures which asked those with access to substantial financial resources to look after themselves. Key among this is the very sensible proposal to remove the means test exemption on superannuation assets in the social security means test for those who can access superannuation from age 55. This seeks to overturn a recent loophole introduced by Labor only in 1993, and treats superannuation like any other financial asset. This is reasonable in view of the tax favoured nature of superannuation compared to other financial assets.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those with small superannuation savings, such as the $38,000 often touted by the Labor Party and referred to again by Senator Sherry earlier, will not be affected. Those with larger superannuation assets will not have to eat into their superannuation capital sum, but are being asked to use some of the income growth to support themselves. Those who cannot legitimately access the superannuation assets are protected from these provisions. The change to rent assistance proposed for sharers is a response to the ridiculous situation at the moment whereby two single people sharing accommodation can currently receive nearly $30 a fortnight more in rent assistance than a couple in the same accommodation. Can the opposition parties explain how that is fair? I do not think that they have succeeded today.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          After these changes suggested by the government, two single people sharing accommodation can still receive $30 a fortnight more in rent assistance than a couple in the same accommodation. I was wrong before: two single people sharing accommodation currently receive nearly $80 a fortnight more in rent assistance than a couple in the same accommodation. With the way rent assistance is structured, many young people will not be affected by this measure because they are paying lower rent contributions and not receiving the maximum level of rent assistance, which is possible at the moment.

         —We are debating in the second reading the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 and the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996 cognately. That is the first problem that we in the opposition have, because the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) has an arcane title. It does not convey anything to anybody, but it contains the very important measures of the collapsing of the tax incentive for research and development from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. It also contains the measures announced in a joint statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 23 July last that syndication—a way in which companies can group together and claim a tax advantage for research and development—is to be terminated.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These are matters of major national importance. These are matters that have occupied the business pages and the general reporting pages of most newspapers in the months since the announcement. There are matters of high controversy here. Industry hotly contest with the government the basis for chopping the 150 per cent to 125 per cent and certainly hotly contest the issues of removing syndication as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report upon which the government's decision is allegedly based is a report which,
        <break page="7385" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         I would contend, is flawed and is not a report that actually finds what the government claims it finds. In a press release of the joint ministers dated 23 July, the government attached four examples in which they alleged the tax system was being abused under syndication.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the evidence that was adduced before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which inquired into this legislation, we had a whole raft of Australian companies that came along and together claimed to represent about 93 to 94 per cent of companies who had applications for syndication before the Industry Research and Development Board. All of them said that the four examples the government had offered were not typical, did not resemble any of those that the companies had lodged—and they had lodged 94 per cent of them—would not have been approved under the IR&amp;D guidelines that were tightened by the former government in the innovation statement on 6 December last year and, therefore, would not apply currently; that is, the examples were fraudulent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I acknowledge, for its part, the government has stuck by the examples. But someone here is not telling the truth. The voice of industry is so overwhelmingly compelling on this that it does raise the question: why, if the government wants to encourage research and development—as it alleges it does, although that allegation would be laughable in the face of the measures in this bill—would the government want to throw out the baby with the bathwater on syndication? Why wouldn't it, if it felt there were some abuse of the system, deal with that abuse and let the overwhelming number of very good cases that promote Australian industry go ahead?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has not answered that question adequately in any way, shape or form. It is simply after the tax gain; it is not interested in the type of advantage Australian industry can get by good research and development, which will create intelligent jobs in this country, which will enable Australian industry to be more competitive internationally, which will enable us to grow our exports by manufactured goods and services and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         redress the problems of the current account deficit.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These issues are so important and so compelling that they ought not be buried in a bill which deals with five other measures. We in the opposition want to vote against the government on this. But—because of the way in which tax bill No. 3 is presented—to do so, we would have to vote against the whole six measures proposed by the government in this bill. I contend that this is a fraudulent way of presenting this legislation to the chamber.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I foreshadow now that at the end of my remarks I will move an amendment to the second reading. If the amendment is carried, one of the effects will be to enable the Senate to vote on the research and development components of tax bill No. 3 on their own rather than as part of an omnibus bill. One of the other effects of this will be to propose a series of steps in which syndication can be tightened so that the objective of the syndication scheme is realised. Therefore, further abuse, if any, can then be hived off and prevented so that this measure can perform its intended role and not simply be abolished. I intend to move that amendment at the end of my remarks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have said, this is a complicated set of bills. tax bill No. 3 has six separate measures—all of which are important. We are opposing three of them, and we are supporting three of them. But there is another bill that we are debating here today too, and that is the research and development bill. This is a bill that has been hanging around for a long time. It is a bill that, just over a year ago when I was on the other side of the chamber and the responsible minister, I proposed to enact in this parliament because it dealt with one of the abuses of research and development; it dealt with the grave digging abuse. We in the opposition support the principle of this bill entirely.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the evidence before the Senate committee revealed, however, is that there is a significant problem here that needs to be addressed. That significant problem is that, given the tortuous way in which companies apply for concessions under the research and development bill, they need to lodge an
        <break page="7386" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         application and have that application processed by the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism for it to be registered.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 6 December 1995, when the changes to the grave digging elements of this bill were announced, there was a backlog of companies that had lodged applications but had not been registered, and they had not been registered for no fault of their own. They had not been registered because of the unavailability of sufficient staff within the department to deal with the applications that had accumulated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This came out clearly in evidence before the inquiry. I understand this is a matter that the government itself proposes to redress as a consequence of the inquiry. I commend the government for moving its position to accommodate the reasonable concerns of industry here. We do not think they move far enough. I will have an amendment on that when we come to the committee stage. It will take the change the whole way and not just seven&amp;hyphen;eighths of the way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are two other elements of this bill that need to be mentioned before I return in my substantive remarks to research and development. The first one is the amendment to the cooperative companies section of the bill. This is an amendment which cuts out an advantage that cooperative companies in this nation have had for 36 years. Cooperative companies have had that advantage because, for 36 years, the governments in Australia have wanted to encourage the cooperative movement to acquire its capital goods and make investments in a way in which they can be encouraged to develop and flourish. The cooperative companies in Australia are, I think, unique. They are something that governments of all colours and hues have supported over the last 36 years. But, alas, the Howard government will not. The Howard government proposes to close down this tax concession on the basis that the very small amounts of money it will save go to the so&amp;hyphen;called bottom line argument for the budget, but without particular regard—and certainly without any investigation—of what the real effects on cooperatives will be. I think this is outrageous.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The cooperative movement, which is mainly rural based cooperatives based on farmers, is outraged about it. I will not speak at great length on this matter now because I know my colleague Senator Sherry and my other colleagues in this debate will speak at considerable length on it. But what I want to say is that the cooperative movement represents the small end of business. These are small business people banding together to create a cooperative company in order to establish a market advantage for themselves in contradistinction to the big end of town. This is now virtually the only sector of the food industry in Australia that is Australian owned—and here is the government quashing them. We will be moving to reverse the government's intention in the bill on that
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Lastly, before I go back to research and development, there is the mining rights issue. The mining rights issue is very important to my state of Western Australia because it applies primarily, but not exclusively, to goldmining. It is when small prospectors find gold or another designated mineral and wish to then develop their lease and on&amp;hyphen;sell that lease to a company which can mine it. They make their income by doing so. This is a provision that was inquired into in 1985 by the Gutman inquiry, and was required to stand. The now government, then opposition, voted with us in government to support that measure. It is interesting that they are now voting to remove that measure—something that they said they would not do they are now about to do.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, I understand the arguments on this issue. I think that all income in one form or another should be properly taxed, but there is a major issue here of retrospectivity. This is a major issue of retrospectivity which is complex and difficult to understand at first blush. This is because, in a way, it is retrospectivity that is dealt with prospectively. That sounds like a contradiction in terms. But one has to understand how the system works to understand that those people who currently hold mining leases or did so on budget night did so on the understanding that, when they did on&amp;hyphen;sell them, they would not be taxed. We will be moving an amendment which will
         <break page="7387" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          protect their rights. Anyone who has acquired or pegged a lease from budget night will have done so in the full knowledge that the government intended to close off that loophole and that, therefore, they should take their chances. There are 4,000 registered prospectors in Western Australia, 400 of whom are active at any one time. Those prospectors are not entitled to be dealt with retrospectively as the government intends. I know that my colleagues will speak further on this measure, in particular my colleague Senator Mark Bishop who is also from the state of Western Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I now have left to me something like eight minutes to address the very complex issue of research and development. That is a joke. The reason why it is a joke is that the government has bracketed these bills to prevent, I think, a full discussion, although I must say there has been quite an extensive Senate inquiry. I therefore commend for the record the findings of that inquiry, particularly the minority report of the Australian Democrat representative on that inquiry, Senator Andrew Murray—I thought he found in quite an important way in that inquiry—but, more particularly, if I might say so, because I think our report goes further, the minority report of Senator Sherry and myself. That contains a very long discussion of these issues. Our minority report is 22 pages. It deals at length with all these matters in detail. Let me try to summarise them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reduction of the tax incentive of 150 per cent to 125 per cent should not pass; it should not pass in the national interest. What the government is doing here in syndication is applying a narrow cost&amp;hyphen;cutting approach in taking a nominal saving which, if you take a whole of budget view, is in fact in all probability a nominal loss to the budget as well as a nominal loss to the economy of Australia. I say that with as much passion and force that I can summon for this reason: an index of a nation's future prosperity is the amount of private sector investment in research and development. It is axiomatic. Companies that commit to high levels of research and development are historically companies which succeed in the globalised competitive market of the future.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Australia is a laggard in this respect. On the most recent OECD figures, in the table on business expenditure on research and development, known as BERD, Australia ranks around 17th or 19th out of 24 OECD economies. We are down there with Turkey and Portugal and a few economies like that. That is not Australia's natural place in the world. The Labor government provided particular incentives—the 150 per cent incentive being the key one—to encourage Australian corporations and firms to spend more on research and development to become, therefore, more internationally competitive and to win in the international marketplace. What does this government do? Just as those companies are developing a research and development culture which is beginning to pay dividends for this nation—there is a whole raft of highly complex but very illuminating submissions here on the type of research and development that is going on in this nation—just as they are beginning to turn on to this, the Australian government chops them back and says that the incentives that it is providing will be competitive.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those incentives are not competitive. In any case, if we are competitive, we would be competitive with the most successful economies in the OECD bloc, and we are not. We need to actually provide a better incentive in order to lift ourselves up to their level of investment in research and development. Might I also add that by chopping the 150 per cent to 125 per cent, the government explicitly, openly and blatantly breaks its own election commitments. Before the election, Minister Moore and Treasurer Costello made it clear to Australian industry that 150 per cent was to remain. It was a solemn core promise. What we found on budget night was that it was an expendable, disposable promise and it is now to go.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All of the literature on research and development points to the significance of investment in research and development and the future health of the economy. Might I say that the government obviously has a more immediate, narrow, cost cutting view than the importance of the economy overall, and that is what has happened here. Important measures for
          <break page="7388" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           industry have been overridden in the pursuit of savings dollars, which are counterproductive in the longer term.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I return to syndication, because I think this is the most blatantly fraudulent myth that the government wishes to perpetrate on Australians. As I have said, in July, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism announced pre&amp;hyphen;emptively the termination of the syndication scheme. They did so on a report from the BIE—what they claim to be the BIE. In fact, if you look more closely, they were wrong. They were misleading. It was not the BIE; it was the department, with someone seconded from the BIE to help with that report.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That report is a theoretical model which does not go to what new evidence would have accumulated given the tightening of the guidelines on syndication that the previous government introduced on 6 December. There is insufficient time to get anything like a population of reasonable examples to know how that tightening would have operated. What we see in this so-called report is a theoretical modelling based on a series of assumptions rather than a case analysis of what actually is the case. The document on which this is based is flawed. As I said in my earlier remarks, no-one in industry recognises the samples that have been put forward to justify this change as so&amp;hyphen;called rorting of the tax system by syndication. The ministers have put them forward in their press release, and they stand condemned on that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am convinced that there is always a need to be vigilant when you provide a tax mechanism like this, because those with disposable income and desire for tax avoidance will always find ways around regulations once they are proclaimed. So you have to keep a watching brief on these things and change the guidelines as ways of subverting the intention of the guidelines are found. That is not a criticism of those who are currently before us. Surveying the type of R&amp;D that they want to do, I think they are all respectable companies and I think that those that have been listed on the A list have an entitlement to have their syndicates considered by the research and development board. These are companies who
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           were in full expectation of that before they were cut off at the pass by the statement of the ministers on 23 July.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The syndication scheme has worked well. It is a cost&amp;hyphen;plus scheme for Australia overall. It is not a cost&amp;hyphen;negative scheme. In my motion, I have set down where further tightening can occur in order to keep this scheme focused on its objective and to prevent tax avoidance. I ask the government to not throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Accept these suggestions for further tightening, allow the scheme to go on and allow the nation to harvest the opportunities that are there on research and development.

In the first place, the amendment splits the R&amp;D part from the tax laws bill No. 3 so that we can vote on that separately, as we should. In the second part, it sets down a whole range of areas in which, I believe, there can be tightening of syndication.

        The Australian Democrats will throw a lifeline to the Liberal and National Party senators and the House of Representatives members on this tax bill. I am well aware that this bill does not enjoy full support in the ranks of the coalition. The cabinet of the coalition is presiding over the worst conceived, most destructive, most short-sighted anti&amp;hyphen;business package of cuts and changes possible.

        Many senators and members are as appalled as I am by this package. You, the government, have deserted the small country businesses. You have deserted the dusty, hard&amp;hyphen;living prospectors. You have deserted the dynamic rural cooperatives, and you have deserted the productive farmers who are their members. You have deserted the clever university and institutional researchers. You have deserted the innovators and technologists of small business. You have deserted the competitive and hardy medium size businesses of Australia. You have deserted those big Australians who take on the world companies on their own terms. You have done so because you have cobbled together a hasty package of bills whose sole purpose is to look at the revenue side of your ledger.

        This bill has been repeatedly and devastatingly criticised by virtually every commentator, policy analyst and industry association that comes readily to mind. As with other industry bills that have been put before us, the evidence is conclusive that the broader impacts of these changes and budget cuts on productive R&amp;D, on industrial innovation and technological advancement, on the business sectors affected, on economic growth and directions, on environmental protection, or on Australia's overall international and domestic competitiveness have not been adequately evaluated by this government. That is why I refer to you having deserted what is supposed to be your own constituency.

        Once again, with this bill it is evident that the government, the Treasury and the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism have not undertaken—nor have they been directed to do so—appropriate and current cost benefit analysis, or sensitivity analysis or modelling, to assess the quantifiable impacts on jobs, investment, growth and competitiveness resulting from the specific policy changes it proposes.

        Under questioning by me during Senate estimates, a senior departmental official admitted not only that they were unable to confirm what the effect of winding down the 150 per cent tax concession to 125 per cent would be but also that it would be three years before the effects of these changes could properly be assessed. This means that, if the effects are profoundly negative, long lasting and detrimental—as numerous witnesses and industry representatives have claimed—important opportunities would be missed before remedial action can be taken.

        The Australian Democrats question the wisdom of taking on faith a radical leap—and it is a radical leap—into new business policy, new tax policy and new R&amp;D policy. How can we justify blindly trusting the judgment of those who hastily cobbled together a policy package whose sole and overriding objective is revenue and cost driven?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Democrats support a credible, responsible and timely budget deficit reduction strategy. I would remind government senators that last year they voted against a deficit reduction package that we put forward. We believe, however, that the government's assumptions overstate the speed and the extent of deficit reduction required. While Treasury forecasts of the size of the budget deficit are important and useful tools for underpinning policy objectives, it is important to recognise that it is impossible for them to be absolutely accurate—and they
        <break page="7391" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        For this reason, it is particularly important that cuts which undermine jobs, profits, industrial development and competitiveness be treated with real caution. When evaluating industry programs, it is most unwise to solely focus on just one side of the ledger—on cost and revenue savings—without focusing on the effects on jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness and without focusing on the revenue&amp;hyphen;positive benefits that such programs are capable of generating.

        The combination of a new and inexperienced government—I do not say that with any slander; it is just a fact—and the triumph of opportunistic ideological elements within the government and Treasury has been unhappy for business, industry, universities and R&amp;D programs. The government has failed to give due consideration to the fundamental importance of maintaining a stable policy environment for business planning and investment and for university and institutional research. The government has failed to recognise the fundamental importance of maintaining confidence in the certainty and durability of Australia's policy mechanisms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a matter of deep regret that, in the defence of some questionable decisions, some ministers—including within this chamber—have chosen the pejorative, unjustified and demonising route of referring to industry and export assistance programs as `business welfare' and `rorts' and the like. Such an approach does no justice to the serious policy concerns that need to be addressed and represents a disservice to Australia's reputation for objectivity and considered policy debate in this field.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has been widely criticised for the series of short&amp;hyphen;sighted and damaging anti-business decisions it has undertaken since gaining office—for example, the imposition of a three&amp;hyphen;per cent tax on imported business inputs, the abolition of the development import finance facility, cuts to business R&amp;D programs, cuts to export assistance programs and cuts to labour market programs, such as the new enterprise incentive scheme.

        The government has also been strongly and rightly criticised for lacking an industry policy which provides a vision, plan, direction or aspiration for Australian industry, both domestically and internationally. The sole policy aim of the government has been to find cuts to existing programs rather than to genuinely seek to invigorate or enhance existing policies and programs.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to deal with the 150 per cent issue. In slashing this tax concession to 125 per cent, the government shows that it has lost sight of the central role of research and development in creating and fostering internationally competitive industries. The 150 per cent tax reduction concession for eligible research and development expenditure was established in 1986 and has actually deteriorated in terms of its applicability, due to changes in the company tax rates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This concession is without doubt one of the major contributors to Australia's research and development successes and growth. I would suggest that, within the OECD and within the tiger economies, continued application of strong R&amp;D effort is absolutely essential if we are to not see a future scenario of Australia's gentle decline.

         per cent concession as one of the key factors responsible for the dramatic growth in business expenditure on R&amp;D which has occurred over the past decade. I was speaking to a senator earlier today and he said, `Oh, but it is going to cost the government such a lot of money if this does not go through.' I tell you: it will cost a lot more money if it does go through, and I would urge you to reconsider.

        Despite the strong efforts of some firms in industrial sectors, Australia's overall private sector R&amp;D performance remains by international standards very low and can be described in some ways as appalling, because we have one of the lowest ratios of business expenditure on R&amp;D to GDP in the OECD. I would say to you, as someone with considerable international experience: that is a waste of the outstanding intellectual capital we have in this country. Even our growth rates in business input to R&amp;D, which until recently were relatively high, have dwindled and are now mediocre in comparison with our international competitors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the government responds, led by a set of people who I do not think understand this field, by reducing the 150 per cent tax concession to a top rate of 125 per cent. It may be in their terms a good way of getting headline figures about ensuring short-term budget savings, but we do not believe this is a means of ensuring genuine, lasting, long-term economic development. We expect that the coalition will be in power for two terms and we think they will rue this policy if they allow it to go through.

        If the government really wants Australian industry to prosper, if it is serious about making Australia a key centre for research and development in the Asia-Pacific region, then it will need to rethink its approach and not walk away from its commitments.

        The government claims that this tax concession is very generous compared with other international measures. This criticism is not well founded. In an extremely competitive world environment, it is probable that Australia needs to increase and not decrease its business R&amp;D incentives.

         I now turn to the matter of syndication. Syndication has been subject to a particularly nasty form of demonising by ministers of this government. I, too, have had people whispering in my ear about the rorts, but I have to rely on credible evidence. No credible evidence whatsoever has been provided in any parliamentary or public forum for the exist ence of rorts in approved R&amp;D syndication schemes. Where previously there was some inefficient or inappropriate approval of syndication applications, the tightening of eligibility and screening criteria in December 1995 was effective in providing for tighter processing of applications, and that has been acknowledged by both the department and the government.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          (No. 3) 1996 is an omnibus bill of nine separate amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. I do not propose to speak on each and every item but I wish particularly to focus my remarks on cooperatives; namely, the repeal of section 120(1)(c) of the tax act which would deny cooperatives one of their few effective sources of funds to enable capital expansion.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Before I do so, I would like to make a few short comments on one other provision in the bill. The new provision that provides for an income tax rebate for low income earners is welcomed and supported by the opposition. The only point I wish to make here is the increase in costs employers will incur in having to vary their payroll systems to cater for the rebate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not raise this as a criticism of the initiative but when this increase is added to the costs employers will face in keeping a record of the background of employees who qualify for the family tax initiative, as well as the increased costs that employers will face from the administration of the new $1.5 billion superannuation tax, one must wonder when all of the coalition's rhetoric about reducing paperwork faced by small business will in fact become a reality. From this series of government initiatives it appears the government is more intent on increasing the paperwork burden than decreasing it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having made some comments in this area, I now want to address the removal of section 120(1)(c) of the tax act and the effect this will have on the many thousands of cooperatives—I was surprised it is over 2,500 cooperatives—which mainly operate in rural and regional Australia. This section of the act dates back to 1930 when it was introduced to recognise the unique nature of cooperatives by virtue of their status of being owned by their members. As the evidence tendered to the Economics Legislation Committee demonstrated, cooperatives face disadvantages not faced by other trading enterprises in their efforts to raise capital to fund capital expansions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Cooperatives are precluded from raising equity capital through public share floats. As such their only source of funds is from capital
        <break page="7394" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         raised from their own members, who have limited funds, particularly in times of a rural downturn, internal funds generated by the use of section 120(1)(c) or external borrowings. Evidence tendered to the committee suggested that banks view cooperatives as an inherently riskier investment due to their unique status as a cooperative. Consequently, cooperatives have to pay a risk premium in the form of higher interest rates on external borrowings than that enjoyed by public companies.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This discrimination would appear to be totally unfounded and one must wonder how banks will view cooperatives in the future when assessing an application for borrowings, given that the repeal of this section will only decrease the amount of internal funds generated and therefore available for the repayment of loan borrowings. Given this scenario, I can only see banks seeking to charge a higher rate of interest to compensate them for the increased risk due to the decrease in available cashflow that cooperatives will have to repay external loans if this section of the bill is passed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It interesting to note that no supporting evidence was given to support the view that cooperatives were inherently riskier investments than other trading enterprises. Nonetheless, this would appear to be a real barrier to cooperatives securing external funds on terms as equal as other business borrowers. This highlights the importance of the continued maintenance of section 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act and how it provides one of the few avenues for cooperatives to access funds for capital expansion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But as is quickly becoming the hallmark of this government the repeal of the cooperatives provision is yet another bash the bush exercise by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on top of the slashing of funds to rural and regional Australia and the one-third sale of Telstra that will see higher costs for local calls and most probably restricted access to new technology for rural subscribers. I note the laugh from the other side but I believe in a few years you will live to regret these anti-bush, anti-rural and regional, measures.

         What is most surprising is the avid and unwavering support given by the National Party as they help the economic dries led by the Prime Minister and his Treasurer to sell out the interests of rural and regional Australia on the alter of economic rationalism. Black Jack McEwen, as he was known, must be turning in his grave as he watches the supposed leadership of the National Party sell its soul to the Liberal Party for little or no gain.

         What has become of the National Party? I always thought that a coalition implied equal standing, equal say and equal respect among the parties involved. But here we have a coalition where one partner, the National Party, has been gagged, bullied and berated to the point where it is no more than a poor cousin to the Liberal wets. The National Party struggles for relevancy and is slowly fading away to the point where it will no longer even be considered relevant unless they take a stand on the sorts of issues that we are considering in this legislation today.

         This bill does present an opportunity for the National Party. It is their opportunity to draw a line in the sand and say no to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The National Party needs to be honest to themselves and realise they got conned on Telstra—and there is growing public evidence from National Party members about that each day—they got duped on funding to rural and regional Australia in the budget, they got done on imported chicken meat, despite their protestations prior to the last election, and they are slowly getting

         What I would like to know is why it is so hard for the National Party to say, `We are going to stand up for rural and regional Australia?' I particularly say to two senators in this place, Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee: come down and stand up for rural and regional Australia, stand up for the interests of cooperatives which you tell them privately you are going to do but publicly we will wait and see what you do.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         I suspect that they will do nothing. I hope that Senators Boswell and O'Chee have read the remarks made by their own National Party colleagues in the other place. But, if they have not, I would like to remind them and remind the Senate about the comments made by some National Party members in the other place. The member for Dawson (Mrs De&amp;hyphen;Anne Kelly) said: The benefit of cooperatives is easily seen . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         She later went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A cooperative has considerable disadvantages compared to a company. They are not in a level playing field situation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Anthony, the son of the former Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, said that cooperatives are:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . extremely important for Australia's rural constituency.
        </para>

         He further said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The great benefit of cooperatives is that they are always run and owned by Australian businesses . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         But the statement which sums up the importance of cooperatives to the National Party and the statement which I draw to their attention, in particular, Senators Boswell and O'Chee, is the statement by Mr Anthony, which said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        <para>
         Mr Anthony, the member for Richmond, could not have put it more succinctly. `Cooperatives are part of the heart and soul of the National Party.' Yet here we have before us a bill which will drive a stake through the heart of the National Party, according to Mr Anthony; a bill designed to destroy one of the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          main underpinnings of rural business enterprises in Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I say to Senators Boswell and O'Chee, who have been furiously trying to reassure cooperatives, particularly in Queensland, to come down and stand up for rural and regional Australia. Stand up for farmers. Stand up for what you represent. Stop being a doormat, and start saying no to the destruction of rural cooperatives in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If Senators Boswell and O'Chee are not convinced by their own colleagues in the other place, then I would ask them to look closely at the evidence presented by the cooperatives themselves to the Economics Legislation Committee. Let me quote from the report. The Mackay Sugar Cooperative Association said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the major motivation for the operation and formation of cooperatives is the desire for primary producer members to control the processing and marketing of their produce.

        <para>
         The submission then went on to state:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         They should therefore continue to be taxed on the same basis.
        </para>
        <para>
         Golden Circle, another Queensland company, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The government's principle of competitive neutrality is focused on domestic competitiveness within specific industries and ignores the fact that cooperatives compete in export markets where foreign primary producers are often subsidised and multinational companies have access to cheap finance.
        </para>
        <para>
         These are two major Queensland cooperatives that have put forward the case for the retention of section 120(1)(c). The question is: are Senators Boswell and O'Chee going to support the cooperatives of Queensland and their members, or are they going to sell them out for a relatively modest total gain against the total budget of $12 million over three years? Is that what the heart and soul of the National Party is worth—a lousy $4 million a year?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="7396" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          It is my honest belief that Senator Boswell is a man with both a heart and a soul, particularly when it comes to representing the interests of his National Party constituency. I am sure that Senator Boswell will not sell out the cooperatives of Queensland for $4 million a year. It is a shame that his colleagues in the House did, though. And I have drawn atten tion to a number of comments they made about this matter. At the end of the day they were quite happy to remain a doormat of the Liberal Party and support this attack on rural cooperatives.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Senator Boswell has become a strident critic of competition policy reform and its impact on rural and regional Australia. Only recently Senator Boswell said in this place:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Not enough time has been devoted to the ramifications of Hilmer on the fortunes of small business.
        </para>
        <para>
         I therefore ask: what assurances have the National Party got on the ramifications that the repeal of section 120(1)(c) will have on the future of cooperatives, which are in the main small business enterprises? My guess is they have none and that the transitional provisions in the bill are no more than a few crumbs the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has thrown the National Party in the hope that they will go away.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that this worked in the House because the National Party members en bloc voted for this measure, but I certainly hope that Senator Boswell will not be so easily conned. Just in case Senator Boswell has any doubts as to the motivation for the repeal of this section, I refer him to the remarks made by Mr Miles, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, when he introduced this bill in the House. He said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The measures will prevent the effective 200 per cent tax deduction which was previously available for the cost of certain assets and which provided cooperatives and government lending institutions with commercial and taxation advantages over other companies. These advantages are not justifiable and are inconsistent with competitive neutrality principles.
        </para>
        <para>
         This assault on the many thousands of rural and regional cooperatives is driven by the fact that the Liberals consider section 120(1)(c) to be inconsistent with competitive neutrality principles. Once again, the economic rationalists of the Liberal Party want to deny cooperatives one of their main sources of funding, because it does not comply with the objectives of competition policy.
        </para>

         I now turn specifically to Mr Miles and his comments. Mr Miles and his avid support for
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          this bill paid no regard for his own electorate of Braddon, in north&amp;hyphen;west Tasmania, and in particular the expansion plans of UMT, a cooperative that employs 346 people and generated sales of $171 million in 1995-96. If Mr Miles had any concern for UMT, which is based in his electorate of Braddon, he would be aware that his government and the Australian Taxation Office are now trying to reinterpret section 120(1)(c) of the tax act, which would be to the detriment of UMT's $45 million expansion at Spreyton.

         The Spreyton project was predicated on the interpretation of section 120(1)(c)—an interpretation which has been relied upon for the last 60 years—that cooperatives which borrow funds from a government or government instrumentality and subsequently use those funds to purchase an asset will be entitled to the full deduction under section 120(1)(c).

         The government, through the Australian Taxation Office, is trying to reinterpret this section so that only assets purchased from a government will be eligible for the deduction. This is a blatant attempt to deny legitimate deductibility to cooperatives that have entered into contracts in good faith. I will read a letter to UMT signed by the acting assistant commissioner of the legislative services branch of the Hobart division of the Australian Taxation Office. It is pleasing to see a member of the National Party in here at last listening to these comments about cooperatives.

This was recognised. The Labor government sought, through a variety of assistance and incentive schemes, to turn around this nation's investment in research and development. In 1983, commercial invest ment was at 0.23 per cent of GDP. Through government intervention, it grew to 1.61 per cent in 1994-95.

All respected commentators have claimed that this government's changes to what has been described as one of our most successful industry policies will result in a stifling of the expansion and momentum that has been gained in research investment. A major plank of this policy is the 150 per cent tax concession on research and development expenditure. This government's intention to reduce that to 125 per cent constitutes nothing less than a halving of the incentive, because its value is in the percentage beyond the 100 per cent that would be available if the expenditure is written off as a normal expense. So this government has effectively halved the incentive to business to invest in this area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government intends to also abandon the successful syndication scheme that has brought researchers together with financial backers to produce not only some of the strategies and programs outlined by Senator Sherry but also leading edge technology which we need to take our economy into the future. As Senator Cook and Senator Sherry both outlined, the syndication scheme is the embodiment of the cooperative and an attack on the provisions can be interpreted in no other way than a fundamental handicapping of small business, particularly in rural and regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Even if this government recognises the value of research and development to our economy, it is taking a complete gamble that there will still be businesses willing to invest in research, regardless of the level of government incentives. I am sure there will be some, but all predictions are that many investments will just not go ahead, or they will go overseas where the incentives are far more attractive. Recent surveys of companies already investing in this area have indicated that up to a quarter of respondents would be considering moving their research overseas.

         According to the Bureau of Industry Economics, the small business sector contributed almost $500 million to Australian research and development in 1993&amp;hyphen;94 and spending in this area by small business has had a faster average annual growth rate than expenditure by big business. Indeed, the sector expenditure on research and development trebled in the decade from 1984. If syndication becomes a scheme of the past, then many small to medium sized enterprises will cease investment in research because they cannot share the financial risk by taking on a partner. The government's alternative Start program does not offer small to medium sized enterprises any capacity to advance through research and development. It is, therefore, a bill that I believe exposes the muddled, mixed up and scatter&amp;hyphen;gun approach by this government to fostering small business growth and expansion. It will not assist anybody in the corporate sector unless they sit at the bigger end of town.

         For a government which publicly commits the success of the national economy on the backs of small business, their policies are quite incredible. We are not talking about small enterprises like the local corner store whose investment in research probably would not get past a bit of community market research. There are a multitude of small enterprises who are technology and research driven in their quest to be nationally and internationally competitive. The information technology sector is one quite classic example of this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Information technology, I believe, will be the major industry of the future. Australia really could be at the crest of the wave of this development—I have spoken about this in this place before. Revenue to Australia from information technology grew from less than $20 billion in 1990 to over $33 billion last year. Significantly, this is also an industry centred on dynamic, small enterprises.

         The Australian Capital Territory and region is home to quite a vibrant information technology industry, dominated by small operators. Nationally, it is important to remember that 95 per cent of these businesses employ fewer than 20 people. Government incentive

         The minister for industry's recent attempts to secure further incentives for small business is another example of this government's patronising and narrow understanding. Yet we again see Mr Costello's juggernaut of fiscal contraction flatten Mr Moore's attempt to secure cabinet support for a Commonwealth procurement scheme that was promised by the coalition prior to the last election. According to press reports, this policy would have guaranteed at least 10 per cent of the Commonwealth procurement budget for small to medium enterprises and link the procurement process with local industry development. This would have been a sound policy that would have been applauded, certainly in my own region, the Canberra region, particularly having been starved of funds, with cuts to the public sector and a lack of innovative and forward looking policy for the national capital region.

         This type of initiative could have alleviated some of the pain that is being felt by residents of the Australian Capital Territory and surrounding area, pain that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) publicly acknowledged yesterday. But again, the anti&amp;hyphen;interventionist stance of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has won through and steered the government away from a policy that would have embodied sound industry development. A smart government would be encouraging the nation's intellectual capacity. This government is putting it to sleep.

         —Yes—with the leading agrarian socialist not here to defend the cause of rural and regional Australia. Under those circumstances, with the absence of Senator Boswell, I will set down the path of doing so. What we have here—as I said yesterday in a question to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp)—is a mean spirited affair where the government is whisking away minimal amounts of money from cooperatives which are the heart and the backbone of places such as Queensland and other states in Australia. Rural people are being exposed to the ravages of this government.

        If one looks at what has brought this on one will see that it is the paranoia of the government to have a level playing field mentality in everything.

        But it is interesting to note that the amendment to section 120(1)(c) will affect some 17 major cooperatives throughout Queensland—including Golden Circle, Tully Sugar, Proserpine Sugar, Dairy Farmers Cooperative, Isis Sugar, Mossman Sugar, Dairyfields, Suncoast, Gold Macadamias, Darling Downs Bacon, Capilano Honey and so on. As one can see, the list covers rural and regional organisations in Queensland that will be hit by the changes to this very section. Of course, there are similar organisations in other parts of Australia that will also be hit by the changes.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, Senator Sherry traversed a lot of the area before. I basically want to focus on the Queensland situation. It is interesting to note that these cooperatives are unique in their structures. They are invariably and totally owned by primary producers. The profit is turned back into the enterprise and also back into the community. It is not profit which is going into corporate profits, which will find its way into the pockets of those already well heeled or overseas; it is going back into the regional and rural communities in Australia.

        <para>
         The government will counter that by saying that there are transitional provisions. They, by my reckoning, do not go anywhere near far enough. The Capilano Honey submission goes on:

           I want to conclude by saying that, by removing the tax deduction, the government is significantly hampering the capacity for regional cooperatives to expand, value add and create jobs. The measure amounts to a new tax, in effect, on debt for primary production cooperatives. This is another kick in the teeth for regional Australia and National Party members who have stood by and allowed it to happen. As a result of the meas ure, many cooperatives, which are 100 per cent Australian owned, will have little option but to accept takeover offers from multinational companies which they have until now resisted.

         Before I go into this contentious area, I note that Senator Brown has circulated an amend ment to ask for a report on which companies receive research and development benefits, how much, for what and under which provisions. Such information would have proved useful at an earlier stage and could prove invaluable in the future. I will be interested to see the comments from the government in relation to this, but it certainly highlights a problem, which is that the  Commonwealth is basically generating an expenditure through loss of revenue from a program specifically targeting commercial industry. Such a thing should be considered an expenditure and be as accountable as, for example, the diesel fuel rebate. We can get information on the rebate—who gets it and to what extent—but we cannot get similar exact information in relation to research and development programs. As a consequence, we get Treasury and the ministry coming to us and saying, `This is a rort; we can't tell you who, but it's happening.' Given the government's record on using hypothetical examples, I think we still have cause for suspicion.

        In relation to the 150 per cent rebate, we have a number of problems with the 150 per cent research and development measures.

We would rather see this tightened than the rate cut while maintaining the same loopholes.

        We will support the opposition amendments on this. We will support the second reading amendment intended to demonstrate how the scheme could be tightened up.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We will also support the opposition's committee stage amendment to oppose changing this scheme from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. Research and development is important. The government uses the rhetoric of the clever country when it suits it. Senator Alston did so yesterday in relation to an amendment to the Telstra sale bill. It was an amendment to end the exemption of commercial companies from state and territory law.

         The 150 per cent tax deduction is intended for use by companies that are doing their own research and development and are making enough income in their primary activity that a tax concession has meaning. Research and development is a real expense and a deduction is really effective only when there is income to offset it. If there are problems, such as companies buying other companies for their losses and tax credits in relation to R&amp;D so that they gain a tax benefit without actually doing any R&amp;D, they should be addressed directly. Changing the rate of the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent does not address this problem.

         I understand that the syndication provision was intended to provide venture capital for R&amp;D in smaller start&amp;hyphen;up companies. Venture capital is always a difficult thing to obtain. Various means have been tried. For several years, the government went into the business of picking winners and providing grants to those businesses with ideas that the government believed had high commercial promise and, later, had high commercial promise and an export orientation.

         The government is not particularly good at picking what applications in industries will be successful. It is a tricky thing. Simply having a good idea or even a good product is not always enough. Venture capital is risk capital and a lot of these risks bear little fruit. The thing with venture capital is, where an investment does bear fruit, it might bear very good fruit in terms of successful businesses which involve a high level of value adding and substantially add to the breadth and depth of the economy as well as to the bottom line.

         I have said that governments are not good at picking winners, but never is the private sector necessarily. However, both may be reasonably good at picking potential winners. The problem with venture capital is that, whenever the economic bean counters look at an entity, public or private, that provides venture capital, they come to the inevitable conclusion that such investment is risky. The result is almost always to eliminate venture capital or to try to make it a no-lose proposition by increasing its cost.

          An example is the now dead managed investment companies, or MICs, which got government support to provide venture capital. After a while, the conservative accounting principle took over and most of the investment funding was put, if I recall correctly, into land speculation—not exactly what was meant by `venture capital'. Another example of a venture capital scheme was the Perth Stock Exchange's second board. This was also heavily abused and used speculatively on a principle similar to junk bonds with far less scrutiny over the quality of projects.

          The syndication scheme gives an incentive to private sector companies to support research and development where the results of that research and development are not of direct productive benefit to the investors. This is almost the definition of a private sector venture capital scheme. Certainly, many of the people doing the research and development are doing projects that appear worth while. They fit the definition of potential winners.

          Partners must register with the research and development board. It is not a case of simply making a tax claim. There is obviously scope for scrutiny over whether an R&amp;D project is actually doing research and development. If the scope for abuse is too broad, it can be tightened. We would support such tightening and, indeed, will do so in respect of several areas such as the feedstock provisions.

          Venture capital schemes to provide investment from the private sector are worth while. They are important to a clever country. If the government wants to change the way it supports the provision of venture capital, it should put forward its proposal legislatively rather than simply asking us to scrap what we have. I know the government wants to shift to a system of government grants and a kind of second board, but I would like to see details before I would be willing to axe the current system.

          I now move to part 6 of schedule 1 dealing with cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives—defined as those whose primary business relates to the acquisition of animals or commodities—are currently given some special deductions in relation to income used in the

           repayment of loans from government. These loans are provided to carry on its business or to acquire an asset.

          The basis of the original policy is a recognition of the fact that agri&amp;hyphen;pastoral cooperatives usually have a harder time getting funding from regular financial institutions and pay higher interest rates as they are at higher risk of default. I also think that there was some recognition that frequently the only way small farmers can effectively get a fair price in a market is to pool their products and sell them as a unit. To do so does not create massive advantages to small farmers, nor does it eliminate the risks and difficulties involved in farming. It just puts smaller farmers on a level with the larger and sometimes corporately owned farms.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are a lot of reasons for supporting cooperatives. A small farmer has difficulty getting the same level of discount on agricultural inputs available to large farms. Larger buyers, such as supermarket chains, will often overlook small producers as not worth the trouble, preferring to deal with someone capable of providing produce at a higher volume. Cooperatives allow smaller farmers to act collectively like a big farm. Cooperatives in supporting smaller farmers generally assure that a lot more money goes into the local economy. Money made by cooperative members is generally spent locally.

          Support of cooperatives is certainly in line with the Greens (WA) policies for support of more decentralised regional development, higher levels of self&amp;hyphen;reliance, and small and medium sized locally owned businesses.

          Many farmers are, of course, concerned about land care. This is often specifically the case for many small family farms. One of the things that works most strongly against small farmers is the onerous nature of debt, which is perhaps the greatest single cause of unsustainable agricultural practice. Where it is a choice of trying to wring every dollar from the land to service a loan or farming sustainably and losing the farm, most farmers will farm intensively, even when they would rather not and know it is not in their long-term interest. For this reason alone, we would do what we could to support cooperatives, which improve profits and specifically those measures in relation to the repayment of loans. We do not propose to punish all cooperatives simply because some farmers may farm unsustainably.

          In relation to medical rebates, we have an amendment to oppose the changes to medical rebates. Currently, cumulative annual qualifying medical expenses which are above $1,000 attract a rebate. Qualifying expenses are those above expenses covered by Medicare. So if a treatment costs $200, and Medicare will pay $190 of that, the qualifying expense for the rebate is only $10. Given that Medicare covers much of most expenses, one needs to be getting considerable levels of treatment before one qualifies for the rebate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government now wants to increase the cumulative level before qualifying for a rebate to $1,500. This seems to be another cynical revenue earner, especially since government is also limiting increases in Medicare payments for medical services, which will push doctors away from bulk-billing and into partial fees above the Medicare component.
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           The partial fees approach has the additional disadvantage that patients must pay up-front and then go to the Medicare office to get a partial refund. Bulk-billing allows the doctor to directly bill Medicare, and the patient does not have to pay.

          This whole process simply makes medical treatment more expensive. As with tertiary education, we are increasingly going to a system where free universal services are being replaced with increasing levels of partial user-pays—a base coverage topped up with fees. This disadvantages the poorest while assuring that those better off get a substantial subsidy for their expenses. As fee components of cost increase, the income level for which a service is accessible increases. Ultimately, as with the current HECS regime, we start seeing a system of partial subsidy for a service that only the middle and upper income earners can easily afford and where the poorest are often entirely excluded. This should not be allowed to occur with health.

         In my home state of Western Australia, the issue of mining, particularly in relation to the gold sector, is of substantial importance. I must initially state that changes to the current taxation arrangements for the gold sector do not surprise me, considering recent comments by the Western Australian Premier, Mr Court, that he would be happy to look at the issue of a gold tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reasons for the change here, though, are somewhat incomprehensible. The main thrust of the argument is that the law regarding exemption was relevant to the 1940s and the 1950s, when minimal reserves were not considered adequate and there was a need to provide incentive for small prospectors to search for these particular minerals, as identified in the report. Apparently, the government now considers the level of mineral reserves in Australia to be adequate and, therefore, there is no need for the tax exemption as an incentive any longer.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This argument ignores two fundamental points. Firstly, the mining industry is just as ever an integral and essential part of the Australian economy. We as a nation cannot take this sector for granted. History illustrates that taking it for granted results in the low level of reserves that were the reason the tax exemption was introduced in the first place. Secondly, this change has the potential to destroy or, if not destroy, harm many communities and mining sectors in Western Australia. In Western Australia there are mining towns full of small prospectors and leaseholders, searching for minerals which can then be mined by major companies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These changes will mean a number of consequences for small prospectors. They will be at a disadvantage when compared with big mining companies. The small prospectors will be taxed under the proposals for selling the mining rights, but the mining companies will not be able to claim a deduction for buying those rights. In the area of gold, most discoveries are made by small prospectors. The figures suggest that it is something in the order of over 95 per cent. These prospectors and their eventual success keep towns like Kalgoorlie and the eastern goldfields alive. These people should be encouraged rather
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report by the committee also highlights several transitional problems. The changes are retrospective and will have the impact of placing upon small prospectors large tax bills for income accrued over a period of time through the increased value of a lease.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's responses are a few tax deductions. However, when compared to the new tax on income received from selling mining rights, any tax concessions will now be wiped out. Overall, many of the changes in the bill are supportable. However, that particular issue I have mentioned today and those mentioned by my colleagues will do much to destroy investment in our industries, research to improve our competitiveness, and incentive for small investors and prospectors to continue adding to the economy through mineral exploration. These changes will have both a national effect and a local effect in areas like regional Western Australia.

         Finally, I turn to some correspondence I have received from the Australian titanium minerals industry. I presume it was received by other senators in this place. I normally would not have much regard for such a submission because they are usually self&amp;hyphen;seeking. However, I was caught by the comments in this document to the effect that, during the past 10 years, Australia's titanium minerals industry has grown to be a $1.2 billion a year export earner on the strength of the extensive investment in downstream processing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The investment has depended heavily on technology advances in processing titanium minerals to synthetic rutile and titanium dioxide pigment. Some of the research which that industry has engaged in is: improved efficiencies in synthetic rutile production, enhancement of synthetic rutile products, processing and reuse of synthetic rutile waste, energy efficiency and recycling in titanium dioxide production, reduction of titanium dioxide solid waste, reuse of titanium dioxide waste, and new extraction and process technology for waste zircon. All this work has had a major impact on the competitive position of the Australian titanium minerals

         In that context, they make three comments which are particularly pertinent and should be put on the record. Firstly, they say that the proposed tax allowance cut from 150 per cent to 125 per cent effectively reduces the level of government support for individual projects by 50 per cent. It is pertinent to point out that most of the industry's projects have qualified for tax exemptions in the past or would be expected to qualify in the future. Removing government support for research will lead inevitably to the shelving or cancellation of sections of this work. It is worth noting also that some of the programs most at risk are those aimed at improving environmental management. Because these projects may not contribute to the industry's bottom line, they will be harder to justify from a commercial viewpoint.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The second complaint that should be placed on the record is the classification of some essential research investment as capital expenditure, ruling out any form of deductibility other than depreciation. This change is potentially crippling to research programs based on pilot plans or test facilities. The third complaint that needs to be addressed is that the new definitions of research possibly eliminate much of the work undertaken by mining and mineral processing companies. Their complaint is that the apparent emphasis in their report on experimental activities and high level risk does not favour the practical research and development programs needed for successful mineral processing.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The first of the reasons for the need for the cut is that there has been an increasing usage of the concession, particularly by syndications.

It is effectively money which is given to the corporations. It is a benefit they get that other corporations do not. It is analogous to the diesel fuel rebate. It ought to be seen as government expenditure. But I know there is very great concern in the government about the amount of money that is being spent in this way and about the way in which it is being spent. That is why this part of the legislation is before the Senate tonight. I will be moving a return to order which would provide the Senate with information about the concessions: the name of each company, its registered address, a brief description of each research activity for which a concession is given, the total cost to government revenue of the concession for each research activity, and the cost of the components of the research activity, for example, the feedstock and the core technology.

I expect we might even have the government considering whether or not it should support this amendment. I hope the government is looking closely at it. I do not know whether the government has got a crystal ball so that it knows whether this legislation will go through tonight. I think the government would be in a much stronger position to argue its case next time round if it had this information. After all, information is the currency of democracy. If we were enlightened, we would be in a much richer position to make a more democratic decision on this matter next time round.

         Senator Cook and other speakers spent a lot of time in their remarks talking about research and development. Let me reassure the Senate that the coalition government is maintaining a strong commitment to research and development—and that would not have been apparent, I would have to say, from the hyperbole that Senator Cook shared with the chamber. We have announced a reduction in the headline rate from 150 per cent to 125 per cent for R&amp;D and for the abolition of syndication.

         However, many overlook that total Commonwealth government support for R&amp;D will remain in excess of $3.5 billion in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. I have a few brief remarks on the R&amp;D premium rate reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. The benefit of the R&amp;D tax concession comes mainly from the immediate or accelerated deduction of expenses, which would otherwise be allowed only over a longer period. By reducing the premium rates of deduction from the maximum of 150 per cent to a maximum of 125 per cent, this parliament will save revenue while keeping the same, or perhaps slightly greater, net economic benefits from the concession.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Moreover, at 125 per cent, the overall net economic gains from the concession are more likely to add something—true—even if there are errors in the data used and even if the economic conditions vary from those assumed in the established economic model.

         In addition, the government has maintained funding for CSIRO cooperative research centres and the technology support centre program.

The government will fund CRCs at about $145 million in 1996, rising to $148 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;99. To increase the effectiveness of R&amp;D assistance, the government is focusing that assistance towards increased outlays on R&amp;D and away from tax expenditures.

I will not repeat my argument other than to say that I do not believe it is appropriate to be increasing the cost of medical services. It is simply a revenue grabbing measure in this regard.

         —I, too, am opposed to part 3 of schedule 1, as are the opposition and the Australian Democrats. I want to make a point here. Under part 3 of schedule 1, the government is attempting to require people to have spent $1,500 instead of $1,000 of non&amp;hyphen;reimbursed medical expenses before getting a 20 per cent rebate on the excess.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The argument that the government has put forward is that since people are now getting the benefit of the $100 single health insurance rebate it is all right to cut the value of the medical expenses rebate by $100. It sounds reasonable on the face of it. But, and it is a big but, families tend to have higher medical expenses and would be hit harder. Secondly, the medical expenses rebate covers uninsured
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         expense. To that extent, taxpayers have not benefited from private health insurance.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The health funds have been putting up premiums. Self&amp;hyphen;insurance needs to be treated no less generously than insurance premiums to ensure that the health funds are subjected to competitive pressures not to raise their premiums. I would have thought the government would have accepted that argument and would have rejected the argument of Treasury. Indeed, the first argument goes against the government's view of supporting families. This is anti-family or discriminatory against families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A further reason is that the health insurance rebate will only be available to those in registered health funds. What about competitiveness that you are talking about all the time? Persons covered by commercial insurance arrangements—and here again is the heart of the government—including trauma benefits attached to life policies will get no benefit from the new health insurance rebate yet are denied recognition for a further $500 of medical expenses. It just does not make sense. I am using principles of the government's own policies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In point of principle, all medical expenses in my view should be outright deductible in any case. Taxation is supposed to be based upon the ability to pay and a person who has to outlay money to achieve normal good health does not have the same ability to pay tax as a normal healthy taxpayer. That has been my view all along. It has also, incidentally, been my view on accumulated sick leave in respect of whether or not that ought to be cashed out.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My view has always been that you are either blessed with good health or you are not. In this particular case it seems to me that the principle that I have just espoused should apply. That might be too much for the government, but I do suggest to the government that it ought to have a very good look at this issue as to the question of the family, as to the question of competitiveness and as to the question of discrimination against those people who are not insured.

         —I also wish to make a few notes before we finish on this particular item regarding medical expenses rebate. We will be opposing this part of the bill. We find that this is one of those nasty little pseudo savings items that are tucked away in the budget. At the moment the threshold is $1,000. This schedule increases it to $1,430 for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and then again to $1,500. This government has prided itself on this budget calling it family friendly. I would argue that this is a long way from that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If we look at the people who are going to be worst affected by this measure we see that they are largely going to be people with chronic illnesses and people with disabilities. Even if people do have private insurance, where there is chronic illness in the family the expenses build up. I call again on the government to reconsider this measure. It is a saving of $25 million, yes, but look at whose pockets it is coming out of. It is coming out of the pockets of those who can least afford it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are not just talking about people who are in the situation where they are able to put their hand in their pocket for medical expenses. We are talking about families who fork out regularly for everything from pharmaceuticals to additional X&amp;hyphen;rays. As you know, even if you are insured you cannot get the gap payment back between what many doctors charge and what is the official rebate. For these reasons, the Democrats oppose the increase in the threshold.

However, the position of the opposition is to support the amendment that has been moved. I do so by endorsing the remarks that senators in support of that amendment have already made. It does not require me to go back over the same ground.

         —One which you might like to take note of, Senator Lees, is the huge benefit to families which is now flowing through from the interest rate cuts. They have been variously calculated. At $100,000 per average mortgage, the assistance to the family is in the order of $188 a month. That is an enormous assistance to many Australian families. The family tax initiative is another huge benefit to families. Two million families will benefit and $1 billion will be expended in that particular policy, which will be effective from 1 January next year.

        So, in the generality, I do not think there can be any doubt of the huge commitment of this government to the family and to the measures which are already assisting families. In relation to the announcement that we have made on the medical rebate, the budget must be seen as part of a package of measures which encourage people to take out private health insurance. Both the private health insurance incentive and the Medicare surcharge are designed to encourage people to retain and take out private health insurance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The rebate is being retained at the rate of 20c in the dollar. Only medical expenses net of reimbursements from health funds qualify for the rebate. The increase in the threshold is consistent with other incentives announced in the budget for people to take out private health insurance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We understand the great sympathy and support that senators have expressed for the family. I point out that we are already delivering great benefits to families, and that should be seen in the generality of the budget. This is a measure which we feel in that context is appropriate. Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Margetts.

        It has three elements: that the right to mine was purchased before August 20; that the exempt income was derived in the next five years and was not more than the current market value of the mine; and that the person is a bona fide prospector. We say these are tight criteria, but they seek to ensure that prospectors who work their claim preserve the value of their asset as it is now an exempt income. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

         —This measure proposes an end to tax exemptions relating to the sale of mining leases by legitimate small prospectors. In their minority report of the committee looking into the issue, the opposition also supported this principle, as did the Democrats. They both noted that there were problems with the retrospective aspects under which the income is seen to have accrued and been effectively earned during the several years of exploration discovery, and ultimately finding a buyer and negotiating a sale. During that time, real expenses were generated, while the notional income was deferred—that income is only made at the time when the sale goes through.

        Let me explain why it is retrospective in terms of its taxation and why Senators Campbell, Panizza, Eggleston and Ellison should cross the floor on this vote—they are senators elected by the State of Western Australia to this states house to represent the interests of that state. There is no interest group in Western Australia that commands more bipartisan support, I would contend, than the small prospector association. Indeed, the mining industry depends on the activity of the small prospectors to discover mineral deposits which would not otherwise be discovered. The reasoning that the government has put up—that this was appropriate in the 1940s and 1950s but is not appropriate any longer—is specious in the extreme. Why those four Liberal Party senators should cross the floor and vote for this amendment is, quite clearly, that they represent the constituents most

        The mining industry is carried on the back of prospectors. Without the type of work that these people do, you would not discover the minerals in the first place. These are small people in terms of their business interests. There is an idea that a prospector is someone who will strike it lucky and make a fortune overnight. The truth is that most of these people are very moderately rewarded. They are not excessively wealthy. They are people who work in arduous circumstances.

        This measure was announced by the government in the budget on budget night. Up until then, the provision had stood the test of time over many years. In 1984, the Gutman inquiry came down with the recommendation that this provision stand, not be deleted. That was accepted by the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, and was then proposed to the Senate and supported by the Liberal and National parties.

        There are good reasons in income tax principles why we should not allow any person to have an income which is untaxed. But there are no good reasons, in any principles to do with taxation, that the operation of those provisions should be retrospective. It should not be retrospective for this reason. When those small guys got out there and found these deposits, pegged and registered them, they did so against the present law. They had an expectation of remuneration or

        The only sensible way the government can introduce this principle is by grandfathering in all of the existing leaseholders. A way of doing that is by the Democrat amendment that is before the chamber. I frankly think a better way of doing it is by the amendment that I have. But I am prepared to vote for the Democrat amendment. If that fails, obviously, mine would fail. But if it succeeds, I will move mine and test to see whether we can take this the full distance. But it is a retrospective measure. This is a question of putting the Western Australian Liberal senators in this chamber on trial. Are they going to stand up for their state or are they not?

        As the Democrat spokesperson on rural Australia, I absolutely relish the opportunity to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). There is a section of this bill which clearly demonstrates this government's absolute stubbornness and lack of understanding of issues affecting the rural sector. This bill seeks to knock out a 200 per cent tax deduction for eligible farming cooperatives who take out government loans for capital expansion. The revenue involved in this measure is negligible in comparison to the total revenue of about $130 billion involved
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         in all of the budget measures. This is a measure of about $6 million a year maximum.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The assistance that this measure gives to farmer owned companies in marketing and controlling the sale of their own products is immeasurable. Anyone with any knowledge of the rural sector knows the value of the cooperative movement to country Australia except, it would seem, the Howard government. I think I am probably prepared tonight—we will see how the vote goes—to exempt at least part of that government. It remains to be seen yet whether I can make that statement.

        Some of Australia's most successful rural industries are cooperatives, particularly in Queensland, where the cooperative movement is one of the proud parts of the history of the National Party in Queensland, which as a government over many years has supported rural cooperatives. That is to their great credit. For many years I have strongly supported the cooperative movement because of the great benefits it brings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some of Australia's most successful rural industries are cooperatives, especially in Queensland. I will just name a couple: Mackay Sugar Co&amp;hyphen;operative Association Ltd, Golden Circle, Capilano Honey Ltd and KR Darling Downs. If there are some Australian icons which we have seen disappear in recent years, there is certainly a Queensland icon that I do not want to see disappear—that is, Golden Circle pineapple juice. It is an absolute icon in Queensland. I am sure Senator Boswell would agree with me.

        The tax deduction which this government seeks to remove allows farming cooperatives to engage in capital expansion and to contribute to regional development projects such as dams and bridges with other proven provincial bodies. It is not much but it indicates a commitment to supporting Australian farmers over huge corporate multinationals, which would be more likely to take over small farming cooperatives without this little bit of support from the taxpayer.

        The fact that this government wants to place small farmer cooperatives on the same so-called level playing field as the multinational agribusiness companies puts the lie to the claim that it cares about rural Australia. Any Australian living in a struggling country or provincial town has to be sceptical about a government that does not understand farmer cooperatives. Clearly, traditionally conservative voters are becoming sceptical, as Lex Buchanan of the Queensland Farmers' Federation said in a press statement this week. He said:

        The Democrats, however, do understand the huge value of the farmers cooperative movement in Australia. That is why we move amendments and support others in moving this amendment to restore the tax deduction and why I commend the amendment to the Senate.

        This measure is an important measure. In the evidence given to the inquiry, two things were said by the cooperatives themselves that bear repeating at this point. They said that the deduction, which the government is by this bill trying to close off, helps to compensate cooperatives for the disadvantages they face in raising capital for investment. They are not allowed to raise equity through the public share float. Their ability to raise capital for members is limited to the members, which means their ability to raise capital is limited to the fortunes of rural Australia. If rural Australia is doing it hard, their ability to raise capital is circumscribed, to a considerable extent, by virtue of that.

        As well, they said that another disadvantage of the cooperative structure is that the members do not have access to dividend imputation. Thus, the concession is not a fair advantage for cooperatives, as the government says. It acts as compensation for other disadvantages. I am aware in the majority report, the report from government members, they did not accept those submissions.

The argument here is about a laudable form of cooperative enterprise in the area of rural cooperatives, particularly cooperatives that are marketing rural products—one of the few areas of the Australian food industry that is owned by Australians. I wonder whether the minister might comment directly on those two points raised by the cooperatives themselves.

         The effect of paragraph 120(1)(c) is that the marketing cooperative can claim an effective 200 per cent tax deduction for capital expenditure, full depreciation for the cost of the asset and deductions for capital repayments if the asset and the loan came from government.

        The paragraph is an anomaly. It allows double deductions for capital expenditures. Double deductions can distort investment decisions by cooperatives as well as providing them with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. However, in recognising the important contribution, this touches on a point that Senator Cook raised. Having recognised the important contribution of cooperatives in the primary production sector, the government has announced transitional arrangements designed to ensure that cooperatives make a smooth transition to the new tax arrangement.

        Senator Schacht got up to speak. I have to say that—and this is pretty hard to say, Senator—that was really one of your least effective contributions, even by your standards. Senator, do not tell me now, because we do not want you to take up any more time, but I wonder whether the cooperative that the senator's family sent its milk to could still use this double tax deduction. It would be interesting to see whether that is the case.

        Only some tax cooperatives can access the double deduction. Senator Schacht, the advice that I have is that some of the largest area cooperatives in Victoria have not qualified for this double deduction for years. So the one that you got started may well not qualify, but it has not stopped their development, as you reminded us, nor their export drive. So I put it to you that the government believes this is an important measure and urges the chamber to support it.

Unfortunately, some of those went astray. But, in Australia, the principle which binds a lot of people together, including a lot of small farmers, is the cooperative movement.

        Outside rural and regional Australia cooperatives are not well&amp;hyphen;known. But they have an enormous effect on the economy of this country, particularly the economy of rural and regional Australia. Their importance is vital to the future of this country. Their major role is in Australian ownership of food processing companies and their integrated path from the primary producer to the processor, on to the domestic and international marketplace where they have played an enormous and successful part in export growth. Their massive infrastructure development plans for the future to ensure that Australian primary produce is processed for the international export market by Australian owned processors. The future plans of food processing cooperatives far exceed the plan of multinational companies which, unfortunately, now control 80 per cent of Australia's food processing industry.

        Multinational food processors make great headlines when they are to invest millions a year in their Australian food processing companies.

The necessary tool in this regard is this section which the government is seeking to excise from the tax legislation.

        Cooperatives cover a diverse range of industries. This information is absolutely vital for consideration of this matter. I know Senator Boswell is very much involved in this. I am grateful for some of the information that he has given me on this particular matter. The cooperatives cover such diverse industries as sugar. There are not too many sugar plantations in Tasmania. I think most of them are up in Queensland. Forty two per cent of all sugar milling is done in cooperative mills. Of course, there is dairying, which is a very important industry in my state. UMT, as I think Senator Cook mentioned, is the biggest cooperative in my state. It is located largely on the north&amp;hyphen;west coast. That is a success story in Australian primary industry. Rationalisation has resulted in a successful industry with massive export sales and a rapidly growing export market. There is the fruit

        I do not want to see advantages being given. The minister has indicated that there is double taxation. But let me say that cooperatives have not got access to capital from where multinationals get capital. Indeed, there is an imputation question; that is a very important matter. I would also like to ask the minister about the imputation that has been referred to by Senator Cook. I think Senator Cook asked the minister a question about that matter. I would be very interested to hear the response from the minister. As I understand it, franking does not apply to cooperatives—unlike companies. Franking credits that would normally go to companies go as a direct benefit to Treasury. They are calculated by accountants as literally millions of dollars.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It needs to be understood by all concerned that cooperatives are not like corporations. They are prevented by law from raising capital because of the restrictions on the numbers of shares members can hold. They often must keep costly inventories of their members' seasonal produce. Treasury can cook up these particular ideas, but they have lost the plot, frankly. They have lost contact with the real world if they are putting this to ministers. I believe, frankly, the committee should reject this proposition.

        I know there is a subsequent measure. Finally, I ask the minister one point, if he would not mind responding to this. Is it a fact that there is nothing to stop a state government and a cooperative achieving the same result—if you are successful in this area—by entering into an agreement to share gross revenues until the amount subscribed by the government is recovered? This income would be tax exempt as the state government is tax exempt, and would achieve the same result as a deduction. Is that or is that not the case? Or are you thinking of levying taxation on state governments?

        This is an amendment to part 6A, relating to deductions allowable to cooperative companies. It seeks to clarify the meaning of the act. We have just defeated the government's amendment to the bill relating to cooperative companies. Mr Howard, representing the Co&amp;hyphen;operative Council of Australia and the Cooperative Federation of Queensland, in his opening summation to the hearing referred to the interpretation that is being placed on the act and sought clarification of that interpretation. His words were:

        As a point of clarification, I draw attention to the section of the act that refers to acquisition of assets, which quite clearly says `or'—it can be from the government `or' somewhere else.

        The point is clear enough. It is a question of making explicit the meaning of the act, because it seems that the act is being interpreted differently.

        All I say is that it should not be necessary. It is necessary only because the Australian tax office has put forward outrageous interpretations of paragraph 120(1)(c), which says that a cooperative must acquire assets from a government in order to write off a loan from the government. That is what ATO says paragraph 120(1)(c) means. But that view clearly is wrong.

        Senator Cook wants to have this declaratory statement of the law to bind the Australian Taxation Office. We should not have to do this but, in view of the history of this, we perhaps need to in this case. It is a shot across the bow, might I say, of those responsible for the sorts of interpretations that cooperatives have been faced with. I support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Cook. I trust that it will be carried.

          This amendment is in the context of what occurred this morning when the disallowance motion on the Austudy regulations was not adopted. There is an argument, I suppose, that the government made a budget decision and the Senate decided to consider a motion put forward to disallow the regulations to increase the age for independent status under Austudy from 22 to 25 years.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It can be argued that that was a budget measure and perhaps it should not have been overturned by a disallowance motion. However, I voted for the disallowance motion because I was of the view that the regulations increasing the age for independent status under Austudy from 22 to 25 presupposed that the parents of the student would be footing the bill. That was the government's assumption, but it is not the taxation department's assumption. The taxation department gives absolutely no recognition at all for the expenditure that is made for students who would thus have lost out their entitlement to independent Austudy.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           Following the government's therefore successful raising of the age for independent status under Austudy from 22 to 25, students between those ages and indeed between 18 and 25 are now means tested for Austudy on the basis of parental income. Given that the government expects parents to support students from the age of 18 to 25, I believe it is time to restore the student tax rebate in the tax system.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           You will recall, Mr Chairman, that I moved a motion at the end of the debate on the increase of HECS that there should be a recognition in the taxation system that self-education expenses by way of HECS payments should attract a tax deduction. You and I, Mr Chairman, voted for that. Unfortunately, on that occasion we were not successful in that particular effort.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There may be a statement emanating from Treasury that the amendment to restore the student tax rebate involves double dipping, but it does not. If a student does get Austudy the available dependent rebate for parents is
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            reduced by $1 for every $4 of income over $282 including Austudy received by students.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           If a student were on full Austudy, the parents would have little or no entitlement to the rebate. It may be noted that the wording of the rebate provisions dates back many years, and the separate net income test goes back further. It was applied to the dependent deductions under the pre&amp;hyphen;1970s Liberal governments. I say that quite deliberately to the government, if it is holding itself out as a family positive government.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The government's family tax initiatives, though touted as $1,000 per child, amount to a $200 tax rebate. In any event, it is limited to children under the age of 16 and students up to 18 years of age only. So there is this area between 18 and 25—which was 22—which needs to be filled. When questioned on the issue of the family tax initiative in the Senate, the government admitted that the family tax threshold is not available for students over 18 years. The rebate for a student aged 18 to 25 is set at $1,000 and indexed to be equal, in my proposal before the chamber, to the without child level of the spouse rebate. This is considered appropriate as both classes of persons are adult dependents. They are over 18 years of age.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I believe that this proposition is a matter of clear equity. I believe that fairness should apply. It would be a proper acknowledgment of the fact that the government is saying that the parents of those students whose Austudy payments are virtually cut out or minimised can pick up the tab. That can be quite expensive, particularly in the case of families with a number of dependent children who are students. I mean students who are 18 years of age and over.

           I would like to explain to honourable senators that paragraph 159HA(7)(a) is intended to omit other than the amount specified in column 3 of the table and, in subsection 159J(2) in respect of a dependent included in class 3 or 4, it deals with the indexation of the rebate.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The amendment to subsection 159J(1A), which states `omit or class 4', is the operative provision in this amendment that restores the rebate for students aged 18 to 25 years.
           <break page="7426" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            Subsection 159A(1B) omits the words `where but for subsection 1A' and substitutes `where a taxpayer is or but for subsection 1A would be' and protects the higher with child spouse rebate for those with students aged 18 to 25. That is quite natural, because they are in fact adults. The amendments to subsection 159J(2) set the actual rebate at $1,000 for students aged 18 to 25 years of age. The other measures in that particular clause are self&amp;hyphen;explanatory. So I commend to the committee the adoption of this amendment.

         —For those of us who are concerned about the overall impact of government legislation at the moment, there is a little saving grace in what Senator Harradine puts forward. But I cannot allow the opportunity to go past without saying that it is very disappointing to have this amendment put forward this afternoon when this morning the vote in the place was to cut children who are not in the family, who are outside very often because they have been excluded through circumstances beyond their own control, by $300 million in students incidentals allowance.
        </para>

       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems that Senator Harradine has a constant pattern of giving some break to those people who are lucky enough to be within the family fold, as we are seeing now, and, on the other hand, of cutting out assistance from those who are unfortunate enough not to have that circumstance. I do not know what the motivation is. I do not know whether it is to subtly say that we might force them back into circumstances out of which they have come. It seems to be a very limited magnanimity towards people who are struggling to get an education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I know that Senator Harradine voted for the government's overall cuts in education and the increase in HECS fees. The disincentive that we argued at the time involved poorer people in our community being able to go on and get a tertiary education. He gave some ameliorating amendment for those people lucky enough to be within the home as a salve to the wider wound of those cuts. Tonight we are getting a bit of the same.

        I just cannot understand why in the morning Senator Harradine would vote against a $300 allowance to school kids who do not have family backup to try to help them get back into a secondary education, go on to a tertiary education and get through against all the odds of the education stream into a career and fulfilment while in the evening he puts forward an amendment like this, which most of the good natured people on this side of the parliament will at least be attracted to support. It is inconsistent and unfair to those people who are down on their luck in our community. I fail to see the magnanimity, to put the most modest word I can on it, that is in it for those people trying to get an education who are in harder circumstances than many of us in this place might have faced in our time.

         —The Australian Democrats will support this amendment. It is a logical extension of what we regard as the illogical decision of this government to treat intelligent 25-year-old adults still at university as children. If it is good enough for Austudy to say that a 25-year-old in the top 10 per cent of intellectual achievement is a child and a dependant, obviously the tax act should reflect it.

        This amendment will give families a maximum of $19 per week in tax rebates paid to the parents, not the children, because this government views a 25-year-old adult as not capable of running their own financial affairs. That $19 per week is roughly equivalent to the basic family allowance payable to students up to the age of 18 at school and the government's new family tax payment. For consistency of policy, the government should support this.

        If we also sought to pick up the parenting allowance as well, the payment should rise to $1,700 per year. But $1,000 has a logic to it,

         so we will support it. It is well short of the $128 per week which a student would get on full Austudy. It is well short of a decent social policy that recognises that a 25-year-old adult smart enough to win a place at a university should no longer be treated like a child. But this government has chosen to put in place an illogical and discriminatory policy on Austudy. They should complete the circle by ensuring that the tax system reflects the policy.

         —There is obviously some logic in this amendment if you follow the fact that this morning there was a vote related to what I call compulsory families. It made sure that students cannot get independent allowances until they are 25. I was pleased to see the pressure put on by various members of the Senate, including the Greens and the Democrats. It helped to get some change in the government's legislation. It was very unclear until this morning that that change had occurred to make sure that it did not go up to the age of 31, which was the original decision.

        As a result of these compulsory families, we are left with very few alternatives but to support measures such as these, which give some recognition of the cost to families who may have to support an adult student up to the age of 25 who has no means of getting independent Austudy. It is very regrettable that we need to support such an amendment. A fairer go for students would have been much better from the government. It is a pity that this morning's vote was not supported by the majority of the Senate.

         —All these things, as the senators know, do have cost effects and implications. I think I am correct in saying that it is not possible to give an accurate costing on this. Certainly we would need time to properly assess those aspects, but I think over time the costs may well be quite substantial. We note Senator Harradine's views relating to the appropriateness of tax rebates for students but, given some of the problems I have just raised with the chamber, the government does not consider this the appropriate place to move these amendments.

        I will certainly draw the senator's comments to the attention of the Treasurer. We do think that these amendments do not directly relate to the provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. However, we note your comments. We consider this amendment would be best considered in the context of other measures provided by the government to assist families. You mentioned in your remarks the substantial assistance that the government is giving to families through the family tax initiative.

        We appreciate your bringing this issue to our attention. We would need far more time to carefully assess this, particularly the implications to the revenue and also, of course, the issue of drafting the matters that you have raised. In the context of what I have said, the government will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Harradine.

         —Senator Harradine is probably going to suggest this. It might well be possible for the government to use their amazing talents, or for other people to use their amazing talents, to deal with those wording problems, so that we will not inadvertently create a problem with retrospectivity back until 1976. I think it is possible, with the combined intellect available in this building, to do that. Perhaps we can adjourn this vote until someone has a chance to look at it.

It would probably concentrate everybody's minds and it would certainly be drawn to the Treasurer's attention were the amendments adopted by the Senate. Because of amendments to the legislation, the legislation will need to go back to the House of Representatives. No doubt the Treasurer would take some passing interest in what the Senate has done in respect of this measure—not only this one but other measures. If there were a problem, as envisaged by you, or if there were other problems, no doubt our attention would be drawn to them by the House of Representatives in pretty quick order tomorrow.

        This is a small amendment with a large effect. It seeks to close down the infrastructure borrowing tax concession from the end of this year. While we will support the tightening measures which the government proposes in item 6, they really are tinkering around the edges of the fundamental issue. The fundamental issue is that the infrastructure borrowing tax concession is, to use the government's
        <break page="7429" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         terminology, a rort. It is poorly targeted, open to abuse, excessively generous and completely unnecessary.

        The Australian Council for Infrastructure Development told the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that there is no shortage of funds for infrastructure investment and there just are not enough projects. So why prop it up with a $200 million a year gift to the financiers and bankers who set up these finance schemes? Why indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has received three reports in the last 18 months telling them that the infrastructure borrowing tax concession is a waste of money. The Economic Planning Advisory Commission private sector infrastructure task force said that the scheme was not needed and there was no tax disincentive for investment in infrastructure.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In June the government's own National Commission of Audit recommended that the scheme needed to be reviewed because it did not seem to be necessary. Earlier this week the Senate superannuation committee, in a unanimous report, called on the government to review the purpose and operation of the concessions.

        It is a waste of money. Treasurer Costello has vowed as recently as question time today to work to stop the tax system being riddled and rorted. Well, here is one of his riddles and rorts.

         —The opposition intends to oppose division 1, part 1 of schedule 4—one of the key features of this bill. This is the proposal that deals with the reduction of the 150 per cent tax incentive for research and development to 125 per cent. In my speech on the second reading debate I provided a great deal of detail about this amendment. I do not need to traverse that ground now. What I do need to say is that this was clearly spelt out in the government's election policy as a commitment by the then opposition, were it to be elected as government, to retain the 150 per cent tax incentive. What we have here is an explicit and blatant breach of that election undertaking.

        If opposition in this chamber were to be in the majority against this change that the government seeks, this chamber would be enforcing the mandate that the government sought from the electorate. There is a certain justification in that when we find that the government has claimed a mandate for a number of things in this chamber, most recently the Telstra bill, earlier the industrial relations bill, and so on. They have a mandate for 150 per cent. That is what they sought and

        The second point I make is that Australia, in terms of the OECD nations of the world—there are 24 of them—is ranked 17th or 19th in the amount of private sector expenditure on research and development. This provision is in the act in order to encourage more research and development in Australia. Commonly, it is understood that countries with a high commitment to research and development have greater prospects for employment and economic growth in the future than countries with less commitment to research and development.

        Nonetheless, it is the only area of complex sophisticated technology where Australia has a world marketing lead. Why do we have it? We have it because this is a company that has done the hard yards and spent funds on research and development. It says that, by making this change, its costs will increase. It will be able to do less R&amp;D than it would have done before and, under another bill due to come up next year, we know it will have a nine per cent increase in costs imposed on it by the abolition of the ships bounty.

         One of the reasons why the ferry industry is upset is that the OECD agreement, which would phase down subsidies to this industry sector worldwide, has been blocked in the US Senate. It has now been thrown out and it is unlikely to be approved by the United States, which means that the other countries in the world—the Scandinavians and the north Asians, the Japanese and Koreans—will not sign it either. So this area of ship manufacture is going to become one of intense trade conflict in the world.

We will lose our marketing edge. I implore the Senate to vote against this measure of the government.

One of the reasons we have a current account deficit in this country is that we do not value add enough. We do not turn our intellectual capacity into high value added products. That is something that Treasury and this new Treasurer would not understand, because a city based Melbourne establishment lawyer would not know a factory, a farmer or a cooperative if it fell on top of him.

When you went and visited Incat's factories—whether they were in Tasmania; Henderson, which is south of Fremantle; and New South Wales—you saw an industry that had been developed.

When you go overseas, these are the ferries the rest of the world wants to buy. They are the best design at the best price, and they work very well. We lead the world.

They cannot do it. When you put this on top of the fact that they have removed the ship bounty without waiting to see what the rest of the world would do, it is a double jeopardy to an industry that ought to be used as an example to the rest of manufacturing.

         —Thanks for the big interest rates! Let me tell you, Senator Schacht, that that is one of the most extraordinary contributions I have ever heard. As chairman of the legislation committee, I listened to the submissions of the people who wanted to make submissions to the committee. I never saw you there on any occasion. I doubt whether you have ever read the report that was put down, because you did not quote from the majority report at all. You may have used the little bits that suited you in the minority report. Let me tell you, Senator Schacht, that you have talked about just about everything except the things that are involved in this part of the bill and the reduction of the concession. You talked about former Senator Button. You have gone back over history for some time, and a lot of things that are quite irrelevant.

        Of course there were differing points of view in the evidence in this particular inquiry. When the government decides that it wants to make some changes, the people who generally come along to give evidence are those who do not like what the government is doing. You picked up every single issue that they raised, but you did not ever listen to the other sides of the argument. There are a couple of things in the report that I think you ought to be reminded of. It is a comprehensive report. I think it is one of the best reports that the legislation committee has put out for a long time.

        I understand that there is a substantial minority report. There is also another minority report from the Democrats.

         The important part of what the majority report of that committee had to say—and I think you need reminding—is that it accepts that the reduction in the generosity of the concession will lead to a marginal reduction in the amount of concession claiming R&amp;D. The committee notes also that the government affirms the importance of R&amp;D to economic strength and intends to compensate for this through the newstart program of direct grants.

        The important question in the design of the concession is not the absolute amount of R&amp;D in the economy but rather what is the most cost effective rate of concession in

         gaining social benefits in exchange for public subsidies. Not once did you look at that and quote that in what your were saying, because this is the alternative point of view, which you have obviously taken no notice of. A subsidy, or a subsidy at a certain rate, which does not change recipients' behaviour when compared with no subsidy or some lower rate respectively, is simply a windfall gain to the recipients and not a cost effective use of public money. It is just not a cost effective use. You have chosen to totally ignore that opinion in putting your opinion before this house.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well as that, at the margin, giving a high subsidy to an increasing amount of increasingly less valuable R&amp;D may increase the total amount of R&amp;D but it does not increase the net social benefits. If the R&amp;D uses resources which, even after accounting for spillover benefits, could be more profitably employed elsewhere in the economy, the same applies to any activity. Statements to the effect that the R&amp;D concession is relatively generous, whether compared with other industry assistance, or by international standards, imply a judgment that the concession rate is set higher than that which is most cost effective.

How much at the margin will a certain reduction in the generosity of the concession reduce an R&amp;D, and what is the most cost effective rate? And what is the most cost effective rate, Senator Schacht, is what we are really talking about here tonight.

The government believes, as a central part of the budget, the Senate should be prepared to give us the support for the changes we have made to the tax concession for R&amp;D.

        Some would say that this is backdoor syndication, and the government has announced its intention to end syndication. I do not believe it can be fairly characterised that way. Even if it were characterised that way, it may well be instructive for the Senate to hear what the government said about syndication prior to the election. The government's policy statement on science and technology, in reference to syndication, said:

       </para>
       <para>
        What they were referring to are the guidelines that the Labor government introduced in the Innovation Statement on 6 December 1995. These were guidelines aimed at cutting out any abuse of the syndication system. I believe—all the evidence that the committee received when it inquired into this consolidates this belief—that those guidelines are effective in doing so. However, the government, then the opposition, was saying that they may be too tight, that they may in fact have gone too far and that therefore syndicated research may dry up. So they were making it clear by saying that they were strongly

        The way in which the government is intending to give effect to that election undertaking is to abolish the program. It can hardly be said that you are improving it by abolishing it. Nonetheless, what they are seeking to implement here tonight is the repudiation of their own electoral mandate. They say further in the same policy:

        And there is a whole range of factors, as one might imagine. One of the pertinent ones is whether the government's revised syndicated research and development scheme guidelines will be much less attractive to investors. The signal here is that they were looking to improve it rather than abolish it. And so it goes.

        The interesting thing about this is that this is the industrial research and innovation policy produced by the government when it was the opposition. Who was the responsible shadow minister at the time? The responsible shadow minister was none other than the now Leader in the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. I notice that he has had the good grace to head for the door of the chamber and leave, as the perfidy that has been entered into by his government is being exposed. I think it is absolutely essential that this provision be retained in the bill. That is why I oppose it.

        It is a pity, therefore, that the government did not support the second reading amendment of Senator Cook in relation to looking into these issues. I guess it is still open for them to do so in other ways. I am sure there are ways the Senate would support looking into any rorts that exist. I am sure the government can do that themselves in their own time as well. In this case, we will be supporting the continuation of the ability for smaller players in industry to have access to research syndication.

The justification for removing syndicates lies in their misuse by finance arrangers to lever up tax benefits to investors well beyond the level of real R&amp;D spending. Most syndicates are arranged so that investors are not at risk, whether the R&amp;D project is successful or not. In the majority of those syndicates, the tax benefits are in the range of 1.4 to 2.4 times the amount spent on R&amp;D.

        The government considers that the best way to encourage genuine R&amp;D is to provide assistance directly to researchers rather than to wealthy investors. To increase the effectiveness of R&amp;D assistance, the government is focusing that assistance towards increased outlays on R&amp;D and away from non-transparent costs and ineffective tax concessions.

         The government has announced a new program of direct assistance for researchers for genuine R&amp;D, establishing strategic assistance for research and development, the so-called START program. Under the program, the government will provide a flexible package of assistance totalling $340 million over the next four years to encourage large projects containing highly innovative or technically risky R&amp;D that has strong support for commercialisation from the private sector.

         I am not sure whether at this stage Senator Murray wants to make further comments, but I repeat that, under the program, the government will provide a flexible package of assistance totalling $340 million over the next four years to encourage large projects containing highly innovative or technically risky R&amp;D that has strong support for commercialisation from the private sector. We would urge all senators to recognise the importance of the government's position on this, the significance that it has to the government's program and the importance of the START program. I urge senators to support our position.

        The government has proposed modifying the deduction rules for interest expenditure used to finance R&amp;D, for R&amp;D feedstock, for core technology expenditure, and for pilot plant expenditure. These changes do nothing to advance the cause of greater efficiency or administrative simplicity. They do not contribute to greater or more focused R&amp;D expenditure. At present, interest paid on debt used to finance R&amp;D is deductible at 150 per cent. We see no reason to distinguish interest from other R&amp;D costs or to move away from the 150 per cent principle. We have heard the arguments of government. If they want to replace those sorts of principles, they have to provide some other form of incentive financing.

         —We are happy to support the feedstock moves by the government, since the particular rorts that arise from that section are not only bad in themselves but are also often used in a way that damages the environment. An example of this is the claim that a pulp mill or coal processor is an innovative piece of development and that the trees or coal are feedstock and hence tax deductible at 150 per cent. The feedstock amendment would see the value of the product deducted from the value of the feedstock so that the net cost of feedstock is all that is deductible. Pulp mills and coal producers may be some of the people rorting this measure. In this case, I

The very least that can be done to try to even it up a little and be fair is to support this Democrat amendment. We will do that.

        The treatment of feedstock was one issue raised. It should be remembered that the detail of this proposed amendment is the result of consultation with industry in Melbourne in September this year. Industry indicated that they were not entirely comfortable with the changes to feedstock. However, the industry accepted that a change was required and that the treatment of the expense item was satisfactory. Increasingly, it became apparent that the manufacturing process said to be R&amp;D would claim inputs at the premium rate while the output would be assessed at only 100 per cent. The bill seeks to allow deductions for only that part of the output that is consumed in the process to receive the premium rate.

        In relation to the pilot plant, it should be remembered that that occurred as a result of consultations with industry in September. Industry indicated that they were comfortable with the proposed changes to pilot plant. Core technology has been modified. Again, the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         detail of this amendment was discussed with industry. Industry did not, I am advised, appear unhappy with the decision to modify the treatment of core technology. Core technology expenditure was found increasingly to be a vehicle for structuring finance. It would deliver a claimant company a substantial tax benefit for R&amp;D previously conducted rather than new R&amp;D. I urge the Senate to support the government's position.

        The final part relates to the treatment of interest on debt, which has been limited to 100 per cent deductibility. Again, I am advised that industry did not appear unhappy with the decision to limit the level of concession to 100 per cent on interest expenses. Interest on debt was limited to 100 per cent to discourage the practice of funding R&amp;D entirely out of debt while using equity in other areas of the company. For example, assume you had a company with $100 of business expenditure, including R&amp;D expenditure of $20. The smart thing to do would be to fund the R&amp;D out of the debt so that the interest expense is at 125 per cent rather than the normal 100 per cent.

        These measures ensure that the existing definition of eligible R&amp;D is retained. The government has sought to curtail what qualifies eligible R&amp;D by changing the definition from `systemic, investigative or experimental

I have been persuaded by arguments from industry that changing the definition in the manner suggested would be counterproductive to effective and well&amp;hyphen;understood R&amp;D activities. This would simply exclude a tremendous amount of legitimate and vitally important R&amp;D. It will exclude R&amp;D of the sort that should be encouraged and motivated. It is a measure whose sole purpose is budget savings. It is just another way the government can pull out research funding.

        Moreover, I am concerned that by the use of the term `high level of technical risk' the government will be able to exercise a significant degree of restrictive discretion which will enable it to deny assistance to research projects on a pretty arbitrary basis. I stress, however, that I recognise the need to clarify definition of eligible research and development in order to enable more efficient processing. My amendment still enables us, as it retains all the clarification proposed but not the words `high level of technical risk' or the word `and' in place of the word `or'.

The international measure is the Frascati measurement that the OECD applies, but Australia has had a more

The reason why it has is that, of the 26 OECD countries, we are about 19th in private sector R&amp;D and there needs to be a more positive incentive for the private sector to get into R&amp;D. So we have allowed a broader definition, is my understanding. I do not know that I can agree with that last comment, but we will be supporting the Democrats on this.

But you know the AAT is not likely to find that way and, therefore, you want to get to the law and fix the case before it goes to the AAT. That is the plain fact of the matter here.

        These government amendments recognise the justice of the case, however—that is, that a number of applications, 46 in number, were put on the so-called `A' list by the government. These were applicants who would have been dealt with by the IR&amp;D board on 24 July at its scheduled meeting. But on 23 July the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) announced an end to syndication. Those applicants who were fully in anticipation of being dealt with were denied access to the board.

        This was legislation by press release. The government announced it by press release, so the board did not deal with them.

        My understanding is that the government claims that of the 46 applications before the IR&amp;D board, this will mean that 16 of them will have the opportunity of going forward and having their applications dealt with by the IR&amp;D board. That does not mean they will pass. They still have to win on their merits that this is justifiable R&amp;D within the tenets of that board, but at least they will have the chance to be dealt with. That is 16 out of 46—what the government claims.

        What we say, looking at the effect of this clause, is that only seven of 46 will be able to go ahead and be dealt with. There is an injustice here to 39 other applicants. I repeat: going to the board does not mean you will be granted. Going to the board only means that you will have to establish your bona fides under the provisions of the board as it existed and then be entitled to have your syndicate approved or not.

         an industry home workers code of practice, and to encourage other retailers to sign such a code. It is hoped that shoppers will be concerned about the exploitation of outworkers in the garment industry who may be working for as little as $2 an hour and that they will buy from retailers who have signed the home workers code of practice. I would like to highlight those retailers who have so far come to the party: Target, Just Jeans, Country Road, Witchery, Ken Done, Australia Post and Jacqueline Eve.

        Fair Wear, the coalition, has been mounting demonstrations in shopping centres in the pre-Christmas shopping season to educate consumers and to encourage retailers to sign the code. This coalition is, unfortunately, bitterly disappointed that at the last moment a significant group of retailers backed away from an earlier verbal agreement to support the code of practice. These retailers include: Coles-Myer, Daimaru, Fletcher Jones and Table Eight.

        After helping to initiate the home workers code of practice, these retailers have now refused to sign it. Through the Australian Retailers Association, they have proposed a new code which promises complete confidentiality to retailers and manufacturers found to be in breach of award wages and which makes the industry fully self-regulatory. The coalition sees the need for external grassroots monitoring that the unions can provide. They encourage consumers not to think that a code which does not involve any external regulation would actually assist outworkers.

        The home workers code of practice was a well thought through and workable proposal originally supported by several retailers, the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia along with several manufacturers. At this stage, the council is also not agreeing to proceed with the code. I should also indicate that there is also another group of retailers who have been unwilling to be part of any negotiations at this stage. They include: Big W, Sportsgirl, Sussan, Best and Less, and Westco.

         This was a deal that was brokered by Premier Olsen, the new Premier. It is a deal that has seen a massive cover up at every step of the process. It is a deal worth $1&amp;half; billion over 15 years. Every detail of this deal has been kept secret from the people and the parliament of South Australia.

         In a grievance speech on the last sitting day of the South Australian parliament, Labor leader Mike Rann asked a number of questions. He asked whether the new Premier Olsen still had confidence in the professionalism and ethical conduct of Mr Terry Burke, the consultant paid half a million dollars for his role in the water contract. He asked whether it was true that Mr Burke—despite NCA interest and a South Australian police inquiry—had since been employed by the South Australian government, on John Olsen's instructions, to work on the MFP smart city project.

          of massively expensive hotel rooms at taxpayers' expense. He is a character who celebrated the last French nuclear test at the Red Ochre restaurant in Adelaide with Bollinger champagne and then tried to make the South Australian taxpayer pay. He was not paid; he was knocked back for that.

         Mr Rann also asked whether the Premier was confident that negotiators working for the government during the water tender did not improperly pass on information from one tenderer to another in order to influence the outcome of the process in favour of United Water. He also asked whether he had informed the then Premier Dean Brown of interest shown in this matter quite some time ago by law enforcement authorities.

         If we go back a little bit further, in July this year Mike Rann was contacted by a citizen of South Australia who was concerned about information she had been given on the water deal. She had informed Rann about serious allegations by a South Australian Water Corporation executive about the bidding process. These included claims that the government's lead negotiator Mr Terry Burke had been involved in unethical and improper conduct during the process. A South Australian Water executive had told her that Mr Burke had involved himself in unauthorised meetings and that he had even socialised with the United Water executives outside the confines of the designated negotiations room for the water contract. These meetings took place, it was said, in Adelaide, Sydney and even on a boat on Sydney Harbour.

         There was not just one informant. The senior business leader contacted the South Australian shadow minister for industry, Kevin Foley, with similar claims of irregularities. I have since been told that Premier Olsen and his office were informed of similar allegations at the time, but they failed to take
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the allegations to the NCA or to the police. Rann, however, advised his principal informant to take her information immediately to the NCA and to the South Australian Auditor-General. She took legal advice and she agreed eventually to give her information only to the NCA, as she wanted to provide the information only to law enforcement officers. She was most concerned about confidentiality, given the nature of the allegations, and her own safety.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The informant asked Mr Rann to intervene for her. He spoke to the NCA's South Australian Director, John Ganley, whom I gather spoke personally to the informant and arranged for her to be interviewed. Sometime later I am told Mr Rann phoned Ganley with additional information, including information concerning an interstate businessman who had volunteered to be interviewed by the NCA. Rann was told that—and I think he has said this as well—the investigation should be more appropriately conducted by the anti-corruption unit of the South Australian Police Force.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On 7 August, Rann was asked by the NCA to prepare a letter giving it the authority to provide his confidential information to the South Australian police. Mr Rann told the NCA he was happy to speak to officers of the South Australian anti-corruption unit to expedite their inquiries, but I gather that since that time he has received no contact from the anti-corruption unit and was informed that the business leader who offered to provide information was not interviewed. I understand that just a couple of days ago Mr Rann lodged a freedom of information request to secure the detailed accounts and receipts of Mr Burke's extravagantly expensive involvement with this contract. It seems that, while the South Australian taxpayer pays, Mr Burke plays.

         I think this is just the latest instalment of what is dragging out to be a sorry saga. Public opposition to the water contract in South Australia is so overwhelming that the Liberal government has fought in the courts all year, including this week, to prevent the public release of opinion polls on the issue. The government paid taxpayers' money to a former Greiner staffer, Ian Kortlang, to conduct the polls. Then they refused to tell the public the result. I think this is only a small example of the practices and secrecy that are the hallmarks of this deal.

         The $1&amp;half; billion contract was awarded to a shelf company called United Water. Neither the contract nor its details have ever been made available to the public or the parliament. We know that South Australians are paying $1&amp;half; billion, but we do not know much else. John Olsen told us that United Water would become a majority Australian&amp;hyphen;owned concern. It is, in fact, almost wholly owned by the Compagnie Generale Des Eaux De France, CGE, and Thames Water of Britain.

          Parliament was told that some 20 senior executives of CGE's French based subsidiaries had been named in bribery cases. Olsen's response to the South Australian parliament was that the South Australian government would only sign a contract with companies of the highest integrity—you would wonder what his benchmark was. Shortly after this he announced the preferred tenderer as United Water, and then a few other facts turned up about the tender process that John Olsen did not want to surface. Do you know—and it is intriguing and quite ironic—that Dean Brown has been found guilty, convicted and executed for the offences that John Olsen has committed in South Australia?

          Labor discovered that, on the day that the closing bids were due—4 October 1995—United Water was given four extensions of time totalling four hours. The two unsuccessful bidders were not told of the extensions made available to their competitor. They had to get their bids in on time. The whole process was supposed to be videotaped in a secure room to prevent tampering with bids. The security tape ran out almost three hours before United Water's bid was received. It was not replaced. At the same time the contract manager left the building and did not return until after United Water's bid had been received.

They are angry at being misled about the level of Australian ownership. They are suspicious about the whole secretive and sordid process. In closing at this particular stage, I will just reiterate the point that I made earlier. This matter will drag out. The information will be brought out over time.

         I would like to speak about wetlands. It is increasingly recognised worldwide just how important and valuable wetlands are. Although wetlands come in many different forms, including lakes, swamps and tidal flats, one feature that is common to them is the enormous biodiversity that is associated with them. Wetlands also provide many other crucial environmental services—for example, flood control and nutrient filtering. They are also major producers of food energy for the wider environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On top of all this biological and ecological richness, wetlands are extremely beautiful and spiritually significant places. In a continent like Australia which is largely arid or semiarid, these areas of permanent or semipermanent water feature centrally in both Aboriginal cultural and spiritual life, and also in post&amp;hyphen;colonial literature and history. Arguably our most loved national song,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Waltzing Matilda

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another feature of wetlands is the way in which they are connected across the surface of the planet through the miraculous phenomenon of migratory birds. These bird species are, and should be recognised as, international roving ambassadors for the protection of the world's environment and the world's wetlands. Australia forms a vital link in this transnational odyssey. The Japan-Australia migratory bird agreement lists some 90 species of transequatorial birds which rely on Australia for their survival. Through such instruments as the Ramsar convention and the Japan-Australia migratory bird agreement, increasing efforts are being made for international cooperation to protect the world's remaining wetlands.

          It is a matter of tragic record that much of Western Australia's wetland heritage has been destroyed or severely degraded since European colonisation. According to the EPA report, some 70 to 80 per cent of the wetlands of the Swan Coastal Plain in the south&amp;hyphen;west of Western Australia have been destroyed or degraded since European settlement. It is even more distressing to know that, in full knowledge of how important these places are, the destruction of Western Australia's remnant wetlands continues with varying degrees of government support.

         <para first-indent="16">
          To give some small indication of how important Western Australia's wetlands are and how threatened they are, here are some examples: the Western Australian coastline, with its associated wetlands, is one of the six recognised major international transequatorial flyways for migratory birds. Important sections of this coastal route are at risk from pollution and development. For example, the wetlands of Roebuck Bay near Broome are in the top five migratory bird sites in the world. Despite this, they are threatened by mineral sands mining.

         <para first-indent="16">
          About 50 of the migratory bird species listed under the Japan&amp;hyphen;Australia migratory bird agreement are recorded from the remnant wetlands of the Peel-Harvey region in south&amp;hyphen;west Western Australian. Important parts of this wetland system are being destroyed as I speak. Places like the Creery wetlands languish under the threat of canal housing development. The south&amp;hyphen;west of Western Australia is particularly rich in wetlands. Even now, entirely new species and even new genera are being discovered in the south&amp;hyphen;west wetlands, such as the newly discovered genus of frog known as the `sunset frog'.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           About 80 per cent of the original wetlands of the south&amp;hyphen;west have been destroyed through some combination of clearing, agriculture, mining, housing development, draining, pollution, and

            invasion by weeds. Although the remaining wetlands of the south&amp;hyphen;west are of incalculable value, they continue to be sacrificed for the most base of commercial benefits or ideological motives. For example, the wetlands spread throughout the south&amp;hyphen;west forest region are being destroyed by the direct or indirect impacts of forest management practices, including frequent prescribed burning, road construction and dieback.

          On top of this, the Court government has recently—as is now a matter of record in this chamber—excised an area of wetland ecosystem from the D'Entrecasteaux National Park on the south coast for mineral sands mining. In a fitting irony, given the Japan&amp;hyphen;Australia migratory bird agreement, the company seeking to mine this wetland is the Japanese Nissho Iwai Corporation. In the agricultural region, many surviving wetlands are under grave threat from rising watertables and salinity. Despite this, important remnant wetlands are being destroyed for commercial benefits. For example, the important Lake Chinnocup `A' class nature reserve is under threat from gypsum mining.

          Elsewhere in the state, the mining and pastoralism industries have had and are continuing to have profound destructive impacts on surviving wetlands. For example, the mining industry is operating in many places in such a way as to draw down watertables or otherwise interfere with groundwater and drainage systems, thereby disrupting the water systems of adjacent wetlands. Pastoralism is responsible for massive wetlands impacts across much of the semiarid region of Western Australia, with sheep and cattle destroying fringing vegetation and causing erosion and pollution of wetlands.

          In recognition of the obvious value of our remaining wetlands and the very strong level of community concern and support for their protection, the coalition parties, prior to the last state election, promised `unprecedented attention to the protection of [WA's] Wetlands.' Wetland conservation was, and continues to be, a priority issue in WA, and the coalition's pre-election commitment to their protection was one of the main reasons they

          It is utterly disgraceful that four years later the record shows that not only have they not acted in any comprehensive manner to protect our wetland heritage, but also the Court government has been actively engaged in the ongoing destruction of wetlands. For example, ongoing land clearing is affecting wetlands in urban and agricultural regions. Wetlands have been modified to cater for urban expansion, for example at Canning Vale and Jandakot. Wetlands throughout the metropolitan area are potentially threatened by Perth's increasing reliance on unregulated bore water usage. The Ascot Waters wetlands have been bulldozed for housing and the adjacent salt marsh conservation area has been earmarked for modification.

          The Secret Harbour wetlands near Mandurah have been destroyed for a housing estate. Commitments on the creation of a scientific park and the protection of wetlands of Port Kennedy near Rockingham have not been honoured. The Creery Wetlands near Mandurah are a continuing risk of housing development. Some of the state's only surviving near-pristine wetlands in the Kimberley remain unprotected and/or unmanaged and are suffering increasing degradation through feral animals, grazing, fire, unmanaged recreation and tourism and mining. The Lake Chinnocup Nature Reserve is at risk from mining. Nationally recognised wetlands of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park are threatened by sand mining.

          The draft state wetland policy, released by the then Labor government in 1992, has not been finalised or implemented despite being promised.
