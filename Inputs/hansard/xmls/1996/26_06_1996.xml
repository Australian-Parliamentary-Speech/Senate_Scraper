        Subregulation 6(2) provides that the Secretary or an authorised officer may grant a permit exempting aircraft from provisions of the legislation; subregulation 6(3) provides that the Secretary or the authorised officer may impose conditions on a permission; and subregulation 6(4) provides that a permission must specify a period of up to a month during which the aircraft is exempt.

        New r.309H(1) requires a regulated agent to give effect to the agent's international cargo security program. New rr.309H(3) and (4), however, provide for the Secretary to exempt an agent from r.309H(1). There does not appear to be provision for review of this discretion, which could affect

        The Regulations give wide powers to authorised officers. However, the principal Regulations properly provide that before exercising these powers in relation to a person an authorised officer must produce a suitably endorsed photographic identity card. The Regulations also give powers to security officers. However, although security officers who are members of a uniformed security force or persons employed by an airport operator for the purpose of security must produce identification, there is no requirement for this to include a recent photograph. The Committee would appreciate your comments.

        New rr.311C(3)(d) and 311CAA(2)(d) provide that an authorised person has power "to discuss" operating procedures with specified crew and employees. It is unclear how far these powers extend. For instance, the provisions do not include the usual requirement that people must answer questions, with protection against self&amp;hyphen;incrimination. What is the obligation, if any, of an employee or crew member to take part in any discussion? May an employee refuse to answer questions? The Committee notes that there is a penalty of $5,000 if the authorised person is not permitted to exercise the power and if there is no reasonable excuse. Would it be a reasonable excuse if an employee or crew number declined to discuss procedures with an authorised person? The Committee would appreciate your advice.

        New r.309F(3) provides that a regulated agent must comply with a direction of the Secretary, while r.309F(4) provides that an agent must not contravene subregulation (3) intentionally or recklessly. No pecuniary penalty is fixed, although under r.309J(1)(d) the Secretary may remove a regulated agent's name from the list of air cargo agents if the agent breaches r.309F(4). However, an intentional or reckless breach of a direction of the Secretary under r.309K attracts a penalty of $5,000 as well as possible removal from the list. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the reasons for the substantial pecuniary penalty in one case but not in the other.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Regulations apply the general policy, in the matter of administrative appeals, of providing an appeal in relation to all decisions that may potentially act against the interests of a person affected by the decision. For example, a decision by the Secretary to reject a proposal (including a one&amp;hyphen;off proposal) of a regulated agent to modify the agent's cargo security measures under regulation 309G is appealable to the AAT.

        Cargo security measures implemented by an agent are outlined within the agent's international cargo security program. The program is a document of the agent, in that the agent prepares the program and sends a copy to the Secretary. The agent is accountable for implementing the cargo security measures outlined within its program. Where the Secretary is satisfied that the program is adequate for the purposes of aviation security (as outlined under regulation 309D), the Secretary may list the agent as a Regulated Agent.

        A decision of the Secretary to exempt an agent, under subregulation 309H(4), does not involve a potential to act against the interests of a person affected by the decision. Rather, a decision of the Secretary under subregulation 309H(4) has the effect of removing an obligation from the affected Regulated Agent, an obligation that the Regulated Agent freely entered into in the first place.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        Identification cards for security officers

        The Committee notes that, under regulation 311CAAA, security officers may request an individual to identify himself or herself. The Committee further notes that security officers who are members of a uniformed security force and persons employed by the operator of a categorised airport for the purpose of airport security are required to produce their identification card, or another appropriate form of identification, when exercising this power. The Committee asks why there is no requirement for the identification to include a recent photograph of the security officer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is a scheme covering identification cards for use within security restricted areas of Australia's airports—the Aviation Security Identification Card (or ASIC) scheme. Security officers are one of the classes of persons required to wear ASICs. A primary (and mandatory) feature of the ASIC is a photograph of the ASIC holder. ASICs have a fixed period of validity and must be renewed at least once every 5 years. As a result, the photograph of the ASIC holder, printed on the front of the ASIC, cannot be more than 5 years old.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, the Committee's point in this matter is acknowledged and the drafting of an amendment will be requested for subregulation 311CAAA(3) to require security officers (described in paragraph 311CAAA(1)(b) or (c)), when exercising their powers (including in areas other than security restricted areas of airports), to produce an identification card that includes a recent photograph which is to be no more than 5 years old.

        Powers of authorised officers to discuss procedures with industry

        The Committee notes that, under paragraphs 311C(3)(d) and 311CAA(2)(d), authorised officers are empowered to discuss procedures with aircraft crew; or employees of an aircraft operator, an airport operator or a Regulated Agent. The Committee believes that it is unclear how far these powers extend.

        The intention of these provisions is merely to ensure that the normal conduct of authorised officers (ie, specified officers of the Department of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Transport and Regional Development), when carrying out aviation security audits of industry, is within power and may not be impeded by the employer. Aviation security audits of industry bodies, by officers of the Department, normally involve the officers observing and inspecting the security procedures performed by airlines, airport operators and regulated agents.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Regulations provide that authorised officers may stay within relevant premises during the audit process and may observe and inspect procedures performed in those premises. The legal effect of this power (and of the offences under subregulations 311C(6) and 311CAA(3) is that airlines, airport operators or regulated agents may not eject authorised officers from the premises for trespass during the conduct of an authorised aviation security audit. In relation to off&amp;hyphen;airport premises, these audit powers only exist in relation to audits conducted during a reasonable time (eg, during normal business hours) and only after the authorised officer has given notice of the audit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These powers also include the power to discuss procedures with industry staff. That is, the Regulations provide that, in the event that authorised officers discuss procedures with industry staff, the authorised officers are not acting beyond their powers. The provision is designed to prevent an aircraft operator, airline operator or regulated agent from impeding a discussion between a Departmental officer and an employee during the course of an audit. There is no compulsion in the Regulation on employees to answer questions. The reason for this is that much of the activity being assessed will be apparent to Departmental staff from personal observation or sighting documentation, the purpose of discussion would be to clarify what has been already been observed.

        In answer to the Committee's specific questions, an employee may refuse to answer a question put by an authorised officer. The obligation in the Regulation is on the aircraft operator, airline operator or regulated agent not to prevent a discussion occurring.

        The Committee notes that, under regulation 309K, a Regulated Agent failing to comply with a Secretary's direction (relating to measures and resources to be used by the agent in responding to a threat) is guilty of an offence. The penalty is 50 penalty units. The Committee also notes that an agent must also comply, under Regulation 309F, with a direction of the Secretary to amend its cargo security program. However, an agent failing to comply with a direction under regulation 309F is not guilty of an offence. The agent is merely subject to an administrative action—the agent's removal from the Regulated Agents list.

        The Regulations introduce new aviation security standards for the handling and carriage of Australian outbound international air cargo. Cargo security controls are required to be applied by either the airline carrying the cargo or an air cargo agent who has elected to perform the controls on the cargo it handles and who has been registered with the Secretary. This allows security controls applied by agents to be recognised by the airline carrying the cargo.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Regulations do not specify the detailed security standards to be implemented for the handling of cargo. These are detailed within the security programs of international airlines and those agents who elect to become Regulated Agents. A Regulated Agent could, at any time, elect to opt out of the scheme, in which case the cargo security controls would be applied by another person eg, the airline carrying the cargo. An agent who elects to opt out would not be guilty of an offence.

        Regulation 309J outlines the circumstances in which the Secretary may de&amp;hyphen;list an agent. The effect of de&amp;hyphen;listing an agent is that the security controls applied by the agent are no longer able to be recognised by airlines carrying international cargo.

        Regulation 309F allows the Secretary to give notice to a regulated agent to amend its program, in the event that the Secretary is satisfied that the program is not adequate. For example, the nature of cargo normally handled by a regulated agent could change over time, requiring an equivalent change in the security measures implemented by that agent.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The intention is to view an agent, who fails to comply with a direction to amend a program, in the same way as an agent who elects to opt out of the cargo scheme. In both cases, the agent has decided no longer to apply security controls over the cargo it handles. Also in both cases, the decision of the agent is transparent to the Secretary and alternative measures may be made in relation to the cargo. The power to issue directions to agents under Regulation 309K is a part of the arrangements necessary to implement appropriate security counter&amp;hyphen;measures which are generally time critical. Any delay could substantially reduce the effectiveness of any industry&amp;hyphen;wide threat response. Because such a direction is initiated by the Secretary and not requested by the agent, it may not be immediately transparent to the Secretary that a regulated agent is not complying with a direction issued under regulation 309K.

However, administrative means are not available with a failure to comply with regulation 309K and it is necessary to create an offence for regulated agents failing to comply with this obligation. In view of the serious consequences (refusing to implement counter&amp;hyphen;measures to a real threat to aviation), it is considered appropriate for the offence to contain a substantial pecuniary penalty.

        During the present sittings the Committee maintained its non&amp;hyphen;partisan scrutiny of the continuing large number of disallowable instruments of delegated legislation tabled in the Senate. In the course of the sittings the Committee scrutinised 1021 such instruments. Only 199 of these were in the Statutory Rules series, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series. This is a trend that has been evident for some years. The other 822 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure compliance with its four principles, which cover all aspects of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. If the Committee detects any breach of these principles it writes to the Minister or other law maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives a notice of motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.

This was a problem with four separate instruments, relating to purported authority to make rules, determinate dates and set the conditions of performance pay. Also, unless authorised by an Act, instruments which operate with prejudicial retrospectivity are void. Three instruments appeared to operate in this way, all of which affected people engaged in commercial operations. Unless authorised by an Act, instruments may not incorporate material as amended from time to time, other than an Act or regulations. One instrument, also affecting commercial operations, purported to incorporate not only Acts as amended but also Acts as replaced.

        Any provisions relating to making instruments which are specific to a particular Act must be observed, as must the general law relating to such making. One instrument purported to be made under two provisions although it appeared that it could only be made under one or the other. One instrument could only be made by an authority, but it purported to be made by the Chairman of the authority. Another instrument gave no indication that lengthy and detailed mandatory requirements for making had been followed. Another instrument which the Act required to be made as soon as possible was made eight years later. An instrument required to be tabled as soon as possible after making was tabled more than six months after that date. Two Acts required a series of delegated legislation to be numbered consecutively in the order in which instruments were made, which was not done. One instrument purported to be made by one officer but was signed by another. Another instrument purported to amend an earlier instrument which had ceased to have effect because it was not tabled. Another purported to impose conditions on a process although there was no power to do so. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that Australian law was unclear on whether a particular levy was a tax or a contractual payment. One instrument inadvertently advantaged some people. The Explanatory Statement for an amending instrument which corrected the errors advised that in the meantime the inadvertent provisions were administered as they were intended to provide, not as they actually provided.

        The Committee had concerns about aspects of other instruments. One instrument created an offence, but did not provide a monetary penalty. Another instrument set a maximum liability for specified torts, but did not determine whether this was for one or more tortious acts or whether the limit was for one or more claimants. One set of regulations repealed certain Australian international sanctions, while another related set suspended them. One instrument provided for blanket procedures, when specific procedures appeared to be more appropriate, while another provided for blanket procedures although two weeks earlier an instrument in the

        Many instruments provide for aspects of taxes and charges. These are scrutinised by the Committee to ensure that they comply with parliamentary propriety. The Explanatory Statements for a number of instruments did not advise of the basis for increases in taxes or, in one case, of a large and unexpected increase in fees. Another instrument provided for a certificate to cost $13.65 and a replacement certificate $270. The Committee also questioned a quarantine charge of $875,000 for any consignment of any animals for one year. One instrument increased a number of allowances by 35%, but increased a similar allowance by only 12%.

        The Committee scrutinises the technical drafting and presentation of delegated legislation, with the object of ensuring that its quality is not less than that of Acts. One instrument used permissive rather than mandatory expressions when providing for an intended benefit. Another included the same numbers twice in a table. One instrument included two identifier numbers, which have previously resulted in tabling under one number in the House of Representatives and under another in the Senate. Other instruments had no numbering. Some instruments were made after an apparent delay; one was made to address issues which arose nine months earlier, one was made one year after the events to which it refers, while another was made after such delay that relevant allowances were increased by one third. One instrument appeared to fail to effect its legislative intent. Other instruments included drafting errors and inaccurate references. One provided for an unusually wide power of delegation. Another included obsolete expressions such as fireman, lineman and laundryman. Others included vague and subjective expressions. The Explanatory Statements for several instruments did not advise that they were made to implement undertakings given to the Committee. The Explanatory Statement for another did not advise why a sunset provision was being extended.

One instrument granted qualified privilege to supervisors performing duties under business rules, with no indication of what constituted those rules. Another instrument provided only six days for employees to elect to change from one superannuation scheme to another. Another instrument, made on 26 February 1996, required a person to obtain an annotated certificate from authorities in Europe by 31 March 1996. One instrument gave public officials power to `discuss procedures' with employees, with a penalty of up to $5000 for people who did not permit this. Another instrument made inadequate provision for identification of public officials who could exercise wide powers. These inadequate provisions included only vague reference to identity documents, with no requirement for photographic identification. One series of instruments appeared to make inadequate provision for overtime allowances for Commonwealth employees.

        Delegated legislation often provides for Ministers and other public officials to exercise discretions. Such discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit the exercise of the discretion, and provide for appropriate review of the merits of a decision to an external, independent tribunal, which would normally be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Two instruments included a double discretion. One granted a public official a discretion both to decide on the amount of an overpayment and then to decide on whether to repay it. The other granted the Minister, or in practice the Minister's delegate, a discretion both to decide on whether an activity is for certain purposes and then to decide whether to refund it. The Committee suggested that in both these instruments the first discretion should be subject to AAT review and the second discretion removed. Similarly, another instrument provided a discretion for a public official to waive certain payments if these were due to mistakes by officials. The Committee considered that in this case as well the discretion should be removed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One instrument provided for a discretion which would have an effect on superannuation payments. No criteria were provided to limit and guide the exercise of the discretion. The Explanatory Statement, however, advised that the discretion would only be exercised favourably if this was clearly justified in the particular circumstances. The Committee believes that such criteria should be included in the body of the instrument and, given the nature of both the discretion and the criteria in this case, that AAT review be provided. Another instrument provided for a public authority to revoke a licence `at any time and for any reason'. Here also the Committee considered that a discretion drafted in such a way should be subject to external review.

One granted a discretion to decide on refunds, remissions or rebates of duty on fuel oil. Another granted a discretion to exempt an operator from an international air cargo security program, with no apparent AAT review, although AAT review was expressly available for other discretions provided for in the instrument.

This penalty, although light, was the highest that could be imposed under the enabling provisions for the regulations.

        The delays being experienced by compensation claimants are causing real hardship and distress in many cases.

        The Opposition have introduced into the House a Private Members Bill which seeks, in its own way, a mechanism to overcome the shortcomings of the original legislation.

        This bill establishes an alternative approach for compensation payers to ensure that the Commonwealth is repaid any monies owed for Medicare and nursing home benefits without delaying the payment of the bulk of the compensation amount to the claimant.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill enables compensation payers to make an "advance payment" to the Health Insurance Commission upon finalisation of the claim and then immediately pay the remainder to the claimant.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current arrangements rely on claimants obtaining a Notice of Charge from the Health Insurance Commission before their case is finalised either by court judgment or settlement. The Notice of Charge is compiled from information given to the Commission by the claimant and is valid for 3 months. Where the case is finalised without a current Notice of Charge, the insurer must withhold the compensation amount until the charge has been calculated and the amount repaid to the Health Insurance Commission. Under the current act, this can take up to 3 months.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Notice of Charge can take some time as it is essentially a three step process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, the Health Insurance Commission must send the claimant a list of all Medicare services since the date of the injury. The claimant has to indicate on the list which of the services relate specifically to that injury and return it to the Commission. At this point the Commission can issue the Notice of Charge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For a variety of reasons it appears that a significant number of cases are being finalised without a current Notice of Charge. In some cases, the claimant's lawyer has not been aware of the new scheme, in other cases there has been misunderstanding about what precisely is required.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unfortunately, in many cases it has been delays at the Health Insurance Commission which have caused the problem. In the main, these delays are due to a much larger volume of claims than was expected when the scheme was designed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some of this increased volume has been caused by an anomaly in the act which unnecessarily required the notification of a large number of claims which predated the act and are not caught by its repayment provisions. This anomaly is also being addressed by the amendments in this bill.

        Under these circumstances, this bill enables the insurer to pay ten percent (or another amount determined by the minister) of the compensation amount to the Health Insurance Commission as an advance payment against any debt owing. This must be done within 28 days of the judgment or settlement. The remaining 90 percent can then be paid to the claimant.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In most cases, the withheld amount will exceed the amount owing. This arrangement will therefore not only give the claimant an incentive to settle the matter as quickly as possible but also ensure that the Commonwealth recovers the amounts owing as equitably as possible.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Where an advance payment is made, the Health Insurance Commission will send the claimant a list of all their services since the date of the injury. As with the current scheme, the claimant must then indicate to the Commission which of the services relate to the compensation injury. Where the amount owing is less than the advance payment held by the Commission, the difference must be refunded to the claimant. Where the amount owed is greater than the advance payment, the claimant has to pay the Commission the additional amount.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While this new alternative is beneficial as it will allow claimants who finalise without a Notice of Charge to receive the bulk of their compensation payment immediately, I should point out, that for claimants this is still an inferior course of action to that of obtaining the Notice of Charge BEFORE finalisation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the Notice is obtained before settlement, claimants will know the full extent of their debt to the Health Insurance Commission before they settle the case and they need have no further dealings with the matter; the insurer will make sure that the debt is paid before they receive the compensation amount.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, with the new advance payment option, claimants may not know the full extent of their debt to Medicare before settlement and they will be left to sort this out themselves at some later date. It could be 3 months or more before any refund is actually made. Further, because the usual practice at present is for claimants'lawyers to receive their payment from the settlement amount some claimants may not even have the benefit of legal assistance in these dealings. For this reason, the bill requires insurers to fully inform claimants of the possible consequences of the advance payment route before they are able to make such a payment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Experience with the early cases under the scheme is that the amount of benefits to be repaid to the Commonwealth is about 7 per cent on average of the compensation amount. Therefore in setting the
        <break page="2187" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         figure at 10 percent we are allowing a margin of about 50 percent above this average to ensure that in most cases the amount held will be sufficient to cover the debt.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unless there are other compelling reasons, any future variation to the amount of the advance payment should be in keeping with this principle.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill specifies that the advance payment option is only available where the total compensation amount is at least $3000. The administration of the advance payment scheme is such that it is not economic for it to be available for small claims. In these cases, it is hard to see a claimant could be significantly disadvantaged from the sorts of delays that are likely to occur with the current scheme. This amount can be varied by a determination of the minister which would be disallowable by the parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill provides for the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission to be satisfied about the substantial truth of the statement made by the claimant as to which Medicare services relate to the injury in question before repaying any amount of the advance payment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Early experience with the scheme has shown that a handful of claimants are making statements which, on the face of it, are difficult to believe. One claimant for example, stated that she had no Medicare claims related to the injury even though
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        her Medicare records showed a large number of claims with dates of service commencing the day after the date of the injury. Many of these services, such as X&amp;hyphen;rays were quite consistent with the type of injury in her compensation claim.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the advance payment arrangements, the risk of this type of false claim is slightly greater as many claimants will be completing the Section 18 statement without benefit of legal advice and may not be aware of the consequences should they make a false statutory declaration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Where the Managing Director is not satisfied that the statement made by the claimant is substantially correct, the claimant must be notified of this in writing. Decisions made by the Managing Director in this regard are able to be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

        With the approach of the centenary of Federation and the opportunity to consider constitutional changes and the shape of Australian society into the next millennium, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (16 and 17 Year Old Voluntary Enrolment) Bill 1996 seeks to make one crucial change in the way in which young people participate in our society.

        The bill provides for 16 and 17 year olds to take up the option of enrolling to vote in federal elections. This would not be a mandatory requirement, but an option for those who wish to exercise it. However, once enrolled, people who choose the option, would be compelled to vote in the same manner as now exists for those on the roll.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That is the substance of the bill, and I want now to say something about the thinking behind it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Throughout history there have been numerous occasions when people have sought to redress imbalances of power, or a lack of a voice in their society. Examples which come to mind include the American revolution, with its slogan of "no taxation without representation", which is most apt in relation to this bill, and the movement for womens suffrage in various parts of the world.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I cannot claim that there is a revolutionary spirit in the country over this issue at present, but it may well be that this parliament could take a lead for change in considering this legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is, however, a compelling argument for change to the Electoral Act so that young people in this country can achieve a greater sense of belonging and participation in the decisions which affect their lives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The previous government took up the issue of active citizenship and, at times, floated the idea that a greater commitment to education about citizenship should be taught in schools. However, this did not seem to extend to changing that most fundamental of all indicators of citizenship for young people by giving them the right to vote.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australian history shows examples of occasions when the difference in age between civic duty and voting age was bridged in recognition of the contribution being made by some young people. I am referring, of course, to the provision for a lower voting age for service personnel engaged in overseas combat during World War II and during the Malaysian emergency in the 1960s.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But war is an extreme example. There are many other areas of community life in which young people are routinely involved.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Young people under the age can be married, they can leave home, obtain a driver's licence and they are required to pay taxes on their income. They are able to apply to Social Security for benefits on their own cognisance, they can be (and often are) questioned by police and can be required to answer charges in court.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As we prepared this bill, my staff and I sought information on other countries where 16 and 17 year olds are able to vote. We found that both Brazil and Nicaragua allow this age group to vote for the national assembly, and that it has been raised as a matter for serious community debate in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         New Zealand, South Africa and Canada, where it was considered in the context of a Royal Commission on Electoral Reform. The South Australian Government has the matter under consideration, as is also the case with a group of members of the ACT Legislative Assembly.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Young people want to be active participants in the Australian community. Sadly, at a number of levels, the potential of their contribution has been blunted by an inability to gain access to the means of involvement. While the community is content to allow young people some of the marks of being part of the mainstream, such as driver's licence, some benefits and the right to seek work, there is an increasing sense of alienation on the part of young people. It is my belief that a great deal of that alienation is due to their absolute or practical exclusion from some of the more significant marks of citizenship.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Too many of our young people are unemployed, thus casting them into the social security system. Too many come in for unnecessary attention from police because of their use of public places in their leisure time. Too many are finding that, even if they can find a place in a training program, the program leads nowhere.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course, it is not possible to solve all these problems by means of this bill to alter the Electoral Act. However, the change proposed in the bill would provide a means by which one aspect of this alienation could be redressed. But I believe that the involvement of young people in the electoral processes of this country would bring about many positive changes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A positive consequence of such a change would be the emphasis it would give to young people when political parties are formulating policy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This will give them standing in such policy areas as provision of legal services for young people, labour market programs and education.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similarly, political parties, and governments, will need to focus greater attention on voter education in schools, which will have positive spin&amp;hyphen;offs for the whole community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in 1988, commenting on the issue of `active citizenship', had this to say
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        "An active citizen in the committee's view is someone who not only believes in the concept of a democratic society but who is willing and able to translate that belief into action . . . . and a conviction that active participation is the right of all citizens."
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I'm sure that all honourable senators would agree that amongst the hallmarks of young people are convictions, energy and a desire to be involved in action.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        "Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of lowering the voting age is that it would reverse the trend in recent years to scapegoat young people for various social problems. It would redress a power imbalance which makes young people easy targets for politicians who want to make a name for themselves . . . . It might just help reduce some of the alienation which the political exclusion of young people currently causes."
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course, whenever this issue is raised, some will argue that young people don't know enough about the political processes to vote responsibly. We are told that they are not mature enough to exercise the right to vote well. Clearly political wisdom is not somehow conferred on people in some magic ceremony on their eighteenth birthday, it is a developmental process, like all other learning processes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        More importantly, if understanding of our system of government and our political processes is to be considered a pre&amp;hyphen;requisite, many thousands of adults may be disqualified.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Indeed, a number of surveys have indicated a very high level of understanding of these issues among young people, and the New Zealand Royal Commission on the Electoral System in 1986 specifically rejected the notion that young people lack the capacity to make political judgements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As an exercise, I had the parliamentary research service provide an estimate of how many people aged 16 and 17 years would have been eligible to vote in the elections in March this year. On the basis of 1995 statistics, it is estimated that some 470,000 young people would have been eligible to enrol under this bill.

        This country has an opportunity to bring about a number of significant changes with the landmark of the constitutional centenary. This bill presents a means of making one such change. Lowering the voting age will not address every issue facing young people, but it will enhance their participation in the life of their society and in the decisions which govern their lives.

         This motion refers to the development import finance facility, universally known by its

          initials and acronym DIFF. This is a scheme which provides for soft loans in the form of aid basically for infrastructure and environmentally friendly development in developing countries, principally in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. On 15 February in a document entitled `Meeting our commitments' released by Mr Costello, now the Treasurer, the present government indicated that it would abolish the DIFF scheme and replace it with a concessional loan scheme at some future time. Since then, and as recently as yesterday, on several occasions the government has confirmed on the public record that the scheme is to go.

         This is an important scheme. The government's handling of its announcement of its intention to abolish the scheme and its vagueness about what it might do are matters of national comment, national notoriety and, in my view, national disgrace.

         I do not think we have ever seen before in the field of foreign affairs a conjunction of so many organisations, interest groups and foreign countries opposed to and putting their opposition on the record concerning the abolition of the scheme. A range of organisations has made it clear that if this scheme were to be removed it would be a tragedy for Australia, a tragedy for Australian companies, a tragedy for Australian industry at large, a tragedy for our Asian neighbours and a tragedy for those unemployed people who are looking for employment in Australia.

         The reason for moving for an inquiry into this matter is that I believe strongly the public has a right to know what the virtues of this scheme are and what the criticisms of it might be. It will provide at a committee level an opportunity for the government to try to justify what I think is frankly a stupid act, as it has been called by respected national commentators. It will also allow us to deal with the bungling efforts of the government to implement this scheme and the misleadings that appear to have occurred in the House of Representatives by the responsible minister.

          former diplomats, Richard Woolcott, has condemned the government on the abolition of the scheme. Mr Woolcott is a considered person.

In the

        </para>

         The essence of Mr Woolcott's letter is that the federal government's decision to scrap the development import finance facility would undermine Australia's credibility, offend neighbouring governments and harm Australia's competitiveness. The letter dated 4 June was to Mr Andrew Thomson, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In that letter Mr Woolcott argued that the government should reverse its election commitment to abolish the DIFF because it contradicts the larger commitment that the government made of making closer ties to the region the government's top foreign priority. The letter states:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         As things stand Mr Howard's and Mr Downer's rhetoric about closer engagement with Asia has been eroded by this action and our credibility and reputation for reliability in the region will suffer, especially in the Philippines following understandings reached during President Ramos's visit last August.

         A number of industry associations have condemned the abolition of DIFF as an effort in cutting off your nose to spite your face. This is a scheme that generates contracts for Australian companies, puts them in a premier position in the world to win further contracts and is responsible for a number of leading Australian companies becoming more effective in Asia and winning contracts in their

The best example of that is Clough Engineering, the chairman of which is a former president of the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the chairman of the Liberal Party's review group in that state. His company has distinguished itself—and all credit to him and his company—by using the scheme intelligently, and it has gone further to win other contracts in Asia to build Australia's participation in that booming market.

Perhaps the most succinct summary of the media's view appeared in the editorial of the

         The Federal Government has made a big mistake with its decision to end the concessional aid program known as the Development Import Finance Facility.

         If they were the only voices raised in protest, then there would be a cacophony of protest from within Australia. But protest about this government reaches beyond our shores. A number of distinguished ambassadors accredited to this capital representing nations from the Asia-Pacific area have also raised their voices on the public record in Australia. Many of them put their views privately to the government before doing so, as one would expect from ambassadors. The ambassadors of the People's Republic of China, of Vietnam, of the republic of Indonesia, and of the Philippines have all entreated the government on the public record not to proceed with its ill&amp;hyphen;advised intentions to terminate this scheme.

          They point to the value of the scheme in their own nations. They illustrate in their remarks—and there are so many of them that I will not go to each individual one—the immense damage that will be done to Australia's reputation in the region if this scheme is abolished. They go further in their muted ambassadorial language to refer to the bungling efforts of this government to terminate the scheme when a number of companies are currently in the throes of developing contracts and will have those contracts terminated while in mid stride. That of course raises questions in the region of Australia's reputation for reliability.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the Asian region many things have been written about business ethics and business behaviour. Of all of those comments, one thing can be distilled from them: in this region a premium is placed on trust and honesty. Indeed, many contracts survive because people know and understand the reliability of individuals and of companies. So, when you lose a contract because you have not honoured it or you terminate a contract such as this, it calls into question trust and honesty. It also means that Australia does not start again from zero. It starts from a handicapped position well behind zero because, once a quality such as trust is lost, the efforts to regain trust are of Pavlovian dimensions. You have to succeed in proving trust at least nine to 11 times before anyone would ever believe that you are a trustworthy person. For this government to terminate those projects, in the future its reputation faces that sort of hurdle in Asian eyes.

          It is not just the ambassadors. If it were, perhaps the government would try to square its account with them. They are faithful message carriers for their host governments as well. We now know from the public record that a number of ministers in foreign governments have raised this question directly with Australia. We have had the notorious example covered in question time and censure motions in the House of Representatives just this week regarding Madam Wu Yi and her vice&amp;hyphen;minister's letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in which she raised questions about the scheme. We know from what

          I have here a copy of a letter dated 13 June from Jakarta under the signature of Minister Habibie in which he refers to a major project that would have attracted DIFF and raises an entreaty with the government that, given the importance of this project to Indonesia, the DIFF scheme should be extended in some way for this project at the very least. Coming from a government of a major developing country like Indonesia and our most important nearest neighbour, that is a major question in its own right. It certainly underlines the significance of the DIFF scheme that that government sees, and it underlines the importance of particular projects that go to assistance in developing our nearest neighbour along the path from being a developing country to being a partly and ultimately developed country.

          This letter from Mr Habibie carries other significance too. Mr Habibie—or, giving him his proper title, Dr Habibie—is a significant figure in Indonesia. The press often write of him as a future president of that nation. What is certainly true is that he is a distinguished scientist in his own right, quite an impressive person, a major public figure in Indonesia and someone with a great deal of influence who could easily succeed at being appointed as president at whatever time it is that President Suharto chooses to retire, if he does.

          As well, Dr Habibie is a friend of Australia. He came as a guest of the Australian government last year. His importance in the trade relationship between Indonesia and Australia, particularly in what Australia can contribute to that relationship in technology and in science based products and services, is quite significant. He appreciates our value. His raising these questions directly with the government comes from not just any minister. This is a senior figure in the whole of the Asia-Pacific region, a distinguished public figure and scientist in his own right and someone whose voice should be listened to. Those entreaties from our nearest neighbours

           and our most important regional associates have been overlooked by this government. One needs to get to the bottom of why they see that as being something that they can blithely flick off in the manner in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs seems to have chosen to do.

          There is good reason why all of these people have stood up and spoken out in support of this scheme. That good reason can be simply encapsulated by saying this is a scheme which works and which is effective. Destroying something that works and is effective and that greases the wheels of fraternal and good relations in the region for a win-win outcome, both for the developing country and for Australian industry and Australian government, is the silliest of things that one could imagine. It has two-way benefits. Over 700 projects have been funded under this scheme, and all of them are vastly appreciated by the partners who have joined together to make those projects successful.

          Another interesting and important dimension of the scheme and one that needs particular commentary, I think, concerns the innovation by the previous Labor government under the ministerial control of now Mr Gordon Bilney for the introduction of green DIFF. One knows that in the Asia-Pacific area, where the pressure is often on governments to take development at any price, matters of environmental damage do occur. One knows that those governments are placed in an intolerable dilemma. They are often faced with having to decide whether they should plumb for projects which will create economic growth, jobs for their underemployed population and development for their nation or whether they should plumb for the environmental elements that sometimes those projects might endanger. That is a terrible and intolerable position for those governments to be placed in.

          So green DIFF to encourage development in the environmental area is quite a significant innovation and an important one for Australia, which takes its corporate responsibility in the world on matters environmental as being a high priority, a first priority. If those projects about water purification, about greenhouse gas
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           emissions and about other elements of environmental degradation in those nations were to be undercut because of the removal of green DIFF, that would be a blow to the global ecology and to the ecology of this region. This government waxes lyrical about its so-called environmental credentials but engages in a blackmail over Telstra. Here is one area in which it could prove its environmental credentials, if it so chose; but it chooses not to by cutting this scheme.

         </para>

          Those countries faced with the dilemma of creating jobs at the risk of environmental degradation are faced with the possibility of pollute&amp;hyphen;now&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;pay&amp;hyphen;later development. The DIFF scheme plays an important role in ameliorating those terrible choices those countries are faced with, and green DIFF in its own right should stand no matter what.

         <para first-indent="16">
          But the worst feature of what the government has proposed, and one of the matters that need to be inquired into further and which this inquiry would allow, is the impact on the viability of companies currently engaged in the DIFF program. There are currently 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline for 1996-97 and beyond. These projects have already been formally agreed to in bilateral aid consultations between Australia and foreign officials.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition AusAID, our foreign aid agency, has provided letters of advice to Australian companies in respect of these projects and has asked them to prepare project feasibility studies. In other words, a number of Australian companies have invested their capital in winning these contracts. Having won them, these companies are being asked to take those contracts to the feasibility stage, which involves these companies in outlays. These companies are now to be cut off. They are to lose the money they have outlaid and the investments they have made in good faith under an understanding of this scheme continuing.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fifty-two projects around the region are not projects to be lightly sneered at. Of the 52 projects, $67 million has been expended to date. Eighteen of those projects are in China, 16 are in Indonesia, seven are in the Philippines and five are in Vietnam. Those 52
          <break page="2196" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           projects have a DIFF value of $379 million and a contract value of $1,082 million. So, by those figures, we can see the magnitude of damage being visited on Australian companies gratuitously by this government. It has an impact on these companies' viability in the local market as well as internationally, with implications for employment and job availability for Australians—not to mention the damage it does to foreign relations within the region.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The loss of contracts valued at $1,082 million is not something that this government—which has promoted its concern about the current account deficit, a reasonable and proper concern, as being one of its centrepieces of economic policy—can walk away from. Under DIFF Australian companies lever themselves into contracts which help the current account deficit improve and which lead those companies, having established their bona fides in the region, on to other contracts which improve the current account deficit as well.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If a government is dinkum about its concern on the current account deficit, it would not cut DIFF and it would not expose Australian companies to the financial risk and Australian workers to job loss that cutting DIFF would do. So the inquiry should look at what major financial damage is inflicted on Australian companies, what loss of jobs this will potentially create and actually create and what damage it does to our image abroad when we do not keep our word that we are reliable, when trust in Asia is a vital and necessary ingredient in business.

          It is not as if the only country with a scheme such as this is Australia. One of the things that are true about the Australian economy now is that it is increasingly globalised. Therefore Australian companies have to succeed not only in a globalised economy which is our domestic economy but also in a globalised economy which is the economy of our region and of the rest of the world.

We won't assist. We won't match some of the others, therefore we are bound to lose.' Goodwill being damaged by the abolition of the scheme will mean that, if all things are equal but our prices are a bit higher, goodwill will not save us, because we have lost trust by the abolition of the scheme and other countries support their industry far better than Australia does.

          I mentioned the current account deficit. I mentioned that this government has on the chopping block three other major things that help our trade as well as DIFF. I mention them now, but in passing. The export market development scheme, we understand, is slated for complete removal. The ITS scheme is also slated to go that way, despite the fact that it is a loan based scheme and not a direct outlay under the outlays side of the budget. We know that the Expenditure Review Committee of this government on 4 June imposed on Austrade a 24.3 per cent cut in running costs, thus meaning a cut of one quarter to the Austrade running costs budget.

          My final point concerns the bungling manner in which this government has gone about the abolition of the scheme. It knows it is doing something unpopular. Rather than face the music squarely, tell the truth and accept constructive criticism, there has been an effort by the Foreign Minister (Mr Downer) at least, and maybe by others, to try to hide the facts from the Australian community. On this basis alone there is a clear case for an inquiry into these events.

We saw him duck and weave when a letter was produced from a vice minister from the People's Republic of China on behalf of their minister for economic development and foreign trade, Madam Wu Yi.

          My final reason for wanting an inquiry into this event is best described by the efforts we have made through the normal forums of this chamber to find out more and better information with the DIFF scheme. On 20 May this year I asked Senator Short a question in question time about what the government's intentions were. Let me go to that question. The first question was: `Are you aware that Japanese, German, French and Italian companies will now be rejoicing at your government's decision to abolish the DIFF system because of the benefits flowing to them at the expense of Australian companies as a result of this decision?'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The second question was quite direct: `Don't you agree that the DIFF scheme would have helped position Australian companies to win some of this work, but that that will now not happen?' The third question was: `What bids for contracts by Australian companies are now in jeopardy because DIFF is to be axed? How many jobs are entailed?' The last question was: `What effect will the loss of these contracts have on our trade position and the current account deficit?' They are questions seeking information. They are questions seeking fact.

If the question time forum does not work, then the Senate has no alternative but to go to an inquiry to elucidate the facts.

This is purely an attempt by the opposition to attack the Foreign Minister, Mr Downer. I do not think there is any doubt about that.

         If the opposition genuinely wanted the issues of DIFF  and its placement in the aid program considered by the parliament, we would have heard about it months ago.

That is an abuse of the Senate committee process, which is here to enable the Senate to explore public policy options, and that is not the intention of the opposition in this regard at all.

         Obviously, the government has to decide what it can afford with the foreign aid vote and the construction of the foreign aid contribution. We criticised DIFF in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the election. DIFF is a subsidy at taxpayers' expense towards public infrastructure programs in developing countries. It enables Australian companies to bid for those programs. Basically, it means that the taxpayer is being asked to contribute approximately $140 million this year to Australian business to subsidise its investment overseas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The extent to which the taxpayer should be supporting Australian business investment is an issue that is open to debate.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government went to the people with a detailed, costed program that would, in part, enable a budget surplus to be achieved and which also recognised the pain and suffering that so many Australians have experienced during the recession and the years since the recession. We acknowledged up front that in some areas of public expenditure there would have to be cuts. We detailed the cuts—the programs and the costs. DIFF was one of them. It was debated during the course of the election campaign. I can remember debating it in business forums at that time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is true, Senator Cook, that some businesses were unhappy with the concept of our cutting a subsidy to business. That is not surprising. But businesses were also saying to us, which is even more important, that they wanted us to get public expenditure down so that we could provide for them the best possible economic parameters in which to operate. In other words, business wanted us to keep interest rates, taxation and inflation down.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Business knew that we could not do that if we continued down the path of the previous government, which was high expenditure paid for by increases in taxation, particularly increases in borrowings for which the whole community, including business, would have to pay. That resulted in Australia becoming uncompetitive in so many areas, and that is the real burden upon Australian business wanting to invest within the Asian region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Business said to us that a greater priority was getting those economic fundamentals right. It acknowledged that we would have to cut public expenditure to do that. Some businesses said that they would prefer that it not be in an area in which they receive subsidies, but that is just human nature.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The important point is that this debate was had at the time of the election. The areas of expenditure cuts were on the table, as were the new areas of increased expenditure. In other words, in addition to getting the economic parameters right, we wanted to give something back, through taxation assistance in particular, to the Australian families who
         <break page="2199" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          have suffered so much in recent years. We wanted to give something back in health care and in those other areas with which we are all so familiar. Both sides of the ledger were set out in great detail at the time of the election. There was nothing hidden about DIFF; it was part of that.

        <para first-indent="16">
         After the election we found that the economic facts of life were much worse than had been revealed at the time of the election. We found that we had an additional $8,000 million to make up. In other words, there was an undisclosed budget deficit in the forecast of some $8 billion. I make that point only to demonstrate how much more difficult it is now to retrace our steps and to exclude areas of public expenditure cuts detailed at the time of the election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was put to us today that we should abandon our intention to cut expenditure in this regard. It is impossible for us to abandon detailed areas of expenditure cuts while at the same time meeting the extra deficit burden of another $8,000 million in savings. That is the problem that the government faces, and the opposition parties in this place are very familiar with it. We cannot break the promise we made in this instance. A Senate inquiry, even if it were a genuine attempt to build upon public knowledge, would not be able to influence us to do that in any event.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The next point I want to make is that for years we have been told, particularly by the Greens and the Australian Democrats—and all the NGOs in the aid world—that DIFF was not good aid. They said that subsidising Australian business was not the best way in which to spend the Australian aid vote; that the priority should be the areas of poverty alleviation, small scale development, primary health care, multilateral and bilateral humanitarian aid, and so on. We were told that a subsidy to Australian business appearing within the aid vote distorted our aid contribution.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In many ways, in determining our priorities within the aid vote, and while recognising that there would have to be cuts, we were responding to the demands of the Australian aid community. We are not embarrassed that we have given priority to areas such as policy

          alleviation. We believe that the vast majority of the Australian people would support us in that choice.

         I could go on, but there is legislation and other things before the Senate that need to be done. If I had time, I could develop the argument that Australia's DIFF contribution has not been well spent under the previous government. Senator Cook would know that one year it gave every dollar to one Australian company. Senator Cook would know the whole depressing legacy of Labor's attempt to introduce mega&amp;hyphen;DIFFs, in which it was going to expend the money on just one or two huge projects. It was another one of these attempts by former Labor prime ministers to attach themselves to grand overseas developments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia's contribution through DIFF has not been an overall happy experience, apart from the issues that I have already raised. We have said that there is an argument for a reformed mixed credit scheme, and we have committed ourselves to examine the detail of that and to come back in due course with proposals for a more efficient and better targeted scheme of concessional finance. In due course, we will do that, but, in the meantime, we intend to stand by our promise, and that means we have made our decisions of choice and we have made our choices within the aid vote. We have made our choices, difficult though they might be, as to where we should be cutting public expenditure to achieve the overall economic benefits that are so important to all taxpayers, including Australian business that is seeking to invest in Asia, and we will be standing by those choices.

         We regret, as I said at the outset, that the Senate is being used in this way—simply to achieve another short&amp;hyphen;term political gain of the opposition, and that is to attack one of the government's ministers rather than to get about work that could lead to changes in public policy that could be to the betterment of public administration generally.

         However, let me make the point that development aid is not mentioned here. It is not in the terms of reference of this committee inquiry. The inquiry will be looking into the proposed abolition of this scheme, a mixed credit scheme, and how that is going to affect various things in the region.

         I would like to foreshadow a move to amend the motion to add an extra section to it. That extra section would read, `The extent to which the DIFF could be further refined to assist developing countries in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.' The reason I would like to put that in is that, specifically, the Bureau of Industry Economics has released a report today which says that Australia could make a massive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by assisting developing countries in the reduction of those greenhouse gas emissions because we have such good technology in this area. I think that is something else that the committee could, very profitably, have a look at, and I will be moving that.

         The comment by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) that the government is looking at a reformed mixed credit scheme is a good one. I hope that it looks at it in terms of trade rather than aid, and my

          —There have been some interesting points made in today's debate. I was very pleased to hear the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) saying that the emphasis by the government is, or will be, on humanitarian aid. I think that is very worthy, and I would like to think that that will be the case. We will certainly be making sure that the aid that is provided is going towards those causes. Basically, the Greens (WA) believe that we do ourselves no good in concentrating aid on assisting business in Australia. In the case of many of our aid programs—if we look, for instance, at Africa, which has not received a great deal of aid from Australia—unfortunately, the aid is in inverse proportion to the social, environmental and other needs of the countries involved.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Basically, the richer countries get more aid; the poorer  countries get left off. That has been a very unfortunate aspect. I would like to think that what Senator Hill has said today is an indication of a change in that—that we will actually be looking at the needs of countries rather than the necessary prospects of return from emerging middle classes in the countries to whom we provide aid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also true, as Senator Hill has indicated, that the Greens, as well as the Australian Democrats, have been very vocal in criticising the levels that have been used in the past in schemes like DIFF as aid and been part of the aid budget. It is also true that the non-government aid groups have been very critical, and they have pushed, as far as they could, for DIFF to be used in ways that are of greater benefit to the communities involved.

         In supporting the motion, we are not saying that DIFF is the best thing since sliced bread, but that elements of DIFF definitely need support and critical analysis. That is why we asked for, and got, the motion to indicate that we would look at the contribution by DIFF to Australia's aid objectives. That is important because it will also give the Australian aid community, the non&amp;hyphen;government aid community in particular, the opportunity to put their views to the committee on the contribution DIFF has made and can make to Australia's legitimate aid objectives.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In supporting the motion, we are not endorsing, necessarily, all DIFF has done. Rather, we are endorsing the necessity of this chamber to do what it should do, that is, to look at the government's expenditure program. It is a very welcome opportunity to look at Australia's aid objectives, particularly DIFF, to see whether we are meeting them. So it is a vehicle for having a very fruitful discussion, and it is pleasing to think that we will have that. From our point of view, it is not a means of simply making cheap political points. It is demeaning to think that we would support the motion simply for that reason.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Undoubtedly, we have put a lot on the record about the aid program. It is the right time for us to consider any changes to government expenditure programs. It is the legitimate role of the Senate to review government expenditure programs, any proposed cuts to expenditure programs and the impacts those will have. That is what people expect us to do and that is why we will support this motion today.

          —I rise as a member of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Much as Senator Cook attempted to dress up this motion as a genuine inquiry, the fact that it is being brought on in the last sitting week of this particular session with a reference to report back to the Senate on the first day of the budget sitting indicates that it simply would not be possible for a Senate committee to do justice to this inquiry, given the very wide&amp;hyphen;ranging terms of reference.

          Senator Cook would be well aware that other senators will be engaged during the coming parliamentary break in other major references which have been designed to delay and frustrate government legislation, and that those references to other committees of other legislation are on such major planks of government policy as Telstra and IR. All senators will be very fully occupied in looking at those references in other committees.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Look at just one clause, (d), of Senator Cook's motion, `the impact on Australia's international relations in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region'. That would require a detailed and extensive Senate inquiry. It simply would not be possible for this committee to deal with that part of the reference alone in the very limited time frame that he has recommended.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Not only that, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee has had several major inquiries over recent times. When the Senate resumes, it will have to deal with a major inquiry concerning the `appropriateness and effectiveness of the Australian government's provision of consular assistance to Australians abroad'. That alone will be a major inquiry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is also very possible that Senator Cook does not want the committee to proceed at the moment with this inquiry which, doubtless, could bring a great deal of discredit to the actions of his former government. Perhaps that is why he has moved that the committee conduct this other inquiry into the DIFF scheme. The China report, which I understand the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee tabled this week, has been delayed through other reports, and the air links report, which is also due for completion, has occupied the committee to a great extent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Considering the present workload, it would be difficult for the committee to handle a reference of such immensity. Very little notice was given of this reference, even though, as Senator Hill has already remarked, the knowledge of the government's action on the DIFF scheme has been well and truly flagged since before the election.

          Senator Cook's last line in his speech summed it up when he said he intends to
          <break page="2202" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           bring the minister to account. In other words, it is a `Get Alexander Downer' exercise rather than any genuine desire to look at the DIFF scheme as it has existed and the role that it should play in government.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Senator Cook thinks he can expand the four&amp;hyphen;minute answer, which I am sure he was given in a very satisfactory manner by Senator Short, to a full&amp;hyphen;scale inquiry. He wants to use that answer as part of the basis for his alleged inquiry because he was not satisfied with the answer given by Senator Short. So we move from the four&amp;hyphen;minute answer given by a minister in question time to a fully&amp;hyphen;fledged, full&amp;hyphen;scale inquiry into the DIFF scheme and only, probably, Senator Cook could do this.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would emphasise that the committee is in no state to undertake this inquiry at the moment. It is a political stunt by Senator Cook to camouflage any further inquiries into his own government's mismanagement. It is a political exercise aimed at a particular minister, rather than a genuine exploration of policy.

In any case, this is a matter that one would have to be blind and deaf not to know is notorious.

         If the government has some proposals, an inquiry of this nature is the obvious opportunity for the government to indicate the nature of those proposals. The fact that it has not indicated the nature of those proposals to this point but fobs off the protests on the basis that `We've got the matter under study' is not an answer which inspires any confidence that that study will produce a result which anyone will be mollified by. Therefore, I believe this inquiry will be of major public interest.

         May I say two other things. An amendment to the terms of reference has been moved by Senator Bourne. I have no difficulty in accepting those terms of reference. But, looking at them on close inspection—and bearing in mind as well the remarks made by Senator Margetts about the importance of foreign aid and her view, as she expressed it in this chamber a moment ago, about the non&amp;hyphen;government organisations' view of the DIFF scheme—I think it is probably possible for those matters to be explored within the existing terms of reference. At the end of the day that will be a matter for the committee but I think it could be possible, under these terms, for those matters to be teased out further if that is the desire of the committee and of senators in this place.

         I commend the motion and the proposed amendment to the Senate. I trust that the debate at least will have shifted government senators to the more reasonable view that, rather than resist the searchlight of a Senate committee of inquiry being imposed on this vexed area of public concern, the far better thing is to go along and conduct a full and frank inquiry as promptly and as quickly as we can so that all misconceptions and misunderstandings are removed, and hopefully a unanimous view can be taken about a valuable scheme such as this, how it is best run and the importance of retaining it. I commend the motion.

         —The Senate has before it the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996, which seeks to make a range of changes to ATSIC. According to the summary provided by the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), the most significant changes are a reduction in the size of regional councils, continuing the practice of the chairperson of ATSIC being appointed by the minister, improved accountability arrangements for regional councils and the provision to appoint an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC under certain circumstances.

        The Greens (WA) objected to this bill being exempted from the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion because of the sweeping nature of the changes being proposed, changes which have certainly not been discussed in the community. We were told at the time that the bill is urgent because failure to deal with it now would create timetable problems for the forthcoming ATSIC elections. We reject that argument because the ATSIC elections will be substantially affected by the passage of some of the measures in this bill. Those changes should not be inflicted on the community just months before a triennial election round. They should be put off until after those elections.

        The measures in this bill should be thoroughly discussed throughout the country. It is all very well for the minister to say that the changes have the support of the ATSIC board. But the ATSIC board does not necessarily encompass the totality of views of the indigenous community. The rest of the indigenous community has barely heard about these changes. In fact, the committee hearing of which I was a participatory member last Friday vividly illustrated that there is not

        In fact, it became clearly apparent in the proceedings of that committee hearing that these policy changes had been made in the form of cabinet decisions which were then imposed. This is my interpretation entirely, I might add, and no doubt the minister would disagree with me. To my mind they seem to have been imposed by the cabinet on the minister and the minister was left in the very difficult position of having to justify those policy changes before he had even become totally familiar with his own portfolio.

        It is highly questionable to go ahead with that state of play in relation to policy changes, irrespective of what portfolio you are in. With Aboriginal and Islander issues, it is even more important. We have continually marginalised and disenfranchised the indigenous people of this country by making laws that do not take their views into consideration. We do not have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in this place. Therefore, we have no excuse for not having the most wide&amp;hyphen;ranging consultation before policy changes of such magnitude are contemplated by this parliament.

        Many honourable senators are very familiar with the time needed to consult effectively with remote indigenous communities and the diversity of indigenous communities throughout this country.

        I will now deal with our objections to some of the measures in this bill. The first is the continuation of the minister's role in choosing the chairperson of ATSIC. This was to have been a power which lapsed with the 1993 elections. It was continued then, as honourable senators would know, largely because of representations made to Senator Kernot. The Greens (WA) opposed the extension then and we most certainly oppose this further extension. We will be supporting an appropriate amendment to be put by the opposition.

I wonder whether the Liberal Party would put up with an outside group choosing its party president, or would the party accept the idea that the Governor-General should choose its parliamentary leader? This measure should be opposed by every honourable senator who upholds the policy of self-determination in whatever form that person might choose to define such a concept.

        The changes to schedules relating to numbers of regional councillors may well be worthwhile, but we have no way of knowing whether that is the case.

        I must object to some of the usage that is being made of statistical tables which show how many people will be represented by the regional councils. There is a failure to take into consideration the geographical factors involved. For example, there might be what looks like a very favourable ratio of councillors to members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in certain areas, such as in the remote areas of Western Australia. However, they are largely mythological in their benefit because of the enormous amount of ground that has to be covered for those people to get together. In some cases, it is utterly impossible. As far as we are concerned, we cannot support those kinds of statistics and arguments.

        Proposed changes subsumed in the general rhetoric of accountability have also been coming from the government. In another context, we have seen the confusion, not to say chaos, which the government has managed to bring about in the indigenous community by its accountability measures. I have repeatedly said that bureaucratic accountability is not the problem; it is about accountability in the communities to the people in terms of service delivery. Adding layer upon layer of bureaucratic accountability measures does

I refer here to the $700,000 that it is going to cost to have a super auditor put in place. It is not under the measures in this bill, but it has been made at the same time as the policy changes in this bill were mooted.

We have to be very sure when we bandy that phrase about that we are not actually being quite offensive in what we are saying. We are implying that some citizens in this country have rights while others have privileges. I believe that we all have responsibilities in this regard.

This smacks of the most blatant paternalism imaginable. Where else would we find such a power? Would the government think of providing such a power to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in relation to the Health Insurance Commission? I think not.

        The minister told us five things. He said there is a perception of this in the community. I think he is right.

When pressed, the minister said that they quantified this mounting community concern by the media reports at the time in taking account of the way in which they attributed the success of some candidates to this perception. The last example he cited was that there are many complaints from Aboriginal communities on his desk. Those regarded as significant have been passed on to the Office of Evaluation and Audit for investigation. I think the pertinent fact is that those investigations have not yet concluded.

The policy also included a commitment not to seek to redesign the system yet again, because the coalition had identified that as one of the repeated failings of indigenous affairs policy in Australia.

The commission has within its own structure an Office of Evaluation and Audit. The director is appointed by the minister and that person reports directly to the minister and the board.

She uses the example of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which, at $1.2 billion last year, costs taxpayers more than ATSIC. She draws attention to the fact that there was a damning Australian National Audit Office report on the administration of this scheme. It suggests that the rorting of this scheme amounts to at least $32 million, and possibly much more, a year. Is that a haemorrhaging of public funds? Where is the outrage? Where are all the people out there saying, `This is a disgraceful lack of accountability.'?

        Senator Herron refers to perception. I think the costs of the last four months have been to confirm many prejudiced, stereotypical views about indigenous people—at the worst, that most blacks are crooks; using a slightly better construction—only very slightly better because it is quite paternalistic—that ATSIC has not been in existence for enough time for it to have had the experience in administration.

        Added to that, there is that ongoing ignorant perception that you cannot trust indigenous people with public moneys of any kind. It is a 1996 version of the mission manager. I think the last four months have done a great deal of damage to the process of reconciliation that most of us here think is important. It does not exist in a vacuum. It does not exist in isolation from the other decisions we are making in this place and the discussions we are having.

        Having made those general comments in the context of this bill, there are more than 40 technical and smaller amendments that we can support to facilitate the election process in October. But the Democrats will not be supporting the three key amendments—on the appointment of the chair of ATSIC, on the reduction in the number of regional councillors and on the reserve power to appoint an administrator—not just because they go to the heart of self-determination, but because, I believe, the government has failed to make a strong case, either in public when these were announced or, more particularly, at the Senate committee hearing on Friday, where not one witness—except the minister—spoke positively about any of the amendments.

        I think that there is room for a review in the matter of a reduction in the number of regional counsellors.

         Let me conclude by again referring to the article I mentioned, because I think it was an excellent article. I think it brought together some important threads about things which needed to be said on behalf of indigenous people.

There is mounting community concern over accountability.' I could never accept that as a quantified rationale for why we should move to undo some of the things that we have done in the name of self-determination of indigenous people in this parliament.

         —This bill is just one of numerous amendments that have been made to ATSIC since its inception in 1989. Some of the amendments contained in the bill are reflections on proposals put forward by the previous government, recommendations from the panel of review—which followed ATSIC elections during the last parliament—community feedback and the policies of the present government as expressed in the lead-up to the federal election this year. ATSIC, as we know, virtually replaced the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and is perhaps the chief administrator of indigenous affairs in this country—although state governments also play a significant role in that as do other Commonwealth agencies.

         This bill basically seeks to make changes in five main areas. The first change provides for the appointment of two commissioners and the selection of the chairman of ATSIC by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The second provides for the reduction in the size of ATSIC regional councils. The third provides for improved accountability arrangements for regional councils—which includes access to docu ments, openness of meetings and the disclosure of pecuniary interests of regional councillors. The fourth provides for the appointment of an administrator to manage the operation of ATSIC in certain circumstances.

        Finally, there is a miscellaneous group of amendments which touch on such things as the eligibility to stand at regional council elections; technical amendments relating to electoral boundaries; the removal of regional councillors convicted of offences; the election of the deputy chairperson of the commission and, when required, an alternative deputy regional chairman; the appointment of acting commissioners; and a requirement that regional councillors who accept consultancies with the commission will have to stand down. That section extends to corporations which are controlled by regional councillors.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand that a good many of these amendments are non-contentious, and so they should be. On the face of it, these amendments go a long way towards improving the performance of ATSIC and improving the efficacy and accountability of the delivery of services to indigenous Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The more contentious parts of the bill have perhaps been the amendments which deal with the appointment of the chairman of ATSIC. In this regard, the bill returns to the 1993 position where the chairman was appointed, before the Keating government saw fit to amend that so the chairman was elected. At the time, we opposed that move by the Keating government, and we are showing consistency with that approach now that we are in government. ATSIC has a large budget—just under a billion dollars—and there is a very good reason for the government to have the ability to select the chairman of the commission. Some form of accountability is provided through that move.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The second amendment deals with the reduction in the size of regional councils. ATSIC, when it was first set up, had some 60 regional councils. That number was reduced in the life of the former parliament to 36 in an endeavour to improve the operation of ATSIC. This amendment, I believe, operates on the same theme. The number of councillors on the regional councils would be re duced, which not only saves on administrative costs but also enhances the level of performance of those councils. Someone approaching this matter for the first time would think this is a step towards limiting democracy but, when one looks at the fact that a council with no more than 1,000 people is represented by some eight councillors, one can see that the ratio of representation is very good indeed.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third amendment also provides for the improved accountability of regional councils, which I mentioned earlier. This relates to opening up meetings of regional councils to the public generally—and particularly to indigenous Australians—and providing access to documentation. This, I believe, speaks for itself.

        The appointment of an administrator to ATSIC has been criticised by the opposition and by minor parties. I would put to them that you do need a fail-safe mechanism. ATSIC enjoys a position where it has a large degree of autonomy—autonomy in dealing with a budget, as I said earlier, which is just under a billion dollars per annum.

        We have seen today the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) tabling reports dealing with the Aboriginal legal services. Those reports show some areas of gross negligence and misconduct in the delivery of services to indigenous Australia. This is something which should cut across the board of government expenditure generally. We have a duty to the taxpayer and to the community to make sure that Commonwealth services are delivered in an efficient and economic manner.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The fourth amendment would allow, in extreme circumstances, an administrator to be appointed to deal with ATSIC when there is gross misconduct or fraud. That does not mean to say that commissioners would be stood aside or sacked. I know Senator Bob Collins raised that during the committee hearing—he said that power was open to the minister. That, I would submit, is a draconian power which would not be as effective as the appointment of an administrator.

        The government made a decision early in its term to improve accountability in this area, and that is what it is doing. It is carrying out its election promises and its policy which it put to the people of Australia in February and March this year. It is a policy upon which this government was elected. Any fraud or misconduct in this area can be visited upon only indigenous Australia. Any loss of funding by way of maladministration can harm only indigenous Australia. Not only is it an abuse of taxpayers' money, but it is more importantly a detriment to the delivery of services to indigenous people, be they in the cities or in the more remote areas.

        I commend these amendments to the Senate and to the people of Australia at large.

The attack on the minister has been entirely unfair. I compliment Senator Herron in the way that he has approached this with such urgency. It is now June, the government was elected in early March and we have already before the Senate legislation dealing with these matters. For that aspect and for the urgency and diligence the minister has applied to the matter he is to be commended.

        I have read the dissenting report of the committee which looked at these matters. I can find no convincing argument in the dissenting report as to why these amendments are inappropriate.

         As I have already said, I would prefer the appointment of an administrator to the willy&amp;hyphen;nilly sacking of commissioners or their sus pension. I believe one commissioner has been suspended already. The appointment of an administrator would provide a system where the commission can still be kept in operation whilst a review is conducted. But, as the minister has said, that would take place in only the most exceptional circumstances—where there was gross misconduct or widespread fraud.

Any organisation is properly subject to scrutiny, and it is really a matter of whether the scrutiny eventuates in proper reform, reform that is not really reform at all or a bit of both.

        ATSIC was the brainchild, in the full sense of the word, of Mr Gerry Hand when he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The idea behind it was that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as the original inhabitants of this land, would have a much more democratic say than they had before—democratic in the sense that they as the original community, the original inhabitants, of this land and the islands about it had a special attachment to it that people of other races did not.

        It seems to me that, if you are going to have a democratic system—it was certainly Minister Hand's objective to have a democratic system, a system that reflected the views of the people that this commission was meant to represent—surely the person at the top should be elected, if not directly then in a secondary way, by the people whom he or she is going to represent—in the same way as the Prime Minister is elected.

        We had a situation where Aboriginal people did not get the unemployment benefit, where they were not counted in the census, where they were not given a vote. All of those things are now behind us. Nobody, regardless of what party they may belong to or whether they are independent people in the political community, would want to go back to any of those things.

        I want to concentrate on the question of the election or appointment of the chairperson. I do not believe that the Aboriginal people should have any less stringent test put on their accountability in terms of auditing and inspecting the way they do business. I believe they should have people in their midst trained to the highest possible level to ensure accountability to the community and to provide a good service to their own people. I recognise that originally the legislation introduced by the Labor government was to appoint the chairperson, but we have moved on from that.

        I certainly have had experience in talking with people and I have been at meetings with people from ATSIC who have expressed views and whom I think are highly competent. We now have Aboriginal people who have gone through university and who are displaying a capacity for negotiating on behalf of their people. I mention, for instance, Noel Pearson, who was one of the people who moved in Queensland, up in the Gulf on Cape York, to get an agreement between the cattle people who leased that land for cattle raising, the Aboriginal people and the conservationists. It did not require any arbitrated decision. They came to conclusions themselves where they could all accommodate what they thought was important. Noel Pearson is an

        Some people might talk about the lack of capacity of people in the Aboriginal community to understand the needs of Aboriginal people, to understand how the administration of ATSIC should be carried out so that they get the best benefit. Some people might say that they might not know how to make an assessment and vote for the best and most suitable person for chairman or chairwoman. However, if we look at our own process and progress in these matters I do not think anyone would have suggested, say, 80 or 90 years ago that everyone who voted in the general community in this country really understood the issues, economic and social. But more and more people are able to understand those things and vote in a careful and understanding way.

        The bill we are debating is essentially about making ATSIC work better. You may say that it is paternalistic but it is done with the best intent.

The bottom line is improvement in services to the communities themselves.

        The proposals have arisen for a number of reasons. Most amendments in the bill were proposed by the previous government and many result from the section 141 review of electoral systems which attracted considerable consultation through hearings in 20 locations around the country. That was an independent review of the regional council zone and Torres Straight Regional Authority electoral systems. It tabled its report in both houses of parliament in May last year, in fact in the Senate chamber on 30 May 1995.

It is a matter of judgment as to how far the consultation could extend.

        ATSIC's operational experience since the last major review of the act has highlighted the need for refinement of its operations. The policies that the government foreshadowed during the election and the decisions that the government has made since then will improve accountability and service delivery by organisations funded by ATSIC in light of concerns from both the indigenous and wider communities. I illustrated that earlier today by tabling the audit reports on legal services. They are but one example of the community concern which has now been proven to be valid. It is no good saying that there was no community concern prior to the last election. The audit reports which I tabled reveal, in stark contrast, what has occurred.

        These amendments relate to the concern which is certainly shared on the whole of this side of the chamber about the appointment of the administrator. If I could refer to Senator Herron's comment first, he said, in respect of these particular provisions for the appointment of an administrator—I think I am quoting him correctly—`You can say that it is paternalistic, but it is done with the best intent.' As a student of history—and indeed, I am—I accept that statement from you, Minister. The sad history over the years is that, in respect of so many measures, which I guess make us all cringe now, in hindsight, we see the enormous damage that was caused to Aboriginal people, damage that is still being realised.

        You do not have to go too far past the personal tragedies of people like Rob Riley and others—so many like Rob Riley—who were scarred permanently by the experience of being forcibly removed from their parents. I am sure Senator Herron would know that in my own circle of close friends and acquaintances I number many men and women, a lot of them now in their 50s and 60s, who quite openly acknowledge the bitterness and the scars that that experience caused them. It often happened that a police officer would simply turn up out of the blue one day and
        <break page="2218" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         remove the child from its parents, usually from a highly distressed mother, and that is something that they will take with them to their grave. Of course, it was all done with the best of intent. It was all done in the pursuit of assimilation.

        While we are talking about assimilation, the other day when Senator Herron was being asked a question, I think a quite reasonable question, about whether any inferences could or should be drawn from his launching of a recent book which advocated such a move, he said that he was happy to launch any book that promoted public debate and that the book simply contrasted the views of Hasluck with the views of Coombs. I have actually had the opportunity now to scan the whole book and thoroughly read half of it. I would be very keen to do a review of it myself. I am sure a number of people will.

        I have picked up at least three errors where the author has in fact grievously misquoted people in support of his arguments. But, with respect to Senator Herron, I want to point out that the book simply does not do that at all. The book is an unblushing advocate for a return to such a policy. It does not simply contrast—interestingly, I might say, as I think the book is interesting—Coombs and Hasluck. In my view, in a very strong and fundamentally flawed way on some occasions, it uses the most trite material to support its case. The most trite anecdotal comments allegedly made by various people are used to strongly advocate a return to that position.

        If Senator Herron would like to know whether I would launch such a book, as much as I am an advocate of such debate, I would have said, `Certainly, but only on the basis that I will bucket the absolute daylights out of it at the launch, which I don't think would suit your purposes at all.' So, in terms of concerns about paternalism and so many of these policies with good intent, all of which were directed to those assimilationist policies, I actually think that those fears are well founded.

        Regarding Senator Ellison's comments that this bill is also due to the policy of the government as enunciated during the campaign, let me remind Senator Ellison and the minister what that policy was that was enunciated. As honourable senators here might know, I was familiar with it because I campaigned largely, domestically, in the Northern Territory in the bush, in Aboriginal electorates. I came across my opposite numbers out there, I might add, and—and I will say to Senator Herron that I have done this for 20 years—when I come across my opposite numbers on election campaigns they are treated by me with the greatest civility, respect and courtesy. I am getting too old: I cannot be bothered with the non&amp;hyphen;stop abuse that some people engage in, despite Senator Herron's assertions that I am an appallingly abusive person and a big bully and all the rest of it.

        It is important to make this point. In the past there have been lots of fears in Aboriginal communities about the attitudes of conservative governments towards their interests, both here and in the Northern Territory. I can tell you, Minister, that your representatives in the Northern Territory gave nothing but reassurance to Aboriginal people about ATSIC. It was specifically mentioned on a number of occasions—ATSIC, land rights and the whole lot. The general tenor of it all was, `We will support all of the programs that are
        <break page="2219" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         now in place; none of them are in any danger. We will not be eroding any of the Aboriginal structures. If the Labor Party suggests we will do that, that is all nonsense. In fact'—as one candidate said—`that is lies; the Labor Party is lying to you. Here is our policy; it is in print.'

        So government senators should not come in here advocating support for this legislation on the basis of their track record for absolutely breaching commitments they gave to the Aboriginal electorate in Australia during the election campaign. Let me tell you, Senator Herron—and I say this with some regret—I know a number of Aboriginal people who actually believed those promises. Aboriginal people that I have known for over 20 years were saying in my electorate, `Bob, this mob are not saying the hard things that they used to say. They say they will help us. They say they will support land rights. They say they will not touch ATSIC and they will not do these things. So maybe we can trust them this time.'

         Those people were deceived. Those promises were broken—and the evidence of that is going through this parliament right now. So do not come in here and ask senators to support this legislation on the basis that these propositions were put to the Australian electorate during the election campaign, as Senator Ellison said. In fact, precisely the opposite view was put. The commitments that were given in the process of this very first section of the bill are now being broken, or at least an attempt is being made here to break them. Hopefully, honourable senators here will ensure that, on this occasion and with this particular measure, those promises will not be broken.

         —Thank you—and I will talk about the issue of whether the commission needs an administrator or not. I note in the explanatory memorandum that the reserve power to appoint a commission administrator would be if the minister is satisfied that the administration by the commission of the commission's funding involved fraud or gross mismanagement; the commission intentionally failed to comply with a general direction; and the commission failed to take reasonable steps to prevent a contravention of direction in force under section 12 of the act. When we were asking whether this was necessary, in his evidence, Senator Herron said:

         stances where there is a pressing need to fix a serious problem. In this way the government would have the capacity to act quickly against fraud, gross mismanagement or failure to comply with my directions under the act.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an assumption there that the whole board of commissioners is either so totally incompetent that we would find fraud or gross mismanagement; that they are corrupt and we would see fraud and gross mismanagement; or that they have conspired to deliberately defy a general direction from the minister, or other matters. I personally cannot see that happening. I cannot see the entire board of ATSIC being incompetent and/or corrupt and I cannot see them wilfully defying directions from a minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is another remedy to some of your concerns. That remedy was identified by the chair of ATSIC in her evidence when she pointed out that she does not know of one instance where ATSIC has not acted against an organisation which has breached its conditions. That includes 2,000 organisations and 6,000 grants to organisations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In that committee hearing and elsewhere, we found that it has been other authorities who have not seen fit to take the matter any further. The chair spoke about the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities Commission and many others. We know that in many instances these organisations have said, `This isn't a high priority for us' or, `Sorry, we don't have the resources to pursue it.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So I would suggest that the remedy is for this government to ask these agencies, authorities and statutory bodies, `Why aren't you willing to take these complaints to the end of the investigation and make recommendations?' Because ATSIC is left with the public perception that they are not interested in accountability or doing anything about their own internal processes. Rather than appoint an administrator, Minister, this government should be more serious about assisting ATSIC in pursuing the processes that are already in place.

When Mr Keating sold out of the piggery at a huge profit, with a repurchase option in the memorandum of understanding to the sale, the media ignored further evidence of impropriety on the basis of saying, `Well, now he is out of it'.

         role of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in financing this mess has still not been properly revealed. Today I gave notice of a motion relating to this problem, which the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) raised last year in the House of Representatives, when unfortunately the press gallery was, as usual, not very interested.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The comments by the honourable member for Mackellar relate to the way that the Commonwealth Bank successfully sought to hide the special relationship that existed between the Commonwealth Bank in lending to this piggery group and Mr Keating, who bought into the group while Treasurer and was the Prime Minister when the joint venture deal with the Danish international company Danpork was put into effect. The honourable member for Mackellar said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . if there had not been a class order granted back in 1993, there would have been a requirement on the bank to report on the relationship between Mr Keating and the Commonwealth Bank and the nature of the loans he had from that bank. I am further concerned about this matter because, on the last day before the last election in 1993, a document dated 6 August 1992 in the name of D.N. Maynard of the Commonwealth Bank, purporting to be a report to the credit committee of the board, was the subject of a legal action by the Commonwealth Bank to prevent this document being published by Channel 10. It was an interim injunction that was sought and was gained.

        The honourable member went on to say:

        Class orders had been obtained which effectively exempted directors and auditors from reporting on related party disclosures.

        In 1993, under the guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities, which were issued by the Minister for Finance, it was said with regard to Accounting Standard AAS22 on related party transactions that `subject to Ministers not being taken to be related parties in relation to matters falling within their statutory responsibilities, they were to be exempted'. But in all other respects, ministers of the executive government were to be related parties for all public authorities and Commonwealth commercial entities. That is quite clearly meant to cover the Commonwealth Bank.

The worrying thing was that the conclusion of the letter says this: `It is therefore submitted that there is an overwhelming case for the ASC to extend the scope of the Class Order in the terms sought. If you wish any further information or explanation in support of the application please call'—

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         My specific concern relates to the effect that the class order had in preventing information as to Mr Keating's dealings with the Commonwealth Bank, bearing in mind the relationship between the government and the Commonwealth Bank, and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Commonwealth Bank, and the need to have transparency.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The clear fact is that the guidelines of the Minister for Finance require ministers to be accountable when they act in other than their capacity as a minister. The honourable member for Mackellar said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I do not believe that Mr Keating's investment in the piggery group of companies had anything to do with his ministerial responsibilities.

         That is self-evident.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The big question is this: if there was nothing improper to hide, why has the Commonwealth Bank gone to such extremes to prevent the normal release of information normally required by law? It took out an injunction—it clearly indicates the accuracy of the document—to prevent the publication of the report to the credit committee of the Commonwealth Bank revealing the provision for bad debt of $4.5 million against the Keating piggery group. That loan was made when Mr Keating was the Treasurer and when Mr Keating's partner in this matter was an owner, along with Mr Keating's former colleague Mr John Brown.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that Mr Keating subsequently received a substantial benefit while Prime Minister as a result of the Commonwealth Bank's extraordinary financial support of his half&amp;hyphen;owned piggery. It is a matter of concern that the report the Commonwealth Bank prevented from being shown on television notes that the loan given was because of the failure to investigate adequately the financial position of the operation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is about time that this cover&amp;hyphen;up of an incredible loan involving enormous losses at a time when Mr Keating made a very substantial profit on the sale of this very expensive piggery, at least as far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, was revealed. It is about time that the cover&amp;hyphen;ups were brought to an end. It is about time that the gallery, for

        Today, I would like to make some further remarks in respect of a matter of the utmost public interest to the people of Sydney, particularly those in the Hughes electorate and the surrounding areas near Holsworthy. On Sunday, 2 June, a public meeting was held at Wattle Grove, a delightful new housing development in Holsworthy, the site of the impending second airport for Sydney if the coalition government has its way. Some 4,000 people attended that public rally, held on a wet day, to express their anger at the deception perpetrated by the coalition government with respect to this issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At Wattle Grove there is a sign at the entrance to the area with a picture of John Newcombe, the former great Australian tennis player, with a caption that reads: `I'd like to live here'. We know that John Howard, the Prime Minister—the then Leader of the Opposition, prior to the election—and John Sharp, now the Minister for Transport, certainly were not saying to the people of Wattle Grove and Holsworthy that they would not like to live there, but they are saying it now. It is a pity that they did not come clean before the election on 2 March and tell the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         people of Holsworthy, Wattle Grove, Moorebank, Chipping Norton, all those other suburbs in the electorate of Hughes and the state electorates in this area, of the plans that they had to put Holsworthy firmly back on the agenda as a potential site for Sydney's second airport.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As we know, the issue of aircraft noise and the location of Sydney's second airport was a most important issue in the last election in a number of electorates in Sydney. It is an issue that many of us have spoken about before in this parliament, and no doubt we will do so in the future. It is an issue that, particularly in more recent years, has been at the forefront of public debate. In that context, one has to ask why the coalition kept secret from the people of Sydney, particularly the people of the electorate of Hughes, their proposal to relist Holsworthy as a site for a potential second Sydney airport, notwithstanding that it had been rejected firmly back in 1985, at the time of the environmental impact assessment and examination of Sydney's second airport's needs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Before the election, John Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition, was clearly on the record with respect to issues of aircraft noise and Sydney's second airport. He was campaigning strongly for the reopening of the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. He was saying to everybody that Badgerys Creek was their proposed site for Sydney's second airport. At no stage was there ever any mention by John Howard, or indeed any other spokesperson from the opposition, that Holsworthy would even be considered.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Acting Deputy President, having been a member of the Senate select committee at the time, you will recall that, when a proposal with respect to Holsworthy came to the committee from an action group on the North Shore, it was firmly rejected by the committee in its majority report. That committee was chaired by Senator Parer, the then shadow spokesperson on transport, also a person who had campaigned and spoken publicly time and time again about this issue but who at no stage ever divulged to the committee or the public the plans for putting Holsworthy back
        <break page="2225" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         on the agenda with respect, as I said, to a possible second Sydney airport.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is that we now know that, whilst the Senate committee was inquiring into this issue and taking evidence from hundreds of people and organisations from around Sydney and receiving in excess of 4,000 or 5,000 submissions, Senator Parer was sitting there, knowing that they had been approached in the previous year about a proposed development for an airport at Holsworthy. That has been confirmed by the transport minister, Mr Sharp, who, on 28 May in answer to a question in the House by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, acknowledged that they had received a proposal for a development which effectively involved a swap for land at Badgerys Creek acquired by the government. In return, they would be involved in the development of an airport at Holsworthy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Sharp acknowledged in the House on that day in answer to this question that they had been asked to keep it secret, and so they had kept it secret. But we know that John Howard knew about this proposal—given to them well before the Senate committee's inquiry and before John Howard himself gave evidence to the committee that they supported an airport at Badgerys Creek, that that was their policy and that their policy was also to reopen the east&amp;hyphen;west runway.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, we all know that reopening the east&amp;hyphen;west runway was part of the coalition's proposal to try and alleviate the problems for John Howard's own electors in the seat of Bennelong. He was certainly looking after the interests of his electors but, when it came to the electors of Hughes, he was silent—even though he knew that the proposal had been brought to him, as the then Leader of the Opposition, and to his shadow spokesperson on transport, Senator Parer. They kept it a secret.

         It is all coming out now that there was in fact a deal between the opposition at the time—now the government—and the proposal developers, to keep the proposal quiet. It disturbs me that the people of Hughes and surrounding areas have been deliberately misled and deceived. They have continued to be deceived by subsequent attempts by mem bers of the government to transfer the blame. Danna Vale, the now member for Hughes, attended the rally on 2 June. She indicated that she did not know anything about the proposal at the time and said that she was opposed to the airport, but she then got up at the public meeting and tried to lay the blame at the feet of the former member for Hughes, Robert Tickner. She stood up at that public meeting and quoted from a speech that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Childs, had given in the Senate on 30 May. You had said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I must comment on the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, who is a Liberal member of parliament. She says that, when she was a candidate, she did not know about the possible Holsworthy airport site. Robert Tickner certainly did. He spoke out.

You were referring to the fact that, at the time that the Senate committee received this submission about Holsworthy from the North Shore action group on 14 September, there was an immediate response by the member for Hughes, Robert Tickner, objecting to this proposal. He put out a press release dated 19 September 1995 and I seek leave to table this if I may.

        That was the context in which that press release was issued. It was an immediate response to a proposal brought before the Senate committee at the time. And I remind the Senate that the committee was being chaired by Senator Parer who knew about this other proposal for Holsworthy that is now on the table, but who did not tell the committee about it.

       <break page="2226" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         But Danna Vale, the member for Hughes, stood up at that public meeting and said—and I paraphrase—`Don't blame me because I didn't know anything about it, but Robert Tickner knew about it.' It was a deliberate attempt to distort the facts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But it gets worse. At that public meeting on 2 June at Wattle Grove, there were a number of members of parliament. I was there; Danna Vale was there, as the member for Hughes; Mark Latham was there, as the member for Werriwa; the now member, but then candidate, for Blaxland, Michael Hatton, was there; and a number of state members of parliament, including Craig Knowles, the member for Moorebank, and Ian McManus, the member for Bulli. There were no state Liberal members of parliament at that rally that I can recall, and certainly none were there that spoke.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is relevant because on 4 June in the New South Wales state parliament, the member for Bulli, Mr Ian McManus, moved an urgency motion to condemn the proposal to build an airport at Holsworthy. That has since, of course, been put back on the agenda by the minister for transport (Mr Sharp) who has authorised an EIS.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In that debate, Mr Chris Downy, who was Danna Vale's campaign director in the last election, made a speech. On 4 June, in his speech to the state parliament of New South Wales, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         These are the words I want to emphasise:

         That contrasts starkly with the approach of the former Federal member for Hughes. Last week Senator Childs actually indicated—

        <para>
         There was then an objection by Mr Phillips who is the member for Miranda and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. His is another state seat which certainly has electors who would be affected by an airport here. He interjected and said:

         He is a Labor Senator, isn't he?

          That is right, a Labor Senator, a factional colleague of the former member for Hughes—that Robert Tickner certainly did know about Holsworthy and the proposal to put an airport there.

          Again, we have, in the state parliament of New South Wales, Chris Downey the state member for Sutherland, who was Danna Vale's campaign director in the last election, picking up this spurious, deceitful, disgraceful allegation that Robert Tickner knew about this proposal for an airport at Holsworthy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I have clearly demonstrated, what the then member for Hughes was doing was responding as soon as he knew, and as soon as the Senate knew through the committee process we were undertaking, of another proposal for an airport; he was responding that he was opposed to it. But what do we have now? We have this disgraceful attempt at that public rally by a member of this parliament, the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), and by one of her close colleagues, Chris Downey, the state member for Sutherland, to try and shift the blame to the very member of parliament who was out there representing the electors and opposing any proposal of Holsworthy for an airport. Frankly, I could think of nothing worse than an attempt by members of parliament to deceive and mislead the electors of this area on such a major and important issue, as has been perpetrated by these people.

         —This will not be the last time that I speak in this chamber, but it is my final speech in the sense that we have a first speech at the beginning of a Senate term. This Senate has a proud recent history as an effective house of review. It has been a privilege for me to contribute to the development of a more democratic system of government, firstly as senior adviser to former leaders of the Australian Democrats, Senators Don Chipp and Janine Haines, and now—for six years—as a Democrat senator for Victoria.

        The traditional view of the main function of a member of parliament is that of a legislator. Certainly, this task has been embraced by the Democrats as the major responsibility, in particular since 1981 when we obtained
        <break page="2227" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         balance of power in the Senate. Unless the government has had the support of the major opposition party, the Democrats have usually determined the fate of legislation. This means that every clause of every bill has to be assessed on its merits, as defined by the policies and principles on which Democrat supporters cast their votes. This role has been acknowledged by the Australian community; and finally, in the recent somewhat silly debate on mandates, most people now accept that it is a nonsense that the government of the day should have absolute power to enact anything and everything as long as it was part of its election platform.

        Being a legislator is not enough. The Senate offers other opportunities to press for positive social change, and in ways not dictated by the government's legislative program which lands on our desk with total disregard of one's own agenda. I owned up to my agenda in my first speech—to push us closer to a society which is socially and economically just for all its members, regardless of colour, creed, gender, sexuality, disability or wealth; a society which is ecologically sustainable and which is accepting of our responsibility to reduce inequality globally.
       </para>

        This is based on the strong belief not only that inequality in people's life opportunities is morally wrong, but also that such inequality, injustice and intolerance ultimately leads to conflict, oppression and violence. This was reinforced by my childhood experiences in war&amp;hyphen;torn Europe and the enormity of the Holocaust. I determined that I wanted to do all I could to ensure that such events did not occur again and that we would leave a safer and better world to our children and to their children. I am very glad that my wife, Julia, and our children, Rebecca, Linden, Christopher and Karen, and Karen's husband, Gary, are here today.

        The main barriers a person of ethnic background has to overcome have been identified as lack of English, incomplete education, lack of money and little information on electoral and constitutional matters.

It is fortunate that John Beever and Fergus McPherson are able to be here today, providing the link with the Australia Party, with Fergus managing the 1972 campaign from Gordon Barton's office and John Beever in Victoria accompanying me on that first visit, in 1972, to the then Minister for

The left&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;centre reform movement also failed to look beyond a leader with Liberal Party antecedents, and valuable years were lost while the ALP proved itself unable to manage the vision of a Whitlam and extinguished Chifley's light on the hill, yet managed to hang on to most of the true believers against what should have been their better, more strategic judgment.

The work I shared with Senator Kernot on the Mabo legislation was the high point of my legislative work. I also appreciate the fact that she was prepared, as I was, to advocate tough action on Bosnia at a time when this would have averted some of the worst tragedies which have eventuated since. When I advanced the concept of my sexuality anti&amp;hyphen;discrimination bill she endorsed it and became one of its strongest supporters. Surely, these are the actions of someone prepared to put herself and her party at the cutting edge of reform. Yet, recently an academic, who should have known better, suggested that the Democrats lacked a rigorous analysis of what needed to the done to achieve a sustainable post&amp;hyphen;industrial society, thus displaying his ignorance of the party's alternative budget proposals released in various forms since 1990.

        Earlier I said that being a legislator is not enough. Perhaps the most important avenue to explore new directions is offered by the Senate committees and their staff. From an early foray through the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs, which resulted in a tougher antimonopoly test for mergers and acquisitions, to the first independent inquiry by an individual senator on industry development and tariffs, to the prolonged cost of justice inquiry, to outworkers, to treaties, to what may yet turn out to be a highly significant report on indicators and benchmarks for national wellbeing, not to forget the unfinished business of the casino and sexuality enquiries which are bequeathed, amongst others, to Senator Cooney for his diligent attention, I count this avenue as a critically important part of my work in this place.

We need to hold our own in the global market place but the Howard Government is cutting industry and export boosting programs. We need to become the intelligent and innovative society but cuts are mooted to education and research. We need to fashion a just and sustainable society but the ombudsman's budget is reduced by a third. We need to conserve our natural environment for future generations but more forests will be woodchipped and the pollution of air and water allowed to proceed.

        I rise in the MPI debate because there is a pressing problem, a proposal by the government to start a youth homelessness pilot program. To be more specific, the government has proposed a task force which will report by the end of this month, and the government hopes to have the pilot program in operation by August. For that reason, I bring to the attention of the Senate some concerns which I have with this program, and I will provide copies of what I am about to say to the task force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government, when in opposition, was concerned about the problem of youth homelessness and it sought to come into power and treat the problem—which it had identified in common with the Labor government—in a different way and from a different perspective. I am taking a generous view of the government's motivation in all of this. It is true that both political parties want to see
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         young people growing up in happy and well&amp;hyphen;adjusted families. I would not want to indicate anything different from that point of view. I do think, however, that the means by which the government is seeking to bring about a different point of view has potential threats within it which, firstly, are going to damage their program and, secondly, are going to be so much worse for young people. I recognise that the coalition's election policy document said:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Coalition recognises that there are circumstances in which young people have every reason to leave home. Equally, there are legitimate concerns expressed by some parents and community organisations that the existing system places too little emphasis on family reconciliation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fair to say that the government was responding to fears expressed by some people in the community that the availability of the homeless youth allowance—which was made available by the previous government—was in some way providing a means by which young people could leave home, and that this was in some way not particularly justified by their circumstances. Although they are very circumspect in most of the statements that they make, you can see that fairly clearly. In March this year, the Prime Minister made a statement in a doorstop interview in which he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the one hand there are obvious cases where family life has completely ceased to exist and young people are deserving and in need of support because they are genuinely homeless.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is fair enough—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        And yet other groups in the community representing parents who felt that the system has worked against them have argued that there is not a sufficiently effective surveillance made under present arrangements of the entitlement of young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the first point with which I want to take issue. Prior to coming into parliament, I worked as a voluntary street contact worker with the Wayside Chapel in Kings Cross, dealing with homeless youth—or, as they are more commonly called, `street kids'. I have to say that my experience there, and that of everybody else that I had dealings with, was very different from that which is implied in the Prime Minister's statement and which has
        <break page="2230" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         been said by some of the organisations that he was alluding to.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was a very difficult position to be dealing with children under the age of 16—and, more commonly, they were children between the ages of 10 and 14—who had come to Kings Cross because it was the place they knew. They were coming to the city for the bright lights. Mostly, they were coming from the country. Their lives were characterised, certainly by the time that we had anything to do with them, by drug addiction—generally heroin addiction—and by involvement with both male and female prostitution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One thing stood out which really astounded me—and this is the reason I want to make such an issue of this program—that is, in every case that I came across, these children would attempt every six months or sometimes every year to go home and try and patch things up with their families. It does not take much imagination to realise what sort of families they were going back to: ones typically characterised by alcoholism, beatings by their parents and discord between the parents, where they saw their mother's partner beat their mother—all the sorts of circumstances of genuinely and chronically broken homes. Nevertheless, these children—without any prompting from anybody—would go home on a regular basis and spend a week or two weeks somehow trying to patch things up with their parents. One of the saddest things to see is when these children return, as they did to Kings Cross, having failed in their attempts to find some sort of reconciliation with their parents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not believe that it is fair to suggest, and I do not believe that data will be forthcoming to suggest, that the availability of the homeless youth allowance is an incentive for people to leave home. I do not believe that any cases of abuse should be forced to go through a process of reconciliation with parents. I do not believe that there should be more stringent requirements brought to bear to stop people from having that form of income support.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I should also say that I have absolutely nothing against voluntary organisations. The task force which the Prime Minister has set
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         up and the policy which the government wishes to pursue depend very greatly on voluntary organisations. As I said before, I worked with the Wayside Chapel, which has established an excellent reputation for work in the Kings Cross area, in particular with homeless youth. I have also had extensive experience with the Oasis Centre, which was set up by the Salvation Army in Kings Cross or in Darlinghurst. In particular, I pay tribute to the work of my friend Marcello Scali, who has worked as a youth worker with the Wayside Chapel and is presently with the Oasis Centre. He is entirely dedicated to the welfare of other people for very little return to himself.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am certainly not pointing the finger at these voluntary organisations, nor am I suggesting that their efforts are anything other than laudable. But, when you go to the specifics of the government's policy and what the task force has been asked to report upon, there are a number of things that lead me to a state of disquiet, and I think they should lead the Senate to a state of disquiet.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to state clearly, and for the government to state clearly, that there should be no link between reconciliation and income support. If there is any necessity for income support—and I believe there is—it should not be predicated on the fact that these children undergo a reconciliation with their parents. It has to be a voluntary process. If they initiate it and they wish it, or if the parents initiate it and the children respond, then by all means. As I said in the beginning, I do not think anybody would want anything other than reconciliation between parents and children and a happy relationship thereafter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is absolutely important that there be no feeling of compulsion on the part of the children. If they feel, as I believe the task force criteria suggest, that there is a link between their continued income support and the fact that they undergo a reconciliation or mediation process, I think that would be absolutely disastrous. There has to be some sensitivity in this matter. The sensitivity has to be shown to the people who are suffering out of all of this. Overwhelmingly, the people who suffer are the children themselves.
       </para>
       <break page="2231" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important to bear in mind that a decision by a young person to go home after reconciliation should not be seen as a one&amp;hyphen;way door. It is quite naive to imagine that people might leave home, have some form of reconciliation and then return home, and that is the end of the matter. If people knew about the circumstances from which these children were fleeing, it would be immediately obvious that the problem could recur. The young person may go home for a while but it may become impossible for them to stay there. They will leave, go home and leave over a fairly long period, at least until they are able to make their way in the world themselves.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Therefore, it is very important that this is not just seen as a closed loop: the children go through a process of reconciliation; the income support is terminated; they go home; and that is the end of the matter. The income support should always be there and both the parents and the children should be entitled to counselling support after the period of reconciliation. They should be entitled to continuing surveillance to make sure that the children are not at home under any form of duress. There should be every opportunity for them to step out of that situation if they feel it is in their best interests.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final area of my greatest concern has to be that I do not think voluntary organisations should bear the responsibility for the counselling process and I do not believe that they should be relied upon to provide to the department the recommendations which the government seeks to place upon them in terms of whether income support should continue. The opposition's policy document says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Under the pilot a young person who applies for a homeless payment will be initially assessed for eligibility by a departmental officer.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para>
         That is well and good. If there is a prima facie case for eligibility, he or she will be given a six&amp;hyphen;week temporary payment. That is fine.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is where the changes occur. One of the conditions of the payment will be that the person will be required to report to a participating voluntary agency. One of the principal roles of the agency will be to provide counselling and, wherever possible, mediate a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          reconciliation between the young person and his or her family or guardian. The agency will prepare a detailed report on the person's circumstances. The report will include an assessment of the possibility of reconciliation in the short and in the long term and a recommendation as to whether the person should continue to receive the payment after the six&amp;hyphen;week transitional period. The final decision as to the entitlement will rest with the department, but it will be based primarily upon the report of the agency.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think that is too great a responsibility for voluntary agencies to bear. As I have said before, I have a great deal of respect for the work that voluntary agencies do; but I still think that, in the terms of the policy which was stated by the government in its election platform and in the terms of the task force guidelines, it is too great a responsibility. At the end of the day, it is only a department that is accountable. It is only public servants, through their responsible ministers, who are actually accountable for their actions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Voluntary agencies mean well, and voluntary agencies do a great deal for very little reward to themselves. But the fact remains that they cannot be accountable in the same way as a public servant is accountable or a minister is accountable to this Senate and to this parliament. Unless that link is very clear, there is a danger that these children will be placed into situations where pressure is upon them to go back to their parents, to go back to their family home, and the sorts of things that made them leave that family home will be visited upon them again. I think it is an unfair pressure. I think there ought to be a great deal of sensitivity in this matter. I really believe that relying upon these voluntary agencies to provide recommendations and that that be the guiding principle upon which a departmental officer makes a decision is too great an onus.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said at the beginning, I do not think anybody believes that youth homelessness is anything other than a blight on our society. It is a sad reflection that we can be as wealthy as we are, we can point to economic growth from year to year to year and, at the same time, in this supposedly wealthy society, we
         <break page="2232" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          can find children, as I have seen, living a homeless life in places like Kings Cross. I might also say that the problem is getting worse, not better. In fact, it is now the case that Kings Cross is no longer the major focus for this problem. In Cabramatta the problem is even greater—greater because there are now greater numbers of children out there and greater because the sort of support which has been built by voluntary agencies and others around Kings Cross is simply not available in the Cabramatta area.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I urge the government to reconsider that particular recommendation and to reconsider the other principles which I have raised today. I hope that in all of their work on this pilot program they are motivated primarily by the welfare of the child—primarily by the welfare of children who have done something which most children will not do. Every person in their life probably packed a vegemite sandwich, walked down the street, saying that they were never going to come home, and were home by teatime. It is not that sort of problem, and we are not dealing with those sorts of feelings. We are dealing with fundamental problems of people who are being abused, people who would prefer a different life and who are, nevertheless, in a wealthy society, living on the street.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, my time finishes at midnight next Sunday; but, if this matter comes before the Senate after my term expires, I hope that other senators will take up these points in debate. In the meantime, I hope that the government's task force will reflect some of the things that I have said, and hopefully the government's pilot program will be less onerous than I fear it will be, given the information I have provided to the Senate.

          Senator Wheelwright has raised in his contribution to the debate. I was, as the shadow minister for youth affairs, closely involved in the policy process. Many of the concerns that Senator Wheelwright has quite properly raised here today were raised with me when I was the shadow minister, and I was certainly able to give reassurance to people who raised similar concerns that that policy was not designed to have a coercive element in it. It is an important matter to raise. I think there are a number of people in the community who believe that the youth housing assistance package acts as some form of incentive to get young people to move away from home.

        My own experience, travelling very extensively around Australia, talking to young people and visiting young people in the circumstances that Senator Wheelwright refers to, is that those people would be in an absolute minority, if they exist at all, and I suspect they do. Certainly, young people leave homes that are divided, homes where there is abuse and alcohol, and all of the other tragedies that occur in many Australian homes.

        I think the policy that Mr Howard released last year, and during the election campaign, addresses a number of concerns identified by the House of Representatives committee on youth homelessness. One of the concerns was about ensuring that there was some income support early in the program. Many of the people I spoke to—both in the voluntary sector and the young people themselves—raised this matter of not being able to get any income support for many weeks, and how that created its own problems. In many respects, it saw young people turning to prostitution and to other ways of earning an income that no&amp;hyphen;one in this society would want to see occur.

        Senator Wheelwright said he would be referring these matters to that task force and I encourage him to do so. I think it offers a positive step forward in making sure that our policy in relation to youth homelessness is more effective than what we have had in the past. I think it is a genuine attempt on the part of the Prime Minister and the coalition to address some of those problems. I think the more input comes from the community, and

        article—I am quite happy to table it if that is required—under the headline `US ship comes to the rescue of Russian polar team', in about the fourth paragraph, refers to Australia's lack of assistance to some Russian Antarctic expeditioners, particularly at the Mirny Station, which is in Australian Antarctic territory. Basically, because of the breakdown of their supply ship, the

         Akademik Federov

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Aurora Australis

Those matters were, of course, confidential. I want to set out the facts for the record and for the benefit of a Mr Vincent Kiernan, whose by&amp;hyphen;line is on the

        When I and my staff and the head of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories were in Hobart on 24 May, Rex Moncur advised us that a request had indeed come from the Russian Antarctic expedition to find out whether or not
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Aurora Australis
        </emphasis>
        would be available for charter for a mission to assist them in ensuring that their wintering party at the Mirny base could be restocked for the winter. Can I say that, entirely contrary to the articles that I refer to, the Australian Antarctic Division, with the close involvement of myself as the parliamentary secretary with responsibility for this division, ensured that within hours—it is fair to say—the Russians knew that the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Aurora Australis
        </emphasis>
        would be available. In fact on 25 May, less than 24 hours after the official sending of a request from the Russians, it was made quite clear to them that the Australians would be available to assist.

The Australian Antarctic Division and the Russian Antarctic division communicated virtually on an hourly basis on these matters from about 24 May—and the matters are still being discussed and communicated on. Part of those discussions was that Australia was quite successful, through our Antarctic

It was purely, in a logistic and communications sense, a matter of informing the United States of the situation at the Russian base, informing the Russians of the proximity of the US vessel to the Russian base, communicating information about ice conditions, weather conditions, the steaming time it would take the United States ship to get to Mirny and whether that was possible, and keeping up to date on the requirement of the Australian vessel.

I will quote from an E&amp;hyphen;mail of 17 June directed to the Australian division.

        I conclude, Madam Acting Deputy President, by saying that the operations of nations such as Russia, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the other Antarctic nations in what is one of the most hostile environments—perhaps the most hostile environment—on this globe require a commitment to the ideals of the nations that go to Antarctica to conduct science and research. They require a level of international cooperation which is not demonstrated in many other parts of the globe. The sort of cooperation that occurred in this venture that the Australian government has been involved in is a demonstration of the sort of cooperation that is required in Antarctica. It is one of the great frontiers, if not the last great frontier.

        I rise to speak today about the rising democracy movement in Indonesia, personified by the struggle of Megawati Sukarnoputri to retain her chair of the PDI, the Indonesian Democratic Party. The struggle for greater democracy which is going on within Indonesia is one of the greatest challenges to the Suharto regime since 1965. As we all know, Suharto came to power amid much controversy in 1965, after ousting Sukarno in a coup attempt. The coup attempt, which apparently had some orchestration by Suharto, with the involvement of the CIA, led to a massive purging of leftists in Indonesian society. It is said that the 1965&amp;hyphen;66 period resulted in the deaths of up to one million people who were pronounced communists and left&amp;hyphen;leaning activists. This major massacre set the democracy and workers movements back 20 years, and they are only now resurfacing.

         —They seem to have written these questions to a script. Yesterday, in taking note of an answer, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate tried to tell the Senate something about the work that his government had done in terms of benchmarks. I was very interested to note that he was very selective in what he said. Let me just tell you why. He tried to explain away why the previous government had also been reviewing benchmarks, just like our government asked the Commission of Audit to have a look at benchmarks. Your government was in it boots and all because it was your Minister for Social Security that was trying to get benchmarks started.

        Senator Faulkner chose to only tell part of the story. He commissioned a study to look at the level of expenditure required by poor households. The budget standards project, which was contracted to the University of New South Wales, is still in progress and has not yet reported. I mentioned that yesterday. Of significant interest is other work which forms part of that broader review of DSS payment rates, which was commissioned by the previous Labor minister, Mr Baldwin.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Faulkner did not mention those aspects but he would have had access to that information. That includes the policy discussion paper that was released by DSS in May last year. It also includes a deprivation standards project and a low income earners project. I will quote directly from that paper which was published last year. It stated amongst other things:
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The use of male total average weekly earnings as an indicator of community earnings is also problematic.

         So your government got what it wanted to know. It went on to state:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is no reason to believe that something lower or higher than 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings is not a more appropriate benchmark.
        </para>
        <para>
         That was the advice that was available to your minister at his request. What that demonstrates is that Senator Faulkner misled the Senate yesterday by not putting the full picture to the Senate. It also indicates that the previous government was looking at the very issues that they are condemning this government for looking at. It is apparently okay for a Labor government to look at benchmarks but there is something very sinister when it is a coalition government. Talk about hypocrisy! There is no reason to have double standards. If it is good enough for one government to do social policy research, it is good enough for another.

All five Aboriginal legal services investigated in the compliance audit are in breach of their grant conditions to varying degrees. Two of the five are in serious breach. Unless those breaches are addressed quickly, one is likely to lose its funding; and the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations is considering winding up the second. A third organisation has been asked to show cause why its funding should not cease. ATSIC officers have failed to follow the laid down procedures and processes with respect to administering grants. In one case, ATSIC is to consider whether disciplinary action is warranted pursuant to the Public Service Act.

Are you aware that the so-called guru of downsizing, Stephen S. Roach, recently said he got it wrong and that `open-ended downsizing and real wage compression were recipes for industrial extinction'? Are you aware of recent employer surveys in the United States and Australia that show that downsizing has failed to deliver higher labour productivity and improved customer service, but have had a devastating effect on morale, staff commitment and motivation?  Have you, as minister for employment, raised these findings in discussion about the government's own downsizing plans, with 9,500 jobs going from the public sector, and possibly 30,000 from Telstra?

        Basically, her question comes in three parts. She asked me to agree that economic rationalism has dominated the debate over the last decade. She asked me whether I have read something about someone she identifies as a guru of downsizing, who is now prepared to do a mea culpa and say that he got it wrong. And she asked me whether I have seen a particular piece of United States research and, subsequently, whether I have raised that with my colleagues in discussions about necessary downsizing.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to each of those questions, of course economic rationalism has played a very significant part in the debate over the last decade. I see no value in answering that any other way. The battle of ideas is what politics is about. Of course it has played a significant part, as have other arguments—the contrary arguments, in fact. Anyone interested in politics would tell you that, when you raise
        <break page="2241" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         an argument or propose a particular theory or particular approach to matters, you necessarily draw out those who would want to go the other way.

It is true that after 13 years of a Labor government Australia has one of the most unfair distributions of national income in the developed world.

        As I said yesterday, in line with normal practice for contracts with the Commonwealth, the contract with KPMG to undertake the tasks of the special auditor contains provisions on how potential conflicts of interest are to be handled. The contract provides for substituted performance of the special auditor tasks for those indigenous organisations with which KPMG currently have a commercial relationship. The firm of Pannell Kerr Forster, or its national affiliates, will be used by KPMG to undertake the task of special auditor where there is a potential conflict of interest for KPMG.

        The reason we had to appoint a special auditor in the first place is that the previous government ignored problems of accountability and service delivery.

        ATSIC has been aware since 10 April of the nature of the information required to be provided by ATSIC to the special auditor, once appointed.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to amendments made by the Senate to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996 concerning tax concessions for private urban road projects.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Short's trademark in this place is that of an obfuscating, bungling, stumbling incompetent. What he has added to that very doubtful reputation is that of being a misleader. On 19 June, to questions from Senator Faulkner, he misled this chamber over the details of the start date on sales tax. It was inconvenient for him that he then had to later change his information to the Senate but, of course, he never changed it all. He failed to withdraw the blackguarding he had engaged in against Senator Faulkner, and he conducted himself in a manner that can only be described as churlish in the extreme. That is strike one.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Strike two occurred yesterday and today when Senator Short again misled this chamber. It is very important to get the facts of this misleading clear so that the degree of misleading can be understood and therefore appreciated. Yesterday he received a question from Senator Kernot about the Development Allowance Authority and, rather than answer the question that Senator Kernot had posed to Senator Short, Senator Short rounded on Senator Kernot, attacked her and accused her in about a five&amp;hyphen; or six&amp;hyphen;paragraph answer of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         sabotaging some 40 projects in all in this country to the value of $2.5 billion.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When one looks at Senator Short's answer one can see he used the words `sabotage' or `sabotaged' at least eight times. There is no doubt, there is no ambiguity at all, that he meant to directly say that Senator Kernot, and those of us in the opposition and other minor parties who had voted for an amendment when this bill was before the chamber, had sabotaged those projects. Today, when asked whether he withdrew or changed those words, he reaffirmed them. So for the second day in a row he used words which, unfortunately for him, do not in any way, shape of form equate with the truth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr President, it is unparliamentary to use the appropriate word that one might use in these circumstances, and I decline to use that word. But it is parliamentary to say in these circumstances that a misleading has occurred, and it has occurred for this reason: the bill in question was passed by this chamber. That is not a small fact. It is the large fact that sits awkwardly in front of Senator Short that, if the bill had not been passed, then there may have been some grounds for arguing the case—although they would have been, it has to be said, weak grounds, but a skilful advocate may have made something stronger from them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But there are no grounds because the bill was passed, and passed with one amendment. It is therefore important to dwell for a moment on that amendment to see whether there is any comfort for Senator Short's extraordinary misleading in regard to that one amendment. Of course there is not. That one amendment referred only and exclusively to road construction in Australia from, I recall, 15 December 1995.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only projects that would have been affected by that amendment are road constructions that would have attracted the development allowance authority grant from 15 December 1995, and not anything else. The projects that Senator Short referred to that make up the $2.5 billion are projects which he has itemised as follows: 18 projects in the mining industry—not true; 10 projects in the tourism industry—not true; six projects in
        <break page="2253" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         electricity, gas and water—not true; four projects in manufacturing—not true. The three projects in transport and storage are more than likely not true although he has declined to give information about those projects.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When my office rang the Development Allowance Authority during question time yesterday to seek verification, they said they would fax the information. When it did not come through my fax, they told us they had received a call from the office of the Treasurer and that, if we want the information, we have to write to the Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is not a question that the Senate should take lightly. There is nothing that has happened here that has sabotaged those projects. To say that it has is to mislead. To continue to say it is to mislead again and offend twice. Senator Short should do the decent thing and now apologise and withdraw.

I thought he simply knew that we were debating the Development Allowance Authority Bill and he had not heard that the Treasurer had made a separate announcement. But listening to the end of the answer and hearing what you have repeated today, it is my view that you have misled the Senate. I believe you have misled us in two ways.

        Firstly, I think you have been wrong about the amount you have stated because, as I understand it from the financial impact statement of the bill, we are talking about $920 million dollars, not $2.5 billion. Secondly, as Senator Peter Cook has explained, it is misleading to say that anything has been sabotaged when the bill has been passed. What it in fact means is that now the government has a choice. It has a choice whether it accepts the extension that they were asking for in the bill to the new applications which have come in after the closing date and the Senate amendment which says no to the reinstatement of urban roads as qualifying for infrastructure tax concessions, or whether it says no to the lot. It is the government's
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         choice. It is very misleading to say, when a bill has been passed, that something has been sabotaged.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to revisit why the Democrats moved the amendment we did, because it has been misrepresented as well. We added a provision to the bill which affects only 40 privately constructed toll roads, not the 40 private projects that you were talking about. The Economic Planning Advisory Commission, the private infrastructure task force that was set up in October, looked at infrastructure borrowing tax concessions for the builders of private tollways. It said that privately financed projects are likely to be least advantageous for urban roads and that there was little efficiency to be gained from private ownership.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You are the people who go on about efficiency all the time—making taxpayers' money work efficiently—and you try and reinstate a rort which gives a benefit to private developers and asks taxpayers to pay three times—through petrol, then to the tax collector, and then to the toll collector at the toll booths—for the privilege of using roads in New South Wales.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the point. You are the ones that go on about efficiencies and you are the ones that are reinstating a very inefficient tax. Mr Costello's supposedly independent Commission of Audit said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not apparent within the current income tax arrangements why special tax treatment should apply to infrastructure borrowings.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the point. We should revisit the Treasurer's words when we are asking why this government, preoccupied with efficiency, chooses to reintroduce a rort.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We should also revisit why the Treasurer said, when he was saying that it was not right for some state governments and local governments to have cars that were sales tax exempt:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Don't think that the government will sit by and allow the existing tax system to be riddled and rorted.
       </para>
       <para>
        He sought to reintroduce a huge rort. That is the point, and that is why the Senate acted as it did. We said that we do not accept this. It has nothing to do with the construction of Sydney's eastern distributor. Tollways are
        <break page="2254" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         incredibly profitable, and that is why investors are lining up to invest in them. That is the fact. When you say that we sabotaged something, Senator Short, I ask you to look again. This Senate passed the bill. The government got what it asked for. It got a little bit more that it did not want, as well. The choice is yours, but you have misled the Senate on two counts.

        In other words, it was encouraging investment in Australia for the long term of Australia.

         —Senator Gibson, of course, accuses the Australian Labor Party of participating in some sort of ambush and sabotage of a government bill on the Development Allowance Authority. Nothing could be further from the truth. The whole issue was raised by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the other place on the question of the infrastructure bonds applying to roads. He did it in such a deliberately provocative way and sought to overturn the decisions made by Ralph Willis and Laurie Brereton who, on 15 December last year, announced changes to the infrastructure borrowing arrangements for urban roads.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The very simple reason was that the application of infrastructure bonds to urban roads, particularly given the City Link project in Melbourne, would have been totally uneconomic and would have led to major distortions and quite savage abuses of the policy processes in this country.

        City Link, a project worth $1.2 billion with an additional cost of finance of some $0.7 billion, under these sordid, secret arrangements would have ended up costing between $7 billion and $8 billion. Its construction costs alone were $1.2 billion. For 34 years, profits would have been guaranteed to the City Link consortia involving Transurban. Individual taxpayers, individual commuters in Melbourne, would have to pay for some 34 years the equivalent, in today's prices, of $1,500 a year for the use of those roads—public assets which were funded by the public purse over many years but transferred to the private sector. By extraordinary means, with additional subsidies to the tune of $300 million added to the project but not funded by the private consortia, a construction project which should have cost $1.2 billion would have ended up costing between $7 billion and $8 billion over the 34&amp;hyphen;year life of the project.

        On top of that, some 66 measures were introduced in the Victorian parliament to ensure that anti&amp;hyphen;competitive actions would provide additional subsidies and protections—and to avoid the normal, common civil rights.

        This is a substantial policy issue that does not relate to ambush or sabotage. The matter was soundly and properly raised by the former Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, and the former Minister for Transport, Mr Laurie Brereton. They indicated that private road builders had inflated the construction costs through legal and financial complexities and had provided a risk premium to such an extent that there was a guaranteed profit. These actions resulted in the public purse being fleeced.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What your government is trying to do is reintroduce those extraordinary rorts. You are trying to fleece the public of this country by allowing this action to proceed. The Senate has amended a bill that you have brought in here. It has not asked you to exempt those other measures; it has not sought to stop the other 35 projects. What it says is that you should exclude privatised roads—the transfer of a public asset to a private monopoly, in the case of Transurban and examples like that in the future—in such a way as to protect the public interest. You are seeking to avoid that obligation. For you to come in here and say that we are sabotaging the program of the government is totally inappropriate and just plain wrong.

He has never had credibility in this place; he was the most pumped up minister the place has ever seen, a pompous minister who did not really know what he was talking about—and he is carrying it on in opposition.

          —I will be generous. The key point is that the Australian Democrats on Monday deliberately moved an amendment in the Senate that they knew was going to be unacceptable to the government. They knew the government could not accept that amendment. As I understand it—I may be wrong and Senator Kernot can correct me—I don't think they even thought of having the amendment until Mr Costello answered a question on it during question time in the House of Representatives. There had been no prior warning or indication that such an amendment was going to come forward.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I repeat the point that the Democrats introduced an amendment which really had nothing to do with the bill at hand. What the bill was about was basically a technical amendment to enable a wide range of projects in the mining industry, in tourism and so on, to qualify for the development allowance. The termination cut&amp;hyphen;off date for applications was way back on 1 January 1993. What the bill was about was a minor technical amendment which, as I recall, the previous government had announced last year that they were going to do, but did not get around to doing it. That was all the bill was about.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What then happened was that Senator Kernot heard a question and answer on the development allowance application as far as private urban roads were concerned. The Democrats thought, `Gee, this would be a pretty good idea. We will do something about this and tack it on as an amendment to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill that was in the Senate.' They knew when they did that that the government could not accept that amendment. That is why I say, and why I said on Monday, that by moving this amendment, which they knew to be unacceptable, they have put the whole bill at risk.

You knew that the amendment you moved on roads was totally unacceptable to the government. For Senator Kernot now to say, as she did in her response, that we have a choice is a statement of the most extreme arrogance.

This has occurred, as I said in my response—ATSIC provided it for me, by the way—in relation to mischievous behaviour. Perhaps `mischievous' was the word ATSIC used.

                   2.1 The Committee recommends that the Government reconsider the legislative requirement that the Tribunal must include the Chair or Deputy Chair when exercising its powers and assess whether it would enhance the timeliness of the Tribunal to have a less restrictive provision such as those found in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, Social Security Act and the Migration Act.

                   The Government does not agree that the requirement that review panels must include the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson unduly constrains the Tribunal's efficiency. The majority of complaints lodged with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT) are resolved at the inquiry and conciliation stages by the Tribunal Secretariat and only a small proportion (4 per cent of all complaints within jurisdiction received from July 1994 to March 1996) require review by a Tribunal Panel. Tribunal reviews are regularly programmed by the Tribunal Secretariat and, while the proportion of complaints requiring review may increase in future (particularly in relation to disability complaints involving medical evidence), there is no basis for concluding that the requirement that the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson must be a part of the panel impedes the timeliness of the review process at present, or is likely to do so in the foreseeable future.

                   In addition, there are a number of benefits that flow from requiring one or other of the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson to be present on all review panels. First, it ensures continuity and stability in the determination making process and will maximise the likelihood of consistent Tribunal decisions emerging in similar fact situations. While the Tribunal, as a merits review body, is not bound by its past determinations, broad consistency of outcomes is an important factor in maintaining industry and public confidence in the Tribunal, particularly where potentially large sums of privately accumulated retirement savings and ancillary entitlements are involved, and given the avid industry attention paid to the written determinations.

                   The Tribunal Chairperson has indicated publicly that the SCT expects trustees to record reasons for their decisions. The Government also regards adequate record keeping as best practice. Trustees who fail to record reasons may find themselves at a disadvantage before the SCT because it will be difficult for the Tribunal to decide if the trustee has acted fairly or reasonably if it does not have access to all material considered and the trustee's reasoning for its decision. The Government is presently of the view that the SCT's stance on this matter will encourage trustees to provide reasons and thereby lead to the desired outcome without the need for legislative amendment. However, the situation will continue to be monitored by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and legislative amendment may need to be considered in the future.

                   6.1 The Committee recommends that a limited Government funded superannuation consumer advice service be established within the existing community legal or credit advice centres; that there be a general limit of two appointments for each client; and that the service be restricted to providing advice and information only and not extend to the running of cases before the Tribunal. The Committee further recommends that this arrangement be reviewed after two years and an assessment as to its adequacy be made at that time.

                   Government funding for a superannuation consumer advice service is not considered necessary given the measures already in place to assist members of superannuation funds with their complaints. These measures include the obligation on the SCT to assist a person in making a complaint, the legislative requirement that the existence and functions of the SCT be disclosed to all members upon joining and each year, the provision of an interpreter service for complainants where necessary, the fact that the SCT can be contacted from anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call, the production and wide distribution of a simple and easy to read publication on how to lodge complaints with the SCT. Regional Offices of the ISC also assist people who want to make complaints to the SCT, there is no application fee for lodging a complaint with the SCT, and no costs are charged to the member or the fund.

          I am pleased to table this report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on Australia&amp;hyphen;China Relations. It is an extensive review of one of Australia's most important bilateral relationships that has been conducted at a time of significant change, not only within China itself, but also within the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region and globally. China's economy continues to change rapidly as the Chinese Government strives to build a socialist market economy. China is also on the brink of ushering in the age of the second&amp;hyphen;generation leaders. The leadership has followed the broad policies espoused by Deng Xiaoping and, in particular, is now united on the importance of maintaining market&amp;hyphen;based reform of the economy.

          The Committee has also taken into account international factors affecting China and its relationship with Australia. Both countries are members of the Asia Pacific Economic Co&amp;hyphen;operation and the more recently formed ASEAN Regional Forum. This reflects the common interests both countries have in seeing that peace and stability prevail in the Asia Pacific. Yet there are a number of tensions and potential flash points which threaten the current state of relative calm in the region. Taiwan and the South China Sea are two such regional concerns, while China's harder line on Hong Kong of late and the recurring tensions in China&amp;hyphen;United States relations have also affected the atmosphere in the region.

In 1983&amp;hyphen;84, the former Senate Standing Committee on Industry and Trade conducted an inquiry into prospects for Australia&amp;hyphen;China trade. However, this is the first time that a parliamentary committee has reviewed the wider bilateral relationship.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          As a starting point, the Committee agreed that Australia's relationship with China should be based on friendship but still be business&amp;hyphen;like in order to pursue national interests and enhance mutual interests. The relationship should also be based on respect, understanding and trust and be robust enough to discuss sensitive issues without affecting the stability of the relationship.

          The relationship has been reasonably good but there are still thorny issues which will test the strength of the relationship. However, the relationship has endured previous rough stretches and the Committee is confident that the relationship has matured enough to deal with difficult issues without compromising the integrity of the relationship.

          In any bilateral relationship, both sides have to work hard to sustain the harmony and productiveness of that relationship, particularly where the two countries have fundamentally different political and social systems, as do Australia and China. This requires frequent contact at all levels of government to build up the understanding and trust necessary to ride over any rough patches which may occur in any relationship.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The importance of building understanding and trust at all levels of the bilateral relationship, from the governmental level through to commercial ties and defence exchanges, is a major theme running through the report. Mutual understanding depends on both countries learning more about each other, in terms of language, culture, people and perceptions. Central to this two&amp;hyphen;way learning process is the need for exchanges of people across all the areas of the relationship. These exchanges should help cultivate trust which is an important antidote for fear and misperception that can damage relationships, particularly during periods of difficulty and friction.

          In light of recent tensions in the region, the development of cultural and social relations continue to be as important and relevant now as they were at the time of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and China in 1972, when China was a more closed society. The Committee has recommended an increase in the real level of resources available to the Australia&amp;hyphen;China Council (ACC) for its work in developing social and cultural ties and for its support of bilateral economic relations to a level similar to that in the ACC's first years of activities. The Committee has also recommended that the Department of Employment, Education and Training at least maintain funding levels for Chinese language and cultural studies in Australia and encourage State Government education authorities to do likewise.

          Commerce continues to be at the heart of Australia&amp;hyphen;China relations. A significant section of the report and over half of the Committee's recommendations to the Government focus on economic and investment matters. This largely reflects the common view that the trading connection between Australia and China is the mainstay of the overall relationship.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The economic relationship has both grown and changed significantly since the first Senate Committee report on Australia&amp;hyphen;China trade in 1983&amp;hyphen;84.

           In 1982&amp;hyphen;83, total two&amp;hyphen;way trade was worth $890 million. In 1995 it was worth nearly $7 billion.

          Currently bilateral trade is growing at close to 20 per cent annually. China is Australia's fastest growing export market in East Asia. Australian investment in China is growing even faster, having doubled in the time since the inquiry began. Australia is the second most important destination, after Hong Kong, for Chinese overseas investment.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          What these figures do not show, however, is the growing sophistication and maturity of the economic relationship. As both economies have changed internally over the last 15 years, so too has the nature of the trade between them changed. Commodity exports remain the core of Australia's exports to China, but they have fallen as a proportion of total exports with the rise of exports of raw materials and energy products needed for China's economic transformation, and with the entry of Australian manufactures and services into the China market. Chinese exports to Australia have also changed qualitatively, with traditional labour&amp;hyphen;intensive exports falling as a proportion of total exports with the rise of light industrial exports and exports of more sophisticated electrical and machine goods.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The economic relationship looks set to expand further and this should be a high priority for Australia in its relations with China. With China's economy booming and foreign investment and aid sought, China offers considerable opportunities for the Australian business community across a breadth of sectors. Australia is well&amp;hyphen;placed to capitalise on the market openings offered by China's economic transformation. Apart from the natural complementarity between the two economies, Australia has established in China a reputation as a fair and reliable trader. The sound state of the political relationship, and Australia's image as a non&amp;hyphen;threatening regional neighbour, mean that commercial links are not hamstrung by some of the political tensions other western trading partners experience in China.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Australia's fast&amp;hyphen;growing investment presence in China also promises to generate follow&amp;hyphen;on export business for Australian companies. As investment is now seen as driving trade, especially in North East Asian markets such as China's, Australian investment in China has strengthened Australia's long&amp;hyphen;term strategic position in the Chinese economy.

          However, there is a view that Australia has not made the most of the opportunities presented by the China market. The recent performance of Australian manufactures to China, for example, has been inconsistent. What appears to be at the root of this problem is a lack of strategic commitment to exporting from Australian companies. Such an approach is a recipe for failure in the competitive

           China market. As the report makes clear, success in China depends on building long&amp;hyphen;term relations and a track record for reliability—hallmarks of Australia's success in primary product exports to China. The Committee has recommended that the East Asia Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs undertake analysis of Australian manufactures exports and East Asian markets, and report to the Government accordingly.

          The Committee also recommends that the Government should conduct a study of the opportunities for Australian business presented by the emergence of regional markets in China. China is commonly described as "one country, many markets. Many of those markets are forming along regional lines, and some present opportunities for which Australian companies should be well&amp;hyphen;placed to take advantage. While some Australian companies have begun to explore and enter these emerging markets, the Committee believes more needs to be known about the long&amp;hyphen;term market potential, as well as the obstacles and risks, of these regional markets before Australian companies will begin to see them as viable alternatives to China's coastal markets.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          In reviewing Australia's economic performance in China, the Committee looked at the overall approach employed by Australia and, in particular, the role of government in assisting Australia's economic interests. Government support remains crucial in a market such as China's. Chinese officials and customers see it as a seal of approval on the value of a private company's bid, a factor which helps overcome some of the limitations Australian small to medium&amp;hyphen;sized enterprises (SMEs) face when up against larger competitors from the united States or Japan. Government support also helps open doors in an economic system where personal connections are all&amp;hyphen;important, and can prove essential if business people run into complications with China's opaque and arbitrary regulatory system.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Yet the role of government in the relationship is changing, if not declining with both the rise of the non&amp;hyphen;state sector in China but also the growing presence of Australian companies in China. These developments necessitate some degree of change in the way Australia conducts business in China. The Committee believes that the peak bilateral government body, the Joint Ministerial Economic Council (JMEC), should be retained to oversee economic relations between Australia and China. But the Committee recommends a review of the level below the JMEC, the Joint Working Groups (JWGs), to examine whether there needs to be changes made to ensure that the JWGs reflect the devolution of economic power and regionalism of the Chinese economy.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee also sees the JMEC operating as an umbrella for the new groupings that are forming amongst Australian companies. The Committee
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           strongly endorses the merger of the Australia China Business Council and Australia China Chambers of Commerce and Industry which is imminent. Likewise, it also supports the merger of a number of Australian Business Groups based in Hong Kong and major centres in China. The formation of these united bodies should help project a clear Australian identity in the China market and overcome some of the disunity that has been a problem for Australia in China.

          Despite China's open door policies and continued relaxation of restrictions on foreign involvement in its economy, the China market still presents significant obstacles and challenges for Australian companies. China is a high&amp;hyphen;cost and high&amp;hyphen;risk market. Tariff and non&amp;hyphen;tariff barriers remain at levels far higher than those in Australia, which is one of the reasons for Australia's current trade deficit with China. While it has a large body of law, much of it is opaque and its enforcement arbitrary.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          These problems make it essential that China joins the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the basis of an unequivocal commitment from China to the WTO's rules&amp;hyphen;based standards and market disciplines. Any compromise of the WTO's rules for the sake of securing China's membership would not only undermine the basis of the liberalised international trade system but would also reduce the momentum for further market reform of the Chinese economy. The Committee has recommended that the Government continue to press, at both the bilateral and multilateral level, for China to accede to the WTO on the basis of a clear commitment from China to implement WTO rules within clearly specified timeframes.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee has also recommended that steps be taken towards establishing a bilateral program of work experience exchanges between Australian and Chinese companies. Such an exchange program would meet the current priority China places on acquiring modern management and technical skills from advanced economies. It would also increase mutual understanding of the different economic systems and business cultures in both countries which should help overcome both Chinese misperceptions of the Australian economy and the difficulties Australian companies encounter when trying to thread there way through China's complex economic system.

This would not only complement the bilateral strategic dialogue that currently takes place between both countries' defence establishments but should also help develop channels of communication that are important both for avoiding misperceptions and during periods of difficulty. Such contacts would be a step towards Australia's larger goal of engaging China more deeply in the evolving network of multilateral regional security ties.

          The Committee also recommends that the Australian Government should encourage China to publish a white paper on China's defence policy and military development. One of the reasons for concern within the region over China's growing but still modest power projection capabilities is the lack of transparency surrounding China's defence planning. The uncertainty over China's long&amp;hyphen;term strategic ambitions arising from this lack of transparency has the potential to breed hostile perceptions towards China. To avoid this occurring, China needs to be encouraged to embrace both the letter and the spirit of defence transparency.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee has also recommended that a priority in Australian policy towards South China Sea should be the promotion of efforts to establish a multilateral framework for conflict prevention in the South China Sea. Although the situation in the South China Sea remains relatively low&amp;hyphen;key, the fact that the military forces of the various claimants operate often in close proximity points to the risk of an accident happening that could escalate to a higher level. Establishing a framework for conflict prevention would help counter such incidents occurring.

          With regard to human rights in China, the Committee supports Australia's policy of constructive, non&amp;hyphen;confrontational dialogue with China on these matters. The Committee believes that linking sanctions in other areas to improvements in human rights is neither productive in maintaining a viable relationship with China nor effective in producing the desired improvements. The breadth of Australia's connections with China at all levels of the relationship offers channels through which Australia make it concerns known and sensitise Chinese people to international accepted standards of human rights behaviour.

          Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with China in 1972, Australia has regarded Taiwan as a province of China and accordingly has not had political relations with Taiwan. This has not precluded Australia developing a strong economic relationship with Taiwan. Taiwan is now Australia's ninth largest trading partner. In pursuing an economic relationship with Taiwan, a country, which has diplomatic relations with China, may find it difficult to keep that relationship solely within the bounds of the economic sphere. In such circumstances, arrangements might be entered into with Taiwan, which in the opinion of China cross the line into the political arena and thus provoke protests from Beijing. Openness with China should help to allay any Chinese concerns that Australia is not adhering to its responsibilities under the 1972 agreement. That is not to say that Australia and China might disagree on whether some action by Australia in relation to Taiwan is consistent with Australia's obligations. As it is a bilateral agreement, the terms of that agreement are subject to interpretation by both sides. If Australia and China do not interpret something in the same way, they should try to achieve accommodation through discussion and negotiation. The Committee does not believe, however, that one side has the right to insist that its view should always prevail. Provided that both sides adhere to the fundamental principles underpinning the relationship, there should be recognition given to the dynamic nature of the relationship, as well as to the regional and global environment, by the adoption of a reasonable approach to new policies. Both sides need, however, to negotiate on the basis of their national interests in good faith.

         It is a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between Australia and China—that is, it deals with the political relationship, the economic relationship, and social and cultural aspects of the relationship. It deals with particular parts of the economy—with commerce, with trade, with joint ventures, with investment from one country to the other and with every aspect of our growing economic relationship.

         The terms of reference also required us to directly assess the concerns of Australians in China relating to human rights. A full chapter was devoted to this in the report. We were also required in our terms of reference to look at the situation in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sometimes we referred to three Chinas. Of course, there is only one China—and we recognise the republic in Beijing as China—but we are aware of the separation, at least for the time being, of Taiwan and Hong Kong as British colonies which are to be handed back to China in a year's time.

         There are very real concerns in Australia about the particularities of the second and third Chinas, as they are colloquially called, when looking at this part of Asia. I think that there is a mature and well developed assessment of each of these economies in the report. There is bipartisan support to maximise Australia's commercial relationship with Taiwan and to in no way whatsoever change the political relationship which exists—that is, that we recognise the government of China in Beijing.

Three years ago there were

          The final remarks I wish to make relate to the 70&amp;hyphen;year period which began in 1980. That was when Deng Xiaoping gained full political support, after the 10 lost years of the cultural revolution, for the open door policy. For the first time in history, China actually began to emerge into the modern world. Prior to that there was the cultural revolution, the ups and downs of Mao Tse&amp;hyphen;tung's period since 1949, the civil war, the Japanese aggression, the war lord period and the period of imperialism that cut up and divided China. Before that there was the dynastic history without which we would not see the strengths of the modernisation that we now have in China.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Up until 1979, and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's open door policy, China was submerged and not living up to its full potential. It is only with the progressive economic policies of modernisation, of realistic economic achievement and of prosperity for the people of China that followed Deng Xiaoping's initiatives that we have seen China given a chance. It has been 17 years that we have observed this. Both in China and in Australia people are looking forward to 2050—a 70&amp;hyphen;year period from 1980 to 2050; if you like, a 70&amp;hyphen;year period in which it is expected that China will become the biggest gross economy in the world and the largest population in the world. This is of enormous significance for Australia and Australia's relations within APEC and north Asia.

         The visit to China and then to Hong Kong, where we spent some time talking to Governor Patten and to the Chinese main negotiator, Zhou Nan, was probably some of the best time that committee members spent, hearing the views of both men in relation to the handing back of Hong Kong in 1997.

         The visit to Taiwan was done in a private capacity. I went, as did Senator Teague. We had discussions with a number of people but I want to relate to the Senate one discussion that I had in Taiwan. We spent some time speaking to some of the people involved in commercial enterprises in Taiwan. One particular person—I will not name people or companies at this stage—bought a high&amp;hyphen;rise property in Sydney and established a manufacturing industry making electrical goods, motors and those types of things. I asked him, `Why would you go to Australia to develop an industry?' He said, `I went to Australia for two reasons: firstly, we didn't have the room in Taiwan to expand; and, secondly, we didn't have the labour. In Australia you have the room and you have the labour.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         I then asked him an obvious question coming from someone who was involved in trade unions, `What sort of problems did you have with the Australian workers? Did you have any industrial problems?' He said, `No, we didn't.' I said, `Why would that be?' He said, `Because we made arrangements and agreements before we started the enterprise and we had no problems.' I said, `My second question would be: how many Taiwanese did you employ?' He thought for a while and then said, `One. By the way, if you would like to meet the manager of our world enterprise, I would be only too pleased to introduce him to you.' He brought him in and he was an Australian who had just been appointed the world manager.

         I was one of those fortunate enough to be invited to visit the country. I welcome having taken that opportunity. It certainly gave me a greater understanding of the country, the customs and the variety within the country. It is a very large country—in fact, larger than Australia. It has a population in the order of 1.2 billion, but its land formation is such that the people are able to live on only 10 per cent or less of it.

         The terrain of the country is very harsh. We talk about our harsh terrain here, but they have mountains that cover large areas, including an area which is part of the Himalayas. That harsh terrain adds to their logistics, infrastructure needs and infrastructure variation. One thing that struck me very greatly was the difference between the infrastructure available in Lanzhou, which is in Gansu province in the middle of the country, and the infrastructure around Beijing, Qingdao, Shenzhen and Shanghai. They were vastly different—like cheese and chalk.

         The CFF, as this program is called, is actually part of the DIFF program, and DIFF has certainly been causing some interest in the other place. A lot of evidence before us stated that this program had been a major benefit to both China and Australia, and that is very important.

         They are the sorts of benefits that this program has given to Australia, but there have been follow on benefits as well.

The committee is not convinced there is a pressing need for Australia's development assistance program to become more trade focused than it already is. We think that it has a good balance, but we do not want to see the CFF program reduced, diminished or changed. We also noted that, of the 1994-95 program budget to AusAID, which totalled $98 million, over half, $58 million, was designated for CFF projects which would assist Australian companies.

I do not think a Senate committee had been beyond the Pacific at the invitation of a foreign country. I went along much as the junior senator, if you like, on that trip. There were others much more experienced than I in matters relating to China.

        I do not think that that by any means should be taken as support for the amendment that the government has here. I was going to read a letter by way of example, but unfortunately I will have to refer to it from memory because I have folded my papers away. Our office received some phone calls and at least one letter where people asked, `Why are you supporting ATSIC when ATSIC has been
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       <para first-indent="16">
        I said, `What would you want to do that for?' They said, `So we could get better service delivery.' I said, `What would you think if the administrator was put in place to make sure that the accountability mechanisms and the bureaucratic mechanisms of ATSIC were strengthened and entrenched?' They were horrified to hear this because that is the very problem. They think there is already so many bureaucratic mechanisms in place that the direct service delivery of ATSIC and the direct funding are being interfered with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So a lot of the support that the government may be receiving for these measures should be, at least on my hypothesis, investigated to see whether what people had in mind under these amendments is exactly what would happen. They need to be given the information to ascertain that for themselves before anybody in this chamber can claim decisively that there is support within the Aboriginal community for the measure.

        Having said that, I have already put on the record that I have been a critic of ATSIC. I am not a person who has not been on the public record fully in support of it. I have expressed concerns and I still have those concerns. If I felt that this particular provision would assist in that regard, I assure the government that it would have my support. My concern is that this will actually make ATSIC worse in what it has been criticised for rather than better. It is for that reason that I am supporting the amendments.

       <para>
        Is there any ability to go to the AAT to challenge the minister's decision? In any event, does that not leave the commission very vulnerable if an administrator can be appointed by the minister on the test of satisfaction of fraud? Would it be unusual for a decision as to fraud—distinct from, say, misconduct—to be made by a minister? Is it not a very serious matter for a whole group of people, being the commission, as I understand it, to be dismissed simply—and I use that word advisedly—on the test of a minister being satisfied? Why is the test for that different from that applied for the appointment of an administrator?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at proposed section 78B(2) you see that it refers to proposed section 78F, which goes to the conditions for an appointment of an administrator, which is defined in the proposed section we are now dealing with—that is, the proposed section that defines `commission administrator'. In relation to the tests where a minister may terminate the appointment of an administrator, in proposed section 78F(3), for example, that can be done only if the administrator is guilty of misbehaviour or becomes bankrupt. I see that as an objective test of fact; whereas the dismissal of the commission itself is done on a subjective test of the minister being satisfied. I am wondering why that difference was made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Following on from that, the administrator can be dismissed if the minister thinks that the performance of the administrator has been unsatisfactory for a definite period of time. So, even within proposed section 78F, why is there a different test as to the basis upon which the termination decision has to be made? I would like some clarification of those standards upon which the decision maker must rest his or her case in the dismissal of the commission. Could you then go on to the dismissal of the administrator.

I refer you to proposed section 78F(3)(c), where all that is required is for the minister to be dissatisfied with the performance.

         —Thank you for that, Minister. If the matter has to go to the Federal Court instead of the AAT, does that mean that there is no appeal on the issue of fact? Would the minister's decision as to whether or not there has been fraud or gross mismanagement be unassailable if it were otherwise done according to law? Is that the position? On the issue of the administrator, if proposed section 78F(3)(c) is available to the minister, why does the legislation contain proposed section 78F(3)(a) and proposed section 78F(3)(b)? Why is the test for proposed section 78F(3)(a) and proposed section 78F(3)(b) different from proposed section 78F(3)(c)?

         —Yes, the issue of natural justice. But it is a very serious business, fraud. The other point you might check is this. One of the bases upon which the minister can dismiss the commission is the failure of the commission to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of a direction in force under sections 12 or 74. Section 12 of the act says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The commission shall perform its functions and exercise its power in accordance with such general

         directions as are given to it by the minister in writing.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a provision of similar character to the provision of section 74. Does that mean that the minister, he or she having given a direction to the commission, can then decide himself or herself whether the commission has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent a contravention of that direction or can decide himself or herself that the commission has intentionally failed to comply with that direction and can thereby dismiss the commission? If that is so, does that not put you into the following position: the minister can give a direction under section 12 or section 74 and then decide himself or herself whether that has been complied with and, if he or she decides it has not been complied with, can dismiss the commission. If that is so, what sort of independence does that give to a commission? What I mean by that is that here we have a commission that, unless it complies with the general directions of a minister given in writing to the satisfaction of the minister who has given that direction, the minister can sack, in effect, without there ever having been any review on the facts.

        In completing my earlier comments, I would like to say that the people who do not like this amendment do not like it because they see it as being aimed at the abolition of ATSIC. Those who express support for it as an amendment think that this is the proposal by the government; they think it might be good to abolish ATSIC. I want to put on the record that I do not think it will actually abolish ATSIC. What I think it will do is put an enormous threat on ATSIC which will make it almost impossible for it to improve its functioning. I feel, if there is to be any question of the abolition of ATSIC, that the only legitimate way to do it would be for this government to have a proposal for something far better in its place that had the support of the majority of Aboriginal people right across the community. That is the reason the Democrats, with the Labor Party and the Greens, are opposing these two items of the schedule.

         —Before responding, I will answer Senator Collins's question. The board is not sacked; they remain in office, and their powers will resume after the administrator ceases. That is the first point. Secondly, my understanding is it would be major fraud involving the commissioners, and this understanding was reflected in my second reading speech. That is, only in exceptional circumstances would that be invoked.

        In response to Senator Chamarette's question, I inform the chamber that there was no intention whatsoever in our policy to get rid of ATSIC. That was stated quite clearly in our policy and I have restated it on a number of occasions since. The clause related purely to accountability and the sanction that could apply if these extraordinary circumstances should occur. As I mentioned last Friday, perhaps something should have been inserted right at the beginning in the ATSIC Act. I am not sure that it was even discussed. Senator Bob Collins said it was not brought up at any stage because of the concern about self&amp;hyphen;management.

The reason such a provision was not incorporated in the original ATSIC Bill was that, after a couple of hundred amendments and extremely long debate, many layers of accountability were already imposed and it was not deemed necessary. That is why such a provision is not there; it was not deemed by the majority of the parliament to be necessary.

          learned friend Senator Cooney, I will chase this rabbit all the way down the burrow just to satisfy myself, because the law may well have moved on from the last time a mug like me looked at it. The minister made reference to his second reading speech. My understanding, the last time I looked, or the last time I talked to a judge, is that a court will take account of second reading speeches only when it needs to be guided on the provisions of the law. If a court is absolutely satisfied that the law as printed is clear, the second reading speech of the minister is just so much paper. Perhaps that practice has changed. Courts these days are finding implied rights for freedom of speech in the constitution which I cannot find, so they are more inventive than I am.

        I take your point, Minister, that we are not talking about sacking the board, but we certainly are talking about disabling it for the period that the administrator is in office. For that reason, this provision concerns me. I will put an extreme hypothetical case of a fraud that has occurred in a regional office of ATSIC. It is beyond dispute that fraud has occurred. It involves, say, a million dollars, which triggers the minister's requirement to be satisfied. I guess it is a matter for political or moral judgment as to whether it is major fraud; nevertheless, fraud has occurred and the minister has acted lawfully by appointing an administrator.

        In respect of an appeal to the judicial review process, surely it would be very difficult to get a court to overturn that decision, even if, on the reasonable judgment of somebody standing outside the process, the matter were confined to one office and not systemic in the organisation. Providing a fraud had occurred and the proposed provision complied with—there is no reference in this provision to `major' or `extreme' fraud—the legislation is satisfied. If you have satisfied the act, is it not very difficult to get any court to go beyond the decision of the minister and overturn it?

        All honourable senators will be very familiar with those provisions—because they do, in fact, apply to us. They must be fairly common around the Commonwealth of Australia. They certainly were the provisions that applied when I was a member of the Northern Territory parliament.

        Importantly, the committee should note that it is not a question of being actually sentenced to 12 months that triggers this disqualification. It is being convicted of an offence which is punishable by a sentence of 12 months or longer. I do not resile from the fact that, in that sense, it is a tough provision. It is an appropriate condition that is certainly placed on the tenure of members of parliament, and it is not unreasonable to have it placed on members of the ATSIC board. Paragraph (3) reads:

        It simply, explicitly, puts in there that there will be a check and balance—there will be an opportunity for the person to have their day in court if they feel they have been unfairly dealt with. But it is, in my respectful submission, a tougher provision than the one proposed and, in that sense, should be.

        I think that is the reason the board wishes to stay as it is. Having just gone through that process, I consider it to be the minister's responsibility to consult with the board before making that determination. Quite rightly, it is a responsibility of the minister. In turn, it protects the board members from being put in the position of having to make a determination on a fellow member of the board.

The section that we would want to leave is simply the section that deals with consulting the commission. Independent of any view the ATSIC board may have, if a minister takes what, I am sure, would be a regrettable and extreme step in removing a commissioner, it is not unreasonable to provide for this provision. I might add that I am encouraged to hear what the minister has said, that it is his view that such consultation would be appropriate. There is probably, therefore, no need to delay the chamber longer as I am sure the minister is not going to fall in a heap if this provision is retained in the act.

          I have certainly gone over in some length the reasons for the opposition not supporting these provisions.

        I know that the point I am about to make has been made by other senators. These points were made by me in the committee, but I also want to make them here. There is one thing I find objectionable about these provisions and the appointment of the special auditor. These two things are related, as the minister knows full well; we discussed this at some length in the committee when we were discussing the provisions of this bill on Friday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I heard evidence on Friday and I have heard an enormous amount of evidence over the last few days. I was also faxed this afternoon by a lawyer in Darwin the minutes of a meeting held in Darwin to deal with social security matters. That meeting dealt with the effect that the appointment of a special auditor would have on the operations of ATSIC bodies right across Australia. As a result of all this evidence, I am far from satisfied that sufficient attention was given to this matter by the government and the minister, although I concede that it may well have been out of his hands. I was a member of cabinet and government for quite a number of years. Nevertheless, the minister is responsible both in a real sense and in here for the legislation that goes through in respect of Aboriginal affairs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One thing that provides for that concern is the sheer timing of these proposals, the appointment of the special auditor and the minister's own evidence to the committee last Friday. I am sure that he can recall it. That evidence is that he was aware of ATSIC's concerns about having gone through all this accountability stuff which would eventually lead, in the worst possible case, to the appointment of an administrator to replace the board. He had heard from the commissioner as to their concerns about the lack of action that subsequently followed references from
        <break page="2281" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the Fraud Awareness Unit after investigations by the Office of Evaluation and Audit. I think I am accurately paraphrasing his words. He had attempted to pursue this matter and had been unable to get a clear answer as to why none of this had happened.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The concerns I had that the simple physical lapse of time did not allow for it were fairly firmly set in place by the minister's own words. I said last Friday that I felt that, rather than putting out press releases accusing other people of being negligent, the minister and, in a corporate sense, the government were negligent in simply saying, `Can't give you a satisfactory answer to that,' and then rushing off to a press conference to announce that the only solution was to have an administrator, for the administrator to be able to disable the entire board for fraud—it is all up in lights; we are going to make it squeaky clean again—and to appoint a special auditor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In respect of the special auditor, I can tell the minister right here and now, because of the correspondence I have had in the last hour, confusion still reigns supreme. While the lawyers are here—and the appointment of the administrator and the appointment of the special auditor are related, as we acknowledged last Friday—perhaps the minister can explain something that puzzles me.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister issued directions, which I as a non-lawyer have read, to the board under section 12 of this act rather than under the other section—I think it is section 74, from memory—that enables the minister to issue directions in respect of financial matters to the board. The first paragraph of those directions to the board says, from memory—and stop me when I am wrong—that `you will not disburse any further money to anybody until you get a certificate from the special auditor' or words to that effect, and there is a three-week time lapse.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My understanding of that as a non-lawyer is that the clock takes over completely at that point. This may be something the minister can clarify now.

        But—and this is the point I wanted cleared up now and this is a little more complicated—in the instructions for the special auditor, which I have also read and they were widely circulated, there is a reference to a short&amp;hyphen;cut audit for organisations that might need a bit of help to get them across the line. The reason I am asking the question—and I am sure it is obvious to the advisers—is that this is where the problem has occurred, if it has occurred, with the letter that was sent from the ATSIC office.

        From my own non-legal reading of the ATSIC letter, that ATSIC letter seemed to be a totally accurate reflection of the black-letter provisions that I had read in your directions and in the instruction manual that was issued. The instruction manual did have a section in it dealing with an expedited process for the audit—if you like, a quick audit, a preliminary audit—but, nevertheless, the audit, as preliminary as it might be, had to be done; it could not simply be circumvented. That was consistent with what was contained in the letter from the ATSIC office.

The instructions talk about an expedited audit, but the audit, nevertheless, has to happen.

         certain circumstances to step in himself, which is probably what this association in Western Australia was hoping he would do.

There are numerous examples of services essential to indigenous communities which are provided by organisations funded under ATSIC or TSRA programs such as water provisions, sewerage and drainage services, electricity provisions and employment.

         The transitional arrangements provide for essential services, without a history of significant breaches, to be funded immediately. The government expects that ATSIC or TSRA will only propose grants to organisations that are fit and proper. I am sure you would support that.

         Relevant exceptional circumstances may be where, for instance, an organisation provides essential services where there is no alternative provider and where substantial restructuring of the organisation, together with an administrator or grant controller, is agreed. The major focus should remain on the bona fides of the organisation concerned and whether sufficient remedial action to develop an alternate provider or to rectify the providers organisational problems have been put in place by ATSIC or TSRA.

         In regard to those transitional arrangements, in order to minimise the possibility of delay in the payment of grants or loans to organisations which are not in breach of grants conditions, the government decided that transitional arrangements should be put in place to speed up the decisions relating to lower risk organisations. These arrangements provide that those organisations categorised by ATSIC or TSRA as having no current breach of grant conditions and no other significantly adverse history will not be required to be scrutinised by the special auditor for their July grants. I think that clarifies it completely.

I do not think we have put on the record yet what was pointed out to us in the committee hearing. Some 95 per cent of the organisations funded by ATSIC have no problems acquitting grant moneys. Of the remaining five per cent, the majority of the problems are due to inexperience or mismanagement. A few of the five per cent are due to deliberate actions. ATSIC acts on those and has referred them on. We have talked about the level of resourcing and the priority of those agencies to whom they are referred. You do not need to appoint an administrator. You need to do something about the mechanisms that already exist.

        This provision was discussed, I think, at some length last Friday during the committee hearing. It requires section 141, which deals with the review process, to have a look at a more intelligent way of improving regional council representation. As I have said in a number of contributions to the debate so far, I do not think that at the end of the day we are far removed in respect of getting agreement on these matters.

This gives effect to that desire to actually have this requirement written into the act. Indeed, from memory, I can recall that Senator Chamarette—maybe it was Senator Kernot—addressed this same issue last Friday.

        I will speak to the amendments together and they can be voted on separately. They all relate to removing references to prison penalties within the act and substituting the appropriate penalty units. There is no diminution in the range of discretion that is given, but there is a principle being applied and, as many senators will be well aware, this is consistent with a campaign that I have been conducting in relation to the Social Security Act and also in any other bills that come to my attention.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason for that is to support the principle that prison should be a penalty of last resort, and that our commitment to that principle should not be simply nominal. In
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         particular, I believe that we have a case in point, that the offences here are serious ones. There is no question about that. But the question as to what is the most appropriate penalty can be answered with almost complete certainty that prison should not be used as a first resort, which is what is implied, and it has been stated in this way in the act.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It should be up to the court to determine the appropriate penalties. To have penalty units means that there is a range of sanctions and penalties that the court can apply. We should be particularly concerned about this when discussing the ATSIC bills, because recommendation No. 92 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody strongly urges that imprisonment be applied only as a penalty of last resort. I believe we need to have a much stronger response in the area of Aboriginal over&amp;hyphen;representation in prison. We need to look at the way in which prison is used in a coercive and threatening way if we are going to keep putting it as though it has a deterrent effect when criminologists know that that is not the case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that it would be beneficial to remove the reference to imprisonment and put the penalty unit equivalents in support of that principle that we should not be implying prison has some kind of magic value by being mentioned in the act. We should certainly be supporting the idea that the penalty should fit the crime and the offence, and that should be left up to the appropriate court determination. That is why I would urge my colleagues to support these amendments. I already know that I am unlikely to get that support, but I want to just put that on the record.

         —I would like to clarify my position. I understand what Senator Kernot is saying, but my understanding is that using the term `penalty units' does not preclude a prison penalty being given. It actually allows either a prison penalty of the same amount that is in the act or a fine. In my view it takes that connotation of imprisonment as a threat of first resort out of the bill. So to my knowledge it does not change the penalties which may be applied or the discretion that is available to the court. Instead, it starts to produce a climate committed to removing prison as a threat which we have been using over the Aboriginal community for 200 years. That is the reason why I would like to see the measure removed.

As Senator Kernot has pointed out, for offences concerning voting—or, in my belief, even if it is a serious offence—imprisonment is a penalty that should be used to protect the community from danger or to protect an individual from being a danger to himself or herself. It is not to be used simply as a first option in order to enforce a particular discipline. There are many appropriate penalties that may be applied, but we do not exercise them if we can so quickly resort to prison.

On Friday I was very interested to hear Senator Chamarette use, in relation to imprisonment, the rationale of the Aboriginal deaths in custody report. From where I stand and from where any Aboriginal community or organisation stands, the line that Senator Chamarette has taken is that all corruption or misdemeanours that finish up in court will have been committed by Aboriginal people.

In other words, the fine should not be so high that they will not be able to afford to pay it and have to go to prison instead. For fine defaults people are imprisoned for certain amounts of time. We have to look at that angle as well. Using penalty points is not necessarily the end of the matter at all.

        My point stands because it does not matter who is subject to the penalty, whether it be an Aboriginal person or a non-Aboriginal person. I would not want to discriminate. My point is that the punishment should fit the crime and that it is very rare that the punishment of imprisonment actually fits the crime. It has become one of those, I believe, easy recourses that we have used over the years to punish people inappropriately when we could think creatively of better ways of making restitution, such as by counselling, community service and other approaches to restore the

        I have been using this argument in relation to the Social Security Act where it is again of no relevance. I think I raised this measure in relation to a disabilities work supplement allowance where a disabled person was penalised by a prison penalty for failure to give accurate information. I pointed out how ridiculous it was to have even mentioned in legislation of that kind those kinds of draconian penalties because, if there is serious fraud, the Crimes Act is referred to. Prison penalties are within the Crimes Act. So I do not believe that it is necessary to fill this legislation, which is dealing with much less serious crimes and offences, with the same kind of prison terminology as though we were recreating another crimes act.

        I could be in error. I will have to plead feebleness of the brain or something in the last two days of the session if I am in error. My understanding was that the ease of converting one year of imprisonment into 50 penalty units was simply that—that it did not take away that possibility. But I could be wrong and I will seek the guidance of the chamber. In any event I would welcome support from Senator Bob Collins and the Democrats if they were prepared to support at least amendments Nos 2, 5 and 6, on the basis that those amendments are very minor and would not even deserve imprisonment provisions.

         I do not think the argument, nevertheless, needs to be dismissed for that reason. It would be good to get the support on amendments 2, 5 and 6 with the recognition that we are throwing around imprisonment penalties. While I do not necessarily agree with fines as the ideal means, at some point we have to address the hard question of why we so readily imprison people or threaten them with imprisonment when we ought to be seeking other more preferable means that do not damage society as much.

         —That is all right. I just wondered what the position was. If you are, then they are inconsistent with the stance of the previous government. The government's amendments to the penalty provisions are consistent with similar provisions in other Commonwealth legislation. Further, section 4B(2) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act provides that a court may impose a pecuniary penalty on a person even if an offence is expressed, as I said previously, to allow for a term of imprisonment only. It would, therefore, seem that there needs to be consistency between treatment of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal persons who break the law.

        I recognise and I support what you say in relation to keeping Aboriginal people out of prison because of the added penalty that is arrived at, in a sense, by imprisonment.

        I take this opportunity to foreshadow that at the conclusion of the debate on the second reading I will move a motion which, if carried, will require the second bill to be withdrawn and recast. I recognise that that is quite a drastic step, but we take it for an important reason, and that is that the government, by virtue of this bill, breaks a most solemn election promise and seeks to impose a goods and services tax by stealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that at the federal election the then opposition, in the person of the then shadow Treasurer and now Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, made a promise. That promise was: no new taxes. This bill unmistakably and unavoidably imposes new taxes, and it does so on consumers and industry inputs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Both these bills deal with tariff concession orders. The situation under the current law is that when no producer in Australia produces a good, that good can be imported into the country without tariff if it obtains a tariff concession. Where there is negligible manufacture or production of a good in Australia, that good can still be imported because it is held not to compete unfairly with Australian production.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first of these two bills is a bill that we produced when we were in government, that is, the Customs Amendment Bill. The origin of this bill was the innovation statement. The innovation statement was announced by the then Prime Minister in early December last year and was a major industry policy initiative by the previous government. It served a very valuable purpose in promoting Australian industrial production and, in particular, in finding a bridge between the creativeness of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Australian scientists and their ability to commercialise their scientific ideas in Australia rather than seeing them go overseas and be commercialised by foreigners. Regretfully, it appears that the majority of the measures announced in the innovation statement by the former government to enable that to occur will now be set aside. That is not the debate here.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the measures that we announced in the innovation statement was to remove the provision in the customs tariff concession order system in which, if there is only an insignificant producer, the foreign good can come into Australia without a tariff having to be paid. The first of these bills, the Customs Amendment Bill, holds true to that view and removes the market test. It makes other consequential changes. As well, it tightens the project status under the bill to the extent of projects over $120 million and is a bill that was widely hailed at the time it was announced by industry. It is, of course, supported by the opposition. It is a sensible measure and one which I think improves the functioning of the act and does not unfairly expose Australian industry to foreign competition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That brings me to the bill that we oppose, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The `GST by Stealth Bill' would be its better name. This bill is an extraordinary thing. As I said in my introductory remarks, it breaks a solemn election undertaking that there would be no new taxes. This is the third time in the short history of this government that that promise—so soberly and purposefully delivered to the Australian electorate—is to be broken. This bill imposes a three per cent tariff on imports which do not attract duty now or which, because the first bill is passed, by virtue of the passage of the first bill, will not attract duty. That is to say, the cost of those goods imported into Australia in the hands of the importers will cost three per cent more.
       </para>

        If those importers are wholesale companies, then of course one expects they will pass on that cost in the final product and retailers, in turn, will also pass that cost on to consumers. No&amp;hyphen;one imagines that it will not be passed on. Indeed, the wry and cynical view of many

        In this bill the government also proposes to impose a three per cent cost on goods imported directly that go to the consumer market, whether they pass through the hands of an Australian manufacturer as a component in a completed good, or whether they come in and go to the market directly. That three per cent will, of course, be directly passed on. It is idle for the government to pretend it will not. It is wrong for the government to say, `This is not a tax; it is a tariff.' The government knows that, but the government also knows that if it tells the truth on this subject then it will be convicted, in its own terms, of breaking its own election promises.

        The three per cent on imports is, as I have said, an astonishing and amazing thing. Mr Simon Crean, my colleague in the other place, sought from the minister there a list of these consumer goods and met a blank wall. Senator Chris Schacht, my colleague in this place, put a question on notice which led to the minister, Mr Geoff Prosser, providing a list of goods that might fall into the definition of consumer goods; and he has now made that available. I understand, if it has not already been done, it will be provided as an answer to Senator Schacht's question by the minister handling this bill tonight, Senator Parer.

        The advice from Mr Prosser is extraordinary. It does not say that there are 20 consumer items that will be taxed, nor 100, nor 500. There will be 23,000 consumer items which will be taxed under this provision as it now stands and Mr Prosser's advice to my colleague Senator Schacht contains a sample of 2,600 items that have been provided by the minister.

        The impact of these measures on Australian manufacturers will be to push up their costs and, where they supply the domestic market, they will pass those costs on—and that will add to inflation in this country. Where those Australian manufacturers import foreign components that would come in duty free, because of this bill they will have to pay an extra three per cent to import those components. So, if they sell their completed product on the international market, the cost to their customers in that market will reflect the three per cent that the imported component part of their finished good represents. That will also mean a higher cost for them.

        This is the third breach by the government of that undertaking. The first breach occurred when it introduced legislation to wipe out the travel exemption provision for building workers in this country. It pretended that this meant that building workers would be treated the same as everyone else, when, of course, the occupation of a construction worker is different from every other occupation. Construction workers are required to start work at different locations depending on where their construction site is and, when they complete their work, to move to another location. For those reasons the exemption was preferred. Very few other workers are in a similar situation. But it is not for me now to argue the merits or otherwise of it because what nakedly is the case here is that a tax that did not exist before was imposed and that measure raises a new tax.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The second breach concerned the wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles. I will not canvass in this chamber again the debacle of the COAG meeting in which the state premiers rolled the Treasurer to a large extent. But senators will recall the debacle during the last two&amp;hyphen;week break in Senate business and the final decision in which it was announced that $1 billion or more would be raised by pursuing the sales tax on motor vehicles. That caused the New South Wales government to say that its share of the cost was $900 million per annum or $100 per household and that it would seek to retrieve the costs that the Commonwealth had imposed on it by raising taxes.

         million per annum. I think Premier Kennett has announced that he will keep the levy of $100 per annum on households in order to recoup that amount. In my own state of Western Australia the cost is $91 million. The state government says that it will absorb that amount by cutting out programs that exist and finding other efficiencies. It says that because there is an election in February in Western Australia and no government would hike taxes before an election. But if they are returned, you watch them. Taxes will go up and of that there is no doubt. So the second breach of the solemn undertaking concerns the outcome of the premiers conference and the impositions on the states which will cause the states to recover their position through taxes.

         —The Senate tonight is debating two bills cognately, the Customs Amendment Bill 1996 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1996. The first bill is one that the Australian Democrats will support. It is designed to revamp and streamline the administration of the policy by&amp;hyphen;law system and, generally, to reform the tariff concession system to ensure that Australian industries are protected and advanced in their efforts to maintain jobs.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill seeks to remove the market test from the core criteria. It will leave substitutability as the sole criterion for determining whether a concession will be granted. Clearly, this will provide additional protection for Australian manufacturers by making it more difficult for importers to obtain concessions. In particular, it will remove the scope for importers to obtain the concession on the grounds that it will not significantly adversely affect Australian manufacturers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats believe that it is important to remove this test because of the difficulty faced by Australian manufacturers in showing that markets for its goods will be adversely affected. The only core criterion that will thus remain is the substitutability test which will ensure that concessions will be available only where there is no domestic manufacturer of a substitutable good. We agree that the honours for demonstrating that there are no substitutable goods produced in Australia should rest with the prospective importer, not with manufacturers. This part of the bill will remove a considerable burden from industry. Overall, the Democrats believe that this bill introduces changes which, while tightening up the tariff concession system, enhance it and improve the assistance it provides to Australian manufacturers.

         I turn to the second bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1996. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore, said that it was dreadful policy. It was proposed by both the ALP and the coalition during the election campaign and very clearly was designed to raise revenue. But like so many other measures that this government is seeking to introduce in response to pressure from the Treas ury and finance departments, it bears little resemblance to a carefully constructed policy based on what effects the moves to gain revenue will have. It runs counter to many statements that have been made by industry leaders and also by authoritative bodies that have looked at the effectiveness of the tariff concession scheme. In a 1991 inquiry, the Industry Commission found:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No case for terminating a tariff concession system which alleviates taxes on production inputs and on other goods in a wide area of economic activity.
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        That report identified lower consumer prices and higher national income as the result of these tariff concessions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government backed down on the initial proposal to impose a five per cent tariff after a tremendous outcry by Australian industries along with Queensland and Western Australian government backbenchers. Thus, we have the present bill, which is a compromise that really satisfies no-one. The effect will be to apply in substance a three per cent tariff where previously there was none.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As has already been stated by Senator Cook, this is a breach of an election promise. Despite government claims to the contrary, a tariff is, in effect, a tax. The industry minister, the Hon. John Moore, has admitted this. It is a three per cent tax on both consumers and industry and therefore on jobs. Let us make no mistake: if we load additional costs on our manufacturers and industries, it will mean that they will be less competitive in domestic and international markets. Their market share and sales will drop. Jobs will disappear and unemployment will rise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the net effect of this bill which the government has brought to this chamber. One wonders what the policy substance of the bill is. What considerations lead to a bill which will demonstrably mean the loss of Australian jobs? It is also a backdoor GST, as has already been said in this chamber. Ordinary household consumers will be hit by price rises to a large identified raft of imported goods. Some of the items which will be hit include television sets, microwaves, vacuum cleaners, children's toys, playground equipment and neonatal equipment.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Democrats believe that this very clearly is in breach of the government's promise not to introduce a new tax. The Democrats will therefore attempt to exclude this section. I understand that the ALP opposition is considering opposing this section of the bill. The Democrats are of a mind to support the opposition. However, we are also mindful of the government's need to raise revenue. We will therefore suggest to the government that—I have communicated this to the minister, the Hon. John Moore, this morning—if it wishes to separate luxury goods from necessity of life items in the list of consumer items, the Democrats would be quite prepared to accept the three per cent tax on luxury items.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very clear that the sole purpose of this bill is to raise budget savings. Very clearly, it is not good industry policy. I have already said this and I will say it again: to the Australian Democrats, that part of the bill which imposes a three per cent tax on components which go into Australian products for both domestic and international markets and on capital equipment which our industries have to buy is by far the worst part of this bill. It will very clearly and quite demonstrably cost Australian jobs. Once again, one needs to ask: what is the thinking behind this bill put by the government whereby, at a time when our unemployment is trending towards 10 per cent, it is happy to introduce a bill that will hamper our industries, make it harder for them to compete and make it necessary for them to reduce the labour force and throw people onto the scrap heap?

         Australian manufacturing is already suffering. A survey undertaken this month by the Australian Business Chamber and the State Bank of Manufacturers in New South Wales found that for the sixth consecutive quarter the main indicators of production, sales, orders and profitability have weakened and that manufacturers have more than doubled the number of jobs they intend to shed over the next 12 months. Extrapolating the figures for New South Wales nationally, this suggests that overall job losses in manufacturing could be well over 12,000.

          This bill will merely exacerbate the present situation and result in a further reduction in domestic manufacturing and an increase in unemployment. So much for the government's commitment to help small business. It will simply make life more difficult for many of them.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The government may well argue that this measure will not cause excessive pain to Australian industry and that a shift in the dollar has more impact on Australian industry than this change to the tariff concession system. But this simply ignores the fact that every percentage point of input costs matters and that, unlike changes in the value of the dollar, we do have control over whether we introduce this measure. This government is quite intentionally and deliberately introducing a measure that will harm industries and cost jobs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government is concerned to increase revenue. It is talking about the $8 billion black hole. We already know that the $8 billion black hole has been based on the extremely rubbery concept of economic growth forecasts, which have already been shown to improve, and that the $8 billion is no longer $8 billion. Be that as it may, the Democrats understand that the government wishes to increase revenue and reduce the deficit. It is a policy that we do not oppose. But we call on the government to give some thought as to where they cut and to consider the consequences of whichever cuts are imposed.

        I am speaking today to the compliance report on ILO instruments adopted in 1995. Most of the report is in French. There is a background and summary at the front of the terms of Australia's compliance. I think the part of the report that is in French mainly relates to the protocol and the document itself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are some interesting points in the report that we should take note of. A summary of the provisions of the new instruments are outlined, but Australia's position in this regard is perhaps the most interesting. There is recognition of the position of mining in Australia. In relation to safety and health in mines, it points out that the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction over the subject matter addressed by the convention and the recommendation. Point 18 in this report states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following a preliminary examination of law and practice, at least two States (Western Australia and South Australia) consider that there is compliance with the Convention. Legal confirmation of these opinions will be sought before these Governments formulate a view concerning ratification of the Convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two governments that consider that they comply with the convention, but that has to be checked. Point 19 in the report states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Queensland currently has compliance difficulties, but is developing new legislation. The implementation of the coal mining legislation has been delayed, due to the possibility of changes resulting from the recommendations of the Mining Warden's Enquiry into the fatalities at Moura No 2 Mine in August 1994. Queensland should comply with the Convention once the new legislation is developed and brought into force.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the lessons learnt from the dreadful incident at Moura is that it was considered a right of the workers at Moura to have access to information about their own safety. That
        <break page="2298" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        There are indications that the Australian Capital Territory does not think the convention is applicable to it. There are not a great many mines in the ACT. Other jurisdictions have identified compliance problems. The fact is that Western Australia and South Australia consider they comply, the ACT considers it is exempt, Queensland has some problems and the other states and territories have compliance problems. There is still a long way to go in terms of occupational health and safety in mines in Australia.

        It is quite clear that the government has another avenue to consider and I believe it should consider it carefully. Numerous industry groups have in fact called on the government to adopt such a policy. It seems that the government refuses to listen. Questioning tariff reductions remains taboo with the economic rationalists who seem to control the debate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Ironically, in this particular case, the government is introducing a new tariff, but will not consider even temporarily pausing scheduled reductions in existing tariffs even though Australian industry has warned it that the measure is harmful—and that is very obvious—and that some relief in the tariff reduction program—which is not necessary and which is not matched by our trading partners—would improve Australia's economic position immeasurably. The general tariff rate is set to go down from about seven or eight per cent to five per cent on 1 July 1996. The tariff for the textile, clothing and footwear industry is set to go down by two to three per cent on 1 July 1996. The tariff for the motor vehicle industry is set to go down from 25 to 22.5 per cent on 1 January 1997.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have already said, these reductions are not necessary under our WTO obligations. One keeps wondering why the government is persisting in disadvantaging our industries, causing them to lose jobs, while our competitors, our trading partners, are protecting theirs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats are not neo-protectionists, as we have so often been called in this chamber. We accept the need for tariff reductions. We accept the discipline that that imposes on our industries to become more competitive. But we do reject damaging our industries far in excess of what our tariff partners are doing. Why should we disadvantage our industries in their hard struggle to match the competitive
        <break page="2299" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         behaviour of our trading partners? Why should we put our jobs at risk? Why should we destroy our jobs? This is the message that the Democrats are giving the government on this particular legislation, and I trust that the government will desist from pursuing this bill.

         —The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) is designed primarily to increase the concessional tariff rate from zero per cent to three per cent, and for the Greens (WA) this is a somewhat vexatious issue. On one hand, a fairly purist or theoretical position, we see the establishment of concessional rates as working against the establishment of industries in Australia. If any good that is not produced in Australia—or where a similar good is not produced in Australia—is granted a total exemption from tariff, why should any producer wish to locate in Australia, aside from the fact that it is a beautiful country with a good climate and a remnant of a decent social system? Basically, there is no economic incentive to do so, unless the market is big enough to be attractive, and other factors such as proximity to that market, or length of transport lines, provide important competitive factors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The argument is that, if there is a tariff on these goods, it allows the development of industries in these areas. It allows new enterprises to somewhat lower the barriers to market entry. The Greens do not see such a measure as protective, but rather as a mecha nism to promote development. It is our assessment that in many cases where the market is big enough, or where there are other general factors, industry has no reason not to site here, particularly since by siting here it immediately ends the situation under which the concession is offered.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The people for whom it may be important are probably not the mass market suppliers, but rather the specialty market, technical market or niche market suppliers. These may not have a lot of start up capital, but some pre-existing advantage may assist them. They can go to the banks or potential customers with price advantages and try to get support for establishing an industry without having to establish it first, then having to go through measures to knock out the concession, and then trying to build their market.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the largest suppliers, we would have to say that many of them would take advantage of the potential to eliminate the concession and create an advantage, but they do not do so because they have global marketing plans and siting in Australia is not included in them. It is not a purely economic decision—it is strategic decision—to site elsewhere and export tariff free to Australia. This begins to raise some of the `real ekonomic' considerations that create an `on the other hand' point of view.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality is that we live in a highly integrated global economy. Large economic interests map out overall international strategies and have considerable interlocking with other businesses who are either supplier companies or provide alternative markets. Many smaller high&amp;hyphen;tech companies have contracts linking them with a few large corporations or conglomerate buyers, and are effectively satellite companies. For example, many of the new developments or niche products are made for IBM by independent small businesses, although they are highly dependent on IBM. In terms of global corporate strategy, Australia has not been chosen as a national site for development of high value added products, but is rather a producer of raw materials. What higher value industries have arisen here are usually the outcome of development of Australian&amp;hyphen;owned small
        <break page="2300" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         businesses. While there may be computer assembly businesses here, many components are controlled by a few big producers and made elsewhere.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In such a situation, the introduction of a three per cent tariff on goods not produced here is not likely to have much effect on investment patterns at all. Really, it is other factors in most cases that dictate whether companies locate here or not. Most of our high-tech businesses arose because they were started by Australians who wanted to continue to live in their own country. It was not the pre&amp;hyphen;existence of a tariff that encouraged their investment here, although such a tariff may make the job of establishment a bit more easy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the existence or non-existence of a zero concessional tariff rate which would disappear if a company started up here does not make much difference to investment, what other effects does it have? One thing it does do is make inputs to industry a little cheaper. Where it does not damage development of Australian products and promotes imports, this is a good thing, whether the industry produces for export or the domestic market.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also said that it may make consumer costs less, though I think this is a bit more dubious. It could, if the differential is passed on to consumers rather than used to increase profit margins, but the relationship between costs of inputs to manufacturers, costs to distributors or wholesalers and the cost to final consumers is not clear cut. For inputs to a final product, it certainly would have the effect of reducing production costs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In any case, when there are cost increases, sellers do not usually hesitate to pass them on, and a three per cent increase on the import price is not a major increase per unit. Obviously, a $100 import product would cost $103. If it were directly resold to a consumer at a 100 per cent mark&amp;hyphen;up, the consumer would pay $203 rather than $200—though I could not guarantee that this is the way people mark up. This would probably not be large enough to change your decision to buy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Often the mark-up would be higher from import to retail sale. When the increase is on a capital good in manufacture and the in crease is distributed over the goods produced, the effect of the tariff on the price to the consumer ought, in most cases, to be negligible. The issue is mainly of concern for production inputs, where cost differences may be more critical.

        The question then is whether the impact of raising production costs by increasing the tariff on goods when there is no comparable Australian product outweighs the impact of rises in market entry barriers. In that context, it is worth pointing out that over half the tariff concession usage is for capital equipment.

        This is an evolving debate. A few days ago, all parties were apparently debating this internally. At this point, I indicate that the Greens support the opposition's second reading amendment. We believe that this is effectively a kind of consumption tax, generally referred to as a producer tax. In other words, it taxes the other end of the spectrum from retail sales taxes and at a stage prior to Australia's wholesale sales taxes. As such, it not only has the regressive attributes of a consumption tax, adding to the cost of goods to eventual consumers; it also has an adverse impact on exports. It does this, as the amendment says, without actually promoting the development of Australian industry. In fact, by negatively impacting on the cost of domestic production, it works against the development of Australian domestic and export industries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We support the notion that this impost on production should be taken away. There are better and more progressive means of raising revenue. One such means, often put forward by the Greens, is the establishment of a lower limit—a minimum below which company taxes cannot be reduced. Company tax as we know is 36 per cent, yet many companies pay far less—often levels less than five per cent. I sometimes wonder whether some companies expect that the community ought to be paying them. We suggest at least a billion dollars is to be gained by setting the company tax level at 20 per cent and making it a level below which companies cannot further minimise their tax.

         There is also the issue of the loopholes identified by Treasury which are used by the top 80 or so taxpayers. It was foreshadowed that closing these loopholes would bring in over half a billion dollars annually. I suggest that these are areas for increasing revenue which should be used long before we create negative impacts on industry that will flow on in a regressive fashion to consumers.

         What we have pointed out is not simple to explain, because we are not talking about a simple issue. That is why it is clear that there was obviously a lot of discussion within all parties involved. There was certainly the same kind of to&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;fro discussion within our own office when we talked through the issues and looked at the various case scenarios which we have dealt with. I do believe that in this case there is a necessity to go back to the drawing board and look at the basis upon which the legislation was drafted to see what it is hoping to achieve. I think that is really important.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you are setting a tariff or a tax—but in particular a tariff—usually there is an industry basis to it. You would ask, `What are we hoping to achieve from this?' If it is just a revenue measure, you would not use a tariff. You use a tariff for a particular industry outcome, and you make sure that is what the tariff will achieve. In this case, I believe that what has been presented is not as clear as it should be. Therefore, it is misrepresenting itself as a tariff when it is, in fact, a form of consumption tax.

There is a list of items to be taxed which has some 2,600 out of a possible 23,000 or more consumer items on it. It is clearly the case that this is a tax on consumers no matter which way you look at it. This is a move from a government that said it would not introduce a new tax—it made that commitment many times.

         —Earlier this week I had the opportunity to read the Australian Stock Exchange's 1994 share ownership survey. It is the fourth of its kind since 1986. These surveys have been conducted as a means of gauging the extent of share ownership by individual Australians as opposed to share ownership by governments, corporates, institutions and overseas investors. The surveys include data about the characteristics of individual Australian shareholders.

         The survey indicates that share ownership by tertiary graduates more than doubled during the years 1991 to 1994. However, over the same period share ownership by those who had not completed high school halved.

As you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, the period 1991 to 1994 marked the trough of the economic maladministration of the former Labor government under Prime Minister Keating. It is now clear to all Australians that, while the former Labor government was desperately attempting to spend its way out of the quagmire of economic failure, many of the very people it said it was trying to help were in fact being made worse off by those very same efforts.

        There is a lesson in this history for all governments, and there is a billboard size message in this history for all senators. The message I would suggest is this: before parliaments, governments or vested interests in the community seek to defend, isolate or protect the expenditure of taxpayers' funds, particularly by claiming that no program should ever be abolished or altered, they should be entirely sure that the expenditure in question not only is contributing in a positive way to the welfare of our society but also represents the best way of achieving the relevant goal. Some will say this is economic rationalism at its worst, that this is the thinking of bean counters. But, if seeking to get the maximum benefit for those in most need is a definition of economic rationalism, thank heavens for rational economists and may the beans be counted forever.

        The National Commission of Audit report to the government released last week has been summarily dismissed by many, including many Labor and Democrat senators. I find such prejudices unfortunate and a derogation of responsibility to the Australian people. There are many recommendations of the audit commission report which I understand are unpalatable to many in our community. That this should be so is not surprising. The report uncovers many desperately disturbing trends in our society. If it can be said that the recommendations are extreme, it is only because the problems they address are extreme.

I urge all senators to read deep into this report, for, as always, the devil will be in the detail. In this instance the detail is the message of trends and directions of our nation. We, as the elected representatives of all Australians, have this obligation to our people. I hope hysteria and blind prejudice will not obscure this critical assessment.

        Having briefly strayed from the matter of the stock market, I would like to now return to the theme I commenced with. The stock market is an entity much misunderstood. It is not the playground of the young, as some would say, any more than it is the refuge of the greedy. It is rather the interaction of many thousands of ordinary Australians, institutions and companies. All participate in the hope of advancing economic wellbeing; all take risks; all hope for a better future.

        To help Australians understand their stock market, the Australian Stock Exchange, ASX, has taken a particularly committed attitude to educating Australians on the workings of the market. In this role of education, the ASX has developed a number of surprisingly innovative and instructive programs which target specific groups and individuals in our society. I would like to highlight two of these programs this evening.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An education program designed for senior secondary school students utilises a share market game which aims to provide students
        <break page="2304" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         with a practical insight into the workings of the share market. The game is a computer simulation exercise based on the buying and selling of shares. At a national level, approximately 20,000 school students from 900 schools across the nation participate in this activity.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ASX is also using the services of the Internet to provide access to this game. Internet access will be available at the beginning of 1997. Considering the estimation that 71 per cent of schools will have access to the Internet by 1997, the number of students with access to the game should increase substantially. The Stock Exchange is also in the process of developing a public version of the game, following its success in secondary schools. It seems that

       <para first-indent="16">
        The second program I would like to mention this evening is perhaps one of the most enterprising education programs I have ever encountered and an example of a truly commercial entity in this community. Recently the ASX began a trial program to provide public lectures on trains. The pilot program was held in association with the Australian Commuter Education Services Department of the University of Western Sydney. A number of western Sydney evening trains were targeted for the exercise. Lectures on share investment were given to commuters while they were travelling home from work. The pilot course was supported by City Rail and attracted 26 participants.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are many other programs I could bring to the Senate's attention. Public open days, Women's Investment Day, ethnic seminars and in-house lecture series in capital cities and regional and rural locations have all been developed by the ASX to bring the stock market into the homes of average Australians in a manner that makes the one-minute flash on the evening's news comprehensible to more and more Australians.

        The operation of the market is often maligned by many of the senators of the Labor and the Australian Democrat parties. They find the market to be unjust and soulless. They consider it to be important to control market participants and to protect individuals

         from themselves. They may even go so far as to believe that governments have the capacity to judge what is really best for people. With the greatest of respect for all senators who hold these views, I have to say that you are wrong. The assumptions which underlie beliefs such as these are fallacious.

        Given valid information it is the individual who is best placed to make those investment decisions, whether it is with or it is without professional advice. The information sessions conducted by the ASX can serve only to enhance the ability of individuals to make those decisions in a rational manner which will best serve their interests. Regulators and legislators have a major role to play in ensuring potential investors have sufficient access to information. However, we should make sure that we leave the decisions to the individual.
       </para>

        I commend the Stock Exchange on its 1994 survey and its educational and promotional activities. The initiatives undertaken in these areas by the ASX are innovative and could provide a blueprint for other organisations in this country. By investing in the Australian stock market, Australians encourage confidence in our free enterprise system and help to develop and sustain economic growth for today and for the future.

        <break page="2305" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         shared his plans for Australia he would have been rejected, as John Hewson was rejected in 1993.

        But, now that John Howard is in government, he is putting into effect his secret agenda. What we are seeing now is John Howard setting the scene for a reintroduction of the Fightback agenda. John Howard asked the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to start tilling the ground into which the Fightback seedlings will be planted. So the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) drew up the terms of reference for the National Commission of Audit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They drew up terms of reference so that they could get the answers they wanted. They wanted someone to tell them that it is time to slash and burn the public sector, to get rid of 28,000 public servants; they wanted someone to tell them to introduce Medicare co-payments and cut pharmaceutical benefits; to means test the child-care cash rebate; to charge people for the care they need in nursing homes; to dump responsibility for health, education and welfare on the states; to withdraw from public housing, to line the pockets of landlords with rental subsidies but not to build decent public housing; to make university education as inaccessible as it was in the 1950s and 1960s, when John Howard was a student and when you needed well-off parents to be allowed to set foot inside the gates of a university. Every pensioner is now on notice. They wanted someone to tell them to end Labor's indexation of pensions and pensioners have no guarantees past this budget.

        The first phase of the attack on the Australian people will be the August budget. It was foreshadowed yesterday in a document leaked from the Department of Social Security: cuts in family payments; attacks on the long-term unemployed; parenting payments to stop when a child reaches 12; slashing rental assistance—6&amp;half; billion dollars worth of cuts. If they are not the cuts, there will be other cuts. They have exposed the second phase of their attack this week in the National Commission of Audit, which is their long-term plan for an assault on our standard of living in this country. The National Commission of Audit

        Significantly, Mr Costello did not ask the Commission of Audit to consider revenue raising measures. Could it be that he knew his mates in the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry could be relied on to keep up the pressure for a GST and give the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) the opportunity to do a somersault when, if there were a next term for this government, they could bring back the GST?

        We in the left, like our colleagues at ACOSS, are concerned about fair and broadly based tax revenue collection. We are concerned that the burden of taxation is equitably spread. We abhor tax avoidance, but let me place on record once and for all that the left of the Australian Labor Party does not believe that a consumption tax is a fair and equitable way of raising tax revenue. Not one section of the left of the Labor Party in any state have come forward with a proposal for a GST. We do not support a consumption tax.

        Consumption taxes never remain at the level at which they are introduced. We have seen the evidence of other OECD countries. In Denmark, where a consumption tax was introduced at the rate of 10 per cent, the rate
        <break page="2306" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         is now 25 per cent. In Britain it was originally 10 per cent; it is now 17&amp;half; per cent. Sweden went from 11.1 per cent to 25 per cent. On average the initial rate of introduction of a consumption tax is 12.6 per cent and the average rate after a few years is 17.1 per cent.

        The usual reason for pushing the consumption tax line is that consumption taxes minimise tax avoidance. Let us minimise tax avoidance by all means but, for my part, let us look at the people who can afford to contribute more in this country.

Let us look at those 80 people with assets of over $30 million each who have reported taxable incomes of less than $20,000 a year. Some of these people are claiming Austudy for their children. That is the sort of obscenity that we have in this community at present. Let us start with Australia's top 100 tax avoiders, whose names the department already has.

        So as far as I am concerned the Labor Party has a united position of opposition to the main thrust of the National Commission of Audit. Of course there are positive things; I am not denying that. But the main thrust of the proposals is definitely from the extreme economic rationalist viewpoint and clearly reflects that agenda. We have even had the Liberal Party leadership so embarrassed by the proposals being so extreme that they are trying to move away from them. It is significant when we turn to the issue of the GST that the very last piece of legislation considered in this chamber just a few minutes ago, the customs tariff legislation, was a consumption tax where this government, because of their business friends and the pressure from them, moved to thrusting the tax burden onto ordinary people—a classic example of the priorities of this government. When business interests moved on them, they jumped.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that everybody in the Labor Party, as our leader has made clear, is opposed to a consumption tax. The left of the Labor Party,

         the right, the centre and the independent people in the Labor Party all support the position that we have put in two elections opposing it.

         —Tonight I want to address three topics briefly. The first relates to the report of the Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards, which I will be seeking to table later. Secondly, I will be referring to a collection of documents which show the infiltration of right&amp;hyphen;wing elements in gun shows and expositions, and in the organisations of genuine shooters. I will be seeking to table those documents also. They have been cleared with the portfolio holders and the whips to ensure that there is no difficulty with having them tabled. Thirdly, I will advert to the Victorian government's sacking of 21 regional business facilitators. I am not sure whether that sacking has already happened or whether it is to be implemented soon, but it is something of great concern.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards was established in response to a motion of mine which the Senate passed unanimously some 18 months ago. That resolution called on the government to take action on the issue of exploitation of children in child labour situations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The tripartite working party has worked assiduously for more than 12 months under the chairmanship of a former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Duffy, and has produced a report which, I believe, needs to be seriously considered by this government. The recommendations of the report call on the government to take action against core labour standards—which is code for forced labour, child labour and other labour conditions—and to give priority to occurrences in our region.
       </para>
       <break page="2307" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report says that we should and must incorporate issues of social importance, with particular reference to child labour, into our trade negotiations. It suggests that Australian government representatives and our financial institutions should build those issues into the programs and funding that they provide to other countries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The recommendations follow reasonably closely the submission that I made to the tripartite working party. I put forward the view that simply prohibiting the importation of goods made by child labour will not fix the problem; we must address the abject poverty of families in many Third World developing countries, who are virtually compelled either to exploit their children in their own backyards or to sell them into bondage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I proposed that the AusAID agency concerned with overseas aid expenditure allocate a small amount to a pilot project providing primary school facilities in those areas where child labour is rife. I also proposed the expenditure of some money to generate work and income opportunities for parents. The report suggested expenditure of $15 million per annum over four years. I was more modest in my submission, asking for $20 million for the pilot program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have had some discussions on this matter with the Minister for Trade, Mr Tim Fischer. I said that while I recognised that the government is concerned that labour conditions per se are the concern of the ILO and is therefore reluctant to move on these recommendations, surely there is some obligation on civilised nations like Australia to take some note of child labour and the 20 million children estimated to be subjected to extreme exploitation in our region. I said that the government should consider taking some specific action in that area.

I believe it is a matter of public interest to consider that and to suggest to shooters and shooter organisations who are genuine sports people and genuine hunters that they should ensure that these people do not infiltrate their organisations and do not use the occasions where guns are being sold for the propagation of extremist right&amp;hyphen;wing propaganda which, surely in our society, we should avoid.

        He was a quiet and caring man of great compassion who put his views in a quiet and most dignified manner, even though they were often at variance with the prevailing view within the party.

Jack and Beryl's contributions to party debates on matters as diverse as Aboriginal affairs, the environment, social justice and foreign relations have been immense, impressive and generally well ahead of their time. Jack was a committed socialist and pacifist even during World War II, when he served with great distinction in the Air Warning Wireless Company in New Guinea, commonly known as the Coastwatchers, and later in the Z Forces in Singapore and the 2/8 Australian Commando Squadron in Bougainville. He joined the Commandos in Lae in 1942 and fought in the Bougainville campaign right until the end of the war. He was very highly regarded by his comrades at arms in the Commandos as a man of great courage and immense forbearance. As one of his comrades said, `If Jack was on your patrol, you knew your patrol had an edge.' He was also a man of great tolerance and understanding, who was always there for his comrades with an ear to listen and a shoulder to lean on in their moments of great trauma.

         —Tonight I wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to the increasingly responsible role and tasks undertaken by trustees of all the superannuation funds in Australia. The total retirement savings of all Australians has recently been estimated at $240 billion. This is predicted to grow to $2,000 billion by the year 2020. There are about 115,000 superannuation funds in Australia, of which 110,000 are small private funds with less than five members. These
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          small funds are called the mums and dads schemes.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Insurance and Superannuation Commission estimates that some 180,000 trustees of those funds are so small that they are excluded from a lot of the detailed compliance requirements under the SIS legislation—about 25,000 trustees of the remaining 5,000 funds. However, the industry is dominated by a small number of very large funds; the top one per cent account for more than 83 per cent of all superannuation fund assets, and 97 per cent of members.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Trustees are controlling increasing proportions of our national wealth, and their decisions can have a far&amp;hyphen;reaching impact on investment in Australia. Superannuation funds control 25 per cent of equities listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and a six&amp;hyphen;fold increase is predicted over the decade of the 1990s. The import of the decisions made by the trustees of these funds on resource and infrastructure developments in our country, for example, is enormous.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I wish to take this opportunity of referring to some research undertaken by Dr Oldsberg, an economic sociologist and Director of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees. Dr Oldsberg has just completed a major research of trustees' duties, responsibilities and levels of expertise.
       </para>

        Using a sample of 550 trustees representing a cross&amp;hyphen;section of various types of funds, she has found that: trustees are generally young; 40 per cent are under 40, mostly male; only 13 per cent are women and are usually a trustee of just one fund—about 75 per cent; trustees are extremely committed to their task—and that is the issue I want to emphasise tonight—and trustees are either nominated and appointed or elected to their board positions. The vast majority of them are not paid, and perform their duties in an honorary capacity. Rarely are trustees relieved of other duties to attend to their trustee responsibilities. The duties and responsibilities of these trustees are increasing. Their liabilities under the new Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act are becoming more onerous and there is mounting concern among some trustees about the difficulties of meeting this

        She also found that trustees are working hard to develop their expertise to meet the challenges of growing and increasingly complex funds. The vast majority of trustees have done some specialised trustee education and training. Sixty per cent of trustee boards have a special allocation for trustee education and training.

        The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees research reveals that despite the complexities of superannuation and the new demands of managing the funds, the trustees have an exceptional level of commitment and confidence in being a trustee. They have a personal commitment both to ensure that the funds perform as well as possible and thereby enhance members' retirement benefits and to safeguard members' retirement savings.

        Trustees must be ever conscious of their responsibilities. They have not only a corporate but, unlike company directors, a personal responsibility. If they manage their funds prudently in accordance with the requirements of the SIS Act, they will have gone a long way to ensuring that the risk of fraud in their fund has been minimised and they will have discharged their responsibilities according to the act.

        But a system whereby there is continual monitoring of funds and constant challenging of the effectiveness of the funds' controls and procedures is essential. They need to operate according to risk management procedures, maintain effective control and supervise vulnerable areas very closely. The responsibility for detecting and preventing frauds rests solely with trustees. They cannot delegate that responsibility, but they can take expert advice. For example, where an external administrator has been appointed, trustees must have foolproof assurance that this responsibility can be carried out within the context of the fund's internal controls.

         Dr Oldsberg's research has found that, as the funds grow larger and member accounts become more substantial, trustees are beginning to adopt a more pro&amp;hyphen;active approach. They are moving from being fund administra tors to becoming active fund managers. They are now more actively searching for investments which will provide the greatest rate of growth for fund members commensurate with prudential safeguards. They are increasingly choosing equity ownership of Australian companies. They channel about 40 per cent of their assets into local equities. These investments will continue to have an enormous benefit in fostering the growth, development and efficiency of our economy.

        There is an increasing interest in issues of board structures and governance, remuneration and performance of company senior management, the relationship of executive and independent directors on boards. But, as the Trustee of the Year, Ross Greenwood says, the trustee's role is easy while the fund is growing. However, where there is a contraction of funds, some trustees around may be ill&amp;hyphen;equipped to handle these situations. In this context training is absolutely essential. In this context the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees is setting up a national program of performance based training workshops for trustees, and I commend them on this particular initiative.
