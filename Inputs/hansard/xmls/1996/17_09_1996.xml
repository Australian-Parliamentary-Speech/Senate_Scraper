The situation so far as this measure is concerned, being one of a multitude of measures that the government has taken in the budget to assist small business and lower and middle income Australians, is no different in that concept from any other part of the taxation law.

Over the last few days housing affordability results and figures from the Federal Office of Small Business have shown how home buyers and small business are benefiting from lower interest rates. The government's budget aims to increase national savings and cut Labor's legacy of debt to take pressure off interest rates and to help all these groups and encourage growth. Despite this, Labor is proposing to sabotage the plans to reduce the debt it created—more than $7 billion. What will be the consequences if its proposals succeed?

         —I welcome the question from the honourable senator because it's more good news for Australia, and a further demonstration of good government in effect. Yesterday, the Real Estate Institute of Australia released figures showing that Australians on average are now spending 28 per cent of their
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          household income on home loan repayments compared with 30 per cent this time last year. Furthermore, last week's housing finance figures showed that the number of new loans approved in July leapt by 16 per cent. So housing affordability has improved and the home loan take&amp;hyphen;up rate has increased. Australian home owners and would&amp;hyphen;be home owners are benefiting under a lower interest rate policy. That is the first point.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second point is that having reduced interest rates is good for small business and small business will also applaud the policies of this government. The Federal Office of Small Business reported on Friday that small businesses across the nation are expected to save around $110 million through cuts in variable interest rates alone. Madam President, you and all honourable senators would know that nothing is more important to small business than keeping interest rates low. It provides the capacity to grow, make profit and employ more Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I remind honourable senators that the first official reduction in interest rates in three years came after this government got into office and the trends are therefore positive. The trends are positive because we are the first government that has been prepared to take hold of public expenditure, reduce it and take pressure off interest rates. Therefore, small business and home owners can be confident about the future. It is interesting to see that today's ABARE report picks up the same sentiment.

         the good work that is being done by this government. I simply draw the opposition's attention to the sentiments of people such as Ian Salmon of the Business Council of Australia who said, `You can be pretty sure that if the savings side of the budget does not get up, that's going to put pressure on interest rates.' In other words, if you vote down our budget, that puts pressure on interest rates to go up. The same sentiment was expressed by the National Farmers Federation; not surprisingly by the Real Estate Institute; and also the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

          Telecommunications Act there is a power for ministerial direction and, of course, that can be used and abused in a variety of ways. There were two high watermarks of political interference. One was a few years ago when it was necessary for Telstra to have all its press releases approved by the office of the minister for communications. But even in more sinister fashion was the other occasion back before the May 1995 budget when you had Mr Keating essentially stockwhipping Mr Blount into handing over a special dividend of an extra $100 million a year for two years on top of their ordinary dividend, together with the early repayment.

        So the risk of political interference is a very serious one. The proper approach to take is to ensure that you have transparent rules by which all carriers must play. I think that is a widely accepted rationale for privatisation but I did not realise quite how widely accepted it was until I read the transcript of the Townsville hearings of the Senate Telstra inquiry. Senators will remember there were only two witnesses interviewed there and that it cost about $25,000 to go there, which is about $3.34 per second.

        Senator Carr has finally realised that you ought to allow businesses such as Telstra to operate commercially, not to have that political interference and to be as efficient as possible. He knows the benefits of efficiency, and I am delighted to welcome him aboard the cart. I think he deserves the commendation of the Senate for the approach that he has taken. I just hope that he will have more success in caucus, that he will be able to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the stance that his own party has taken and that he will take the opportunity to explain to Mr Beazley and Senator Schacht just precisely why this is the sensible approach to take.

It means choice as to whether they provide child care themselves, whether they provide it through the informal sector, whether they provide it through family day care, whether they need out of school hours care or holiday care, or whether they choose to go down what has been the high cost option of the publicly funded community child&amp;hyphen;care area. In all these areas, we are giving families choice.

        I notice that the opposition is only prepared to have a slash and burn where there are people on higher incomes who are being affected by the government's actions. We have made it very clear that battlers are the ones who deserve the greatest attention, support and sympathy from the government. It is battling families that were our prime targets for assistance through our family tax initiatives, which were not just for families where a parent stayed at home, but also where there was any dependent child. So in a very real sense, we were looking after families.

        We were looking after people with work and family responsibilities through the industrial relations reforms which will give greater opportunity for flexibility of hours, which will give greater opportunities for permanent part&amp;hyphen;time work, which many of the unionists on the other side of the chamber would have spent some of their years making more difficult for women. Women trade unionists have told me over and over again of the lack of sympathy they have encountered in trying to make arrangements for more flexible working arrangements to deal with family responsibilities.

They may be young married women in relationships where there are two incomes; they may choose to stay at home for a little while when their children are babies and then they may be a one income family.

        The brief provided by the minister for health says that under current arrangements it is the state and territory governments which determine the total amount of funds available to the pubic hospital system, the budgets for individual hospitals and the arrangements—for example, casemix—under which they are paid, the number and the location of hospitals, and the range of services available at each hospital.

        As you would realise, the Commonwealth makes a substantial contribution through hospital funding grants to the states and also contributes indirectly through financial assistance grants. Under the current funding arrangements, the total Commonwealth HFGs to the states rose from $3,080 million in 1988&amp;hyphen;89 to $3,933 million in 1992&amp;hyphen;93.

The $75 million cost shifting adjustment in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 reflects the failure of states to comply with an agreement by health ministers back in June last year to desist from further cost shifting.

         —I find it somewhat strange that it is being suggested that protests on human rights issues in China should be delivered to the Dalai Lama. He is here in Australia as a respected religious leader and we welcome him to Australia. Mr Downer has met with him. Mr Howard has said on the record that, subject to his program, he is likely to meet with him also. Therefore, the answer that I gave a moment ago stands. I am a bit disappointment at the way the Labor Party has sought to politicise this visit, a la statements from Mr Brereton who said that Mr Howard should meet with the Dalai Lama and apologise, a la Mr Beazley's attempt to get into the act today and Senator Brown's attempt as well.

There has been no disproportionate cut in relation to sport. In fact, as you would know, Senator, and no doubt applaud, the Olympic program has been fully maintained. In what remains, the emphasis is on programs delivered to the young and delivered in the form of community sports. In many ways that is the distinction between the emphasis in our program and that program that was put down by the previous Labor government.

        There is an attempt by some people to create the impression that full fee&amp;hyphen;paying places is about reducing the number of Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;funded places and, equally, to say that it is about reserving 25 per cent of those places for the so&amp;hyphen;called rich. These assertions are completely false. A fee place at a university will be over and above, not instead of, Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;funded places. Next year the government aims to provide 358,000 undergraduate places at Australian universities. We aim to have 6,000 more undergraduate places than the number of places provided this year. In 1998 we want the number of undergraduate places to rise to 364,000. So it is certainly our intention to not only maintain the number of undergraduate places but to increase it. There is no desire on this government's part to reduce the number of government&amp;hyphen;funded undergraduate places—a point that was made in this place the other day.

We have an opposition, which used to be the government, which was the government for the yuppies and the top end of town. What we now have is an opposition that is for the well&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;do in Australia and with a total lack of regard for the battlers. Why have they got a total lack of regard for the battlers? I think Mike Steketee put it pretty accurately after the last election when he pointed out that Labor's vote dropped dramatically among households with incomes less than $20,000 while it did not fall much at all among the households with incomes of $50,000 to $60,000. That is why the battlers have abandoned you—and there was a very good cause for it. Why do you think the battlers found very great value in the proposals that we made at the election for family tax initiatives, for health rebates, et cetera? I could go on and on.

        What happens when the government brings down its budget? We hear day after day in here about how the opposition does not like this measure, is going to block that measure, is going to shuffle it off to a committee here and delay it. We have seen that happening with the superannuation charge on high income earners from Senator Sherry. We are seeing the same sort of opposition from the Labor Party over superannuation being included in the assets test for those who are over 55. Of course, the situation is that that is something which the Labor Party had, but they changed their minds and in 1993 left the

        The respected financial adviser Daryl Dixon said only last Sunday about the current system that the losers have been the ordinary taxpayers subsidising welfare payments to people with substantial assets. That is what we have attempted to deal with in this budget. We have tried to make a complex social security system simpler and easier to understand, but we have tried to deal with the unfairnesses in the system whereby the battlers have been paying for people who could and should be expected, first of all, to draw on their own resources—that is, people who are unemployed and have substantial resources, people who have superannuation and are facing early retirement who should be providing income from those rollover funds, and the elderly who have received compensation payments at law late in life. We are expecting them to make better provision for themselves.

        I wonder if we may not have to rename some of these chicken diseases because they seem to be infecting the government. Perhaps it is mad chook disease, and that is where the problem lies.

        I want to underline the fact that the government is confused about this issue, although I ought not perhaps be too hard on Senator Parer because he is trying to give answers for a minister who himself is confused so it must be very difficult to do that. The problem is that the minister seems to be having a bob not just two ways but every way possible.

         yesterday, despite the fact that the minister has instigated two inquiries himself—we have had the NAIRN inquiry and also a Senate inquiry—the minister seems to be pre-empting those inquiries, that is, if the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        I wish the minister had been at the various Senate hearings we have had where I have become totally convinced that we certainly will be putting not only our chicken meat industry at risk but also significant numbers and species of our Australian native birds at risk. It is quite clear that the assessment done by AQIS is based on wrong suppositions and bad science and in fact misinterprets the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         results of the only tests done, which were done in Great Britain, in its own study.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is quite clear that our own industry is at great risk from these imports both from an environmental point of view and from an economic point of view. That is why it is essential that the minister does authorise an environmental impact study before any decision is made. But, if the minister representing the minister for primary industries is confused, I understand that because the minister for primary industries seems himself to be very confused. One day he is supporting an inquiry; the next day he is telling us he has already made the decision. So somewhere along the line somebody had better either correct the minister or correct the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        newspaper so that the rest of us actually know what is going on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Just to put the record straight: in a letter dated 28 August 1996 from the minister to Mrs Marven of the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, the minister quite clearly indicates that he will not be proceeding with an EIS. More confusion, more problems for our own industry and more decisions that seem to be taken in a vacuum. I trust that, in my taking note of this answer, the Senate will also note the problems in this area and the confusion of the government and will press for the minister to do what he actually promised during the election campaign to do.

        Why does he do it? I will tell you why. There are a few inescapable truths for the minister for primary industries on this issue. It is a fact that the minister for primary industries, during the period of the election campaign when this was a red&amp;hyphen;hot issue—this industry employs thousands of Australians in full-time and part-time jobs—promised the industry in writing that he would not take this decision that he has in fact taken. All that is being worked out now are the protocols. The decision is taken. John Anderson says, `Competition policy; you've got to wear it. Competition policy is a good thing. Farmers are just going to have to wake up to this.'

        What did he do? He told the chicken industry in writing that he would not do this until after the Nairn inquiry had been completed and the government had fully implemented its recommendations—not just the inquiry, but until the government had actually implemented its recommendations, probably a year away. He also promised in writing to the chicken industry a full EIS. He has failed to deliver on both.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bob Collins today, relating to funding for the Community Development Employment Projects program of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        I bring to the Senate's attention the fact that in the area of the community development employment program, the CDEP, this government will be spending $337 million more in our first four years than Labor did in its last four years. If Senator Bob Collins is trying to say that this government is attacking the employment and training opportunities of Aboriginal people, then he had better think again. He had better have a good look at the budget because, in relation to education and training accounts, we have around $344 which will be spent in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, with a total of $1.3 billion over the next four years—a real increase of 12 per cent compared to the last four years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are four major programs which will be affected. The largest is Abstudy, essentially the equivalent of Austudy, which provides financial support to secondary and tertiary indigenous students—and that will allow $542 million over the next four years in the form of living allowances, assistance with fees and other educational expenses. There is the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, which provides funding of $419 million over four years to educational institutions to improve opportunities and outcomes for indigenous students. This also includes additional funding of $143 million before the efficiency dividend over the four years from 1995&amp;hyphen;96 provided in response to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         a 1994 review of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, which found that indigenous people are the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. We have real programs with real increases in expenditure that deal with the training of Aboriginal people.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have the Aboriginal direct assistance program, which provides educational support such as homework centres or tutorial assistance. For this program, $233 million will be provided over the next four years. ATSIC's major program is the community development employment project, with funding of $353 million in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. There are currently 262 communities involved in such projects, with a total of approximately 28,000 participants. CDEP participant numbers have been quarantined in the budget, so no CDEP jobs are at risk and no current projects are in jeopardy as a result of budget decisions. Additionally, current and future allocations provide some capacity for natural growth of around 50 new participants per month.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If Senator Collins is trying to say that there has been a cut in funding, a cut in the government's assistance towards Aboriginal training and employment, then he is mistaken. And he is not only mistaken; he is misleading the Senate in saying so because those figures are from the budget announced in August this year. This government is totally committed to the training of young Aboriginal people; it is totally committed to providing maximum employment for Aboriginal people. In fact, our policy of reducing the budget deficit is in turn going to offer more job opportunities to Aboriginal people.

         With the native title committee I visited a training facility not far from the Marandoo mine site where Hammersley Iron was providing on the job training for Aboriginal people. That training program was indeed successful, and plant operators from the program were then eligible to go on and gain employment with annual earnings of somewhere between $35,000 and $50,000 a year. That was brought about by economic growth from the development of a new mine. That is what this government is going to do: it is going to create an economic climate where all Austral ians will benefit, where all Australians will have more employment opportunities. But in the meantime we have that increased expenditure. For Senator Collins to say that we are cutting back on that is just not right and he ought to have another look at those budget figures.

        The Delegation was struck by the overwhelming support it encountered for the Dalai Lama. This appeared to be pervasive in Lhasa and its environs, at least.

The public display of this support, and Chinese tolerance of that display, greatly surprised the Delegation.
