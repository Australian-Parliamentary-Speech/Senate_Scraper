       The ANZACS at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACS of 1915&amp;hyphen;18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever.

          â€”I thank the chamber for the indulgence. The Select Committee on Certain Land Fund Matters presented its final report to the Senate on 30 November last year and therefore ceases to exist. Honourable senators will remember that I had the honour of chairing that committee. After the tabling of that report, supplementary correspondence dated 27 December 1995 was received from Rosemary O'Grady which I believe, as the former chairman of that committee, should be tabled.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In so doing, I would like to point out that the committee did in fact receive a submission from Ms O'Grady during the course of its inquiry. That submission, which was received as evidence in the inquiry and authorised for publication, provoked a response from the Kimberley Land Council. The Kimberley Land Council submission, which was also received as evidence to the inquiry and authorised for publication, was provided to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Ms O'Grady on the understanding that, as the points of view of both parties were on the public record and as the matters were not germane to the committee's inquiry, the committee did not intend to deal with the matters raised any further.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Ms O'Grady was overseas at the time the committee communicated its decision to her and was not therefore in a position to respond immediately. The supplementary correspondence which I am tabling today is Ms O'Grady's response to the KLC submission. Notwithstanding the committee's decision not to take the matter further, the principle of fairness requires Ms O'Grady's rebuttal of assertions made by the Kimberley Land Council to be placed on the public record. During the time of the election, I indicated to Ms O'Grady that I would take the first appropriate occasion to table this correspondence. I further indicated to her that this would conclude the matter, as I do not intend to table any further correspondence either from her or from the Kimberley Land Council.

         The purpose of this motion is to require the tabling, by the Minister representing the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General in this chamber, of the current final draft classification guidelines for film and video. It also, inter alia, calls upon the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, to ascertain in writing from FACTS, the ABC and the SBS details of recent steps taken by them concerning their television codes of practice and to table these details before the Senate. The parliament, I believe, is entitled to these documents; it is particularly entitled to these documents post the Port Arthur massacre and the widespread view currently throughout the community that media violence has significant effects on behaviour patterns.

          Had the Port Arthur massacre not occurred, I would still believe that the final draft guide lines for the classification of films and videos should be tabled in the parliaments prior to their being finally determined by the censorship ministers of the Commonwealth and the states. The reason that I say that is that we are in a totally different ball game at the present moment.

         Last year this parliament passed a bill known as the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1995. It was a bill to provide a system whereby there would be a uniform approach to these matters of classification throughout the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, sometimes in these uniform approaches, the bureaucrats are the ones who seem to have the say. In this particular case, I believe that that is the situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that it is absolutely essential that the public and the parliament do have access to this final draft so that the public can have an input. Once the censorship ministers decide the issue, then the parliament has no say at all. They are not disallowable instruments, and there is no say by the parliament in respect of this very vital matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a widespread view that videos reinforce and engender violent attitudes which, of course, trigger violent actions. Clearly, because of other influential variables, it is impossible to prove that the viewing of a particular video has been the direct and sole cause of the commission of a particular crime.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course there are other influential variablesâ€”and we all know that. There are other factors, including upbringing and treatment of the person concerned, and other aspects in the media as wellâ€”not to mention, of course, some of the sort of rap music that is part of the subculture at the present moment. That music, if you listen to itâ€”and if you can hear it to understand itâ€”has significant aggressive messages which are absorbed by the listener, mostly the younger listeners.

         But there is a general and well accepted view that the media does play a significant role in behavioural patterns.

         I do not think that would come as a surprise to anybody.

         The draft guidelines were sent out for public consultation in October last year. There were a considerable number of responses.

         I do not think that we should act in a manner which is based on pure emotion. I think that there has to be a very informed and guided approach to these particular matters. It is now past the time when people can say that adults should be free to read and see what they like.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you have a look at the legislation that was passedâ€”I let it goâ€”it did say that the principle was that adults should be free to see, hear and read what they choose provided that children are protected from material that may be harmful to them and that everybody is afforded protection from unsolicited exposure to material that they consider offensive. That is the sort of principle that was established in 1973. As this document said and as our report from the Joint Select Committee on Video Material said at page 260:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         These principles have been supported by all governments since 1973. But when the principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose was originally stated as public policy, the number of video tapes entering Australia was insignificant and there was not the widespread availability of objectionable video publications as exists today as the result of the flood of these materials into Australia. This principle is often stated but not
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          adhered to in practice since adults are not free to view video material depicting, inter alia, child pornography, bestiality and sexually explicit violent pornography as these are banned under censorship guidelines and prohibited from entering Australia under customs regulations.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para>
         By the way, this is no longer the case. The document continued:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose is dependent upon the pornographersâ€”and I interpolate, the producers of violent videosâ€”and their claimed right to freedom of expression, and the balancing of this claimed right against requirements fundamental to the common good which legislators are bound to uphold. The issue now is not whether there should be censorship, as was the case in 1973 when the principle was first stated as public policy but, in fact, where to draw the line.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have the feeling that the public of Australia consider that the line is not adequately drawn and that there is a need to tighten up. We all become desensitised. As a member of the committee, along with Senator Margaret Reynolds and Senator John Tierney, the deputy chair, I know that you do become desensitised. You can watch extremely violent videos and extremely pornographic videos and, bearing in mind the guidelines, you think: should they go into that particular classification or should they go into that category? Of course, that is not how people watch videos. We all become desensitised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I just wonder whether the public are satisfied with what is going on now because the director of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, Mr John Dickie, stated of the draft guidelines that they would have little practical effect. I believe that we need to have the final draft guidelines before us and we do need an explanation, hopefully through a re&amp;hyphen;established committee of which Senator Margaret Reynolds was the former chair and Senator Tierney the deputy. I hope we can have an explanation to the public through this committee so that we all know where we are going.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I can understand that there may be some reluctance on the part of the government or the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to provide those final draft guidelines to us based on the agreement that there is between the Commonwealth and states in respect of censorship. I have read
         <break page="596" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that agreement. I cannot see anything in there which would absolve the Commonwealth government from its obligations to the public through this parliament. I believe there is nothing in there that absolves the government of that obligation. I do ask that the Senate accept this motion so that we can go forward on the bipartisan approach that we have had on these very, very important matters.

The OFLC advises that the draft guidelines are currently under consideration by the Standing Committee of Attorneys&amp;hyphen;General. The policy of that committee is that such drafts are confidential. The draft is based on an earlier draft that was widely distributed for public comment. The draft was considered at the March meeting of SCAG, but was not finalised due to the need for further policy consideration relating to the ACT proposal concerning an E classification for nonviolent erotica. The draft is also currently the subject of out of session correspondence between state Attorneys&amp;hyphen;General and will go to the July meeting of SCAG.

         â€”Three months ago the now government would have been arguing very strenuously for the tabling of these documents. We as a government probably would have sat there and said, `With good reason,' because what we have had here is a process which has gone on for quite some time: a process where the drafts of the past have been made widely available to all and sundry. We would not have argued. It would not have been all that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          difficult to have tabled these documents. I was looking through some of the documents in my office this morning to see if we had them to table today, Senator Harradine, but unfortunately we do not have them. We think this is a reasonable request. It is reasonable for us and, of course, we support Senator Harradine's motion before this chamber.

        I am afraid to say that what we are seeing here is another example of how the government has had problems in transition to government. They have taken this approach in respect to these documents, which reflects a stubbornness which really is not justified. It is a stubbornness which is, in a sense, born of arrogance. Having won an election, they are now over there and they think, as Senator Vanstone said the other day, `We will only give you what we want to give you.' The discarding of all grounds of reasonableness, all grounds of public interest and all grounds of fairness is the attitude that I think has been taken in respect of these documents.

        We know there is a division on the other side between the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and Senators Hill and Alston. We know that Senators Hill and Alston have been a bit more flexible than the Attorney. But the message obviously has not got through to the executive that the Senate is a function of government, is an equal partner in government. A lot of those arguments that the opposition ran for the last 13 years are probably relevant with respect to this.

        In supporting Senator Harradine's motion this morning, let me place on the record that in doing so we do not in any sense agree with all the arguments he might put forward in respect of censorship, nor would he expect us to take that position. For instance, we on this side of the parliament think there is a pretty good system in place. From time to time it does make mistakes. The recent episode with the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hustler
        </emphasis>
        magazine is an instance where the system made a mistake. It has been acknowledged by the Chief Censor that a mistake was made in that regard. But we think we have in place a system which balances fairly well the interests of all.

        Going back to these documents, it was interesting, as I said, when going through some of the paperwork this morning, to compare the attitude taken today with the attitude that has been taken with respect to guidelines for classification of films and videos and the drafting process in the past. One document I was able to find was a document from John Dickie, the Chief Censor, dated 29 September 1995. He sent out to colleagues and, I presume, state jurisdictions and ministers, the then stage of the draft documents. He talked about how the Office of Film and Literature Classification had obtained an independent analysis on the readability of the current guidelines from Dr Judith Bowie. He then talked about the next step of making those draft documents widely available for public comment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If you think about it seriously, when you add up the number of state jurisdictions, the number of officials and authorities that might have these documents now, you could probably argue there were 100,000 or so copies of them around the country. It is not just the ministers in every state who have got them, it is the bureaucrats in every state. It is not just senior bureaucrats in every state, it is junior ones as well. It is an enormous contradiction to argue they can have them when people elected to the federal parliament, to the Senate, cannot have access to those documents. So we see a contradiction and an inconsistency there.

        We defend the process that involved Professor Peter Sheehan giving an assessment and advice to the ministerial council, SCAG. We defend the process that has taken place so far. But we argue there is no conceivably good, rational reason to deny the Senate access to these documents now. As I said, we do so with the knowledge that we do not agree with Senator Harradine on a lot of his attitudes here, although we do agree with his concerns. I think he knows me well enough to know
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that I do share some of his concerns. But we also support this motion. In doing so, we send a message to the government: don't suffer amnesia on your way across the chamber. Don't forget all those arguments that you used to run when you were on this side. You not only used to run them but you used to get so terribly emotional about them. You used to ensure that the Senate would sit on, hour after hour, discussing matters that are now irrelevant to you, but which were of such deep constitutional concern in those days.

        If you look at our record on the production of documents, there were very few circumstances in which we did not produce documents. In those circumstances, there was a system in place for most of those documents to be considered by representatives on either side.

We would not support making these guidelines a disallowable instrument within the parliament, because once that occurred you would have an ever increasing cycle of the lowest common denominator, as various senators or House of Representatives members outdid each other to curry favour with a particular sectional interest group on either side of the censorship debate in the community. So we would not support those guidelines, after the consultative process with the community, once approved by the Standing Committee of Attorneys&amp;hyphen;General, being a disallowable instrument, if that is the final point you wish to achieve.

        I say to Senator Harradine: you and I probably in some areas of the censorship debate may have, to say the least, a marginal difference of opinion about what should or should not be allowed in some areas. But one area on which we have always agreed is the issue of the depiction of violence. One reason that I have risen to support Senator Harradine's motion is that in paragraph (c) he notes the decision by the television stations not to proceed with the televising of violent movies in the week or so after the terrible events at Port Arthur.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As shadow minister for communications, I have, like you Senator Harradine, noted that decision. I have already written to the Commonwealth Chief Censor, Mr Dickie, asking him to discuss with the television stations their decision not to show these movies in the weeks after Port Arthur because a program director said it would not be in good taste. If it was not in good taste in the week after Port Arthur it is not in good taste full stop. If they have been arguing with Mr Dickie to get certain classifications to show those movies when they think they ought to be shown, and now they say, `There are circumstances in the community when we do not want to bring criticism on ourselves or look too callous or whatever so we are going to take them off', it is only appropriate that Mr Dickie have a serious discussion with them about those programs full stop.

        style. My main concernâ€”it is a concern I have always expressed in this area; I agree with Senator Harradineâ€”is that those movies have an indiscriminate attitude towards the use of guns and violence. In those movies the characters, both the good and the bad, shoot off 10,000 rounds of ammunition and no-one seems to get wounded or hit other

         than in a nice way. You do not see lots of blood and gore. You do not see the awful consequences of someone being machine&amp;hyphen;gunned. You just see a body fall over. They are almost like cartoon characters.

        I believe that if you are going to depict what these guns do and that level of violence, people have to see that the consequences of that are not a nice thing that you can just avoid. It appears to be good fun; you can just spray these bullets around. That is an important issue. Those types of movies are of most concern to meâ€”what I call the `
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Rambo'
        </emphasis>

       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the movies, I understand, that was taken off because it was not considered to be in good taste was a well-known American movie called
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Goodfellows
        </emphasis>
        . The story was based on actual events that took place within organised crime in New York in the 1960s and 1970s. It certainly had terribly violent scenes in itâ€”I saw the movieâ€”but you saw the consequences of the violence. You were easily able to understand that the men involved were evil, they were bad. The violence they were involved in was very, very nasty. I think that movie is different from what I call the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Rambo
        </emphasis>

         I note in America in the last couple of years the use of the so-called V chip, a decision of the US Congress to put into every television produced in America now a microchip that enables the owner of the set, when the classification of a movie or program is given, to automatically stop that program from being broadcast on their television set.

         Mr Dickie, as Chief Censor, and the Film and Literature Board of Review often get strongly abused for the fact that they have separated violence from erotica.

When I was debating on radio in Adelaide last Sunday night with representatives of the Festival of Light, we agreed that the issue of violence had to be dealt with. We all had concerns.

I believe the film and classification office has done an excellent job in separating those issues, and I support them in that area.

         I do not believe you can say that the dreadful events in Port Arthur are a result of somebody watching a non&amp;hyphen;violent erotic video. That person may have had access to violent videos but, even then, one has to be very careful about saying that this is the thing that made the person who is now being chargedâ€”the perpetrator of those eventsâ€”do those things. In the history of civilisation, people were committing terrible crimes of violence against others long before they had access to written, film or video material. We should keep that in balance.

The tragic events in Port Arthur have sensitised the whole communityâ€”and we are no exceptionâ€”to the culture of violence that is promoted in various ways in our community. In supporting Senator Harradine's motion, we in no way resile from the statements we have made supporting stricter gun controls, and we trust that the meeting of federal and state ministers on Friday will result finally in a comprehensive scheme. If not, the Democrats will be pushing for a referendum to give the Commonwealth adequate powers.

        In doing that, we are not saying that that is the only remedy for tragic events such as the one that happened in Port Arthur.

        In supporting Senator Harradine's motion, we do not necessarily telegraph what our final decision will be on the various classifications or which material should or should not be allowed to be shown either on television or in theatres. Suffice it to say, there is increasing evidence that movies and television features depicting violence are connected with people later perpetrating acts of violence. This should make us aware of the need to give very careful consideration to that material and to also restrict its showing. The Democrats will be supporting Senator Harradine's motion.

        I do not quite know what Senator Bolkus meant when he said that he did not necessarily agree with what I said in my speech. I just wish to say this: when people make those general statementsâ€”and I have heard those comments previously; they say, `I disagree with Senator Harradine'â€”could they please identify those matters with which they disagree. Do not take that general broad brush approach when I am standing up for the many people who have suffered discrimination because of their religion, ethnicity or something else.

        I would like honourable senators, when they say they disagree with me, to say precisely how they disagree. I defy any senator in this chamber to stand up and say that I have adopted any approach other than one which is consistent with attempting to come to grips with public policy issues by rigorously analysing the facts and by coming to a decision based on values that are generally supported by persons of good will.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The same applies to Senator Schacht, although his speech was a little more specific. In future, in any debate, I would like honourable senators to say how they disagree with me and what the basis for that disagreement is, and I hope we can then have a meeting of minds.

        Senator Bolkus said that he agreed with the principle that adults should be free to read and hear what they like. He does not, because he has consistently supported legislation which does the opposite. I took the trouble to explain what was set out in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. It is there. I have read it and I will read it again. It says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the principle that adults be free to see and hear and read what they choose was originally stated as public policy, the number of videos entering Australia was insignificant and there was not the widespread availability of objectionable video material, video publications as exists today as a result of a flood of these materials into Australia.

        which Senator Bolkus supported. So how can he say that adults are free to read and view what they wish?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us deal with these matters as a matter of principle. We do need to have a united and bipartisan approach to these particular matters. Senator Bolkus did say today that he agrees with the current system. Therefore, by agreeing with the current system which has refused classification to child pornography, bestiality, and so on he does not support the principle that adults should be free to read and view what they wish, because they are absolutely banned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Schacht indicated his view about a number of matters. I would like to hear how people disagree with me so that we can a have a meeting of minds. There is no suggestion in what I have said that the guidelines should be disallowable instruments in this parliament because I assume, with a federal&amp;hyphen;state arrangement, they would need to be disallowable instruments in every other parliament. I agree that that would be so cumbersome as to make it unworkable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Schacht then raised the issue ofâ€”I don't know why; I thought we had been talking about video violenceâ€”pornography, or, as he calls it, non-violent erotica. What he means by that, of course, is described in the report to which I referred. It says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The dominant theme of this material also said it objectifies and commodifies women rather than treating women as free and responsible initiators of human activity. The material in this category, although non-violent, treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience. Thus, sexual intercourse is typically depicted as a mechanical act devoid of love or human consequencesâ€”
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bulk of all pornographic video materials commercially available in Australia falls within this category. The committee, as did the Meese commission, also refers to this material as degrading in that it frequently depicts people, usually women, as existing solely for the sexual satisfaction of others,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         usually men, or that it depicts people, usually women, in decidedly subordinate roles in their sexual relationships with others, or that it depicts people engaged in sexual practices that most people would consider humiliating.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purpose of satisfying male sexual desires. This is sometimes manifested by themes involving workplace sexual practices and favours. Women are frequently depicted as eager for sexual experience of any kind and ever ready for any opportunity for sexual activity. This is frequently manifested in group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activity and which are a feature of much of the material in this category.
       </para>
       <para>
        If you call that erotica, you do not know what you have been looking at. I did not raise that matter; Senator Schacht did. If he has a thing about it, a fixation about the matter, that is his problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do believe that we ought to know what this material does. This committee looked at the social and behavioural science research in these particular areas and found that the exploitative material does have an effect on the viewers. I suggest that you read this particular document. There is, of course, self&amp;hyphen;reporting by persons who are convicted of rape of having enmeshed themselves in this material. There is, of course, violent sexual material available in published form. Putting the two together, no doubt you get a greater effect.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I also would like to know why Senator Schacht wrote to John Dickie about television. I would have thought that he would have written to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. That is the relevant authority, rather than the Office of Film and Literature Classification. Naturally, the Office of Film and Literature Classification does assist in respect of establishing classifications of particular films but, in regard to the activities of commercial television stations, the Australian Broadcasting Authority is the authority. Senator Schacht is now the shadow minister for that area. Maybe he should get over his shadow portfolio.

        In the early 1980's, Mr Bill Kirk and his family brought to the King Island dairy a significant personal investment and a capacity to develop new products.

Such occasions are particularly volatile times for all of us. We all feel more strongly about issues in the period leading up to elections and during the election campaign when we all say things in our strongest and most political tones and terms. However, I do believe that we have certain responsibilities as parliamentarians. I believe that anyone standing for political office has a responsibility to set certain standards in the debate.

        The first part of my motion is that the Senate condemn the use of any racial material to manipulate public opinion during election campaigns. I want to make it absolutely clear that I am certainly not accusing anyone in this chamber of doing that. But we are all aware that there were elements of racism in the election campaign. It is important that we now debate this honestly and recognise that there were candidates who used racial overtones in some of the material and statements that they made.

        I think this sort of thing lowers the tone of debate in an election campaign. What is more important is the damage it does to the very tenuous race relations in the Australian community. Senators who live in cities in Australia may not be as familiar as I am, living in a northern regional centre, with the sensitivities of race relations. I know that my colleague Senator Bob Collins, and I believe my colleague Senator Tambling, would be very sensitive to the very fragile nature of race relations in northern Australia.

        When leaders in the community, people seeking political office or people who have the ear of the media make statements that can or may be termed by some as racistâ€”and I use that word advisedlyâ€”then we lose control of how those statements will be used by certain extremist groups in certain communities. That is why I think as responsible parliamentarians we have a special obligation to work in harmony across the chamber and across political party lines to deny racism in election campaigns and to deny racism in our debates be it in this chamber or out in the community.

        As a result, it would appear, of some of the racial debate in the election campaign and the subsequent racial debate, complaints of racial hatred towards Aborigines and migrants have jumped 70 per cent since the federal election in March in Queensland. The Queensland Human Rights Commissioner, John Briton, reported this on 18 April. This rise is due to a range of issues, and I am not going to address them because I am trying to keep aside some political differences in regard to policy issues. But, in asking for support for this motion, I want to emphasise that we must remember that what we say in here and toss across the chamber, what we say in interviews and what we say at meetings and in speeches to various groups ultimately affects the way certain extremists in our society respond to the issue of racial harmony.

        I believe everyone in this chamber supports reconciliation. Certainly, the leaders of the various parties and we on this side of the chamber have indicated, in our support for the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, that we do support reconciliation. We do want racial harmony in our society. We do recognise the injustice that has been done to the original inhabitants of Australia and that there does have to be a coming togetherâ€”with an agreement, a treaty, a document that we hope will come out by the year 2000â€”to put the past behind us and to reach agreement with indigenous people. Therefore, as we have agreed on reconciliation, I believe we should agree on the need for a code of race ethics.

I am not advocating setting up yet another committee or doing anything that is all decided here and now. Let us have a small group working towards a code of race ethics. Then we can bring the matter back and have a more specific debate about what it should contain and what it should not contain. I commend the motion to the Senate.

        Before looking specifically at the motion, I want to pick up a couple of things that Senator Reynolds said. I preface everything I have said, though, by saying that we on this side of the chamberâ€”the coalitionâ€”have always been in the forefront in this country of opposing racism in whatever form it may arise and wherever it may raise its odious head. In any consideration that we give to motions such as this one or any other in this area, we come from that basic principle of total abhorrence of any form of racism.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not think there is any doubt that in some areas of Australia today average Australians have an attitude and a mentality, if you like, that there are legitimate causes for concern and debate about aspects of policy and life in Australiaâ€”for example, aspects of the details surrounding native title, certain aspects of policy in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the issue of immigration and some of the implications that flow from debate on immigration, the role of the family, the role of women in society and so on. There are many other areas; I have just named a few.

         When people raise what I think are legitimate issues for debate in some of these areas, there is a tendency in our society today to howl down those people and say, `You are attacking some of the basic principles on which these matters are based.'

         In relation to anyone who faces honestly the issues of public debate in Australia and what can be publicly debatedâ€”and we saw this on more than one occasion during the election campaignâ€”anyone who suggests there is not an aura of political correctness in important areas of Australian society and debate is deluding themselves.

          words in this motion and their implications. So far as the first part is concernedâ€”that the Senate condemns the use of any racial material to manipulate public opinion during election campaignsâ€”yes, the coalition certainly supports that. We have been blessed in Australia throughout most of our history in being free of this type of material. It is of course often in the eye of the beholder as to what is racist or racial material and what is not. There is very often a grey area there when you get to the issue of definition. But, so far as the sentiment in part (a) is concerned, the government of course supports that.

         Similarly we support the intent of part (b), which reminds parliamentarians that they are elected to represent all of their constituents and that it is totally reprehensible for any parliamentarian to announce that they will refuse to represent a particular group. Certainly I think all politicians and parliamentarians are elected to represent all the people. However, I wonder whether Senator Reynolds means to include that we are all there to represent all people, regardless of how extremist their views on particular issues may be. One can think of organisations in Australia that may well fall into that category and which would be included in Senator Reynolds' wording of part (b). That is something Senator Abetz might take up.

         As a general principle I would have thought that parliamentarians certainly should not need reminding that they are elected to represent all the people. Indeed, that has been the whole basis and strength of the Liberal Party throughout its history. We believe quite passionately that we are there to represent all people equally. I would have to say that, of the major political parties in Australia throughout our history, a criticism that can be levelled seriously at the Labor Party is that it has been a party which on many occasions has represented sectional interests rather than the interests of all Australians. Personally that is why I am a Liberal rather than a member of the party opposite.

         But I do have some concern, and the government has some concern, in expressing support for a proposition that vague. There is no indication in the wording of the motion as to what might be the content of that code of race ethics. There is an important question as well as to what a code of ethics in this sort of area may not only seek to achieve but, more importantly, actually achieve in substance. Personally, I think it is very difficult to imagine that having a code of ethics in this areaâ€”and, indeed, codes of ethics in many other areasâ€”will really achieve what the promoters of such codes, perhaps even having the best intent in the world, really hope to achieve from them.

         I think that community attitudes and the attitudes of individuals in areas such as this are not shaped by codes of ethics. There is, as well, depending on the contentâ€”and I stress, depending on the contentâ€”the question of whether a code of ethics runs any risk of infringing on the basic responsibility and rights of members of parliament being able to freely express their views on a range of issues. We often hear statements not just from our colleagues but from the wider community which we may find abhorrent and totally reject. But at the same time, one of the fundamental principles on which this great democratic nation of ours has been based has been the right of basic freedom of speech.

         We need to be very careful indeed, as we as parliamentarians develop our attitudes, policies and approaches towards whatever issue might arise in the community, to have very much at the forefront of our mind the huge benefit that we as a nation have derived from that basic principle of freedom of speech in our community. Whether part (c) of Senator Reynolds's motion would cause problems in that area, I do not know. No-one can tell, because we do not know what the content might be. But certainly it would be an issue

         â€”Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I thought it important to put the facts on the table. They are well and truly known, and they were the subject of the debate. I think we need to take account of how we react to such a statement. I do not mean to indulgeâ€”and I do not believe I have
         <break page="611" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          indulgedâ€”in a personal attack. I am happy to acknowledge that Mr Katter has apologised. However, we should also note that, when the election results were on the table, the media reported that, despite these commentsâ€”and, in fact, the implication was drawn by some commentators that because of those commentsâ€”the votes went up.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We should be conscious of that factor, and also of the responsibility that we as parliamentarians have, individually and collectively. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that we contribute to the shaping of public opinion. That is important, and it is also important in terms of what we do about it later and how we treat it. I do not resile from the comments I have made earlier.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also important to take note of the fact that making these racist comments during the election campaign has had an effect on what is happening and what is being said in the community. Certainly, in our offices, the number of letters that were unleashedâ€”I use that word advisedlyâ€”by these comments and that were repeating and stating quite blatantly racist statements increased markedly: tenfold. In the past, we would get one or two letters from people making racist comments. We now have, as I said, a tenfold increase. I will read a sentence from one letter received in Senator Kernot's office:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That is why those brutal, vagabondist abos have NO RIGHTS to any piece of land in AUSTRALIA. That land right corruption must end. Billions after billions of dollars gone to small minority of abos.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is typical of the comments we receive, and it is unfortunate. It is therefore important that we wholeheartedly support what is stated by Senator Reynolds under subparagraph (a). Subparagraph (b) seems to state the obvious in reminding parliamentarians that `they are elected to represent all of their constituents'. If Ms Hanson has made a statement excluding a particular group then, no doubt, this debate may be a reminder to her.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The comment made by Senator Short is worth looking at, that there may be members in the community whom we find so abhorrent in their views and objectives that we say that we cannot represent them. But it seems to me that the function we have to represent some body is twofold. One part is to ensure that that person, no matter what their views, has access to the parliamentary process in the normal course of events and that they are not told to shut up and go away. The other part is to put our own view and direct our own energies into putting forward what we believe the right attitude is and into defending the values that we have.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I suspect that Senator Reynolds meant subparagraph (b) in the former sense, that we have to serve as a conduit for all views whether we do or do not agree with them. In other words, one presents a petition from someone, despite the fact that both the person and the content of their petition would be totally abhorrent. I would still present such a petition, as I am sure would Senator Reynolds and every other senator. So I think it is in that sense that we cannot exclude representing someone. If someone has a difficulty with a government department, through not receiving a service or whatever, and asks for assistance as a constituent, then obviously one provides that assistanceâ€”provided it is within the law, of courseâ€”no matter what one thinks of the motivation, values or views of the particular person.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would also very strongly support without qualification the suggestion that we should develop a code of race ethics. Developing a code of ethics means that first of all one asks what should be part of that code. Apart from actually producing a codeâ€”which can be no more than a guideline, of courseâ€”the process would force not only the people who would be part of the ethics code group but also everyone here and, hopefully, the wider community to consciously confront what we are talking about. It generates a thinking process, so the process of developing a code is almost as important as the final product of that process.

        I will refer to a statement that the Prime Minister made recently. I preface it by saying that it is an example of how we unconsciously follow thought processes because we do not consciously think in a particular way and because our collective memory sometimes excludes things we should remember. I am sure that, if Mr Howard had consciously
        <break page="612" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         addressed the question and the implications of what he said, he would not have put it in quite the way that he did. I am only citing this as an example of how important it is for us consciously to be reminded of our history and of how it affects our thinking at the moment. In commenting on the horrendous tragedy in Port Arthur, the Prime Minister said:

        Obviously the Prime Minister, at that point, did not think of the 1838 Slaughterhouse Creek massacre, where up to 300 people were murdered by police, or of the many other cases where indigenous Aboriginal people were slaughtered in very large numbers by police, settlers or others.

        I believe it is absolutely essential that we become conscious of our history, that we have it uppermost in our minds and that we are not bludgeoned by the political correctness label. This is the other point that I wish to emphasise in Senator Reynolds's address, because it has become a club with which to bludgeon debate. Radio commentators, journalists, politicians and others have, on numerous occasions in the last few months, taken up the fashion of saying, `Oh, yes, that's political correctness. Don't worry me with it. You're obviously following a formula,' but in its
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        Senator Reynolds's motivation in moving this motion is quite transparent, and that is that she is genuinely concerned about this issueâ€”there is no doubt about that. I commend her for this and, basically, I share her views. However, I do consider there is some difficulty with the motion, and I have suggested to Senator Reynolds that, in paragraph (a), the word `racial' be deleted and the word `racist' be inserted instead. At the moment, the paragraph reads:

        Clearly there was racial material quite appropriately put around, because racial means `pertaining to the relations between people of different races'. We have a multicultural affairs policy, which pertains to the relations between people of different races, we have an immigration policy, and we have an Aboriginal affairs policy.

        On the strict wording of the motion I am suggesting that amendment to Senator Reynolds, because there is no doubt that Senator Bolkus, as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, tried to gain votes for the Labor Party on the basis that his policy was better than ours. I think that the import of what Senator Reynolds is pursuing is really racist material, and I would commend that change to the Senate.

Yet when I mentioned I was receiving this information, a certain person immediately branded me as being racist because I was daring to examine, along with my colleague Senator Paul Calvert, the question of whether the funding was getting through to the appropriate people or whether people were creaming off some of the money. If you raised

I suppose in general terms I believe that if somebody wants to put a point of view, even if I disagree with it, they ought to have a right to put that point of view. So I am somewhat concerned as to what this code would do. Senator Spindler used a fairly contrived example of what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in recent times.

        The Labor government has a very proud record of governing for all Australians, and that included having to give attention where necessary to disadvantaged groups such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to redress some of the gross imbalances and injustices of the past. But too often in the lead-up to the campaign and during the campaign when I turned on the programs of some fairly noted talkback radio hosts in Sydney I heard this constant obsession with what had been done for groups such as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islandersâ€”that too much had been done for them and that, therefore by implication, not enough had been done for everyone else.

        I will mention one name because he certainly has not resiled from his position on this, and that is Mr Alan Jones.

He did that by particularly targeting in his radio program Robert Tickner, the member for Hughes and the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I happen to be a resident of the Hughes electorate in Sydney so, firstly, I know Robert very

Mr Jones would argue that you are not allowed to raise these things in Australia because we live in a politically correct environment and that if you raise these issues you will be branded a racist. This is the real straw man argument. The constant vilification, the constant denigration, the constant obsession with this issue, is clearly intended in my view to stir up amongst the rest of the community feelings that they are being disadvantaged vis-a-vis groups such as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. I do not think it is any coincidence thatâ€”unfortunately from my point of view and my party's point of view and Robert's point of viewâ€”he has suffered one of the biggest swings of any Labor member in the Sydney metropolitan area and, indeed, the country.

I do not think it is appropriate for responsible journalists or talkback radio hosts, whatever their political views, to get involved to that extent.

My recollection is that the owners of the supermarket laid the blame on young Aboriginal children in the Bourke community. After that, the member for Parkes, Mr Cobb, sought to lay the blame for this situation on the federal government. He said that the federal government was responsible for this incident and that it was up to the Keating government and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Robert Tickner, to come in and sort out the problem of community race relations in the Bourke community.

That is what the people in Kempsey had been told or had heard. It was a common message throughout the community. I went to other parts of New South Wales where the same story was told.

We, as parliamentarians, have to do whatever we can to turn that around. If that means being a bit politically correct at times, then I am in favour of that approach.

        Let me conclude by saying that this is a very timely motion. The contributions in this debate from all speakers on both sides of the chamber have demonstrated that we should be endeavouring to stop this sort of racial material and other racist electioneering to ensure that we do not ever see that sort of campaign become a feature of the wonderful democracy which we have in this country.

         â€”I was listening to this debate in my room, doing a lot of other work at the same time. It seemed to me to be a debate of importance and also a debate that was very well conducted. The issue of racism is vital in a country like ours. The tag of racist is a horrible one because in a multicultural society racism strikes at the heart of the community. That is one of the reasons Senator Reynolds has brought this motion before us. Part (c) of this motion reads:

        <para>
         Of course, that is good, but it also means that we in this chamber should not readilyâ€”if at allâ€”accuse our colleagues, no matter what side of the chamber they come from, of being racist. Nor should we be pleased about or, if it comes to that, ever encourage people outside the chamber to call people racist when clearly they are not.

         Senator Abetz said that he had been accused of being racist. I must confess that having sat on many committees with Senator Abetz and having had some tangles with him now and then, I have never seen any suggestion that he would be racist and it would be wrong for people on this side of the chamber to use what was said outside the parliament to accuse him of that.

         I also notice that Senator Spindler spoke in the debate. He has recently been accused not so much of racism as of retaining some aspects of Hitlerism. That is also a most fearsome accusation. In fact, Senator Spindler was a member of a youth committee under Hitlerâ€”but that was a matter of form. I think everybody in this chamber would agree that Senator Spindler shows anything but a fascist tendency. He has been very assiduous, committed and energetic in the civil liberties area, enabling democracy to flow as it should. It would be a shame if anybody in this chamber used or even condoned whatever accusation has been made in recent times against Senator Spindler.

         In the light of part (c) of this motion I wanted to speak about those two people because if this motion is to have any meaning we have to embrace it not only in its terms but in its spirit. I hope the address I am about to conclude is some indication of what I mean because we have to defend people in this chamber, no matter what party they come from, if they are falsely accused.

That is why I am pleased we managed to maintain the degree of harmony in this chamber that we would all like to see out in the community.

        Several people alluded to the term `political correctness'. I have also mentioned it. Senator Abetz said that he objects to the fact that just because he is talking about an issue and a particular group of people, he is suddenly accused of being a racist. Maybe it is true that the term `racist' has been bandied about in all kinds of situations, just as `political correctness' is now being used.

        The purpose of this bill is to insert into the Excise Tariff Act 1921 the definition of "prescribed division", which is currently contained in an Excise By&amp;hyphen;Law.

It was suggested for clarity to transfer the By&amp;hyphen;law definition into the act, with effect from 1 July 1983, being the date the relevant provision which relies upon the By&amp;hyphen;law definition first appeared in legislation.

        The purpose of this bill, and the Associated Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1996, is to introduce minor but necessary amendments to ensure consistency between the current industry milk payment practices and the dairy market support legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following the Uruguay round of trade negotiations, Australia introduced new arrangements from 1 July 1995 which deliver assistance to dairy producers through a clearly defined and transparent domestic support scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The market support arrangements involve a levy on market milk, paid by producers; and a levy on manufacturing milk, paid by manufacturers of dairy products which can be recouped from domestic consumers. Exports of manufactured dairy products are exempt from levy liability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The two levies are appropriated to the Australian Dairy Corporation which pays support to manufacturing milk producers. The Australian Dairy Corporation also collects the levies as the agent of the Department Of Primary Industries And Energy.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The scheme centres around being able to distinguish between market milk and manufacturing milk at the point of receival from a producer. The distinction between market milk and manufacturing milk under the current legislation is based on actual usage.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Current administration of the scheme by the Australian Dairy Corporation is on the basis of industry milk payment practices and is not consistent with the legislation as it now stands.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Extensive consultation with the dairy industry has established that it would be extremely difficult for the industry to modify its current milk payment practices without causing major disruption. Accordingly, this bill retrospectively aligns the market support legislation with the existing administration arrangements of the Australian Dairy Corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill provides for market milk to be redefined as that milk for which a producer receives a market milk payment. Manufacturing milk will subsequently be the residual of total leviable milk less market milk.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These definitional changes will ensure that the legislative framework and the current method of administration of the dairy support arrangements are compatible. They have been developed in close consultation with the dairy industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Two additional modifications have been incorporated into the bill. The first involves removing the imposition of the corporation, promotion and research levies on milk which is consumed, disposed of or lost on&amp;hyphen;farm. In practice, the amounts of such milk are indeterminate and have consequently never incurred levy. The removal of the levy liability from such milk gives legal effect to industry policy and practice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second modification clarifies the levy imposition arrangements for modified market milk and manufacturing milk by emphasising that levy is calculated on the milk fat and protein content of milk as determined on&amp;hyphen;farm. Again this provision ensures consistency between established industry policy and the legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments do not affect actual levy collection and support payments, as current industry practice will continue. No producer or manufacturer will be disadvantaged relative to the current operation of the scheme. Furthermore, there will be no effect on the annual amounts of revenue and outlays under the scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Most importantly, the market support arrangements remain consistent with the original policy intention of the scheme and with Australia's commitments to the World Trade Organization agreement.

         Abortifacients are prohibited imports unless exempted by the Department of Human Services and Health pursuant to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. As a result of questions by Senator Brian Harradine at Estimates Committee Hearings as far back as 1988,  undertakings were given and policy adopted that no such exemption would be given or clinical trials approved unless the Minister was involved in the decision. Neither the then Minister for Human Services and Health nor the then Minister for Family Services (Minister responsible for the TGA) were consulted prior to the exemption by the departmental delegate. Health Minister Graham Richardson acknowledged that the official assurances were "breached" and said the Government would see whether it could rectify the situation (

         RU&amp;hyphen;486 (also known as Mifepristone and sold in France as Mifegyne) is a progesterone antagonist. It is a synthetic steroid which blocks the positive effects of the hormone progesterone, which is necessary to sustain the rich, nutrient lining of the womb during pregnancy. When the function of progesterone is inhibited by RU&amp;hyphen;486, the womb's lining is broken down and the foetus is destroyed in the process. This is RU&amp;hyphen;486's most common function. If administered after fertilisation but prior to implantation, RU&amp;hyphen;486 is intended to make the womb unreceptive to the embryo because the lining is inadequate for the embryo to attach.

         However RU&amp;hyphen;486 has a significant "failure" rate when used alone.

         A major factor propelling the research and promotion of the drug is its ultimate use in the armoury of population controllers. It is for this reason the drug attracts the financial support of the Human Reproduction Program (HRP).

         The World Bank, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Development Program and World Health Organisations are sponsors of the HRP program. WHO is the executing agency because its "perceived neutrality" make it "a most appropriate instrument to deal with an area as sensitive as that of family planning research" (Dr Halfdan Mahler former Director General of WHO now Director General of International Planned Parenthood Federation in Research on the Regulation of Human Fertility, Proceedings of an International Symposium, Stockholm, Scriptor, 1983, P.359). HRP priorities are recommended by an advisory committee of which Professor Baulieu has been a member. Authorisation for the use of RU&amp;hyphen;486 in developed countries is a prelude to widespread distribution in developing countries because distribution at a cost&amp;hyphen;plus price in that market is mandated by company contracts with HRP. Ausaid allocates funds to the HRP program from aid moneys.

The Population Council of New York and The Population Crisis Committee are sponsors of RU&amp;hyphen;486 research and active in its promotion.

         Women considering taking the drug are advised to live "within about 40km" of an abortion clinic.

         RU&amp;hyphen;486 is promoted as a simple do&amp;hyphen;it&amp;hyphen;yourself, private, de&amp;hyphen;medicalised abortion. Yet it requires three or four visits to a specialised centre, the taking of up to five hazardous drug combinations, vaginal ultrasound and may result in the complications cited above. Klein, Raymond and Dumble: "There appears to be an unquestioning acceptance that RU&amp;hyphen;486/PG de&amp;hyphen;medicalizes abortion, whereas the reality of RU&amp;hyphen;486/PG treatment is that it re&amp;hyphen;medicalizes, ie. more thoroughly medicalizes, the abortion experience for women. . .

         Then there are the potential long&amp;hyphen;term effects. There are concerns about the lasting effect on tissue of the cervix and uterus. RU&amp;hyphen;486 has also been found to have crossed the blood&amp;hyphen;follicle barrier and has been found in the egg follicles of women to whom RU&amp;hyphen;486 has been administered. The implications of this for future fertility, pregnancies and health of future children have not been established. Dr Lynette Dumble, senior research  Fellow at Royal Melbourne Hospital, says that prostaglandins used with RU&amp;hyphen;486 "have the potential to have serious life&amp;hyphen;threatening side&amp;hyphen;effects."

         â€”I rise to speak to Senator Harradine's amendments. There is no rule of the Greens (WA) that their elected representatives must vote together. The fact that this is generally not noticed is an indication of the high level of agreement we usually have on issues. Without pre&amp;hyphen;empting Senator Chamarette's decision, this amendment represents an area where we have some differences. I do not believe it is proper to single out abortifa

       <para first-indent="16">
        The debate on this issue functions at several levels. There are issues of safety, freedom of side&amp;hyphen;effects, and so on. But abortifacients are not especially prone to such side&amp;hyphen;effects, nor are they the only class of drugs with concern over side&amp;hyphen;effects. In point of fact, it is usually specific drugs rather than classes of drugs that are a concern.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If this had been put up as an accountability measure, as a procedure by which members of the public could present concerns over the medical and health effects of drugs, after they were accepted by a panel of expertsâ€”in other words, as a process for appealing a judgment to allow drug use as safeâ€”I may have supported it. This would have opened the door to the public to express concerns on a number of drugs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We must remember there has been a history, which includes expert decisions, that various drugs or chemicals are safe, when in fact they were not. Only struggle has resulted in the admission of ill&amp;hyphen;effects and sometimes banning of those substances. So it would not have been odd for the Greens to support a broad mechanism for appeal, in the name of accountability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We would also consider a mechanism which would allow a minister to override the negative judgment of experts, as well as positive ones, in response to the community. This is applicable in issues such as drugs for treatment of terminal or long&amp;hyphen;term debilitating illness, where victims of these diseases might choose to try a promising drug not fully tested, rather than face certain death or massive discomfort. It seems that in a nation where, at least in some states, people can choose to die with dignity, people ought to be able to at least apply to choose a course of treatment that may not be fully proven to be safe.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In any case, there are issues of the efficacy of a drug, of health and safety, which may be considered in terms of evidence. It concerns me that this is not a process which is aimed at addressing such issues. RU486 is already restricted. This says that, if a panel of experts agreed that an abortifacient drug passed all
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         tests that would allow its use, this is a special class which still should not be used. The minister may exempt it from general ban by direct, written, undelegated decisions. The effect of Senator Harradine's amendment is that all other drugs may be used when a panel of experts say they are safe. But these drugs are special, and should not be used even if they are safe, unless the minister personally says so.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why is this class of drugs considered so bad? It is not one drug here. It is not a general procedure for drugs which a sector of the public finds likely to be unsafe. It is not a safety issue at all, in spite of the existence of some safety issues with some of the drugs in this class. We do not see similar bans on tranquillisers or mood elevators, valium or Prozac, even though they are questionable both socially and medically. The issue is the use of these drugs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The class of drugs is defined by purpose as abortifacients. This amendment says, `abortifacient drugs are especially bad.' If this amendment were passed, it would say that the parliament indicates that these drugs should be considered special and not generally allowed. That is an executive decision to countermand this general rule that the minister must be personally accountable for such a decision.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Greens support the idea that value&amp;hyphen;based decisions should be made. It is not always appropriate to let economic bottom lines and personal freedom dictate the basis of social activities. But neither do we like to see the abuse of executive power on issues of community value. Restrictions on personal freedom should be made clearly, and on the basis of broad community participation. At very least, if there is no broad public decision&amp;hyphen;making forum, the decisions should be made in parliament.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In the specific case of family planning, the debate has been conducted for a long time in the public domain. The first issue is whether this sphere of activity is one where individuals should have choice, or whether it is an area where government has a duty to regulate. I support the idea that contraceptive use by men or women is a personal decision, and
        <break page="623" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         support the right of the woman to choose whether or not to bear children. I further support the idea that all safe means of birth control should be available.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If one disagrees and supports the notion that this is an area for regulation, there is still the issue of whether or not abortifacient drugs may be preferable to surgical abortion which is legal. But we are not being asked to debate these issues. We are being asked to accept that government should regulate, and regulate by ministerial proclamation, with a pre&amp;hyphen;judgment that these drugs should not be allowed except in special circumstances.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I share Senator Chamarette's concern that abortifacients should not come to be seen as a replacement for contraception. I disagree that the way to address this is to forbid abortifacients. Education campaigns and ensuring appropriate advice is available are liable to be more appropriate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The choice surrounding whether or not to abort an unwanted pregnancy is often difficult and traumatic for women. It is often one of those situations where neither option is good. If an abortifacient is proved safe and free of side effects, then it becomes, for those who choose abortion, an alternative to surgical abortion rather than an alternative to contraception. Ethically, some people may find abortion at cytoplast stage, a few hours after conception, more acceptable than the surgical abortion of a foetus that may be well over a month old. Others may feel it makes no difference, but there is a range of ethical positions on this issue.

        I would like to think that all parties feel that this is an issue of such importance that those who have a certain belief on this issue can make their own decisions in relation to this vote. I would therefore be very disappointed if the voting on this issue becomes party based. Contraception and abortion are areas where choice should be based on individual ethics rather than opposed by government. I oppose this amendment.

        In looking at this issue, it becomes very clear that Senator Harradine has a particular objectiveâ€”that is, in dealing with restricted goods, to make it as difficult as possible for drugs that may be used as abortifacients to come into the country. In particular, he indicates his opposition to the drug RU486. He has made that very clear both in debate in the chamber and in personal discussions. We can certainly say that he has been consistent in his approach.

        Whilst the opposition does not agree with Senator Harradine's particular objective that these drugs should be removed entirely from circulation and that they should not be allowed in Australia, we acknowledge that this issue raises large concerns within the community.

These issues need to be addressed by the executive of this government and addressed with absolute and direct accountability and absolute and complete transparency.

        It is on this basis that the opposition has decided not to oppose the amendment put forward by Senator Harradine.

         â€”I wish to reiterate my strong opposition to this amendment, as outlined yesterday. I will not go over all the points. The Democrats cannot support either the specific amendment or the intent of the amendment. The intent of the amendment is to make it as difficult as possible for women to have another choice and to make it as difficult as possible for manufacturers to actually get their product into the country let alone through the process of trial, approval and making it available.

        We do not deny that there are risks with these drugs, as there are with many other drugs. If these amendments were based on the risk involved with particular drugs then perhaps there may be some case to argue. Surely parliamentarians are not the best people to determine what the risk really is. I would be prepared to listen to arguments about improving the current process. Perhaps the minister can inform us of any specific problems there may be with the current processes. I understand that, for the past few years, the TGA has adopted a practice of formally notifying both the minister and the secretary to the department whenever it receives a request for the special use of a drug such as an abortifacient.

        I wish to comment on some other remarks Senator Harradine made when we were dealing with this legislation yesterday. He quoted a book written by Renate Klein. He indeed indicated his interest in a range of issues in that book. Renate Klein and others argue that much more funding needs to go into primary health care alternatives. We could not agree more. In particular, far more money needs to go into family planning. I agree with her that more attention should be directed to male contraceptives and far more responsibility should be taken by the male partner. From an international perspective, I believe that we should be spending less time focusing on the more technological methods of birth control.

        While we do share some of her concerns about this drug and these types of drugs, we certainly do not share her views that they therefore must be banned or research into them should immediately be stopped. I do not believe that she represents anything like a majority of women in this country. We certainly should be exploring all possibilities, I believe, to give women a genuine choice about contraception. We should ensure that these various means are discussed and looked at ethically. I do not believe we in the Senate should prevent women from being able to exercise their choice on these matters.

        I am happy to place on public record my belief that women should have access to as wide a range of options and as much information as possible. I would be grateful if the parliamentary secretary could take the opportunity to answer my questions before I ask a couple of others.

        Mr Beazley seems to think that at the moment Telstra dominates the equipment manufacturing sector. Of course it once did; it used to be the only game in town. But in recent times, as a result of competition, particularly from Optus and Vodafone, according to the Telecommunications Industry Development Authority Telstra absorbed less than half of the domestic production. The growth of competitors to Telstra and the very rapid increase in sales of customer premise equipment have meant an enormous growth in demand.

The fact is that Telstra is in a very competitive environment. The industry is growing rapidly.

The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy yesterday confirmed both on the ABC and in the parliament that he is a beef and grain producer.

        Can the minister advise the Senate whether the minister's pastoral company receives payments under the diesel fuel rebate scheme? If so, has the minister in cabinet or any of its committees, including the Expenditure Review Committee of which he is a member, declared his interest and absented himself from discussions, in accordance with his undertakings, and any decisions regarding the retention of this scheme? Does the minister's family still retain financial interests in companies with extensive forestry operations? If so, has the minister taken similar action, given the reported current examination by the government of proposals to `significantly increase' the volume of woodchips exported from native forests in areas such as northern New South Wales?

        Unfortunately, I am all too aware of this major environmental problem. The once productive paddock in the picture is affected by the environmental cancer of dry land salinity, which is caused by rising watertables bringing salt to surface soil largely, in part, because of removal of tree cover. When salt reaches the surface, it increases salt loads in our rivers, eliminates remnant habitat as vegetation is poisoned by the salt, and lowers agricultural production as the soil and water become increasingly salinised. Scientists have described dry land salinity as a sleeping

        If the other parties in this chamber were to allow us to set up our national heritage trustâ€”with the funding coming through the sale of one-third of Telstraâ€”the government's national vegetation initiative would be able to be put in place. This initiative involves $254 million over five years for revegetation projects over and above all the existing Commonwealth landcare-related programs. In addition to that, $64 million over four years is earmarked to assist voluntary schemes to preserve vegetation which might otherwise be cleared. In other words, a total of $318 million over five years will be spent on combating land and water degradation.

        It is about time these parties which claim to be so committed to the environment took the opportunity to demonstrate that commitment. All that is needed is a simple vote supporting the government in the sale of one-third of Telstra.

        There are two important points I need to make to the Senate in respect of Senator Crowley's question. The first point is that Minister Such indicated to me that he believed the article did not properly reflect the remarks he had made. He did not believe it did at all. I indicated to the minister that it
        <break page="630" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The second point that not only Minister Such but a very wide number of people would be interested to know in relation to the downsizing that is now under way in my department is this. The reduction in running costs between 1995-96 and 1996-97 is some $100 million. That is a fairly substantial amount of money. Of this, some $25 million has been factored in to cover the government's two per cent across-the-board reduction in running costs and the notional allowance for some other reductions announced during the election campaign, such as consultancies and advertising. Around $75 million in the reductions to the running costs was built into the department's forward estimates by the previous government.

        I thank Senator Crowley very much for the opportunity to advise honourable senators, and anybody who has been misled by media reports in the paper or by comments made by Senator Crowley's colleagues, about the downsizing in DEETYA, and no doubt a similar situation is happening in other departments. It bears repeating: of the $100 million in downsizing, $75 million is as a result of the previous government's plans in its forward estimates.

       <para first-indent="16">
        For those people who do not easily accommodate amounts of $100 million and $25 million, because they are very substantial sums of money for most people to comprehend, let me put it in terms of people. Of the 1,285 reductions in permanent staffing which were announced on 24 April 1996, I am advised by the department that some 965 are as a result of decisions made by the previous government. These are the people who get out in the media at any opportunity to mislead the community into believing that the downsizing that now has to happen because of their incompetence is completely a function of decisions we have made. It is worth bearing in mind that the downsizing is a function, in part, of the government's own plans and

        We want to do this in the most organised and sensible possible fashion and, as you well know, Mr President, an indication has been made through the department of the sort of changes that need to be made. If anyone is interested in taking a package, it should be a hands-up process. That is the way we would like to proceed with this. Constant fearmongering and rumour mongering with respect to this process does not make it easier for the people whose jobs are at stake as a function of Labor's incompetence.

They have also said that they are happy to give access to the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service if that first study proves inadequate. That is the advice that is available to me.

We made those representations to the regional representative of UNHCR and in each and every instance we have followed those cases as diligently as process will allow.

You refused to take industry into your confidence; you refused to talk to people. This government inherited a very damaging fiscal situation. Savings need to be made in all areas. We recognised early on that the former government's proposal to abolish the TCS with respect to business imports needed modification to reduce its undesirable effect on the economy as a whole. To that end we consulted industry as part of an exercise to seek good industry policy which contributes to our revenue objectives and which helps bring the budget into balance, something that the former government never even had a vague concept of doing, let alone recognising its desirability.

Let me answer the real point of Senator Foreman's question. In 1991 the Industry Commission concluded that, if all tariff concession orders were removed, the general level of prices would increase by around 0.3 per cent. That was at a time when tariffs were much higher than they are now. The latest analysis and calculation of the CPI effect of yesterday's decision are that it will be totally negligible, in the region of 0.1 per cent.

         â€”I thank Senator MacGibbon for that question because we can never remind enough the Australian  people of the broken promises and the web of deceit that were woven by the previous government right through its 13 years. Senator MacGibbon is correct in saying that in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to  the 1993 election, the then Labor Prime Minister, Mr Keating, did say, `What I am promising is not to put up tax.' It was a key element of the package of measures which Labor sold to the 1993 electorate, as a result of which it lied its way back into office. It was one of the all time con jobs in the political history of this country.

         and time again. Indeed, it broke it so often that I cannot, in the time available, inform the Senate of all the tax increases. But let me mention a few of them. Labor increased the company tax rate It put up wholesale sales tax by two per cent across the board. It imposed a further punitive tariff or taxâ€”wholesale taxâ€”on motor vehicles. It increased petrol taxes. It increased the departure tax. It extended the PAYE arrangements.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Not only did it promise not to put up taxes but, prior to the 1993 election, Labor promised two rounds of personal income tax cuts. The second round of tax cuts was due just five months ago, on 1 January 1996. Those cuts would have been worth more than $10 a week for a person on average weekly ordinary time earnings. The then Prime Minister went to great lengths to reassure voters that the tax cuts were genuine. Mr Keating said that these tax cutsâ€”you might remember; I think Australians will never forgetâ€”were not only promised but they were enshrined in l&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;w law. That was another one of the great Labor frauds, another deception and another empty promise which Labor never ever intended to keep.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Voters never received the 1 January 1996 tax cuts which they were promised. Those tax increases from the broken promises have been estimated to cost Australian taxpayers more than $7 billion in the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 financial year and $10 billion in the year ahead, 1996&amp;hyphen;97. In other words, as a result of those broken tax promises, Australian taxpayers will be paying $17 billion more tax over these two years than they would otherwise have paid. Labor is not just the party of high unemployment and high interest rates; it is also the party of high taxation. Above all else, it is the party of lies, deceit and broken promises.

Mr Beazley, as the former finance minister and now Leader of the Opposition, oversaw that fiscal irresponsibility of such magnitude that we have that massive hole in our finances. Next year will be the sixth consecutive year of economic growth. The Reserve Bank, amongst others, has said that we should have an underlying surplusâ€”and a substantial one at that.

        This point had to be made in an instruction today which the secretary to my department has sent to the network across Australia which delivers these labour market programs. I am happy to table that instruction. Moreover, to a very significant extent the challenge we face in managing this cash limited appropriation within the financial limits is a difficult one and we have to do it in a way which meets commitments to clients and client needs. The problem that we have been landed with is a function very largely of the previous government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I indicate to you, Mr President, that, in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, $2.1 billion was appropriated for these programs. It was evident by late last yearâ€”that is, not halfway through the financial yearâ€”that they were being taken up very rapidly. The previous minister, I am informed, was aware of this, and he did not exercise either of the two courses which were open to him: namely, to decide to borrow forward from the next financial year or to administratively slow the rate of expenditure in order to manage a capped program within the limits set by this parliament. As a consequence, on coming to office I have been faced with a very difficult situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is, I repeat, a function of the previous minister understanding that the money was being spent very quickly and sitting on his hands. He could have either slowed the rate of expenditure or he could have made a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         decision to borrow forward from the next year and he did nothing. As the secretary's note records, the government looked at this matter very closely in terms of prudent financial management and the need to meet commitments to clients, because if you run out of money it is the clients who suffer.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We therefore took the step of borrowing forward $30 million from the next financial year. That was a decision I was prepared to makeâ€”a decision that the previous minister, Mr Crean, simply walked away from. He had a choice of two options to avoid running out of money and he declined to act. Faced with those choices, I have arranged to borrow forward money from the next financial year.
       </para>

        I am aware of the concerns of clients and stakeholders and senators and members. This is a very difficult situation for everybody, not the least of whom are the clients.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The commitments still allow for a significant number of commencements in the next two months, especially in the brokered and formal training programs.

          During the last election campaign you promised to cut a total of $3.5 million a year from the budget of the Family Court. That figure includes the 2% service wide efficiency dividend and the Family Court's share of the Attorney-General's running cost reductions. At the time you claimed that these cuts `would ensure a more efficient service for litigants and the legal profession'. Does the Government still stand by your statement in light of the minutes circulated by the Chief Executive Officer of the Family Court on 23 April this year, which advised that the loss of funding would result in a dramatic cut to services, including: the reduction of judicial circuits by some 30%, the reduction in the number of conciliation conferences by 50%, and the cancellation of the delay reduction programs at the Parramatta and Melbourne registries? How do you even try to justify these cuts to the many families in crisis, particularly those in rural and regional areas, that will be affected by your cuts?

          The Attorney-General's portfolio is not immune from the budgetary cuts which are necessary as a result of the previous government's economic mismanagement.

          The Parliament has made the Family Court a self-administering agency where decisions about the management of its administrative, including financial, affairs rest with the Chief Justice. How the Family Court reduces its spending is, therefore, a matter for the Court.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          It should be noted, however, that the size of the spending reduction proposed is relatively small when compared with the Court's total budget. The memorandum of 23 April 1996 from the Chief Executive Officer to staff of the Court, which Senator Bolkus tabled, notes that a 2% reduction in running costs is proposed. The Family Court's Budget this year is approximately $100 million.

          Although specific budgetary targets have been set for the Court no direction has been given to the Court on how to achieve the efficiencies necessary to meet these targets. In this respect the Court is treated in the same way as other public sector organisations and, like other departments and agencies, the Court will need to develop strategic plans to meet the targeted cuts, tailored to meet its individual requirements.

          The Attorney-General has advised that it is not proper for him to second guess the Chief Justice in the exercise of his statutory powers. He does not intend to comment on the proposals being developed by the Court for savings measures other than to say that the measures by which the Court will meet its targets are still the subject of on&amp;hyphen;going discussions and that he is prepared to look at any suggestions the Court wants him to consider.

          Should either of the judges choose to retire then the matter of a replacement judge in Tasmania would be considered.

       <para>
        The reason why I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Alston from his own dorothy dixer from his own back bench is that during the course of that answer, in response
        <break page="640" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to some interjections from the opposition, Senator Alston described the workers and the Australian telecommunications manufacturing industry as a `sheltered workshop'. This is one of the most disgraceful attacks on tens of thousands of Australian workers, and very successful companies, that I have heard for a long time in the Senate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I know that Senator Alston gets very excited and lets his mouth run away from his brain from time to time, but this is a disgraceful attack on a very successful industry. I would like to refer to a statement which Senator Cook, the former Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, made in August of last year when announcing further details of the progress in the development of the telecommunications industry in Australia. He pointed out in August 1995 that since 1991 the sales of locally manufactured telecommunications equipment had increased from $2 billion to more than $4 billionâ€”and wait for this; this really exposes Senator Alston's ignoranceâ€”and exports had expanded from $218 million to more than $970 million and employment in the industry was growing at almost 11 per cent annually.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is not a sheltered workshop industry. This is a world's best industry competing in the toughest market in the worldâ€”that is, Asiaâ€”supplying top quality equipment at reasonable and competitive prices. He said that the people in the new emerging economies of Asia do not give you a free kick to buy unless you have the best price and the best quality. The industry's exports have grown over four times in five years to nearly $1 billion. That is not a sheltered workshop industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Even in our own competitive telecommunications markets in that 4&amp;half; years Senator Cook pointed out that manufactures for the domestic market supplied from Australian manufacturers, Australian workers, grew from $2 billion to $4 billion. These are exceptional figures and it is disgusting for Senator Alston to describe this industry in a throwaway line as `a sheltered workshop'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is why the opposition in the House of Representatives yesterday and today moved an amendment to the privatisation bill. We
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         want Telstra to maintain 70 per cent of its purchases from Australian manufacturers, small and large businesses, but overwhelmingly small businesses. We want to maintain that 70 per cent. Telstra accepted that responsibility over the last decade under the industry development plans of the former government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you privatise Telstra you will not have an industry growing at the rate that Senator Cook pointed out last yearâ€”not with a job growth of 11 per cent, not going into export markets. We noted with some interest today that when it came to the vote on this amendment in the House of Representatives all those 95 coalition government members, including the new members, voted against that amendment. They voted against Telstra maintaining its national interest purchasing policies, which give jobs to tens of thousands of Australians, of top quality product.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is another disgraceful example of how this new government does not understand industry development policies in this country. When the Telstra bill comes into the Senate we will certainly be pursuing the issue of ensuring that Telstra maintains its purchasing policy in Australia in order to maintain Australian jobs. We will make sure that every worker and every manager in the hundreds of companies that manufacture telecommunications equipment in Australia are aware of his description of the industry as a sheltered workshop. It is shameful day for a new minister.

         â€”I rise also to take note of the answer the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, gave concerning the so&amp;hyphen;called sheltered workshops of the Australian electronics industry. He has extraordinary arrogance and contempt to come in here and argue that these great enterprises are sheltered workshops. We saw a similar position put yesterdayâ€”that is, that somehow or other the public servants of this country are merely people who live on the drip&amp;hyphen;feed.

        It has to be understood that in the five&amp;hyphen;year industry development plan established in 1992 Telstra estimated spending some $10 billion in terms of forward planning but in actual fact it spent over $20 billion. In 1994-95, it spent $3 billion on Australian made goods and services. We have some 1,000 Australian companies that have undertaken contracts of $400,000 or more and some 50 companies with contracts of over $10 million. Some $200 million is spent on research and development. Export earnings from Australian industry has been some $1 billion. Telstra has been pursuing a range of offshore projects, particularly in the Asian regionâ€”in Vietnam, Pakistan, India, Indonesia and Taiwan. This minister says that the Australian industry is run on the basis of a sheltered workshop. What a disgrace.

        In Australia about 60 per cent of switching, 65 per cent of analogue mobiles, 45 per cent of appliance transmission and 98 per cent of optical fibre comes from local content. We have seen local companies such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Exicom, Siemens, and MIM Cables all producing quite extraordinary levels of expertise and contributing directly to the Australian economy in ways that could not and would not be considered if a foreign multinational got hold of Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is quite an extraordinary proposition for this minister to come in here and suggest that our economy is run on the basis of sheltered workshops. What extraordinary arrogance. Telstra is Australia's overseas flag carrier. If foreign owners purchase or have a controlling interest in Telstra through dilution of that basic public ownership we will see those overseas opportunities and the Australian industry diminish accordingly. There are major risks with a privatised Telstra in terms of the domestic market and in terms of Australian jobs. Perhaps as many as 20,000 Australian jobs are directly dependent upon whether Telstra will be put under threat by this government's policies. In terms of overseas marketing, quite extraordinary levels of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         investment will be put at risk by this government's policies.

        We clearly cannot allow that position to go unchallenged. Quite clearly, this minister works on the presumption that Australian industry is not up to it. He has a contempt for Australian industry, hence the comment about so-called sheltered workshops, he has a contempt for Australians and he has a contempt for the Australian electronics industry. That this government is pursuing this policy is a disgrace.

        I would like to reiterate some of the sales achievements of Telstra and the contribution it makes to this economy. Sales of locally manufactured telecommunications equipment and services have gone from $2.1 billion in 1991 to just over $4 billion, as Senator Schacht said, a year ago. In 1983 Australia exported just $50 million worth of telecommunications equipment and services. In 1990 to 1991 it was $280 million. Last year it stood at $970 million but, more importantly, it is forecast to reach $1.5 billion by the year 2000. Those are the sorts of things that I am sure Senator Alston ought to take account of. I am quite sure that the people working in those industries do not consider them a sheltered workshop in any respect.

        The question asked by Senator Collins, the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, was part of a continual attack on an existing minister, John Anderson.

That attack has continued all week, and I think it is important for Senator Collins to know that his comments simply are not getting any bites. They are certainly not getting any bites at all from the rural districts.

        It should be noted that Mr Anderson is undertaking his duties on a full-time basis.

        He comes from the background of his own electorate. He has been able to pick up the experience as his own electorate has just about every primary industry crop or sector: it has wheat, beef, cotton and sheep. Mr Anderson's own property is a wheat and beef property. So Mr Anderson does come to the parliament and to his portfolio with experience. He has been able to get the breadth of experience by representing his own electorate and his own partyâ€”the National Partyâ€”which was set up to represent the primary industries. That was its sole purpose. The National Party is now 76 years old. I cannot think of a better party to represent the primary industries than the National Party.

        The facts are that the same principle applies to cabinet declarations of interestâ€”and it shouldâ€”as applies in the law. That old axiom of `justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done' is the same principle. Not only must there not be a conflict of interest but there must not appear to be a conflict of interest. Clearly, there is. The extraordinary answer provided by Senator Parer, when the minister has now gone on the public record and said he will not let his private interests `interfere' with his duties as minister, is an astonishing thing for the minister to say. He will be hearing more about that, let me tell you, when we sit again. It is extraordinary.

        Here is what John Howard said about conflict of interest in respect of then Prime Minister Keating's piggery interests. Barry Cassidy asked him, `Where is the conflict of interest?'

         Let me put it to you that there is real cause for concern. If John Anderson is a member of the Expenditure Review Committee, as he is, and has a pastoral company in receipt of money from the diesel tax rebate schemeâ€”which I am very familiar withâ€”he should not take part in the deliberations about retaining it. He should not do that if he is a direct beneficiary of the scheme. There is no argument about this under these principles. If the minister's family has, as it does, extensive shareholdings in Boral, one of the biggest forestry companies in Australia, the minister should not be reviewing woodchip export licences.

         I am not saying John Anderson should not be Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.

What I have said is that he has got an absolute obligation, on each and every occasion that this arises, to declare those interests. I want to know if he has done so and we still do not know that.

         But I will tell you this right now: in terms of my interpretation of the cabinet bible, which I worked under for a number of years, there is an apparent absolute conflict between the minister's family interests and the forestry industry, as indicated by the press reports. At least three newspapers I have seen have said that this minister is currently reviewing whether there should be `a significant expansion of woodchips'.

He was getting no money at all, but he held an office of profit. The High Court said that the appearance of what was going on was just as signifi cant as the reality.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This proposal is not about marrying an ideological attachment to private ownership with the necessity to balance the books. Partial privatisation of Telstra is one element of a broader telecommunications policy aimed at giving Australians a world class telecommunications industry, not only in terms of technology, but also pricing and quality of service. The other key elements of our policy are the introduction of legislative and institutional arrangements which will promote competition in the provision of services and preserve and enhance universal service.
       </para>

        We are committed to having legislation in place by the end of the year to establish clearly the framework for a more competitive telecommunications market from mid 1997. That legislation will

         continue the Universal Service Obligation in an enhanced form, but we are taking the opportunity in this bill to reaffirm the current requirements placed on Telstra and the other carriers.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Partial privatisation will both benefit Telstra as a companyâ€”by making it even more responsive to market signals and better able to compete domestically and internationallyâ€”and benefit the Australian public through increased investment opportunities, a more efficient communications sector and reduction in public debt via the sale proceeds.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To these benefits the Government has also added the benefits of a billion dollar trust for the natural environment. The important companion to the Telstra Bill is the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill which will establish a trust for the protection and rehabilitation of Australia's precious natural heritage with the first billion dollars of the proceeds of the sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra. The Government undertook that the proceeds of the sale of equity in Telstra would be used to retire debt rather than fund recurrent expenditure. The expenditure on the environment planned for this program would be an investment in Australia's capital for the future. Failure to enact the Telstra Bill would, therefore, entail forgoing a unique opportunity to invest in the maintenance and enhancement of Australia's natural capital.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill contains a single provision which enables the sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra. Reflecting the Government's undertaking that it would not sell more than one&amp;hyphen;third without obtaining another clear mandate at a later election, the bill does not allow the Commonwealth's equity to fall below two&amp;hyphen;thirds.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bulk of the bill comprises provisions aimed at safeguarding the national interest in world class infrastructure and services being spread as widely as possible, a smooth transition from full public ownership to part private ownership and proper monitoring of the continuing public investment through the Commonwealth shareholding.

        In "Better Communications" the Government undertook to ensure that a world class consumer framework was in place before any partial privatisation of Telstra was initiated. The Government gave this undertaking not because it considers the partial privatisation of Telstra will jeopardise current levels of service. Far from it. The Government expects the partial privatisation to improve customer service in the industry.

Anyone who suggests that USO services should be delivered by anything other than the most efficient and economical means practicable is simply advocating the waste of community resources.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed consumer framework also tackles two other problems. First, it tackles perceived existing problems with carrier performance by establishing appropriate operational requirements and enabling AUSTEL to report on the carriers' performance. Second, by establishing those requirements, it removes grounds for any community concerns that the partial privatisation will affect current levels of service.

        It is to assure consumers, both business and residential, that the system will continue to serve them well that the Government has undertaken to implement a number of consumer safeguards prior to the partial privatisation.

Under its plan Telstra reported purchases of goods and services totalling $A4.2bn in 1994&amp;hyphen;95 with almost $A2.8bn or 65% local content. The privately owned carriers, Optus and Vodaphone, have reported comparable or better levels of local content.

        The reporting obligations in the bill have been modelled on those in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and are consistent with the guidelines for "Accountability and Ministerial Oversight Arrangements for Government Business Enterprises" established by the former government.

        Placing reporting obligations in legislation is the most transparent means of retaining access to information on a basis comparable to the current arrangements. Since 1991 Telstra has been a Corporations Law company with an independent Board of Directors, bound by that Law to act in the best interests of the company. This will continue to be the case and Telstra's business activities will operate at arm's&amp;hyphen;length from Government. The Government does not intend to intrude in the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day running of the company and the access to information is to assist in obtaining a broad strategic overview, monitor the performance of the Board and management, and protect taxpayers' continuing investment.

        The bill provides the necessary flexibility in sale arrangements by defining the mechanism through which the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra can be transferred to investorsâ€”"Telstra Sale Scheme"â€”very broadly, so as to include not only conventional single tranche sales, but sales effected through a number of tranches, or through single tranche sales with instalment purchase arrangements.

        The bill allows for a number of different models of instalment purchase arrangements. These arrangements would include models where partly paid shares are initially purchased by investors, with subsequent calls for additional funding being used to obtain the remainder of the proceeds. Other models would involve a so&amp;hyphen;called "sale scheme trustee" acting as an intermediary to hold the legal interest in Telstra shares for investors following the first instalment of the sale. Investors would pay later instalments to the trustee until the shares were fully paid for, at which time they would be transferred to investors.

Moreover, the legislation ensures that Telstra will receive fair reimbursement for any assistance provided.

        One of the most critical justifications for the injection of private equity into our major telecommunications carrier is the need to achieve a more efficient industry and a more efficient Telstra. Virtually every other country in the developed world and many in the developing world, particularly in our own region, are increasingly recognising that true shareholder accountability combined with maximum competition is the best guarantee of lower prices and higher quality of service. Indeed Telstra is now the only carrier in the top twenty telecommunications companies by revenue in the world, which is not already privatised or scheduled to be in the near future. The onus is on those who have so far been content to hide behind outdated ideological defenses of the public sector, to demonstrate that business as usual is going to be anything other than a recipe for declining competitiveness for our major carrier and inferior consumer outcomes for all Australians.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Telstra is a business. The previous government clearly recognised this in making it a Corporations Law Company in 1991 as was authorised by parliament in the Telstra Corporation Act 1991.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Telstra is Australia's third largest company in terms of turnover (after Coles/Myer and BHP) and largest tax payer. It has total assets of $A24.1 bn (at 30
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         June 1995), annual revenues in excess of $A14.1 bn and employs more than 73,000 people.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since incorporation the company has performed creditably posting steady increases in revenues, profits and dividends in the last three financial years. Telstra has achieved this in markets which have been increasingly open to competition but it is also operating in a sector which is growing at around 10 percent per annum which is significantly greater than the economy as a whole.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While there is no doubting the strength of Telstra's balance sheet there is scope for operational, infrastructure and productivity improvements if Telstra is to match world's best practice. Improvements in such areas as operating expenses, digitisation of its network and access lines/revenue per employee are an absolute necessity if Telstra is to remain competitive. They would also translate directly to lower prices and better quality of service for consumers and business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is convinced that the discipline of having performance reflected daily in the price of Telstra's shares will induce improvements in all aspects of Telstra's performance from its customer focus and service through to its financial management and control of corporate overheads.

         A considerable amount of work has already been carried out. Advertising, both in the national press and ethnic newspapers and radio, was carried out in mid&amp;hyphen;October, and a telephone link for concerned outworkers was established. From this some 30 substantial submissions and some 20 phone calls were received. The Committee has already held three public hearings and has conducted inspections of factories and outworker homes in Sydney and Melbourne.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This inquiry was initially established because of allegations of exploitation of outworkers in the garment industry. Over the last 10 years, the number of people working in their homes has increased dramatically while the number of factory&amp;hyphen;based workers has decreased. While the flexibility resulting from this change has probably allowed much of the textile, clothing and footwear industry in Australia to remain viable in the face of industry restructuring, a number of other problems have emerged. Among these are allegations of low rates of remuneration received by some outworkers, the unsatisfactory conditions under which they work and the possible involvement of children in the industry. Secondary problems relating to social security entitlements and taxation laws, are also evident.

         The Committee believes that this inquiry should be completed. The issues are current and national, and they effect several Federal Government agencies. In the Committee's opinion, the inquiry into Outworkers in the Garment Industry is very much worthy of the Senate's attention.

We are asking that the Senate note, firstly, with concern, the recent announcement by the Australian Taxation Office of the closure of 15 regional tax offices; secondly, the failure of the coalition government to intervene to ensure that services are retained in rural and regional areas; and (b), we call on the government to direct the Australian Taxation Office to reverse the decision to close the offices and to ensure that services such as these are maintained in rural and regional Australia.

       Since this motion was presented to the Senate by Senator West, it has become apparent that the Taxation Office closures are but one very small part of sweeping changes, shutdowns, that are occurring right throughout rural and regional Australia as a consequence of the new government's approach to budget matters.

       If the new government had believed it appropriate, it would have been very simple for the new minister to instruct the Australian Taxation Office not to proceed with the closure of the regional tax offices. To use my own state of Tasmania as an illustration, the tax office in Launceston is one of the 15 regional tax offices to be closed. The distressing thing about this from a Tasmanian point of view is that Tasmania is a decentralised state. The majority of people in Tasmania live outside the capital of Hobart, and it is essential to have services such as those provided by the Australian tax office.

Another example is the Family Court in Launceston, which, by the look of things, we will not have for much longer. The Family Court illustrates better than even the tax office the particular problems that rural and regional Australia face. I say that because of what I consider to be some very open but certainly ignorant comments from Mr Len Glare, who is the Chief Executive of the Family Court of Australia. When justifying the closure of the Family Court in Launceston, as a result of cutbacks to services initiated by the new government, Mr Glare said:

       One of the difficulties of the cutbacks in the Customs Service is that the service performs not only a customs function but also a quarantine function. With 24 of the 63 staff going, we would certainly question the ability of the Customs Service to maintain the quality of service. In terms of the quality of service, when the government was in opposition it said that the service was not good enough because there was not enough staff in the quarantine and customs areas. As a consequence of that criticism from the then opposition, the coalition gave an absolute commitment in its election promises not to cut back

       What is happening in Tasmania illustrates what is happening and what is going to happen in other areas of rural and regional Australiaâ€”certainly in North Queensland, rural New South Wales and other areas of South Australia and Victoria. This serves to highlight the sorts of cutbacks to access to government services in a range of areasâ€”higher education facilities, the Family Court, the Taxation Office and Customs. We have no doubt that there will be other cutbacks to services not just in Tasmania but also in rural and regional Australia.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I suppose what makes the cutbacks more evident in Tasmania is that Tasmania is a distinct geographical and political entity. As a regional economy, it is much easier to measure the draconian effects of the cutbacks that are going to occur. There is no doubt that at least 1,000 direct jobs are going to be lost in Commonwealth employment and Commonwealth instrumentalities in Tasmania. Look at the bravado with which the new government promised to cut 10,000 to 20,000 jobs in Telstra to make it more efficient and easier to privatise. There will be hundreds of jobs lost in Tasmania in Telstra. Add to that the university, the Australian Maritime College and a variety of government departments, and it will very quickly add up to a thousand direct jobs.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What is this worth in terms of the Tasmanian economy? It means there will be about $40 million in wages withdrawn from the Tasmanian economy. We then have the multiplier effect: for every three people employed in the public sector, one public sector job. It will mean less demand in the retail sector in the Tasmanian economy. This is going to be true right around Australia in rural and regional economies. I want to point out that rural and regional economies have had it very tough in the last two years because of the drought.

It is an interesting theory, but there is no evidence that that has been occurring in rural and regional Australia, certainly not over the past 10 or 20 years.

The Prime Minister refuses to give undertakings about tied grants. There is about $18 billion in tied grants. It may well be in the guise of economic efficiency, reduction and rationalisation that the Commonwealth says to the states, `We'll give you $18 billion of services but we'll only give you $17 billion of money to fund that $18 billion of services.'

I do not think that will happen. In fact, I am confident that it will not.

       This alleged $8 billion, the so-called black hole, is as a consequence of a couple of issues. Ninety per cent of it comes about as a result of changed forecasts from Treasury. Treasury downgraded economic growth over the next financial year and the following financial year from 3Â¾ per cent to 3Â¼ per cent. It is a result of a change in projections. What happens if, as many private sector economists say, Treasury got it wrongâ€”that, in fact, economic growth is greater than 3Â¼ per cent and 90 per cent of this so-called $8 billion budget deficit is a consequence of the change in projections by Treasury? In fact, there is a good chance the Treasury could be wrong. I noticed, when reading the ANZ bulletin the other day, they are in fact projecting economic growth in the next financial year of least 3&amp;half; per cent to 3Â¾ per cent. The point is, of course, that a one per cent improvement in economic growth means a reduction of about $2 billion on the bottom line of the budget deficit, and that is a very, very significant contribution.

       Another reason for the budget deficit is the fact that, in the last 90&amp;hyphen;odd years, in their entire history, coalition governments have never had a budget surplus, and they are crowing about it now.

        â€”It is one of those decisions which, as I say, was announced earlier than the government had planned to announce it because people had got wind of it. It was not a decision that had been presented for approval by the previous government. The previous Treasurer has no recollection of seeing any material. No material has passed across his desk. So I think it is very important to nail this home very clearlyâ€”this is a decision of the department that has been approved by the conservative government and it is a direct attack upon rural and provincial Australia.

       As I say, those who are protesting are very interesting because they are groups of people who do not normally protest about the closure of offices. They are the local accountants who are very concerned about what is happening, who have utilised and would like to further utilise the tax office. In fact, they will be asking the government to look at an expansion of the role of the regional tax office.

        I have also had information put to me by a previous manager of a regional tax office that the productivity level in regional tax offices was far higher than the productivity level of tax offices in the metropolitan areas. I think that is a pretty sad indictment.

       With the closure of these regional tax offices, we will also be losing services that they offered, particularly to pensioners. I know that in the electorate of Calare in the last few years taxation officers have visited the smaller communities and towns which do not have a regional tax office to offer assistance, particularly to the age pensioners who are having trouble with their tax returns, who want information, help and assistance. That service has been very well received and has

       In my motion I call for an extension of services to country areas, not just by the Australian Taxation Office but also by other services. We have seen in recent years the opening of a DSS office in Bourke. I would like to take a fair bit of credit in joining with the communities in that area to push very hard for the minister and the department to open that office. It might not be a very large town but it is a very important town because it services a very large areaâ€”the more remote areas of north&amp;hyphen;western New South Wales and southern Queensland. It is vitally important.

I can see no quicker or easier way of making cuts and saving money for some of these departments and some of these uncaring ministers than to lop off the small outreach services that are provided. I wonder what will happen to the small Family Court office in Dubbo. A question mark remains there. We know the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is going to suffer cuts. Of course, that is to be expected from a government that does not want people to have rights to complain and rights to seek redress.

What this will mean is that in rural areas, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the CSS will be able to offer fewer outreach programs. There will be fewer officers able to travel from the regional centres out to the smaller communities.

       This will further disadvantage rural people. If they have difficulties with their forms, they will have to wait longer to have problems resolved.

       We see that 200 will be cut from the Bureau of Meteorology. In the last couple of weeks we have seen a report about the Bureau of Meteorology, outlining their absolutely crucial need for a staff increase so that they can provide the services that are needed. This government is about to take 200 staff away from them, a 13 per cent plus cut in their staff establishment. How is that going to affect this country? How is it going to affect rural people?

       We saw some misforecasting recently in western New South Wales in regard to the very large floods that started up around Mungindi in January&amp;hyphen;February of this year. In the Mungindi-Moree area, we were led to believe, one of the more significant flood events was to have occurred. As is the wont and the ability of the weather bureau, the Bureau of Meteorology, they were able to predict the river heights going down the Barwon&amp;hyphen;Darling system. So in six weeks time
       <break page="661" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        a peak would be at Bourke and in another fortnight or a week's time it would be at Louth and Tilpa and Wilcannia. They could give dates as to when the peaks were expected.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       They were quite accurate in regard to the actual dates when the river was going to be at its height, but something happened with their forecasting. The river levels at the lower end of the river did not each anywhere near the predicted heights that were expected from the initial event up around Mungindi&amp;hyphen;Moree. This has a major effect on those farmers and graziers on that river lower down. They are still in drought. They have basically been in drought for five or six years. When they know that they are going to get major inundation they have to move their stock off the lowlands, off the flood plains. Those stock are weak from the drought. There are shortages of water. It places a great deal of stress on those stock for them to have to be moved.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What happened? In a number of areas the river did not break its banks. Therefore, there was no need for that stock to have been moved. So the stock and the farmers, the graziers, were caused additional work and stress. It would have led to the consequential deaths of stock as well. These people cannot afford to lose stock indiscriminately like that. I am not blaming the Bureau of Meteorology, the weather bureau, for that misforecast but it indicates that sometimes things can be wrong. If they are going to lose staff, we are going to have more inaccuracies of that sort occurring.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The other thing that the Bureau of Meteorology does is provide weather forecasts for a number of important areas, particularly aviation. The aviation industry is very dependent upon the weather forecasts. They help to increase safety in the skies of this country, and people living in rural areas are very familiar with having to fly frequently. Another thing the bureau is able to do is predict frosts in fruit growing areas at the beginning of the season, the end of the winter season, when you do not want frosts. If the growers are told that there is not going to be a frost and there is a frost and they have not taken remedial action, they stand to lose crops.
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        These are the sorts of impacts that this reduction of 200 people is going to have. It will reduce the mantle of safety for aviation and increase the costs to grazier and farmers.

How does that impact upon the supervision of aged care facilities? How are we going to ensure a national standard? That is what we have a Commonwealth government for, that is what we have a Commonwealth department forâ€”to ensure a national standard in a lot of these areas.

       There is also to be a huge cut to Worksafe Australia. As I said the other day in my speech during the Address-in-Reply debateâ€”and I will keep repeating itâ€”part of Worksafe Australia incorporates Farmsafe. What is Farmsafe about? Farmsafe is about addressing the occupational health and safety needs of those employed in rural industry. There are three very dangerous industries in this country occupationally: mining, the timber industry and farming. Anybody involved with those industries knows and appreciates just what the dangers in those occupations are. But Worksafe, occupational health and safety, the provision and assistance of information, are all going to be savagely mauled.

        A fortnight ago the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) went to Wagga and laun ched two manuals that Worksafe had put together. One manual is concerned with farm operation, so that when there is an accident of some sort people have information readily at hand on what to do regarding first aid. The other manual is for the emergency service workers, those who are going to have to answer the urgent call, the emergency call.

It is often the women who have to go out and find what there is to be foundâ€”and it can be pretty horrific with tractor rolls and those sorts of nasty things. This government is cutting the assistance to the occupational health and safety provisions and cutting assistance in rural areas. I think that is an absolute shame and catastrophe for those involved. It is something I feel very strongly and very sad about. We also see that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy does not escape. We know the Australian Taxation Office does not escape at a time when it should be doing more.

The number of people being treated by and under the care of that department has not dropped, yet the government is going to drop the staff who are providing the services. Rural visits officers for rural veterans is a very popular service, and becoming more so as veterans and their spouses are ageingâ€”and their needs are increasing. As I have said before, there are
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

They cut $2.5 billion out of the budget last year on the savings provisions. That is the sort of thing that we are having to put up with.

I view with a great deal of concern the recent announcement by the Australian Taxation Office of the closure of 15 regional tax offices. As Senator West has said, the coalition has been doing something about this decision by a bureaucrat, the Commissioner of Taxationâ€”a man who has brought to this decision the typical capital city, golden triangle, bureaucratic approach.

        I might just say, in passing, that it is rather strange that Mr Carmody chose not to announce the cuts until after the election. One may draw some conclusions from that, which I would not want to do. I will say this: Mr Carmody felt compelled by the constraints and mismanagement of the previous government to make economies. In a typical capital city bureaucratic fashion, he has decided that the cuts should be made in regional Australia. I am totally opposed to that and so are most of my colleagues in the coalition. That is why we have been meeting with Mr Carmody to try to do something about it. It is a pity my colleagues opposite did not do something with Mr Carmody either now or before the election, when they possibly had some control.

        It really does show that you do not have to be a bureaucrat in Sydney or Melbourne to be able to administer the tax act properly. The tax act can be administered just as well from Townsville, Toowoomba, Mackay, Cairns, Launceston, Bendigo, Ballarat or any of those regional places. It does not need to be administered from the capital cities, as it increasingly was under Labor, and not just the Taxation Office but all parts of the Commonwealth bureaucracy where the bureaucracy was concentrated and centralised in the golden triangle of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. That does not have to happen. It is just as easy to administer the tax act from Cairns as it is from Sydney.

        The people who are qualified to administer the tax act do not just live in Sydney and Melbourne.

Mr Carmody and other bureaucrats have to understand that the old Labor inspired system of centralised control in big centralised bureaucracies in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra is not the way that the new government will operate. The concerns shown by the coalition members in these meetings with Mr Carmody is meant very much to demonstrate that.

       Furthermore, when he said that it was the Labor government that centralised all Public Service issues in the capital cities, I thought where have you been for the last 13 years? It is quite clear as you look around Queensland and every other state that it was the Labor government that was committed to decentralisation. I know that is the case from my own experience of travelling all over Queensland and seeing services established so there was an equity of service between cities and regional and rural areas. Taxation is symbolic of the possible reduction in regional and rural Australia of other services in areas such as child care, age care, youth, veterans' affairs, the environment, migrants, and Aboriginal and Islander people. We saw a decentralised philosophy during the 1980s and into the 1990s.

        We hear the coalition referring to so-called real jobs. I think Senator Vanstone was referring to this point when she said that the new government would be providing more jobs through the small business sector. We all support the small business sector. We need to work in partnership with the small business sector, but is the small business sector going to provide jobs in respect of aged care, schools, counselling and health care?

        I think there needs to be a complete reassessment of just how important the Australian public sector is. Australia's public sector is already small by international standards. I confess that in the past few years I was concerned when I heard ministers on my side of politics say that the public sector had decreased under our administration. Our public sector is already small by international standards. Australia's public expenditure, tax levels and public debt are amongst the lowest in OECD countriesâ€”that is, the major industrialised countries which have similar living standards to Australia.

Over the years I have had in my office many people who have been very concerned about taxation.

In the 1990s we do not receive the same number of letters or have the same number of constituents visiting us that we did in the 1980s, when there was not this decentralisation of taxation.

       I would like to go back to the election campaign first, however. At one stage during the election campaignâ€”as we all know quite wellâ€”Mr Costello said that there would be 2,500 staff reductions in the Public Service but that the reduction would not be achieved by forced redundancies. That was not accepted in the ACT, where there are about 15 per cent of Commonwealth public servants, and it was suggested at the time that the electorate of Namadgi had gone because of that announcement. All three electorates in Canberra returned Labor members, and that was against the trend of the election in the rest of Australia. Whilst one knows that there are a great number of public servants and people dependent on public servants in Canberra, one must
       <break page="669" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        remember that the greater part of the Commonwealth Public Service is outside Canberra.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The undertaking of a reduction of 2,500 staff does not have any currency now: staff positions which have gone and which have been foreshadowed greatly exceed that 2,500. As early as 10 Aprilâ€”five to six weeks after the electionâ€”there was an announcement that 15 regional tax offices were to close. For the record, these are: Ballarat, Bendigo, Cairns, Elizabeth, Horsham, Launceston, Lismore, Mackay, Mt Gambier, Orange, Rockhampton, Tamworth, Toowoomba, Wagga Wagga and Warrnambool.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I would like to concentrate on what this means in Queensland. Queensland is a greatly decentralised state. In fact, the capital city does not have half the population of the whole state. Four out of those 15 taxation offices to be closed are in Queensland.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Starting in the north of Queensland, the first office I will mention is Cairns. Cairns is a popular growing centre which has a population of about 42,000 people. I would like to know what the local member said to his constituency about the elimination of the regional taxation office in his city. The local member there is, I understandâ€”I have not got used to them all yet, but I willâ€”a Liberal member, Mr Warren Entsch. I think that he should be explaining to the people in his city why people in regional areas cannot have the same service as do people in other parts of the country. We are told that people from Cairns can now go to the post office and pay their taxation. That is fine, but what if they want some advice on a particular taxation matter? They are not likely to get much from the post office.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We then go to Mackay. Mackay is a thriving centre of 23,000 people, and I would like to know what the new National Party member, Mrs De&amp;hyphen;anne Kelly, has said to the local people about the closure of the taxation office in her city.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The next city south is Rockhampton. At about the time of Federation, Rockhampton was considered to be a possible state capital if Queensland were divided into three states, and it is still a major centre. Rockhampton is the gateway to central western Queensland
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        and it has a population of approximately 61,000 people. Rockhampton is popularly known as the city where the railroad runs down the main street. It is not quite the main street, but the railroad does run down one street. Rockhampton is a very pleasant city.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Again, the residents of Rockhampton can pay their tax through the post office, but where do they turn to for advice? Do they make phone calls? Those of us who make phone calls or who hear about the problems our constituents have in making phone calls to offices know that inevitably there are delays. They can write and hope for a reply. I would like to know what the new local member there, Mr Paul Marek, said about the withdrawal of the services to the people of Rockhampton.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The other place where the taxation office is to be withdrawn is Toowoomba. Those who have been to Toowoomba know that it is a pleasant thriving city located on the eastern edge of the Darling Downs. It has approximately 87,000 people, but they will now be denied a local branch of the Australian Taxation Office. What my good friend the Liberal member, Mr Bill Taylor, said to his constituents about the decision I do not know, but I am hopeful that those government members have been agitating to try to have this decision reversed.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I would like to mention one other centre which is not on the list, and that is the Gold Coast. It is of interest to me, because that is where I have my electorate office. The Gold Coast was not one of the centres where an office was closed, and there is a simple reason for that: it does not have a branch of the Australian Taxation Office. Despite the Gold Coast city population of about 330,000 people, it does not have a taxation office, and it seems to me that an office is overdue. The Gold Coast has an Australian Taxation Office presence once a week when officers drive down to the Gold Coast, but I am fearful about what might happen to that once a week service now.

       The announcement which has been mentioned this afternoon was made by Mr Carmody. I am not quite sure whether this was his idea of keeping sweet with his new

        political masters or whether it was for some other reason. He says that staff will be offered positions elsewhere. It would be interesting to know where that might be when staff numbers are collapsing throughout the country like a house of cards.

       Mr Carmody must be able to provide detailed answers about alternative employment for Australian Taxation Office officers in regional areas whose positions have now disappeared. He must be able to answer those questions when the estimates committees sit later this year. We will want to know where staff have obtained employment, whether they had to move, and whether they obtained employment at all.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Whether this matter was initiated by Mr Carmody or not, the withdrawal of services from regional Australia does not seem to have been opposed by the Howard government itself. It may be opposed by some members of the Howard governmentâ€”the people who are close to these regional citiesâ€”but it does not seem to have been opposed by the Howard government itself. If the government does not reverse this decision, it will pay the price for its arrogance to people in regional areas.

It was a particularly effective piece of advocacy that Senator Newman took part in and which defeated the arrogant and centralised move by ADI to relocate part of the functions of that industry to Melbourne.

        I know that because I joined Senator Newman in her campaign. I also know that other senators in this place did so too. It worked. It enabled the Scottsdale materials research laboratory to defeat the attempted justification advanced by ADI. Some figures were produced, there were some economic calculations, there was an occasional suggestion of efficiency and there were internal reviews quoted; but these were all to no avail, because ADI was unable to demonstrate that the relocation was a sensible, practical and useful thing to do. The laboratory remains operating in Scottsdale at the moment. It was demonstrated that centralising the function to Melbourne would not be an appropriate thing to do. But at least ADI attempted a justification for this unilateral effort it was making.

        In this situation described to us today, about the closure of 15 regional tax offices, I have yet to see any objective information advanced to justify these cuts or any of the multitude of percentage cuts being applied willy-nilly, it seems, to a number of departments in the Public Service across Australia. It is not as if there is a report which says that there are 20 people here or 100 people there who are surplus to requirements because of these reasons or because this service is not required by the public anymore. There are no indications of objective evaluation of the service which is being provided, the performance of the staff and how it is in excess to what is necessary.

        . It is a report by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, which I chaired. The committee inquired into service delivery in the Public Service in Australia. During the conduct of that committee's inquiries we noticed that there was some disquiet and community concern about the level of service provided and what measures should be taken to ensure that proper service, the service which Australians are entitled to expect, could be actually delivered.

         significant report. I cannot understand how anybody who has read this and has taken notice of it would endorse in any way the sorts of cuts to our Public Service that we are hearing being proposed by the government. I remind the Senate that on page 12 of that report an employee of the Australian tax office told the committee:

        Devolution, decentralisationâ€”I think they were inevitable directions for the organisation. People wanted service; the community wants service. You cannot persist with a sort of central command type system with everything just sort of coming up to the national office for decision. We were just drowning in that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further on, the same witness described what has happened under the devolution-decentralisation model. The witness said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the Committee's view, devolution and decentralisation have had a mixed impact on service delivery by the APS. Geographically, decentralisation has the potential to give greater access to services in the regions.

        There were many other conclusions that we reached, and I will read some of those shortly. But I would have thought that such a natural conclusion to be reached would be one that would influence any government's decision-making, particularly if those who participated in this inquiry were able to demonstrate the contents of this report to their colleagues.

        I know that other aspects of the committee's inquiry had a particular effect on the members. I share with you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, your concern about the efficiency dividend which was being applied by the government across the board. One recommendation that received particular support from you was recommendation 2.47, which recommended that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . special problems of small agencies be taken into consideration when applying the efficiency dividend.
       </para>
       <para>
        I supported you in that and the committee did as well. There was some publicity about the efficiency dividend, and I know that feeling was shared unanimously across the parties. I
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         also know that the general public was particularly concerned about that and drew our attention to it. In light of that, I cannot understand how the decision makers in the present government could possibly justify moving away from recognising that concern.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The committee also found that we agreed with the Department of Finance and some of the other agencies which are described as central agencies. We agreed that there was a need to continue to monitor and maintain information which would enable the Public Service to make proper decisions about the allocation of resources. It was all very well to talk about best practice across the system, but it was very strange to find that the paths for finding out what best practice was were a little disconnected and hard to find. That led to other recommendations in the committee report which centred on the concept of there being a need for central agencies to monitor resources, share resources and disseminate information.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is ironic that the Commonwealth ombudsman and the Department of Finance were among the earlier targets of cuts to the Public Service. It is hard to understand how monitoring can be conducted if the central agencies are denied the resources to do it. That makes us wonder whether the cuts will deliver the efficiencies that are suggested because, if you cannot monitor, how can you make effective and efficient decisions?

        That led us to the situation where the ANAO was unable to determine whether the level of inoperatives in the Australian Public Service was 7,000 or 10,000.

        I would like to mention one other thing briefly, as I am aware that others would like to speak on this.

       Of course, the Launceston tax office does not employ a lot of people, but it is worth noting that more than 50 per cent of those people live north of Oatlands in Tasmania. Yet the tax office in Hobart employs some 400 people. I know that the coalition's position is to ensure maintenance of services to regional Australia. But unfortunately, in your first eight weeks of government, you have not demonstrated one iota of anything like that commitment. In fact, every step you have taken thus far has led to a reduction in services in regional Australia.

       I am rather curious as to why Warwick Smith, the member for Bass, said, on Tuesday 7 May, in relation to the Australian Tax Officeâ€”and I will quote from this article:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . similar moves had been made before the election by the Australian Tax Office bureaucracy, but that their plans to close the Launceston office was now under review.

      <para>
       I do not know whether the government has it under review; I do not think it has. I understand that there has been a meeting with Michael Carmody. But as to the review at that time Mr Smith did not know. I would have to say that again he was caught short misleading the people of Bass. The only review that was going on at that time was a review by the Australian Taxation Office itself, based on a decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. They directed the Australian Taxation Office to review their closure arrangements on the basis that the AIRC were of the view that the tax office was in breach of industrial agreements it had with its employees. But of course that did not worry Mr Smith. He thought there was an opportunity for him to pick up and say something that was, in fact, not happening.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       But it ought to happen; the government ought to review this decision. Yes, I totally agree with you, Mr Acting Deputy President:

That is a significant number, and it is an even greater trip for them. For them, it could mean eight hours of travel to get to the tax office in Hobart, if that is where everything is going to be centralised.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Of course, the tax office is not the only thing in Launceston that has received a mention for closure. The other little area is the Family Court. The Family Court, again, is the subject of a recommendation. At least the hierarchy of the Family Court were honest enough to come out and say that their decision was based on the requirement of the now government to achieve the requirement of a two per cent reduction in expenditure.

       Again, Mr Smith, the member for Bass, gets a run on this issue. For some time he did not say anything. Yet in the year prior to 7 May he castigated us no end when there was the possibility that the Launceston based judge would not be replaced. In fact, the real question at that time concerned where the judge would live. He wanted to live in Hobart and we at the time said that it was not a matter for us to determine where the person lived but rather to ensure the services were provided.

      <para first-indent="16">
       On 7 May, Mr Smith saidâ€”this is prior to the federal electionâ€”that if the coalition were to win government, he would ensure, in fact he would guarantee, the future of that court. He would guarantee that there would be a Launceston based Family Court judge.

       He did not say anything for a while, but when we got the notice of closure, he was able to come out and say, `The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is considering these things.

I contacted the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's office, and said, `In the light of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's consideration, does that mean there will be a magistrate based in Launceston?'

       Not only do we have the problem with the Family Court and the Taxation Office, but another very important aspect of our economy in Tasmaniaâ€”and, I would suggest, an aspect of national importanceâ€”is the matter of the Australian Maritime College and the Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre. Launceston and Tasmania are very lucky to have a very important facility in the Australian Maritime College. It does a lot of marvellous work. It has been at the leading edge of research for the development of catamarans. It has led and assisted the development of our catamaran building industry in Tasmania.

It also received some $500,000 from the state and, of course, it proceeded with the development. It is a very important development and it is worth

It is an area greater than the land mass area of this country, so it is very important that we stay at the leading edge of research in the maritime industry. It is also worth noting that the maritime industry contributes about $20 billion to the economy. It has been forecast that this contribution will increase to between $50 billion and $85 billion by the year 2020.

The AMC has already entered into memorandums of understanding with two other countries on the basis of this facility proceeding.

So if you took your car over on the boat, you got $150; if you took it back, you got $300â€”provided, of course, that the cost of the fare was more than $300.

What I want to know from the government is this: if we do not get a 20 per cent increase or thereabouts in the number of cars, so that we do not use up $12 million, will the government give an undertaking to give to Tasmania any unused portion of that money?

In that inquiry, all the government senators moaned about the lack of ability on the part of AQIS or customs to actually do the job they are required to do. We are a very large country. In fact, we are the largest island in the world. So why are we cutting these things back? What assessments were done? In all the time we were in government, you were jumping up and down, going on about these things.

        â€”Madam Deputy President, there has been a lot of press discussion in recent times about the impact that the mooted Public Service cuts will have on the ACTâ€”your own electorate. The Chief Minister of the ACT, I think it was yesterday, had meetings with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in respect of these cuts not impacting severely on the ACT. I was greatly amused last night to hear on the ABC national newsâ€”and to see it repeated in the print media this morningâ€”that the Prime Minister had assured the Chief Minister of the fact that the ACT would not be singled out for special attention. Last night on the ABC news it was carried in the words that the brunt of the cuts would not fall on the ACT.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The reason that I was somewhat amused by that statement, which I guess the Chief Minister of the ACT had to make to put some kind of face on the outcome of the meeting she had with the Prime Minister yesterday, was that that was hardly news. That statement indicated clearly that the Chief Minister of the ACT got no assurances whatsoever from the
       <break page="678" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        Prime Minister about negative impacts on the ACT in respect of these cuts. He simply told her what everyone already knows: that 70 per cent plus of Commonwealth public servants do not work in the ACT, but work across the length and breadth of Australia, particularly, in respect of my own portfolio, primary industry, in rural and regional Australia.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       So it must have been a fairly barren meeting for her yesterday with the Prime Minister. I guess it was a fairly desperate attempt by her, being a political colleague of the Prime Minister's, to put the best face on it she could by stating the obvious. The obvious has already started. As I said in the Senate just the other day and in a press statement that I issued yesterday in the Northern Territory, the cuts and the sackings have already begun, making an absolute mockery of the assurances and promises that were given to the electorate prior to polling day that there would not be sackings in the Public Service, that there would be no forced redundancies, that it was all going to happen by natural attrition.

      <para first-indent="16">
       I spoke personally to a number of Northern Territory Commonwealth public servants. This is how I found out about it, simply in the normal course of their business. I had to ring them on a number of issues. I felt a little guilty, after occupying one of them for 10 minutes on my problems, to be told by him at the end, after patiently and courteously hearing me out, that unfortunately he would not be able to follow it up as only four days before he had been told that he was sacked and that the entire functionâ€”not only his jobâ€”of the section in which he worked was being closed down and shifted elsewhere.

       That is why I noted with some interest the complaint made here in the Senateâ€”I think it was in question timeâ€”just the other day by Senator Harradine that already this was happening in Tasmania, with entire services being closed down in Tasmania and the functions of those services being shifted to Victoria. Indeed, I regret to say that it is already happening in my own electorate of the Northern Territory. It was always going to happen with these cuts.

How did Senator Alston in this new sensitive, caring government we now have refer to it today in question time with respect of Telecom? What did he call it? A `sheltered workshop', I think. A pack of bludgers public servants were, in sheltered workshopsâ€”a brilliant observation by the new sensitive, caring Howard government from one of its senior ministers.

         â€”With respect, Madam Deputy President, the interjections are so loud that it is very difficult to ignore them. Perhaps if he could just make them a little more quietly. The problem is, to go back to Senator Campbell's continuous interjections and his `What did you do?', in my own department of primary industry over a period of years efficiency cuts were made in the order of 20 per cent. We instituted, and it was proper to do so, an efficiency dividend across the Public Service to ensure that it did not get out of hand. By comparison with other OECD countries we do not have a bloated Public Service in Australia, as is constantly referred to by the opposition. That is why I said that

        There is this nonsense being perpetuated at the moment by even up to and including the Prime Minister that somehow or other the public servants who are now being axed can blame us because a certain percentage of these cuts were already in place prior to the election. What a nonsensical and illogical position to take.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yes there were cutsâ€”and we do not think they should have gone any further. That is precisely the point I am making. It is a silly position that the government and its senators in here are taking on this issue. We did introduce efficiencies and we believe that those efficiencies were squeezing the Public Service to the point where it really should not responsibly have gone any further, particularly because of the impacts on rural and regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I say to Senator Campbell that I know from personal conversations I have had with what will now shortly be former Commonwealth public servants in the Northern Territory that the cuts the government is instituting go way beyond what we considered was reasonable. These are people who have lost their jobsâ€”they have simply been told they will be losing their jobs shortlyâ€”whom I know we would not have forced retrenchments on. I thank Senator Campbell for assisting me to make my case. Of course we introduced efficiencies into the Public Service. Our complaint is that you are taking that too far, that you are going way beyond the point you need to go to. You are trying to make a virtue out of it. That is precisely the case that is rightly being made.

        The problem is, as Senator Sue West knows, that the primary industry minister has already announcedâ€”it was during the election campaignâ€”that severe cuts are going to be made in the very program, the rural access program, that employs rural counsellors. Services such as the Freecall services, providing information to rural residents of Australia and which, when I left office, were receiving 50,000 telephone calls a year, are going to be closed down, according to the minister. That was even announced during the election campaign. From memory, a $5&amp;half; million cut in the rural adjustment scheme has been announced.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These things should not be skated over in this debate. Not only is the government unnecessarily escalating the rate at which these services in areas outside Sydney and Melbourne are going to be withdrawn, it is also cutting programs that the former government put into place to compensate to some extent. A crisis exists in rural communities with their services being withdrawnâ€”but the government has put that up in lights. It stated that baldly before polling day.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        God alone knows at the momentâ€”I do not think that is strictly correct; in a sense I suppose the Treasurer and the finance minister know as wellâ€”the extent to which those projections by the then shadow minister for primary industry of the cuts will be escalated. Why do I consider that to be a matter of great regret? I will tell you why. It is because most of those services were put into place because of representations we received from rural women.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We see all these crocodile tears being wept today by members of the governmentâ€”and it is politically correct to do so and the great critics of politically correctness are pretty good at it themselvesâ€”who are saying they will concentrate on women's issues, yet the very programs that women place a higher
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why is that an issue? It is because they are the most vulnerable programs. It is very easy to get rid of them. When you get the instruction from Finance or Treasuryâ€”and I, like any other former cabinet minister, know how it worksâ€”you are simply told in a non&amp;hyphen;discretionary way that you have to find 10 per cent or two per cent. You sit down with your departmental secretary and look at the core services that are provided by your department. After trying at least to put a wall around them to protect them, all other services, however important, that are further out in that priority are up for cuts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Where does that tend to be in my portfolio? It is in the rural counselling services, in things like telecentres that provide rural communities with facilities that do not exist in those communities because of the small populations, and in the 008 numbers we provide. They are always the vulnerable services. Do not think, Mr Acting Deputy Presidentâ€”I would not pretend otherwiseâ€”that they were not targeted at every single budget when we were in government. They were. But I have to say to our credit that we preserved them against those attacks from Finance and Treasury.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But we have already had an acknowledgment from the current primary industry minister that those services, particularly those valued by rural women, are going to be chopped. We have to wait for the extent of those cuts. I want to put on record in this debate this afternoon my deep regret at cuts in a number of programsâ€”I confess a proprietorial interest in themâ€”that were valued so highly by me, in terms of seeing the work on the ground done by those people.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The BARA services, the business advice to rural areas program, is another to be cut. In my electorate of the Northern Territory I am familiar with a BARA office that has helped start 114 new small businesses since it has been set up in this small rural town in the Northern Territory. It is greatly valued by the community which, of course, contributes to its financial upkeep as a result. But we provided the seed money, as you must do in these
        <break page="681" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         circumstances, to get it up. The minister has already announced that the program that supplies funding to the BARA program is going to be cut. The agribusiness program, to my total astonishmentâ€”with the emphasis that has to be put on exports in Australiaâ€”was also singled out by the minister for budget cuts.

        As I said a little earlier in this debate, the poor old Chief Minister of the ACT is trying to put the best face she can on what she got yesterday from the Prime Ministerâ€”which was obviously nothing. She simply stated the obvious. I agree with her. The ACT is not going to be singled out for these cuts; she is right about that. That assurance is no assurance at all. It is rural and regional Australia that is going to cop the bulk of these cuts, not the ACT. Those cuts have already begun. It simply means, in the case of the particular concerns I raised about the Northern Territory, that territorians who had the opportunity to have direct access to the offices concerned will now have to direct their inquiries to another state several thousand kilometres away from where they live.

        I spoke to Senator Harradine about this at that time. I was interested because it struck a chord with me to hear Senator Harradine making the same complaint about services that had already been shifted from Tasmania. I will make the point again: these are the vulnerable services; these are the ones that are very easy to chop off at the outside.

        In conclusion, there is clearly a significant element of scare campaign going on with all of these projected cuts. All political parties do it. You drum it up and you drive the argument through the roof and frighten the daylights out of everybody as to the extent of the cuts, and then, finally, the budget comes down and the cuts are only half as bad as the rumour mills have them. Everyone is then supposed to breathe a sigh of relief and say, `Oh, thank goodness; it could've been a lot worse than that.' Then, with the smoke and mirrors removed, hopefully everyone will ignore the fact that what has been done will have a catastrophic impact.

        â€”I only left the chamber for five minutes. Senator Chris Evans considered it a matter of great moment and the very next day raised in the Senate my gross discourtesy to the Senate. If he wants to do his job as opposition whip he should have had Senator West listening to this boring debate.

       So, in fairness, I can understand why the Labor Party has not insisted on having Senator West here to listen to the debate. The point is pretty clear. If Senator Sue West, who moved this motion, was genuine about it, she would be sitting in here listening to every word that has been spoken. I am sure she would not want to listen to your words, Senator Collins. She would not learn much from them but she should be in the chamber,

         Senator Knowles has conveyed her version of events to a wide range of people and in the process has caused much pain and anguish to our family. My privacy and that of my children was ignored and disregarded.

         Senator Knowles stated "It disturbed me, as a consequence, that the Senator's estranged wifeâ€”whom, I might add, I assisted to stay in hiding for over 12 monthsâ€”telephoned me just after midnight soon after the disclosure of the restraining order this year and accused me of betraying her trust. I also totally reject that . . . "
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I am most certainly not estranged from my husband and I am offended by that assertion by Senator Knowles. Senator Knowles did not assist me to stay in hiding as she puts it. The circumstances of my telephone call to Senator Knowles are as follows:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         On 27 March 1995 our family travelled to Geraldton for the funeral of my father who had died of cancer, which was to be held the following day. To add to our distress my husband had that morning received a disgusting "dirt sheet" by facsimile which alleged to set out some circumstances surrounding the restraining order.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I had been aware for some time that Senator Knowles was quite openly discussing the matter so the evening of my father's funeral, upon returning home I was extremely upset and I rang Senator Knowles, told her I had just returned from my father's funeral and said I wanted to talk to her. Senator Knowles attacked me and as I was in no state to respond I said goodnight and put the telephone down.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I believe that Senator Knowles obtained a copy of the restraining order and had it reproduced in her office. I have in my possession a statutory declaration obtained by me which supports my belief. I ask Senator Knowles why was it necessary to give it to anyone. Why did she reproduce it and distribute it, particularly given that she claims to have been "totally supportive and retain the expected respect for my position associated with such a totally distressing time" as she cares to describe it.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         One matter of particular concern to me is Senator Knowles' public claim as to my professional relationship with Mr Viner. Her assertion is wrong.

         I conclude on this note. This matter has caused enormous distress, trauma and anguish to myself and my three children. I have always been an intensely private person notwithstanding my husband's public office. The ensuing publicity has totally engulfed my children and myself. The public humiliation and attention to our family has been compounded by harassment and intimidation to my children and me by the media. There have been occasions when we have feared and have been unable to enter or leave the family home because of the media.

         I was a member of the Joint Committee on Migration which presented a report on the migration agents registration scheme. I will not delay the Senate for long. The report of the committee raises the question of how far governments can go, in effect, in licensing people who work as migration agents. It was prepared because of concern about the way some migration agents are working.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Included in its cover is consideration of solicitors. The term `migration agent' can encompass solicitors. I am concerned that solicitors should be licensed by the state. That will happen in Victoria shortly. In my view, it is a problem. In so far as we have done it at a Commonwealth level, it causes concern.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The legal profession, at its best, is there to represent people in their stand against the state, to stop the exercise of arbitrary power by the state, to speak for the individual's rights against the power of the state. It is also, of course, there to help one citizen in an action against another.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, in so far as the state purports and, in fact, does license solicitors, it tends to take away that appearance of independence that they should have. Journalists argue, with some merit, that newspapers should never be licensed by the state because that would take away from them the ability to express freely and without fear their comments on what has happened, not only in parliament but generally, and their ability to fairly and fearlessly report matters, and that would be bad for the general health of our state.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Likewise, it is bad for the general health of our state if we have a system whereby government can license the legal profession, because the legal profession is there to represent the individual against the onslaughts of a more powerful opponent. Just as it is argued that the press should have freedom from direction by government, so in my view the legal profession should be in that position.

          There is a tendency these days more and more for governments to say that they should go about the licensing of the legal professionâ€”always for the best of reasons, of course. But the public good that comes from attempting to license the legal profession is far outweighed by the need of the public good to have an independent legal profession that stands up against the state and against any exercise of arbitrary power against the citizenâ€”whether the exercise of that power be by the state itself or by some big corporation or organisation.

         On 9 November 1994, the Senate referred the following matter to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report: the administration and management of all aspects of the operations of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Serviceâ€”AQIS.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the course of the inquiry, the committee took over 2,400 pages of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         evidence from 77 submissions and 142 witnesses. The committee held 22 public hearings, travelling to Tweed Heads, Cairns and Thursday Island and every capital city, except Darwin.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee inspected rock lobster and prawning facilities at Fremantle, Western Australia; salmon breeding and processing sites, ballast water research facilities at the CSIRO and infestation of the Pacific seastar in the Derwent River, Hobart, Tasmania; and lychee and mango farms and packing operations near Cairns, Queensland. The committee also inspected northern Australia quarantine strategy operations on Thursday Island and other islands in the Torres Strait. The committee is grateful to those persons who gave their valuable time to conduct these inspections.
        </para>
        <break page="684" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The responsibilities and activities of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service cover a huge range of issues. These include responsibility for defending Australia against incursions of exotic pests and diseases, formulation of quarantine policy for imports as varied as cooked and uncooked foodstuffs, live animals and genetic material, and certification of every kind of primary agricultural product to the satisfaction of Australia's export markets. AQIS also has responsibility to represent Australia on international plant and animal health committees, and to engage in bilateral and multilateral negotiations over access to export markets for Australian agricultural products and in order to justify Australia's own quarantine restrictions which, I might say, have some times been suggested as non&amp;hyphen;tariff barriers, even though they are not.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In order to discharge its quarantine functions, AQIS screens passengers, cargo and mail at international points of entry to Australia, operates the northern Australia quarantine strategy specifically to deal with the quarantine threats posed by the proximity of mainland Northern Australia to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands, and is involved in research into the management of exotic pests introduced by the ballast water released into Australian ports by international shipping.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Certification that agricultural exports are free from pests, weeds and disease is required by most importing countries, and AQIS is responsible for providing this service to Australian exporters. The biggest part of AQIS's inspection program is in the export meat sector. In other words, to maintain the validity of the green Australia image.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Over the years, the quarantine and inspection service has been the subject of numerous reviews and reorganisations. The most recent of these occurred as a result of the budget 1993&amp;hyphen;94 when the government announced a major restructuring reform package for AQIS. This package included reorganisation of AQIS's internal structure, measures designed to improve AQIS's client focus and its role as a facilitator of export business, and a requirement that AQIS recover 100 per cent of its
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           user attributable costs calculated on a full accrual accounting basis. That, of course, demonstrates the very efficient way in which the previous Labor government went about its work.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These reforms were designed in part to address complaints, particularly from industry users of AQIS services, that AQIS was inefficient, had industrial relations arrangements which were detrimental to industry interests and did not do enough to facilitate Australia's agricultural export industries. That raised the question of whether it should be a facilitator or a regulator.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee received evidence from several industry groups, and particularly from the meat industry, expressing significant concerns about these matters. However, concern was also expressed by several witnesses that AQIS's current structural arrangements were an impediment to significant improvements in the organisation's efficiency and effectiveness, and that improvements in specific areas were dependent upon major organisational reform. Again, that raised the question of whether people saw it as a facilitator or regulator. I think at first it was a regulator but that did not prevent it being a facilitator at the same time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Accordingly, the committee saw two main aspects to its task in this inquiry. Firstly, the committee sought to determine whether medium to long term challenges in quarantine and inspection can be met by AQIS under its current structural and administrative arrangements. Secondly, the committee examined particular concerns raised in evidence with a view to making recommendations which would assist AQIS to discharge its functions more effectively.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In relation to the first issue, the committee formed the view that AQIS is an organisation in transition and that the reform process, while still incomplete, has already led to significant improvements. In the committee's view, any major restructuring of AQIS may jeopardise this process without any assurance of a concrete benefit being gained. In particular, the committee rejected the view that AQIS should be removed from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.
         </para>
         <break page="685" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           As part of the department, AQIS has access to broader policy information and expertise on its 11 commodity groups, as well as international developments in trade and quarantine. The committee considers that this coordination and integration is critical and must be maintained. However, the committee considers that several aspects of the administration and management of the operations of AQIS need to be reviewed, reformed or improved and, accordingly, the committee made 14 recommendations.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           With respect to industrial relations arrangements, particularly in the meat industry, the committee notes that AQIS has negotiated some reforms with its work force which will allow for greater flexibility and alignment of inspectors' and industry practices. The committee considers, however, that AQIS cannot achieve this transformation alone, and that significant gains in industrial relations reform can only be achieved through a process of cooperation between AQIS, industry organisations, individual unions, relevant unions and workers.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Accordingly, the committee has recommended as a matter of priority that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy establish a task force comprising relevant government officers, industry groups, representatives of the meat industry, union officials and other relevant parties to identify and address critical issues in industrial relations between industry and AQIS with a view to achieving a cooperative working relationship based on a high degree of accountability as well as efficiency, flexibility, trust and goodwill. To me that means maximising cooperation in terms of communication.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Another major issue which faced the committee during its inquiry was the debate over several draft import risk assessments relating to proposals to import products hitherto excluded from Australia on quarantine grounds. These were the draft import risk analyses on uncooked Pacific salmon, untreated grain from North America and cooked chicken meat from Thailand, the USA and Denmark.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The evidence received on this issue can be classified into two categories. Some witnesses
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            accepted that the risk assessment was an appropriate approach to quarantine management, but rejected the scientific adequacy of a particular assessment. Other witnesses maintained that the risk assessment methodology itself should be rejected and that Australia should maintain a no&amp;hyphen;risk as opposed to a risk management approach to quarantine policy.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The committee has endorsed the risk analysis and risk management approach applied by AQIS as the only realistic approach to allocating resources to quarantine risk. The committee acknowledges that these concepts are widely misunderstood and has recommended that AQIS develop strategies to explain its risk analysis and management approach to quarantine and inspection. While endorsing this approach, the committee notes that the process can only maintain its integrity and independence if AQIS has access to relevant scientific and technical expertise, and consults fully with relevant industries in order to use the industries' practical experience, and bases quarantine decisions on scientific grounds rather than on trade related considerations. That is a very important issue.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The committee considers that quality assurance is an important management tool which, when properly implemented, contributes significantly to improved food quality and safety. However, in the context of quarantine, the committee considers that it is counterproductive to regard quality assurance programs primarily as cost cutting devices. The adoption of quality assurance programs may result in long term savings on quarantine inspection costs, but the motivation for adoption must be a commitment to improve and maintain standards and quality.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           If the current quality assurance programs are to be extended, the committee considers that a strong cooperative working relationship must exist between AQIS and industries. Given the costs and daunting task of establishing quality assurance programs, AQIS, in its promotional material and training programs, must provide maximum support and encouragement. (

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The committee received a significant amount of evidence expressing concern that
           <break page="686" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            AQIS's staffing and resource levels were inadequate, particularly in the area of quarantine and international liaison. The committee considers that lack of resources in these areas would constitute a significant diseconomy in the long term and recommends that the government undertake a review of staffing and resource levels so that the integrity of Australia's quarantine and inspection services can be maintained. The government has now changed but the attitude of the committee remains constant.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The committee has recommended other administrative management reforms, including that AQIS better disseminate information to industry about cost recovery methodology and charge rates; that AQIS ensure that detection of any incursion of an exotic pest or disease by the Northern Australian quarantine strategy automatically triggers coordinated and clear strategies and responses; that AQIS develop and maintain more effective channels of communication to on-site inspectors, ensuring that they are routinely informed of the outcomes of the investigation of matters raised by them and whatever remedial action has been taken; and that, as a matter of priority, AQIS carry out its commitment to the committee to extend workshops and client focus to all staff.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The committee considers that Mr Paul Hickey, the Executive Director of AQIS, and other senior officers are highly competent and committed to the organisation and commends AQIS for the improvements already made in the organisation since 1993-94. The implementation of the committee's recommendations should assist in improving AQIS's client focus and its relationship with industry and increase the organisation's ability to meet future challenges in quarantine and inspection in Australia. I commend the report to the Senate.

          â€”As a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, it is certainly a pleasure to support the remarks Senator Burns just made. This is possibly the last report Senator Burns will present in his role as chairman and probably as a senator. I would like to say as

The only great disagreements we had were about a particular tune we were playing on a piano in Kakadu and over the shearing report. Apart from that, I think Senator Burns has been doing his very best, as have the rest of us on the committee, for the rural people of Australia.

         I wish to speak about only one aspect of the report: the risk assessment process. When we talk about risk, whether it be initial risk or no risk it conjures up the real problem we have with quarantine in Australia, particularly in Tasmania. We are an island state. We rely on aquiculture and agriculture for a major part of our income. Anything that can ruin those industries has to be looked at very carefully.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I note that in the last week or so the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) took emergency action to prevent the importation of farm machinery from North America because of the karnal bunt disease scare. Karnal bunt is a virus in wheat that could wipe out an industry. Using the minister's words, `If this disease reached Australia, it could easily ruin the Australian wheat industry'. That shows us just how susceptible we are to disease and how important it is that our quarantine service be kept at its absolute maximum efficiency.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The examination of AQIS by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee was conducted at a time when the activities of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service were the subject of ongoing public scrutiny. There have been many critics of the service over quite some time. I suppose AQIS will continue to be scrutinised by the parliament and other committees. It is important that they are because it is so important to rural Australia that the quarantine service is kept operating in its most efficient manner.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I return to what I mentioned earlier: the risk analysis process. The risk analysis principles adopted by AQIS as they apply to the importation of uncooked Pacific salmon, grain and cooked chicken meat highlighted during the

          inquiry the difficult path which AQIS must tread. My colleague Senator Murphy is also very interested in the importation of uncooked salmon. He likes to drop a line in the water occasionally in Tasmania. Being a good senator from that state, he would be most concerned about anything that could jeopardise its native fish. He would know, as I do, that the Tasmanian salmon industry has become a very significant employer and export earner for our state of Tasmania.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our investigation into AQIS highlighted that judgments about the level of risk can be the subject of genuine dispute, but it also highlighted the need for the risk assessment process to retain its integrity and independence so that the growers and the people involved in the industry can have confidence in that particular process. To that end, the committee was of the very strong view that AQIS must have access to the best scientific and technical expertise available; that it must consult fully with relevant industries and use the experience of those industries; and that, finally, any quarantine decisions or decisions made to change the current importation restrictions must be based on scientific grounds and not on trade related considerations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Put quite simply, if we are going to base our quarantine service on trade related considerationsâ€”that is, if we are wanting to do favours for other countries for trade&amp;hyphen;offs, such as, for instance, Canada bringing Canadian salmon here for the trade-off of Australia exporting more beef to Canadaâ€”we will certainly expose our unique agriculture and aquiculture industries to unacceptable risk. That is just not on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee formed the view that AQIS must develop strategies to better explain and disseminate the information on its risk analysis and management process for quarantine so that there can be a better understanding amongst those special interest groups which it affects. I remember very well the day that Senator Sherry first announced the risk analysis draft report in Hobart on the salmon industry. Everybody was jumping up and down, and a lot of that was caused by ignorance.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Whilst it was reassuring to hear from AQIS, when it gave evidence to us, that it possesses the necessary expertise to undertake comprehensive risk assessments, it was the view of our committee that there was a need to complete a review of AQIS resources and, if necessaryâ€”and some people on our side might not agree with this at the momentâ€”increase staffing and resources for AQIS because we just cannot afford the risk. The money comes second to the affordable risk that we do not want to take.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I know that the salmon industry in Tasmania shares the view of the committee that any assessment of risk should not be undertaken until a detailed research program has been completed. It was certainly evident to our committee that this assessment should be relevant to Australian conditions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the most glaring problems to emerge in our investigations of AQIS is the present standard practice of consulting industry after the development of initial risk assessment. As happened in Tasmania, they brought down this initial risk assessment report. They had not consulted industry and, of course, it is easy to see the concern that was raised amongst interest groups such as the salmon industry, because of ignorance. Any initial draft could be the subject of inaccuracies, as in this case I believe it was. When there has not been consultation with the industry as there should be, it is highly likely that those inaccuracies will get out of all proportion.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It was also evidentâ€”using the Tasmanian salmon industry as an exampleâ€”that where a draft IRA document is released, and there has not been detailed involvement from the industry prior to its release, the inevitable result, as has been the case, is a long period of expensive and bitter dispute, where not only AQIS is placed in the position of criticism but the whole industry feels as if it has been unreasonably threatened. Then the whole process seems to get off the rails. That is what has happened in the case of the salmon industry in Tasmania.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Our committee has found it extremely difficult to understand why extensive discussions with the salmon industry did not occur before the draft IRA was released. I am afraid

Only last weekâ€”thanks to the intervention of the parliamentary secretaryâ€”we got the process back on the rails, but, had it not been for Senator Brownhill's timely interjection on that situation, I think AQIS may have made some rather hasty decisions that would not have been in the best interests of Tasmania or the Tasmanian salmon industry.

          â€”I too want to speak on this report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. There are a lot of things that have been said that I agree with, but I do want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Australian Democrats do have a dissenting report. It is not very long, but it does go to the heart of the things that Senator Calvert was saying. It really is in relation to the whole debate about whether or not we have a policy of risk assessment and risk management as preferable alternatives to a no-risk option for quarantine policy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Democrats want to raise a philosophical point at this stage. While risk management may seem to be a more technically realistic approach than a no-risk option, we point out that risk management may be simply an excuse for a minimalist approach to quarantine monitoring services. I do not say that lightly. I would say to you that the risk management approach, which we have all been experiencing, has proved to be a failure. It has been a failure in Tasmania and it has been a failure in North Queensland, particularly with the incursion of the papaya fruit fly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason it has failed is that risk management and risk analysis are a very inexact way of achieving the protection of our industries which ought to be paramount, because it is always debatable where you draw the line in terms of a barrier. We found that the barrier in North Queensland was full of holes in terms of the papaya fruit fly.

          While, for financial reasons, risk management and risk analysis may seem to be the way to go, I believe that Australian consumers and Australian agricultural industries expect that no risk ought to be the goal of our quarantine services. While, for financial reasons, that may be a very difficult goal to attain, it certainly ought to be the goal. When we introduce any other kind of goal, the practice always falls far short of the way in which we describe the goal if we describe it as anything less than a no-risk policy. While we may not always attain a no-risk policy, that certainly ought to be the goal. That is what Australians expect of their quarantine service.

          There is no way you could convince people in North Queensland that you can have risk analysis or risk management. They demand a no&amp;hyphen;risk policy in terms of the papaya fruit fly.

I am sure that I will continue to follow the committee and endeavour to become a participating member. I am very pleased to say that this report covers a very important area which deserves supportâ€”support which the government ought to give it.

          â€”I did not plan to stand to speak to this reportâ€”that is, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. But I do feel the need to speak briefly on the aspect that has been represented by more than one senator here: the issue of risk assessment.

         What I have not heard expressed here is that what AQIS has been set is, in fact, an impossible task. The reason it was set the impossible task relates to what Australia has signed up to under the Uruguay Round of GATTâ€”and that is, that the onus of proof has shifted to countries like Australia. That is why the proof and risk assessment become so difficult. What we have signed up to under the Uruguay Round of GATT is that countries
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          like Australia have to prove without doubt that the importation of such live fish, fish food, and so on, will have a devastating impact on their industry.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is almost impossible to prove. Talk to scientists in lots of areas, and they will tell you that it is almost impossible to prove until it has happened. That is why we are finding instancesâ€”unfortunately, a growing number of instancesâ€”where either viruses or plant diseases, and in this case fish diseases, are being brought in because Australia has to prove that it will destroy the industry. The only way, generally, that you can prove without doubt that it will destroy the industry, unfortunately, in terms of aquatic pests, is when it is too late.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have been saying this all along. We all sat in here during the Uruguay Round of GATT, and people almost spat at me in corridors because we wanted to talk about the whole process of reversing the onus of proof. That is why it is so difficult for any of the bodies for whom we have set the task to prove that Australian industry is at riskâ€”because the task we have set them is almost impossible. We have signed up to this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was even more gleefully signed up to by other countries, because many of these diseases are diseases that have been rife or destroyed other industries in other parts of the world. Australia, because of its peculiar geographical situation, has resisted these diseases. In the past our rules allowed us to take a protective approach in relation to imports; that is, if there was a reasonable concern about such diseases spreading, Australian laws were allowed to prevent the importation of those goods which may have spread that disease.

         <break page="692" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          That becomes so much more difficult as we have to change our laws; we have to turn ourselves inside out to try to prove something which may become in the end impossible to prove until it is too late. It might be fish diseases, it might be plant diseases, it might be newcastle disease. If we set a fairly small resourced group like AQIS this task of having to prove without doubt that it will destroy the industry for every single potential case of which you can think, then even if it is pos sible one by one to prove this we have set them an impossible task.

         All I am saying is that we did tell you so. But it is time to start thinking about not just what we do, how we flog AQIS in response to whether or not they have done their job right, but how we have made the decisions in the first place which have created what I believe is an unacceptable situation in creating an ongoingâ€”not just for this one thing, but an ongoingâ€”acceptable risk for Australian agriculture and the Australian natural environment. Many of these diseases have the ability to transmutate into natural species. It would be bad enough to destroy our chicken industry, but it would be even worse if we then destroy the natural wildlifeâ€”and this is what we have left ourselves open to.

         I wish to make a few brief remarks in relation to this report from the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on an inquiry into the Commonwealth's actions in relation to Ryker (Faulkner) v. the Commonwealth and Flint. In prefacing my remarks, I wish to pay tribute to the former chair of that committee, my colleague from Western Australia Senator Chris Ellison. I am pleased that he will be chairing the legislation committee. I also thank the secretariat for the work that they did in assisting members in coming to, once again, a unanimous report.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note that, when this reference was before the Senate it was argued on party lines and opposed by the then government. However, it was good to see that, when we settled down into the committee system, we were able unanimously to come to a conclusion. Without going through all the history, this was basically a claim by two citizens who believed that the Commonwealth had intervened in improper ways to defeat a legal action they had going.

          I believe that they were, in a way, justified in thinking that that was the case because of the way certain Commonwealth government departments had behaved. There was not the degree of transparency that I believe there ought to have been. In addressing this report, we should also congratulate Fia Cumming and Allan Howden for the work they didâ€”and, in fact, are still doingâ€”in trying to get documents from the Department of Defence and others. At the end of the day, it appears that, if anything, it boiled down to the fact that their complaints were really against their legal advisers as opposed to the Commonwealth departments.

         <para first-indent="16">
          However, one matter of concern did arise. That was that, where somebody is legally aided to fight the Commonwealth under the Bankruptcy Act, if those people are bankrupt, then a minister needs to make a determination ultimately as to whether funds ought to be made available for the case to proceed. Where the Commonwealth is the defendant, there is very real potential for a perceived conflict of interest.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That became an issue during the hearing. As a result, the committee recommended that, in cases involving a claim against the Commonwealth, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General should review arrangements relating to the provision of advice on funding under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act in order to ensure that any perception of a conflict of interest on the part of the Commonwealth does not arise.

          I believe that that is a very important matter of principle that needs to be considered by the new government. I trust that in its response the new government will look favourably upon that recommendation. We have a very fine justice system in this country. Admittedly, it has a lot of flaws but, at the end of the day, it is a pretty good system. Whenever we find flaws in that system, I believe that we are duty bound to try to overcome those flaws. Once again, this committee did that on a unanimousâ€”in fact, a tripartisanâ€”basis, to ensure that our legal system and our justice system is as refined as we can possibly make it.

         I also give credit to the chair of the committee, Senator Ellison from Western Australia. He did a phenomenal job in holding together the committee on what had the potential to be a very divisive issue, both within the committee and within the community. Senator Ellison managed the committee with acumen and grace, and it was a credit to him. I think the report itself is evidence enough of that matter. Senator Ellison will remain on the committee during the life of the next parliament.

Without diminishing or disregarding the issues the committee was looking at, this report brought very much to the fore the matter of legal aid to people who are involved in litigation in this country.

         It might appear to some people that the Faulknersâ€”the people involved in the litigation that the committee was examiningâ€”did not receive any legal assistance. In actual fact, over the life of the legal cases that they were involved in, they received something like $130,000 in public funds to assist them with their case. That is not an inconsequential amount of money. However, it does bring to the fore the many thousandsâ€”probably hundreds of thousandsâ€”of people in Australia

          now who cannot receive any form of legal assistance at all. Even when they do receive some form of legal aid from the various legal aid commissions around the country, there are many conditions attached to that legal aid.

         In my own state of Western Australia, some 40 per cent of applicants for legal assistance in the last financial year were rejected out of hand. There was no money available for them. Some 5,500 people were unable to get legal assistance from the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia. The very last paragraph of the committee report draws attention to the matter of the lack of funds available for legal assistance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         Inquiry into education and training in correctional facilities

        . Senators on the committee moved around Australia and went into prisons around Australia and examined the nature of the education and rehabilitation of prisoners. This matter has become topical in recent times because of the riots in the prisons in South Australia. It became so topical that, on the ABC the other night, Tony Delroy scheduled a one&amp;hyphen;hour session to discuss the state of prisons. I had the opportunity to ring inâ€”if any of you were listening from 10 to one until 20 past one in the morning, you would have heard meâ€”to speak about the work of this committee and the work of the Senate.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The way in which we have made recommendations for the improvement of prison education in Australia is basically as is shown in the introduction to this report. We found that education in prison was a disgrace, but that does not mean it has not improved. It was, actually, appalling previously; it is now a disgrace. There has been some improvement but, as that terminology indicates, there is a very long way to go to improve the present state of rehabilitation in this country. What we saw as being needed is a major paradigm shift in our approach to prisons in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We should stop looking at prisons as purely custodial institutions and see them more as rehabilitation institutions for some of the most disadvantaged groups in our society. During our inquiry we quite often found people who were illiterate. When they went back out into the world they could notâ€”because of their record, because of their lack of skill and because of their lack of educationâ€”be employed in any sort of job. As a result, many went back into a life of crime.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The essence of what we focused on in the committee report was, first of all, improving education within the prison system so that these people have a chance when they try to go straight on the outside. We also focused onâ€”I think this was the most glaring problem in the whole systemâ€”building a better link between rehabilitation in prisons and rehabilitation when these people leave prisons. A lot of them leave with the clothes on their back, a little bit of money and with no support following that time in prison.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will return, firstly, to what is actually happening in prisons. We found that industry in prison had a much higher priority than education in prison. People sometimes picked up work skills from working in industry in prison, but not necessarily in a systematic way. There seemed to be a priority in the whole system for making money to help fund the prison system. This was perhaps good for the bottom line budget, but it was not good for the rehabilitation of the prisoners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We found that generally there was a poor range of courses and that courses were rarely linked to outside mainstream courses. Indeed,
         <break page="695" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in many states there was tension between the department of correctional services and the education department about who should be running education in prisons. The outcome was different state by state. Often the education of the people who were custodial officers in prisons was very piecemeal as well.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of what we saw in the education area, the report came up with 32 recommendations, and the report was unanimous. As a group, the Democrat, Liberal and Labor committee members saw the great need for improvement in prison education. The major problem we saw as we looked at the system was illiteracy. The main need in prisons at this time is to give people the basic skills that most of us take for granted so that people can read and write and are numerate. It is not necessarily the case in prisons that people have these basic skills. If you send people out in the world without any skills, recidivism is going to be a problem; they will be back with you.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         People will claim, `Well, it will cost money to improve this,' but think of the cost of the crime rate to society because we are not doing it. If you do it, you can reduce crime: you can reduce the costs of policing; you can reduce the costs in the justice system; social security for prison families is reduced; and the cost of just keeping the prisonerâ€”which is about $50,000 a yearâ€”is reduced. If you add up those savings, it provides a fair pool for preventative measuresâ€”for preventing people from reoffending and getting back into prisons again.

         The basic problem of literacy came to us most starkly in a previous report in which we looked at prisons. One of the prisoners came before us at that time and told us that in his prison in Queensland one&amp;hyphen;third of the inmates were totally illiterate, one&amp;hyphen;third were partially illiterate and one&amp;hyphen;third were literate. If you have that situation and you do not have a proper education and training program, you will have continuing problems when people leave prisons.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other group that we found greatly disadvantaged apart from the ones who were not literate was women in prisons. There are not many women prisoners in the country. If
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          you look at it as a proportion of the total, it is a tiny amount. So when you come to educating women in prison, you have very small groups scattered across a very large range of prisons. That makes the cost of educating them a lot higher. Many of them desperately wanted to join particular courses that they were interested in, but they were not available because of that. One woman told us her real need for education was because, `I will just go stir crazy if I don't get something like this in the prison'. In her case and in the case of many others it was not available. We need to develop a much wider range of courses in the prison system.

         There are over 30 recommendations from the committee to improve the situation and to better integrate what was happening in prison with the mainstream of the education system in this country. We recommended that ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, direct some of its growth funding into prison education, that there be properly  designed, delivered and accredited courses in prisons, and that the National Training Authority monitor the standard of prison courses.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, when they leave prison, as I alluded to earlier, there needs to be a much better pathway in the community to continue that education that these people have started in prison. There was a total lack of interface between what was happening in education in the prisons and what happened when they left. Even programs that had been established to help prisoners when they left were often temporary and were shut downâ€”like the one in Fairlea women's prison, which only cost $2,000 and which was helping people who had offended get back into the community, but after one year it was shut down because of lack of priority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There needs to be a much higher priority for prison education. For state governments, it can save them a lot of money. For the community, it can save them crime and reduced legal costs. For prisoners, it gives them a chance to break out of a life of crime, to rehabilitate themselves and assist them to contribute to our society.

        (Tasmania) (7.26 p.m.) I want to commend the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on his initiative in proposing to the states that laws relating to the control of weapons should be strengthened. The tragedy which occurred on a recent Sunday at Port Arthur has shocked all Tasmanians. Such violence is not part of the Tasmanian way of life. Our historical treasures remind us of the past and thereby highlight the law and order we have todayâ€”or what we thought we had until the tragedy on that Sunday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, this tragedy reaches beyond Tasmania. Because so many victims were visitors from the mainland, the result of the violence has been brought home to all Australiansâ€”to Tasmanians, as well as to those in other states and other countries. Belatedly, we have been made all too fully aware that if 35 people could be shot dead in a peaceful setting such as Port Arthur on a quiet Sunday afternoon, there is no place anywhere in Australia that is safe.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We should have the courage to take whatever measures are necessary to reduce the likelihood of such a tragedy ever happening again. Whether it is someone who is determined to take vengeance on society or someone who acts dangerously or recklessly in undertaking legal activities, or whether it is simply someone who fails to take due caution with a weapon, the loss of life or at least harm to an individual is likely in a society where there is unfettered access to military&amp;hyphen; style firearms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Controlling the use of guns is just one measure which the Prime Minister will recommend to the states tomorrow. He is strongly of the view that we need to totally prohibit the ownership, possession, sale and importation of all automatic and semi&amp;hyphen;automatic weapons. He will also urge the state ministers to approve a national register to give strength to the import regulations which are in place. However, because gun owners have purchased these in the past in good faith, he is recommending a six&amp;hyphen;month amnesty period during which people would be required to surrender their guns. He believes there should also be proper compensation for their surrender.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the Prime Minister said last Monday, there are, however, other related issues arising from this tragedy. These include a consideration of the way we care for the disabled and the influence of visual media, particularly on those already predisposed to violence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr President, I would like to spend a few minutes in drawing your attention to this last aspectâ€”the predisposition to violence. Reverend Newt, the Anglican minister in Ulverstone, on the north&amp;hyphen;west coast of Tasmania, focused on this aspect when he spoke at a memorial service for the victims last week. He highlighted how we are being `desensitised to evil'. Television and video viewers are being constantly tempted to indulge in violence and to pore over the manner in which people can be killed. Take your morning newspaper as an example. You only have to flick over to the entertainment page to be faced with a barrage of weapons advertising box office hits at the various cinemas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the concern is not only the graphic display of the type of weapon and its use. It is the context, too, which is disturbing. The context for many, unfortunately, does set up a challenge. Once this challenge is embedded in the desensitised mind of a person, particularly someone who is prone to violence, conscience and morality are often replaced by a ruthless desire for power, revenge or simply a macabre craving to produce shock horror. There are those viewers whose longing to exert mastery over the weapon will take priority over the appreciation of the value of human life. In fact, they lose all comprehension of its sanctity.
        </para>

         For those who have become victims of crime for which step by step instructions have
         <break page="697" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          been given on the television, on movies and on videos, as well as in video games, the steps taken by the Prime Minister will be heartening. The Prime Minister has set up a committee, to be headed by my colleague Senator Richard Alston, to access the impact of violent videos, movies and video games. These kinds of products are very often found in the homes of those who commit such crimes, so the need to address these issues is urgent. It is extremely encouraging to me that the Prime Minister has taken up this challenge and I commend him for it. I thank the Senate.
