        This bill is about the right of all Australians to speak freely and inform others of their political and electoral choices. It repeals section 329A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, under which it is an offence to advocate a method of voting which is in fact legal, formal and legitimate.

        In 1996 we had the spectacle of Albert Langer being imprisoned for 10 weeks for contempt of court because he refused to stop advocating a perfectly legal form of voting. Amnesty International described him as Australia's first prisoner of conscience for over 20 years. The now Prime Minister Mr Howard described s.329A as a `silly law' and `an unacceptable infringement of the right to free speech' (letter to Mr Ken Partridge, Launceston, 28 February 1996).

        The Greens believe that proportional representation is the fairest and most democratic voting system, and that the national parliament should follow Tasmania and the ACT, not to mention most European countries and New Zealand, by adopting it. Under the current system of voting for the House of Representatives, half the electorate will end up with a member that they didn't vote for or to whom they are actively opposed. Proportional representation with multi&amp;hyphen;member electorates enables everyone to be represented by at least one member who reflects view similar to their own. I have already flagged that I will be proposing amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to introduce proportional representation.

        This is an urgent matter because there is a great deal of hurt being felt in the communities around Australia. The hurt is being felt because of original statements that may have been made, perhaps by mistake, and which are now being seen to be an electoral bonus. There are communities in Australia that are being used as scapegoats. In the meantime, what we have experienced in this chamber has been a minister who so far has failed to seek advice or consult before taking action on a number of occasions.

        While I was reading out those issues I heard people from the other side of the chamber saying that this is old. What we have today so far is an accumulation of points which lead up to this censure. I do not take such an issue lightly. This is the first time in three years in this place that I have moved a censure motion and it should be made very clear at the outset that my decision has not been taken lightly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have become increasingly concerned in recent times about the incompetence and insensitivity of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). My motion refers to five key issues,
        <break page="3753" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and I will address my comments in relation to those matters.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first issue is the actions of the minister in relation to the appointment of a special auditor to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. This decision was made early in the minister's time in his new portfolio and it has subsequently been found by the Federal Court that the minister had no power to set up the audit process. This flawed decision is indicative of an appalling lack of due care on its own, but it escalates to outrageous proportions when the financial implications of the decision are taken into account. There are huge hurts being felt by many people in terms of self-determination, but it is a slap in the face for people to find out that steps to move away from self-determination will actually be charged to those people who are most affected.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        ATSIC was forced at the time of the appointment to set aside $750,000 to fund this special auditor, but this budget blew out to more than $830,000 within the first few weeks. The result of this bungle by the minister and his advisers is ATSIC is being forced to pay nearly $1 million. Will this have to be paid for by a reduction in services to Aboriginal communities?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Throughout this Senate there have been many occasions in industry or otherwise when the issue of some people not using funds as they were intended has been brought up. It has never been argued by the coalition in relation to industry that something like a 10 per cent figure in relation to funding for a program or a subsidy would mean that the program suddenly was frozen, the program suddenly was stopped or an independent auditor was immediately introduced. It certainly would not happen to business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second issue referred to in my motion is the debacle that occurred during the debate on the ATSIC Amendment Bill 1996 (No. 2). This bill dealt with structural changes to ATSIC and had some very important implications for the 1996 ATSIC elections. One of the changes was in relation to the eligibility criteria for ATSIC councillors, which my office determined immediately prior to the debate on this bill would take effect after
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         nominations had closed for the 1996 election. This could have led to a situation in which the entire ATSIC elections, which cost millions of dollars to conduct, could have been deemed invalid.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was only after this matter was raised with the minister and he at last realised the extraordinary implications of proceeding with those sections of the bill that amended eligibility criteria that the government decided to withdraw the offending section from this bill. I am pleased to say there was support from others in this chamber to do so. I am happy to provide advice to the minister, but perhaps I should be claiming higher duties allowance.
       </para>

        The third issue referred to in the censure motion is the inability of the minister to comprehend the outcomes of his own decisions which impact on the quality of life and the push for self-determination by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There appears to be a denial of the fact that the funding that is currently provided to state, territory and local governments to provide such services as health or education to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities may simply be absorbed into those bodies' general revenue, leaving communities totally dependent either on ATSIC funding or on the royalties of mining, as is the case in the Northern Territory.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Where is the accountability in that? When people have talked about accountability, has anybody not mentioned to the minister that the accountability should be to the people to whom those services should be provided? If ATSIC is considered to be necessary for intervention by the government, how much more should state, territory and local governments be given when they are provided taxpayers' money at much greater levels to provide health, education and community services? How many of those dollars have been followed through to their final point? How many? How many areas only get access to royalties? How many areas virtually only get access to ATSIC funding?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We know that some health dollars are spent, but there is no tracing through, as far as I can see, to make sure that those dollars that are provided to those bodies get to where they are

         supposed to go. It is inevitable that, if you leave all other services to ATSIC, you will find they will be unable to provide all of those services to all of those communities. The funding is not accountable in that sense. We seem to have a very skewed opinion in relation to who should be targeted in this area.

        Instead of providing greater self-determination, the minister is removing the decision making power from those bodies. The minister's response in not realising that ATSIC had been left with an impossible task is to cut funding for ATSIC programs. It should be said that this policy is largely poll driven, given the minister's preference for quoting polls, which he claims indicate that most Australians are not happy to see Aboriginal people receive more than their fair share of the taxpayers' dollars.

        The minister's statements and actions reflect the mind&amp;hyphen;set. This ignores the very real discrimination which has existed for Aboriginal people since the arrival of Europeans on this continent and whether or not those dollars which are down as being available to Aboriginal people which are going through state, territory and local governments are going to the point to which they are meant to be going. If that is indeed the case, the minister should tell us that it is so.

        The fourth element of the censure motion refers to the promotion of inappropriate and outdated policies of assimilation. Many Aboriginal people bear the psychological scars which result from the paternalistic and assimilationist policies that dominated thinking on Aboriginal issues in this country until very recently. The minister's attitude to `the stolen generation' inquiry is reflective of this position. I have spoken to Aboriginal people in Western Australia who are friends of mine who have suffered greatly as a result of the policies that took them away from their parents. Those scars are not going to disappear quickly as a result of their speaking to the inquiry and, as the minister says, `getting it out of your system'. That was a recent statement by the minister.

        The minister's statements on this and other matters has not helped in the process of reconciliation that must happen before we can move on, if there is a duty of care for ministers. If this involved a teacher, we would say that the teacher has breached their duty of care. It is quite clear that the minister considers that benefits have accrued to those who were forcibly separated from their parents. Perhaps he believes that these benefits are so great that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders do not feel real agony in telling strangers about their experiences.

        If there was some true understanding and sensitivity, there would be the understanding that what is required is recognition—recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are human beings and that whatever changes to their lifestyle there may have been as a result of being taken away from their parents, there is no substitution for that sense of identity that has been lost, that sense of loss of culture and that sense of loss of language. Only now are we seeing communities who are trying desperately to regain that sense of culture and that social cohesion to be able to teach language and culture to their children. At this point communities are realising that they need to regain some of what they have lost several generations on. That hurt and damage has lasted for several generations. As communities are trying to regain that sense of community, now is the vital time when that support should be given.

        The fact is that the Aboriginal people deserve representation which understands and reflects their point of view, and the complexity of that point of view, in the cabinet, in the government and in this parliament. This minister is patently failing the very people he has been put there to represent. That is what this censure motion is about. It is about failure. It is calling to order a government which allows this minister to stay in office when patently he is incapable of carrying out the extraordinarily important job of representing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country.

         Yesterday we were warned that new legislation which will come before this House will give this minister the power to veto Aboriginal objections to mining operations on land which they claim as theirs. That is the ultimate paternalism. That is the ultimate indignity. That is the ultimate example of how we as a nation have a lot yet to learn—when we have a government saying, `We're going to give this person who's creating turmoil in the Aboriginal community the right to represent the interests of mining companies over the interests of Aboriginal communities' so that their objections will be ridden over the top of by the mining corporations which, of course, have the advantage of being able to come and lobby, have their business dinners and tweak the ears of weak&amp;hyphen;kneed ministers in this government.

We hit the basis of the matter when we consider the Aboriginal people, with their ancient and magnificent relationship with the land, still facing the prospect of their minister in cabinet turning down their protests and giving the go-ahead to the big mining corporations coming in from outside, without any understanding of that ancient relationship and that cultural intertwining between the Aboriginal people and the land, and saying, `Go ahead; the Aboriginal people will have to suffer the cultural, social, economic and environmental consequences because I say that it is good for you.'

The reason I say that is that one of the big things the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has got going for him in this censure debate—and I made this point to Senator Margetts last night—is that the minister's obvious ineptness in this portfolio is now so commonplace it has become a matter of daily bread. It has already got to the situation in a very short time indeed where the news that the minister has in fact mishandled the portfolio has now become so commonplace that people are saying, `Well, what's new?'.

         In essence, those judgments confirmed the absolute substance of this first part of this censure motion—that there was a failure to seek advice. What the judgment said very clearly—all judges were unanimous on this, and you did not need to be a lawyer, let me tell you, to read it—was that the parliament, rightly or wrongly, had given to ATSIC the power to make decisions in respect of funding Aboriginal organisations. The minister purported to have exercised his directions under the section of the ATSIC Act. Those directions related to directions to ATSIC in how they should exercise that decision making power.

         What the minister's directions did do, however, was not to in fact give ATSIC directions as to how they should exercise that power; they purported to in fact restrict that power which parliament had given to ATSIC. They purported to restrict it by effectively handing the decision making power to a non-elected, non-appointed&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;parliament third party—that is, the special auditor. The effect of his declaring that an organisation was not fit and proper to receive money meant that funding would instantly be cut off without any further reference to ATSIC, the body that parliament had appointed to make those decisions.

However, if I say that he—and I am pleased to say that yesterday this changed—was for a time happy to be seen as a fellow traveller with these sentiments, then I think that is made out well and truly. That was contained in that extraordinarily silly comment he made, but politically astute from his perspective, that we had a new era of free speech in this country. What nonsense that was!

         John Howard, being the astute politician that he is—and he is as astute as they come—knew perfectly well that that would be accepted by a great many people as a direct reference to Pauline Hanson's much publicised maiden speech. She got more publicity than she deserved to get, but, nevertheless, it was avoidable. He knew that. To keep it all straight, he officially denied those bits that he had to deny, but no-one was in any doubt at all that he was referring to that maiden speech when he said we now enjoy a new freedom of speech in Australia.

         The Prime Minister said yesterday again in the parliament that people in Australia do not mind having their taxpayers' money spent on Australian Aboriginal people, but they hate seeing it wasted. There is no return for it. He has been on the public record again and again with that for months. Of course it is a popular misconception that hundreds of millions of dollars—to quote the Prime Minister again from yesterday—over the last century have been spent on Aborigines with no return.

          Take the misconception that we spend a zillion dollars more on Aboriginal people, despite their incredibly greater need for the services, than we do on all other Australians. The facts are, for anyone who wants to look at them—and they have been laid out by the Menzies School of Health Research, which is a research institution of excellence, and in other places as well—in terms of primary health care, despite the obviously greater need that Aboriginal people have for the services, we spend about the same per capita on Aboriginal people in Australia as we spend on everyone else—about $700 per capita per year.

          What is one of the reasons for that? No-one ever mentions it. I will tell you why, because of the isolation of many Aboriginal people in this country. I must say that I am pleased that someone is living to the north of this country of ours in a network of small communities, all with radio transceivers, in terms of the national interest, apart from anything else. But one of the reasons for that expenditure is the massive underutilisation by Aboriginal people of Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. That is a matter of fact. Because of their isolation, they substantially underutilise the provisions that everyone else utilises.

          A lot of those other myths can be exploded in the same way by simply comparing the quite proper expenditure of public money on the provision of essential services—sewerage, water supplies, police, nurses and teachers—to all small isolated communities in Australia, on which we have also spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the early part of this century. No-one, of course, ever puts that in the equation. Somehow or other isolated Aborigines are the only people in Australia who have ever had the need for that money to be spent on them. What nonsense!

          The ingratitude of these people to still insist on dying from Third World diseases, despite all of the money that we have spent on them! Do you want to know why they are dying? The evidence is there. A major detailed medical research project was recently done on the community of Maningrida in Arnhem Land. It was a detailed nuts and bolts study as to why people are dying early. Do you know why? Because that community which, if it were in rural Australia would probably have two doctors servicing it full time, has got one medical practitioner that visits it for three days a week. That is why.

          The reason I make that point is, for those of us who have been around a little longer than others who have recently come to this debate, the nonsense that is perpetrated again and again is that there has been no improvement in this situation over the last 13 years. Let me tell you what an utter falsehood that

           is. As bad as the situation is now, and it is, as urgent is the need—and I think the minister is sincere in his desire to fix it—to make it better, let me tell you, Minister, it is by quantum leaps better than it was 13 years ago. I do not link that to any particular government.

Why then, and the minister knows this, do we still have the early mortality? Why is it still happening? Why are Aboriginal adults still dying early? I will tell you why. They are dying from the results of early childhood disease, which marked them out at a very early stage for a short life.

          My close friend and colleague—whom I miss badly—the former member for Arnhem in the Northern Territory's parliament, died tragically at the age of 42 just a short time ago. His medical specialist from Adelaide told me himself that my friend had an enlarged heart as a result of an epidemic of rheumatic fever that went through Arnhem Land when he was four or five years old. He had simply lived with that legacy all his life. His medical specialist said to me—and I have not forgotten him saying it to me—that the situation was that he could live for another 10 years with very careful medical treatment or that he could die that afternoon. Both outcomes would be consistent with his medical condition. In other words, it did not matter a damn what improvements we have made in the last 10 or 20 years.

The depressing part is, Minister—particularly with the addition of things like substance abuse, which is horrific—that we are continuing to have generations of young Aboriginal people now, whom I know and you know and many others know,

          It is wrong to say that there has been no improvement because of all this money that has been spent. There has, in fact, been a substantial improvement, particularly over the last decade. I might say with some feeling of regret that it is a matter of record also that a substantial increase in the allocation of those funds only occurred in the last four to five years of the previous government. That is the reason it is still happening. It is not because there are not results being gained from the expenditure of that money and not because those Aboriginal people are not entitled to it.

          There is, in fact, a very simple health policy for this country, and I commend it to the minister. It is a health policy which, if it were put into effect in real terms, would actually result in a substantial improvement. That health policy should be simply this: all Australians, irrespective of where they live, should to the maximum extent possible have a level of health care commensurate with their needs. It is as simple as that.

          If that care were provided—and in many cases I agree, Minister, it would be extremely expensive because of the isolation of those people to provide it—there would be a dramatic increase in the improvement of the health situation of Aboriginal people. There would be a far greater improvement than there has been over the last 10 years, as encouraging as it has been. But do not take the cheap political position of going to the statistics and saying, `Look at all this money. People are still dying early.' The fact is that they are often dying early because of things that happened generations ago.

         I do not believe this minister himself believes that all Aborigines are crooks—in fact, I am sure he does not believe that—but his government has done little to correct this impression, and it is rife in the community. Every taxi driver you speak to and almost every person on the street is cheering, for they want an enemy to hate. They want a scapegoat upon whom they can lay all the ills of the community. There has been a horrendous increase in these reports. At the weekend the Young Democrats had a conference here in Parliament House. One of them, who is an Aboriginal person, spoke about the personal attacks that he has endured.

         Let us understand the original purpose of the CDEP. I remember, many years ago, visiting one of the first instances of this program having been put in place, in the Aboriginal communities of Ernabella and Fregon in the north of South Australia. A very wonderful Uniting Church deaconess, Win Hilliard, was involved in that program. Not only did the Aboriginal people benefit from the welfare payments which were paid through the CDEP; some of the profits from the craft shop also went into the program to be distributed to the community. What the minister and the government need to understand is that taking away funding for those programs is taking away money to which the people were entitled and which all other Australians are able to access. This action has deprived them of this money.

We need to understand that Aboriginal people want to make a contribution to this country but they cannot make it if they feel that they are constantly being excluded.

         The fourth issue which was raised in the censure motion was the promotion of inappropriate and outdated policies of assimilation. I must say I was disappointed that the minister promoted the book about Hasluck's assimilation policies. I know the minister gets hundreds of invitations and he has to make choices about what he will or will not promote. I believe it was a deliberate and bad choice to launch the book, but it does give us an understanding, by default, of the thinking of this government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         To say that many indigenous people benefited from being forcibly removed from their families is to support one of the cornerstones of assimilation. It is a remark which has brought pain to many people and has put a spin on the outcome of the stolen generation inquiry which was unnecessary and just wrong. I have spent 35 years living, working and struggling with Aboriginal people within Aboriginal communities. I helped set up the Aboriginal child&amp;hyphen;care agency in Brisbane—and I must say that working with those people to recover some of those children was a very poignant and telling experience for me.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I turn to the fifth clause in the censure motion. In some ways, I do not think this should be directed as much to the minister as to the Prime Minister because I underline again that the failure to correct the impression being left in this community in fact is making Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into scapegoats. The phenomenon of scapegoating has a long and inglorious history. Through the centuries, people have been made scapegoats where a minority group which is easily identifiable and living on the edge of society is accused of being the basis for all that is wrong in that society. In times of social instability, the rise of scapegoating is something which we can note in history and something about which we ought to be really concerned.

        <break page="3768" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The creation of an enemy—where a group of people is identified, then vilified, then brutalised and finally eliminated as a public service—has historical precedents which, I think, give all of us pause. I would like to underline that by pointing out that the story of scapegoating, or the whole idea of scapegoating, has a very long history. It really comes out of the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Old Testament
          </emphasis>
          . It is a story that comes out of an ancient Jewish ritual. In Leviticus 16, on the day of atonement, a goat was paraded in front of the tabernacle. The sins of the people were laid on the head of the goat by the priest. The goat was taken into the desert and released, presumably to starve to death. Its fate was of no further concern to the people.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Thus, in our modern culture, a scapegoat is one identified in the mind of the community as a focus for all that is wrong with society. It is vilified as one to whom the blame for all the community's ills can be attributed. It is cast out to the edges of society where its fate is of no further concern because the community has laid on its head all of that community's guilt and responsibility. That process is happening and many people in the Australian community are endorsing that very action and that process. We need, from this government, a very strong statement to the contrary so that we can say that this is not on.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It sounds depressingly familiar as we recount the ancient story. It is not so much an ancient Jewish ritual as it is a modern political parable, except that we are not talking about casting out symbolic goats to wander around in the desert: we are talking about the lives and the future of real people, real Australians. We are talking about laying on the heads of Aboriginal Australians, in particular, the failure of our society to deliver a fair deal to all of its citizens.

         —I will respond seriatim to the censure motion and go through it point by point. I vigorously respond, and I will detail in my response the fact that all of these points can be adequately refuted. In relation to clause 1, the special auditor process and the independent auditor, the government stated that it was committed to accountability. We will not step back from that process of accountability or from the fact that we did appoint a special auditor.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe that the special auditor process has been extremely worth while, and, interestingly enough, so does ATSIC. The ATSIC chief executive officer has written to the government indicating that the special auditor process has been of considerable value and will be used to help to decide future funding determinations. The background was the Federal Court decision that the general direction establishing a special auditor was too specific. It was the first time a general direction had been used. It was new territory and the court challenge was the first time general directions had been tested.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Legal advice is, in fact, that the decision could be appealed but, as the audit process was virtually complete, there seemed little point, and a great deal of taxpayers' money would be spent through the legislative process. I saw no point in doing that when it was virtually completed at the time the court decision was handed down, so I did not proceed along that process. At the time of the special court decision, 95 per cent of the special auditor process had been completed. ATSIC agreed to complete the process and used the material gathered by the special auditor to assist in funding decisions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are still awaiting the final report from the special auditor; I hope to table it today or tomorrow. The preliminary report shows that the special auditor has found that 19 per cent of all organisations funded by ATSIC were in serious breach of grant conditions and 60 organisations which received $27.8 million in their last ATSIC grant should be declared not fit and proper and de&amp;hyphen;funded. At the time of the court decision, the special auditor was
        <break page="3769" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         seeking additional information on a further 130 organisations that received $89.6 million in their latest funding. Of these organisations, the special auditor says:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is the potential for some or all to be declared not fit and proper.
       </para>
       <para>
        The special auditor has found that a further 184 organisations were in such serious breach of grant conditions that they require immediate and close attention. They received a total of $124 million in their latest funding. Altogether, that is a total of 374 of the 1,300 organisations funded by ATSIC in serious breach and either not fit and proper or requiring close and immediate attention. Those 374 organisations received a total of $241 million in their latest ATSIC grants.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result of the special auditor process, ATSIC has implemented tighter internal funding requirements. Senator Margetts said `some blunder'—when we have the special auditor reporting on that volume of money that has been found and will be found as a result of this process. As I said, ATSIC itself is adopting the procedures to tighten this up.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The initial cost of the special auditor was expected to be around $750,000. That figure was based on an estimate that 60 per cent of ATSIC funded organisations would be in compliance with their grant conditions. In fact, less than 20 per cent were in compliance, which increased substantially the number of organisations requiring close examination; therefore, the cost increased. The final cost is still to be settled on, but it is expected to be in excess of $1 million. ATSIC budgeted $1.2 million for the special auditor and the money is from running costs, not from the programs, which is another essential point that needs to be made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In summary, the special auditor process has forced the 80 per cent of organisations classified as amber into compliance and others in serious breach to either undergo substantial remedial action or lose their funding. For the first time, and as a direct result of the special auditor process, we will be able to move forward with confidence from a baseline that sees all ATSIC funded organisations either in full compliance or undertaking changes to bring them into full compliance.

        <para>
         I am not sure where Senator Margetts was when the ATSIC amendments passed the Senate, but the government moved to remove the eligibility criteria from the amendments. The eligibility criteria were there because government had hoped to pass amendments back in June when first introduced, well in advance of the ATSIC election. There was never any threat to the election process. The government was in full agreement with the removal of these provisions.

         I do not really know what Senator Margetts is about. We did remove them and now she comes in with a censure motion that I sought to make changes to eligibility criteria, et cetera. The eligibility criteria are not there. They certainly did not add any additional cost to ATSIC and did not threaten the validity of the election. The government's legal advice at the time was that the provision changing the eligibility rules for the current ATSIC election would not have threatened the legal validity of the election.

As Senator Collins said, it has been only belatedly in the last four or five years that that has increased. Despite that increase, indigenous Australians still have an infant mortality rate two to three times that of non-indigenous Australians, a life expectancy up to 18 years less than non-indigenous Australians, adult diabetes at four times the rate for non-indigenous Australians and falling education standards.

I thank Senator Newman for inviting me to that conference in Darwin of all the state housing ministers. There was general agreement that the funding would be put together from the states and the Commonwealth and that indigenous housing would be specifically approached. For the first time, Senator Brown, indigenous specific funding will go to indigenous people with regard to housing. It was a move by Senator Newman, which was totally supported by me. I thank her for the invitation to attend, and I thank the state ministers for housing for agreeing to that.

As I mentioned, I am grateful to the housing ministers for getting that through. That is your point No. 3.

They are related to low birth weight and immunity. Nobody knows why, but by the time an Aboriginal child is nine months of age, they are colonised with bacteria and their immune system is deficient because of the low birth weight. There are a lot of problems associated with Aboriginal health. We cannot blame that on the conditions that are there.

         —There are obviously a number of points that have been canvassed in today's debate. Most of it has been a very sad debate. Whatever the outcome of today's debate, it has been important for these issues to be canvassed and is important for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) and the government to see that the parliament and the community are watching and that they do not swallow the kind of statements and attitudes that are coming out from this government via decisions that are being made by this minister.

        Point No. 1 of the motion said that there was a failure to seek proper advice or consult before imposing an independent auditor on ATSIC. That is what the courts clearly said. It was a unanimous decision. Whatever the outcomes of the audit, there are provisions within ATSIC for that audit to take place. The problem was the failure to consult and get proper advice before that action took place. Whatever people have said about the outcomes of the auditor, they do not address the situation that proper advice was not sought and proper consultation did not take place before that decision took place. Ministers should not act in that way.

        In relation to point No. 2, the fact that the change was made to the bill on the day in the chamber was the result of advice given by the Greens to the minister. Yes, the minister withdrew it. I obviously know that—
        <break page="3774" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         everybody knows that—because, despite the preliminary and inadequate advice the minister received, the information that the minister gave me that there was no problem did not constitute a legal advice.

        So, whilst the minister says, `I received advice that it was okay,' he clearly knows that that advice was not a legal opinion and did not comment in any way upon whether or not such a move would make or would not make the election ineligible. Of course, most of those issues would require a court challenge to establish that absolutely.

        That does not change the fact that the minister did seek to make changes. There is nothing at all that the minister can say to indicate that he did not seek to make changes to the eligibility criteria for the ATSIC election. Of all the people looking at the bill, if it requires the Greens at the last minute to save $4.7 million, then it should be acknowledged it was on the basis of that decision. It was because of incompetence on the part of a number of people, including perhaps department and minister, that that situation got that far.

         —The detail of the senator's question obviously makes it one for the minister responsible, Mr Wooldridge. The number of applications that have been flowing through the system for an increase in private health insurance premiums is a direct result of the previous government's failure to take action to encourage people to stay in private health insurance. I well remember when I was the shadow minister for health and the then Senator Richardson was keenly trying to do something to encourage private health insurance. But he was stamped on from a great height by his Prime Minister Mr Keating. So precious years were wasted while action could have been taken to make private health insurance more attractive to Australians.

        The present government, as soon as it had the opportunity in its first budget, announced the measures which are going to be implemented to encourage people to stay in private health insurance. The Labor opposition, I gather, has got some sort of mean&amp;hyphen;spirited approach to this, that it does not believe Australians should get assistance in terms of
        <break page="3775" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         affordability of private health insurance. If that is their ideological stance, it suggests that they are going even further to the left than they have been in the past. That will be a great shame if it means that older Australians who desperately want to stay in private health insurance are prevented from affording it and that families, with children particularly, will find it difficult.

        You may be aware, Madam President, that the Minister for Health and Family Services just recently has been talking to the health funds, trying to encourage them to introduce new and innovative measures which will make the opportunity for private health insurance more attractive to special elements of the community. I will be very happy to get any details which the minister is able at this stage to give me. I am not, of course, going to be in a position to bring an answer back to the Senate which predicts which health funds might have applications pending because, as you would know, Madam President, health funds are only able to get confirmation of their applications for an increase in private health insurance where their reserves have dropped to such a level that they need support through extra funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The situation is that, as more and more people drop out of private health insurance, the pressures on the reserves of those funds grow greater. So, for each year that no action was taken, the problem has grown greater and greater and greater. While there can be the odd bit of mirth and interjection from the other side, they know full well where the guilty party is because we would not be facing this problem, this pressure on Medicare by the failure of people who can afford it to take up private health insurance—people like the Keating family.

        I would point out also to the Senate that the phone calls coming in to the national hotline for employers around Australia are now running at something like 100 a day.

In the social security area this is one matter that we have undertaken. It has been well received by employers. I am advised by the department that, in fact, they expect the 100 calls a day to grow substantially in the future, because more employers, as they become aware of the number and the fax line, will take up the use of it.

         —I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for that question and for the keen appreciation he shows and his recognition, as I hope all Australians recognise, of the need to take pressure off interest rates. The government is committed to delivering an interest rate environment which provides significant material benefit to all Australian families and small businesses. That is in stark contrast to the record of the previous Labor government whose interest rate policies as a result of overall economic incompetence forced thousands and thousands of small businesses into bankruptcy and imposed enormous hardships and burdens on most Australian families.

        We are absolutely committed to taking pressure off interest rates. Under Labor, Australia had amongst the highest interest rates in the world. We had the second highest prime interest rate of any of the OECD countries, the western countries, and higher interest rates than most other of our major trading and competitor countries. In one four&amp;hyphen;month period alone under Labor, interest rates in Australia rose by no less than three per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A key cause of that was Labor's failure to run responsible prudent fiscal policy. By running up huge deficits, $70 billion worth of deficits over a five&amp;hyphen;year period alone, which left an inheritance for the new incoming government of $100 billion, Labor failed to tackle our No. 1 problem—a shortage of national savings. By failing to tackle that national savings problem, they failed to take pressure off interest rates and put pressure on interest rates to be much higher than they should have otherwise been.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Moreover, during Labor's term in office, they presided over two downgradings to our international credit rating which further increases the cost of borrowing by Australia overseas. Our budget strategy will return the budget to balance over the next three years.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         By doing that, we will directly boost public and national savings. Increased national savings equals less pressure on interest rates. It is a very simple equation which Labor never seems to have been able to come to grips with. That means that families struggling to pay off a mortgage will benefit from lower repayments. It means that businesses pay less interest on business loans, helping them to expand, helping the economy to grow faster, helping to create more jobs throughout the economy.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Macdonald also asked me about the critical importance to the economy of getting this budget passed in full. I want to stress this. Let there be no mistake at all about this that any diminution of the government's fiscal consolidation strategy risks putting more pressure on interest rates. The budget should have been in surplus in 1995-96 if the former government was serious about Australian families and business. Instead it was in deficit by $10 billion and when they left office, as I said, it was $100 billion. The Australian people have had to pay very heavily for this fiscal incompetence and are well aware of it.

To use Senator Ian Macdonald's example of a family in Lindsay, a family with a 25-year, $100,000 loan—a typical loan nowadays—will have enjoyed an $88 per month reduction in repayments as a result of that fall in home mortgage rates.

Do you accept the ABS classification of `a tax' as compulsory levies imposed by government to raise revenue? Further, it says `there is usually no clear and direct link between payment of taxes and the provision of goods and services'. You also stated in answer to a question on notice from me that your government does not intend to change the classification adopted by the previous government in regard to taxes which was based on this ABS definition. In light of this, why did you not provide this definition of a tax when I repeatedly asked for one during the estimates committees?

        The national park that you are referring to in South Australia currently prohibits mining. Therefore, I do not quite see the point of your question unless, of course, you are concerned about the deliberations taking place in the South Australian parliament. There is an issue as to whether that park should operate under the same basis as most national parks in South Australia, and that is a multi&amp;hyphen;use park. I am not opposed to multi&amp;hyphen;use, provided that the other use is consistent with the conservation values that we are seeking to preserve. That seems to me to be sound policy.

They are going to use all their intellectual skills and all the media power they have to bring force to bear on a government to leave them be, to make up Beazley's bankcard from the rest of the community, to leave higher education alone and not expect them to make a one per cent contribution next year. That is not going to happen, but that is obviously what some vice-chancellors would like to happen. If you would like to see a more informed reporting of the speech, I direct you to the

         —My question is directed to Senator Short in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Is it correct that, of the 50,000 Chinese students who came to Australia during the late 1980s and early 1990s, there remains a group of about 4,000 who were not granted permanent residency status and whose futures are still uncertain? If so, was the group of students given an assurance—either before the election in March or since then or both—that the coalition government would consider this matter with a view to satisfactorily resolving these students' long&amp;hyphen;term status? Further, I ask the minister to advise the Senate what efforts have been made to resolve this situation. When can the Senate expect to be advised that a resolution has been reached which is satisfactory to the government and this group of students?

        Senator Colston's questions relate to a number of people who have sought permanent residence in Australia and are referred to as the 1 November caseload. The majority of those cases are from the People's Republic of China. All but 500 to 600 of those people have had their cases finalised; 41,527 people—mainly from the PRC—have been granted permanent residence in Australia; and 2,641 applications covering 3,129 persons from the PRC have been refused. Those applicants who have been unsuccessful and who seek a review of their decision will take longer, of course, to have their cases finalised.

         The government is aware that many of those who have been unsuccessful have been in Australia for a considerable period of time. We are concerned, and have been for some time—including before we were in government—about the length of time taken to finalise their situation. During the recent election both major parties indicated that the situation of those PRC students who failed to benefit from the 1 November 1993 decision would be examined. The coalition stated that it would resolve the matter satisfactorily.

         Discussions have been held with representatives of the Chinese students and the Chinese community since the election in both May and July of this year on the students' situation. The government has not, as yet, come to a concluded view on the matter. When we have come to such a concluded view on a satisfactory basis—which I hope will be a view that we can communicate sooner rather than later—the people concerned will, of course, be advised.

        During the election campaign the coalition made four commitments on the Native Title Act. These were, first, to retain the Native Title Act; second, to reserve the right to amend the Native Title Act to make it workable; third, to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act; and, fourth, that any amendments to the act would be preceded by wide consultation.

        In regard to the question as to whether pastoral lease extinguished native title, the government decided to await the outcome of the Wik case currently before the High Court. I would remind the Senate that, during the debate on the Native Title Act, that lot over there, and the Prime Minister at the time, said over and over again that pastoral leases did extinguish native title. It is clear that, with the passage of time, the Native Title Act has not worked—to the detriment of everybody involved.

        The dispute between claimants became an absolute fiasco in the gas pipeline project in Queensland. Even when a legitimate claim was recognised, there was uncertainty as to just what the negotiations were about. Was it the right to transgress or hunt, was it the right to occupy or was it a type of freehold? On what basis could compensation even be considered, let alone determined? Quite clearly, the act was not workable and my colleague Senator Minchin was given the job to consult, which he has done widely for months. He has consulted with Aboriginals, land councils, graziers, miners and state governments. And, I might say, Senator Minchin has done a magnificent job.

        The right to negotiate process will be streamlined by a number of amendments, including making it clear that the right to negotiate can run parallel with state approval processes, improving the process for excluding activities such as exploration and prospecting, providing for more specific criteria to be followed by arbitral bodies, allowing for earlier intervention by the minister in exceptional cases during the right to negotiate process and prior to an arbitral determination to allow future acts which make up a project to be dealt with together.

        The amendments also set up a statutory framework for representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies which will improve their functioning and assist in streamlining the native title process. They will improve the quality of service provided to native title holders and claimants in the representative bodies' geographical areas and ensure accountability for the representative bodies' constituents and for the expenditure of public funds. The amendments include a voluntary agreement process that will provide greater flexibility to both indigenous and industry groups.

        These amendments are an appropriate response to fix an act which has clearly not worked. It is yet another disaster that we inherited from the previous Labor government, which we went to the election on and which the public expects us to address. The coalition was elected on a mandate to make the act workable. This is what we are doing in the interests of all concerned. The amendments will produce a better outcome for all Australians.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator Eggleston today, relating to proposed amendments to the Native Title Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of native title has been one of the most important matters which has been brought before this Senate since federation. In fact, it was in this chamber that there was, I think, the longest debate in this country's history on that bill. At the time, coalition senators said that this bill was unworkable and history has proved it to be so. In fact, we have in excess of 380 claims across Australia. Forty per cent of the continent is under claim, yet no native title has been found. Satisfaction has not been found by indigenous people, developers, pastoralists, miners or people in industry. In fact, to date I would put to the Senate that the bill has been a disaster.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With these amendments, the government is intending to make the bill workable. I say to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         fellow senators, the Australian community and, in particular, members of the press: beware of anyone who criticises these amendments as being racist, beware of anyone who uses labels in this argument, beware of people who seek to attack the person in this argument because that would signify that they have lost the argument themselves. Too many people in this debate would try to argue it on emotive terms.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have to look at this bill in an analytical fashion. We have to make the bill work. We have to amend the process whereby justice is meted out to all and, most importantly, where results will be achieved. To date, there have been a lot of complaints from industry and Aboriginal communities that there has been too much delay, that this whole process has become bogged down. Time and time again, senators from both the opposition and the government have said that lawyers have been the only ones to benefit from this native title process. I would put it to the Senate that these amendments go a long way to streamlining the process to make it workable and to cut out the role of lawyers who have enjoyed the proceeds from this process thus far.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When one looks at the right to negotiate one will see that it is possible on one project to have several rights to negotiate. That is in no-one's interests. Therefore, the amendment which proposes that you have one right to negotiate in relation to a project as a whole is a thoroughly sensible one. The amendment which says that you can deal with native title processes as well as state approval processes for a development is a thoroughly sensible one. The situation at present is that you have to go through state processes and only after that embark on native title processes. That gives you a cumulative effect which can take years before any decision is made.

        As has been said by members of the opposition and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), there is a lot to be said for economic development in remote areas for Aboriginal Australia. In areas where there have been developments not only in the tourist industry but also in the mining industry, we have seen that Aboriginal Australia has benefited. It is
        <break page="3789" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         by this process of facilitating development and taking native title rights into account at the same time and on an even balance that you can see how this framework can possibly work.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is one other aspect I would commend—that is, the question of voluntary agreements, which Senator Parer referred to. The question of voluntary agreements has been a vexed one. People have wanted to come to an agreement, but they have been unable to because the system will not let them have an agreement which can work with any efficacy or certainty. This proposal by the government will allow a voluntary agreement to be registered. I think that is a step in the right direction. Of course, it is a complicated area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendments will have to deal with a rather complex proposal where people who want to form an agreement in relation to native title will come together. Nonetheless, this government has not shied away from addressing this most complex area, something which the former government shied away from completely. The only amendments we had were in relation to the High Court decision of Brandy, which was foist upon the former government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government is addressing this complex problem head-on. That is a courageous effort on behalf of the government. I compliment Senator Minchin on his excellent work and consultation, which I might say has been extensive. That is a lot more than we can say for the Native Title Bill. Senator Cooney would remember the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had seven days and an air force jet to go around this vast continent and consult with the whole of the country as to the whole of the Native Title Bill. We have had, I would submit, consultation which would be at least tenfold higher than that, and that is just in relation to some amendments to the bill.

         Senator Ellison has just talked about the courage of the government. Can I say that, in my view, `the stupidity of the government' would in fact be a better phrase. This is not going to solve anyone's problems. It is a fraud. It is a fraud on the National Farmers Federation, the miners and anyone else who cares to fall into this trap of believing that, in terms of determining the common law rights of Aboriginal Australians in native title, you can do so by legislation with absolute certainty. You cannot.

         This is a fraud and a smokescreen that the government is attempting to put up, but it is also extraordinarily offensive.

By the way, just as a matter of interest, the government has also claimed that they are simplifying the act with these amendments. Could I point out to the Senate that the original Native Title Act was 127 pages long. This is now the second package of amendments the government has produced. The first package of amendments consisted of 77 pages. This next package is 84 pages.

The minister for Aboriginal affairs is going to get the job of overriding Aboriginal opinion, but under what circumstances can the minister do so? Read the government's paper. Under the heading `Early ministerial intervention in the national interest' it says that where native title

        Can you believe that? It is the first time I have seen paternalism legislated for in black and white, and it is happening in 1996. In other words, they are saying that the great white father, the federal minister for Aboriginal affairs, the protector of Aborigines—that is how the government sees Senator Herron; it is certainly how the Prime Minister sees him—can determine that they will receive significant benefits from the mine. Some Aboriginal people in Kakadu National Park have determined—they met with me last week as a matter of fact—that because of the disruption that is currently being caused out there, rightly or wrongly, in terms of their community, they do not want mining to proceed. That is their view as a community. They are the people who actually live and experience these things.

        The federal minister for Aboriginal affairs in 1996 can overturn their decision in their interests. The minister for Aboriginal affairs can determine that they do in fact receive significant benefits from the mine. They do not know their own minds; they do not know what is best for them! He can put that aside. I could not believe this when I read it in the government's paper yesterday. It is legislated paternalism and it is utterly contemptible.

I would like to join Senator Ellison in congratulating Senator Minchin on undertaking a genuine consultation process, which I believe commenced only a few days after Senator Minchin was sworn in as a parliamentary secretary. It is in absolutely stark contrast to the processes that were undertaken by the previous government, where they basically did not involve the state governments or the mining industry. They involved but a clutch—a small group—of Aboriginal interests to negotiate with, excluding the interests of tens of thousands of other Aboriginal groups around this country.

        We saw the same process of consultation in relation to the land fund, where they were trying to put together a package as part of the deal to get the native title legislation through. The minutes of the meeting that were used to discuss the land fund, which was part of the native title package, show the consultation processes that were undertaken as part of that. The minutes show that there were six or seven hand-picked A&amp;hyphen;team negotiators, people that Mr Keating chose to deal with. To his credit, I do not think Mr Tickner would have agreed that that was a inclusive or consultative process. He said that he had the agreement of Aboriginal Australia.

        We found out, both at hearings of the Joint Committee on Native Title, now chaired by Senator Abetz, and also the two select committees on the land fund, that there were thousands of Aboriginal people across Australia who were appalled by the way that the Keating Labor government and its failed and since disgraced minister for Aboriginal affairs, Robert Tickner, handled consultations.

We have had a couple that stick in my mind in my relatively short time in this place. Firstly, there was your government's attempts in 1990 to simplify the corporations law. That was a 2,500 page exercise, as I recall. Indeed, it actually achieved a bit of simplification. It does not matter how many pages you have in a bit of legislation—it is the effect, the outcome and the processes you create. The former member for Canning and Assistant Treasurer at the time brought in a tax simplification process.

         —Senator Collins is interjecting, and he said to us that the Prime Minister had delivered on pastoral leases. Of course, I remind him that in the second reading speech, on 16 November 1993, your then Prime Minister promised the pastoralists that native title was extinguished on pastoral leases. Can I just ask the rhetorical question: what do you think the Wik case, which is in front of the High Court, is about? It is exactly about the question of pastoral leases because the legislation did not make it clear.

        It was clearly within our election promises to make the Native Title Act more workable. We want to see it work. At the moment it has provided heightened expectations, with no genuine benefits or benefits being delivered to any of our indigenous brothers and sisters. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy President, I unashamedly support the genuine work that Minister Herron and Parliamentary Secretary Minchin are trying to do without playing politics. It is very important that we get this right and that we do it very carefully. They have been very diligent in that task, and it is very sad that we get these very—

         —I just want to make a few remarks in whatever time remains to this taking note of the answer in relation to native title. I do want to address my remarks to what Senator Bob Collins has said—and I am sorry that he has now left—because I do respect what Senator Bob Collins has to say on native title matters; I respect the experience he has on this. I do just want to say that I am sorry to hear that he thinks this is legislated paternalism, and I would be very glad to talk to him about his concerns with the particular provision we are referring to—that is, the power for the minister to intervene in relation to the right to negotiate process.

        The amendment has been drafted to ensure that there is consideration of native titleholders' interests in the matter. So it was done very deliberately to ensure that the minister must take account of the interests of native titleholders when deciding whether or not to exercise the power proposed under that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         particular provision. I am therefore somewhat concerned by the remarks of Senator Collins, and I would like to talk to him about them. I would also remind him, of course, that the Labor Party in framing this bill did provide in section 42 for the minister to be able to override a determination made by the arbitrator, the tribunal, in order to allow a mining project to proceed.

        All we are doing is taking and applying exactly the same principle that is already in the act—that is, the capacity for the minister to insert his or her own determination in relation to the question of whether a mine can proceed by simply allowing the minister to bring such an intervention forward in the process—being the principle that the Labor Party provided in the act when it drew it up in 1993. I think the hysteria that has been built up over this suggestion is really quite ridiculous.

        I would also like to take the opportunity to stress that we have built these amendments very much on the principle of respecting the Racial Discrimination Act. We have gone out of our way to make sure that these amendments are not inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. Nothing we have done in relation to our proposals on the right to negotiate would constitute any breach of the Racial Discrimination Act, nor is there anything in our amendments which breaches our fundamental commitment to respect the fact of native title where it has survived. In other words, we are not proposing, nor will we, any extinguishment of native title. Those are the two fundamental premises of our approach, and all these amendments respect those two commitments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also thank Senator Brown for his contribution, but I am also sorry that he thinks what we are doing is paternalistic. I would hope that is not the case. I would ask him to consider the fact that under this act, which has been in operation for three years, and in the four years since the Mabo decision, there has not been one determination that anybody, other than the Murray Islanders, has any native title. I think that is a very sad fact, and I think it is partly because of the incredible
        <break page="3795" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         complexity and, frankly, unworkability of many parts of the Native Title Act.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Much of what we are proposing I think will lead to a situation where it will be easier for Aboriginal groups to be able to get a determination in their favour that they have native title, and I hope that that will be the outcome. But at the moment, claims are getting bogged down in the most extraordinary and expensive legalistic processes that we want to simplify. It is not all a one-way street. There are many respects in which we have taken on board and accepted propositions put to us by Aboriginal groups, particularly in relation to the amendments dealing with the representative bodies. Those amendments take on board many of the things put to us by Aboriginal groups.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question of only allowing the registration of group claims is very much in response to Aboriginal positions put to us. It does not and will not prevent individual Aboriginals from making a claim to the Federal Court for a determination that they have native title. But in response to propositions put to us by Aboriginals, we are proposing that individual claims not be allowed to be registered for access to the right to negotiate—because, as Aboriginals keep reminding us, native title is really a communal title, a group title. Aboriginals are extremely concerned by the extent to which the act allows individual claims to be made with no group basis. So we have a situation of multiple overlapping and competing claims, particularly in the gold fields of Western Australia, that are seriously causing disharmony among Aboriginal communities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So we are working with Aboriginals to try to overcome some of those problems caused by the current structures in the act. Also the voluntary agreements process, as referred to by Senator Ellison, is something that Aboriginals are looking for. In fact, it is one area where there is great unity of purpose among industry, state governments and Aboriginals to find a way in which voluntary agreements can be entered into and registered so that acts can occur on native title land with the agreement of Aboriginals and so those acts can be valid and for the benefit of Aboriginals.

       To take the second point first, in relation to consultation, Senator Abetz did clarify the matter somewhat, but I would like to put a sharper focus on it. I do not expect Senator Brown to have known about the work that a number of members of this chamber have done on both native title issues and land fund issues in the past six years. Many people in this chamber have spent day after day, week after week travelling to remote parts of Australia consulting with Aboriginal people both as a part of the formal processes of this Senate—

Secondly, in relation to `certainty', Senator Brown, I think, has a mind&amp;hyphen;set that, when anyone else talks about `certainty' or talks about `simplification' in relation to native title issues—particularly anyone from the coalition side of the chamber—they naturally refer to supporting the interests of business.

Senator Brown only needs to go to the gold fields of Western Australia—and I encourage him to do so—to look at the uncertainty that is in the minds of Aboriginal people, not only about the act but also about these overlapping multiple claims and access to legal support.

Budget cuts affecting rural Australia have hit a wide range of programs, including assistance to agribusiness, regional development, drought relief, quarantine and inspection programs, education, the ABC and labour market programs.

The exact budget cuts include the gutting of regional development programs; the cutting of $20 million dollars from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service budget over the next two years; the freezing of programs of assistance for agribusiness administered by the Department of Primary Industries; and the savage cutting of $55 million from the ABC with the premier regional radio show

        Let us just have a look at what the budget did for rural Australia. The isolated children's allowance was increased by $17 million. Senator Woodley did not acknowledge that. Let us be honest. You are a man of the cloth, you should acknowledge those things. If you are going to criticise, at least be fair about it and acknowledge some of the benefits.

The non-means tested basic boarding school allowance increased to 55 per cent of average boarding fees from $2,500 to nearly $3,000. That is another benefit for rural Australia. There is $123 million for RAS for 1996-97, an increase of $90 million.

        Let us be reasonable, Senator Woodley.

As I said, Senator Woodley, what you want, what you have got in your mind, what the Democrats want, is a government that will have the farmers totally relying on handouts. That is not what farmers want and that is not what they would even think about. That is totally in opposition to what a farmer wants.

         So today we have a motion that was borne out of a misconception of what the Democrats want to see for the Australian farmers. Unfortunately, Senator Woodley is totally wrong. The National Party have not walked away from the farming sector. The Liberal Party have not walked away from the farming sector. The people who are responsible for the absolute and utter disaster in the farming area are the people who extended the interest rates up to 23 per cent.

         In contrast, between the 1993 election and the March poll this year, the now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, released one new opposition policy document for rural Australia. It was an internally inconsistent drought policy which would, if it were ever implemented as written—I hope it will not be—largely undo the national drought policy. Thankfully it has now been dropped.

There is the closure of Medicare offices, the majority of them in regional Australia; the closure of tax offices throughout country areas in Australia; the closure of CES offices in country towns; the wind back of ABC services, which inevitably will hit the bush hardest; the complete closure of the entire department of regional affairs here in Canberra; and, I might add, the subsequent closure of the Office of Northern Development in Darwin. In terms of my own electorate, that office was absolutely crucial in getting major development projects such as the MacArthur River Mine and the Mount Todd Mine off the ground. They have all closed down with the consequent loss of people and their families from regional Aus tralia. These are all the initiatives of this government in office in terms of the contribution they are making to regional Australia.

Not all of them, of course, were successful, but have a look at what the mayors of the cities where some of them were operating said about the real on the ground support that they were giving to those townships—plenty of them were saying it.

        The changes that we are talking about have been apparent for some years, with three key areas of concern: a declining population base; economic stagnation; and a sense that it is the poor relation to the major cities. These problems existed long before this government came to office and they are a reflection, if anything, on some of the policies and attitudes of the previous government to rural and regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well as the areas of concern that I have just mentioned, over the last 10 years we have had low or fluctuating commodity prices, between five and eight years of drought, and a drift of population to the cities. In some ways, this was attempted to be addressed by the regional development program that Senator Bob Collins has just referred to. He knows very well that two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the funding for those programs was spent on the better cities program, that there were major problems in that program identified by the McKinsey, report such as that the program was poorly delivered, the highly bureaucratic reporting requirements and the excessive administrative burdens that were placed on RDOs under the programs. Not only that, the program was poorly conceived and RDOs had a limited success.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In contrast to this, Minister Sharp has announced that there will be brokering of major improved links between the regions and the investment and financing community, and given that the McKinsey report criticised the cargo cult mentality and the way in which the
        <break page="3804" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         regions themselves had difficulty accessing investment and financial advice, this should go a long way before that. Senator Collins also said that we are putting no more money into it.

        I move on to the way in which this government has started to address the problems of rural and regional Australia. Apart from the $1 billion family tax initiative which will give families more choice about work and parenting, there is, as Senator Collins did not remark on, a new $149 million road safety black spot program to improve roads, 50 per cent of which will be spent on rural roads. The road toll for 1995 was 2,017 people and road trauma costs Australia $6 billion annually. Anything that can move against this will be an improvement.

        Senator Collins also spoke expressively about the supermarket to Asia program and the way in which our initiatives were a development of the previous government. The major difference that he did not talk about was that our micro&amp;hyphen;economic reforms in transport and industrial relations will act so that we can at least deliver more efficiently and cheaply food to Asia in a way that the previous government never did. There have been many horror stories of perishable cargoes left to rot on wharves while unions went on strike and the previous government could not bring its much vaunted industrial relations program to bear on that so that we were at least able to deliver our exports. Therefore, we gained an extremely bad reputation in Asia for not delivering on time and not delivering our contracts. One of the major initiatives of our whole economic program will be to work in concert with the supermarket to Asia program so that at least we can gain a record as an efficient exporter and one who delivers cargoes on time.

        The government—the Howard-Fischer government—gave a hint of what it would do when it abolished the regional development program of the former Labor government before the budget.

        When I asked during estimates why the transport and regional development title was still being retained after the government had abolished regional development, I was told that that was not correct. I suppose, technically, it is not. They only had a staff of 220; they now only have a staff of six, which reports to the transport economics area—not to any other operative area in the department. One has to wonder what this group of six people is going to be able to do.

        Senator Collins has very clearly outlined what the impact of the abolition of regional organisations is going to be. I know very well. I was in Dubbo the day the announcement of the abolition of the department took place. I know very well the palpable anger that was being felt by that community, because that community was benefiting from a $2 million grant under this program for which it had been able to leverage over $40 million from AGL for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Marsden to Dubbo and beyond if the RDOs had continued to be funded to the proper extent. They were very uncertain on that day—at that early time in the morning—as to whether their contract was going to be honoured or not. Fortunately, they were one of the organisations who had the two signatures on the contracts, and the cheques have been paid. They also have received $200,000 to set up a white cypress mill in Gilgandra.

        One of the other things that it has done is make massive cuts to labour market programs—a cut of $1.5 billion over the next four years—and that is going impact extremely heavily on rural areas.

These programs have not just been providing employment for people but they have been providing these people with training and with skills. If we are going to be a caring community and offer our community the best chance available to them as the economy improves and as jobs become more prevalent, then we have to have an educated and trained community.

Now you have the gall to blame us when we are trying to take a responsible decision. We have had to take a decision in a way that there are some cuts. Yes, they were difficult decisions and the coalition had to decide to try and spread the pain across a wide range of people. The National Farmers Federation, when they first responded to the budget, said:

        When the opposition had the opportunity of quarter after quarter of growth, they threw it away. They threw it down the drain. When they had the opportunity, when they sold the Commonwealth Bank, when they sold Qantas, did we see a natural heritage bill? Did we see part of that money being spent to retire debt? No. Did we see that money being spent on something like a natural heritage bill? No, but the coalition has put up a proposition for the partial sale of Telstra, a one-third sale of Telstra. That is a commitment that all the money raised, bar $1 billion of it, will go to retiring debt and the other billion will go into a program that will benefit rural and regional Australia enormously.

        If you had come around with us to those inquiries and listened to those farmers in rural areas in Albury, Senator Woodley, if you had listened to farmers who came and visited us from Tasmania, you would have heard them talking about the benefits of the natural heritage bill and the benefits to rural areas of creating jobs and of actually increasing their productivity. To come in here and say that we are not supporting the rural and regional areas, that we are contributing to the decline in programs in rural and regional areas, is only telling half the story. You are looking at only some of the things.

        They have also said there has been a massive cut in road funding. Let me talk about road funding. The road funding commitment of the previous Labor government has been supplemented enormously. The shadow minister for transport, the honourable member Melbourne (Mr Tanner), actually issued a press release in August saying that the Howard government had slashed road funding. He was absolutely wrong, and it is totally wrong for Senator Collins to come in here and say that we had slashed road funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Commonwealth has allocated $1,603 million for road funding in 1996-97, which is up from $1,569 million in 1995-96. It has gone up. I do not know what Senator Collins has been reading, but they are not the same budget papers I have been reading. It is the largest road funding budget in the last 10 years excluding 1993, I think it was, when we had the blip of the One Nation program. So it is the largest one in 10 years. A large majority of that money will be spent in rural and regional Australia.

        If you come in here and say that we have not committed ourselves, you have only to look at the rural program that Dr Wooldridge has put in place to try to increase the number of doctors in rural areas. There are enormous initiatives that are being undertaken to develop new programs in rural and regional areas.

         —I am cognisant of the fact that Senator Ferris is waiting to make her first speech today, so I will keep my remaining remarks as brief as possible. In the course of the debate, before we ran out of time, I was saying that in the last five weeks I have visited and spoken to Aboriginal representatives in Darwin, Jabiru, Alice Springs, Uluru and Denmark in Western Australia—not by phone but in person.

        I was rather disappointed that in the debate some members opposite yelled out, `Ah, but you didn't get out of the bus.' It is really interesting that in a number of instances today the behaviour, inappropriate behaviour, of ministers was mentioned. That was relating to
        <break page="3811" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         a dorothy dix question which was intended to give the impression that I—and it was said to the media—had wasted taxpayers' money. It was quite interesting that this was the response in today's debate.

        It would be extremely difficult to spend a day having meetings and briefings at Ranger Uranium Mine without being out of a bus. That has never been acknowledged by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron).
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, if we are talking about ministerial responsibility and behaviour, it is about time that that bad behaviour was addressed and it was acknowledged that I did not conduct a sit&amp;hyphen;in, that I was out of the bus all day and that the only time during that trip to Ranger that I was still in the bus was when we were in the bottom of the pit and places like that. I think that I am entitled to make a decision to stay in the four&amp;hyphen;wheel drive for the few minutes or not. The four&amp;hyphen;wheel drive had to be decontaminated later.

        We are talking about accountability. Accountability to whom? I am hearing from Aboriginal communities that spending on Aboriginal programs ought to be accountable to Aboriginal people. But we have not heard that from the minister. We have not heard from this minister that he understands that Aboriginal communities are saying that spending on Aboriginal programs should be accountable to Aboriginal people and communities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Point No. 1 of the motion relates to the failure of the minister to seek advice or consult before illegally imposing an independent auditor on ATSIC. People were giving scores in that particular debate. I would have to say that the score on that ruling quite clearly was 3&amp;hyphen;0 in relation to the illegality of that action.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Point 2, seeking to make changes to eligibility criteria: yes, in the debate that was changed. We knew that. We went into that debate knowing that it needed to be changed. But I am talking about the responsibility of the minister to go into a debate on legislation on something that could well have cost ATSIC $4.7 million to repair a ministerial error.

         Many people in the Australian community cannot comprehend why this minister cannot understand the impact of his decisions. I was challenged during the debate to go with the minister when he visits a community. I have to say that I am covering all areas of the portfolio for Western Australia. But, if the minister is listening, I am happy to take the minister up on his challenge. Sure, you name the time. Provided that the Senate is not sitting and that I can make the time available without having other commitments, I am happy to accompany you on a visit to communities to listen to their responses to the changes that are occurring in the communities. Just let me know when that is to occur.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many reasons why it was necessary to have this debate today, not the least of which has been to show that some people do understand and have thought through the issues that are being promoted and have surfaced in the media in recent times. They do understand why the populist trend to find people to blame is a political godsend to the coalition; why it is helping them in their ratings. People do not understand what the bases are for the changes that have occurred that are making their lives less secure at the moment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But this is not just occurring in Australia. If you look at a number of countries in recent times, with the change to economic rationalism the turmoils are often internal. So it is not just in Australia where scapegoatism has become a more obvious element of society. I would like to think that we can recognise the danger of scapegoatism before it reaches the levels to which we have seen it develop in other countries where, because of economic rationalist policies, because of such things as structural adjustment and major changes and differences between the rich and poor in those societies, there has been social turmoil and scapegoatism. I would like to think that, as mature people and as people representing the community in Australia, we recognise the dangers of scapegoatism and address them before they get to that stage in Australia; that, before they get worse, we will address them and start dealing with the issues of why people are feeling disenchanted, why there is
         <break page="3812" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          a growing number of working poor, why the nature of jobs and employment is changing, and why it is easy to look at other people who appear to be getting handouts and assume that they are on a good wicket, when it is not the case.

         Senator Bob Collins has very articulately pointed out the issues in relation to health, particularly health funding. I hope this debate about health and education service funding, but most particularly in the areas of self-determination, does get somewhere; that, if nothing else, the course of this debate today means that those issues will be recognised, that it will be seen that members of the community recognise it and are prepared to pull this into the debate that we are having today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Today I was saddened to hear the minister pulling in the politically correct notion. That has been an excuse on a lot of occasions recently for parliamentarians not taking their responsibilities seriously and instead finding scapegoats in the community, targeting minority groups and those people who are less able to fight for their rights, less able to be represented in the parliament. It is our responsibility to try to represent not just the strongest in the community but all of the community where we can.

         There are statistics of Aboriginal deaths in custody which show that, despite what anybody says in relation to so-called benefits, a large number of Aboriginal people who have died in custody were directly involved with the stolen generation—and not just that generation, but also the next generation whose lives become dysfunctional because their parents' lives became dysfunctional. It did not just happen 60 years ago; its repercussions are being felt today.

         I do commend this motion to the Senate. But, no matter what happens, I am extremely grateful that the debate has occurred and that these issues at least are being put in the public arena. I hope that some of these issues will be dealt with, and that people will realise that there are ministerial responsibilities which do mean that you often have to check. I hope, if nothing else, there is an immediate remembering that, if there are going to be
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          major changes, you check to find out whether they are even constitutionally possible and what their impact will be, before jumping in and making changes that will have major impacts on communities, especially communities which are already deeply disadvantaged in Australian society. I commend this motion to the Senate.

       It is an honour to take my place in the Senate, which our constitutional authors determined at the time of Federation should be a protector of the rights of our states and, in particular, the rights of the less populous states. In choosing to follow the style of the American Senate by providing equal representation for each state, Australia is regarded as having one of the most powerful upper houses in the world.

       As senators, we are part of an auspicious history. The original Senate was of course the highest deliberative body in ancient Rome, taking its name from the Latin senatus—literally, a group of elders. Clearly not all of us would qualify by their election criteria.

       I had the chance to reflect on the history of the first Senate when I wandered among the spectacular ruins of the Forum and the Palatine Hill last year. These huge and imposing structures which still dominate the city are ongoing evidence of the civic pride, the  engineering brilliance and the majestic grandeur of the old imperial city—and among those ancient pieces of marble and granite, an ongoing reminder of the fragility of democracy.

       The state of South Australia, which I have the honour to represent, includes some of

        Australia's most diverse and beautiful landscapes, providing the backdrop for the resource industries which have become part of our nation's colourful history. The opportunities to create wealth for Australia and employment for its people were recognised soon after our state was first colonised.

       In June 1836, the first edition of the South Australian gazette and Colonial Register reported an early description by Captain Charles Sturt, who wrote:

       Of course the chances for prosperity offered to our early pioneers extended much further than the Adelaide plains. Our state's early wealth resulted from the determination and perseverance of our primary producers—those courageous and visionary men and women who pioneered our pastoral lands, establishing the great sheep stations which contribute to our wealth and our export income.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Their lives and their lifestyle in the harsh and often unforgiving bush attracted comment from a range of visiting international writers, among them Anthony Trollope, who observed in 1873:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The number of sheep at these stations will generally indicate with fair accuracy the mode of life at the head station: a hundred thousand sheep and upwards require a professional man&amp;hyphen;cook and butler to look after them; forty thousand sheep cannot be shorn without a piano; twenty thousand is the lowest number that renders napkins at dinner imperative.

       Maintaining standards and more than a modicum of commonsense in the face of testing adversity is a proud tradition in country families. It still remains strong and long may it continue. Their personal contribution and those of their industries built the strong foundations of this great country. We in the cities continue to enjoy the benefits that flow from their bountiful harvests and offer them support when the elements do not.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       These great industries have given South Australia a good share of heroes, courageous Australians whose personal contribution continues to be remembered. Sidney Kidman, from a humble stockman's family, out of
       <break page="3814" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        school and working at the age of 13, sacked when he asked for a pay rise, through ingenuity and sheer hard work became the largest land&amp;hyphen;holder in the British Empire. In 1921, Kidman was knighted, not for his contribution to the pastoral industry but for his wartime efforts in supplying horses and equipment, fighter planes, ambulances and shipments of beef and wool for the First World War. Thomas Elder, and his brother&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;law Robert Barr Smith, who together built one of the largest pastoral agencies in the world, provided hundreds of jobs and rural services to the farming industries around Australia.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Pastoralists were of course not the only farming pioneers. Miners and early explorers found our first significant mineral wealth as South Australia was facing financial ruin. The early discovery of large copper deposits at Kapunda in 1842 and at Burra three years later saved the young colony from certain bankruptcy.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       These industries also fostered some very special South Australians. Essington Lewis, from humble beginnings in the mining town of Burra, rose to lead Australia's largest company—Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. Douglas Mawson, a renowned geologist and engineer, is appropriately remembered for his pioneering spirit and incredible courage in adversity on the Antarctic coastline.

       Minerals and resource processing industries have continued to contribute to the wealth of South Australia. We have in our state Australia's largest onshore oil and gas reserves in the Cooper Basin. We produce 60 per cent of the world's precious opal. There is in our starkly beautiful outback a world&amp;hyphen;class 200-year-old resource of copper, silver, gold and uranium at Olympic Dam, while the world's largest zinc smelter is at Port Pirie.

      <para first-indent="16">
       For almost a century, iron ore has been mined in the Middleback ranges to be processed at Whyalla and, of course, we have our significant coal reserves at Leigh Creek. The $20 million South Australian exploration initiative is now uncovering many more of the prosperous geological secrets that have remained hidden beneath our ancient soils. Greater resource wealth seems assured.

        Our primary producers, blessed with a bumper season last year and optimistic that another could be at hand, boosted exports of their products last year to almost three&amp;hyphen;quarters of a billion dollars—an increase of more than 200 per cent. The state's winemakers recently toasted overseas sales of $315 million—up by a quarter on last year and more than 400 per cent higher than five years ago.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Spectacular growth has also occurred in our manufactured exports. Our two motor car manufacturers are now producing 150,000 vehicles a year and they are selling their products to the world, creating new opportunities for expansion and jobs for more than 13,000 South Australians. During the past year, the vehicle and components industry exported products worth $254 million—double the figures of five years ago.

        Last year South Australia's exporting industry sold to the world products worth more than $4.5 billion—clear evidence that we have at last conquered our old rustbelt image.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We have first-class speciality food—fruit from the Riverland; tuna, oysters, lobsters and marron from our growing aquaculture industries of Port Lincoln, the Eyre Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, the southern coastline and Gulf St Vincent; our lean beef and lamb from the lush pastures of the south-east; and rich grain products from the state's farming lands, which are widely sought after around the country. And, at last, the great restaurants of the world are discovering our fine wines.

        I am very proud of my state of South Australia, although my pathway to this place has also taken me through other states and territories. I first came to the national capital as a young journalist to work at the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Canberra Times
        </emphasis>
        and soon became an enthusiastic spectator of the national political scene. Canberra was then a robust and developing city, growing by more than 10 per cent a year. As the new suburbs tumbled over the grazing lands and the foothills of Woden and
        <break page="3815" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Belconnen, the dust storms from the newly created cul&amp;hyphen;de&amp;hyphen;sacs and playing fields filled the houses—and the eyes—of the residents.

        What a spectacularly beautiful city Canberra has become—its avenues of stately trees and sweeping vistas a living tribute to the imagination of Walter Burley Griffin and his talented wife Marion whose significant contribution to her husband's work must surely soon be recognised in this national capital.

       <para first-indent="16">
        During my days as a Canberra journalist I was privileged to meet Australia's first female federal member of parliament and later cabinet minister, Dame Enid Lyons, who was in Canberra to officially open a school in a suburb which bears her family's name. She was a modest, yet quietly inspiring woman, her forthright and commonsense approach to politics a lesson for us all. Dame Enid, writing in her first book,
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         So we take comfort
        </emphasis>
        , likened her entry as the first Liberal woman into federal politics as being, `like a lamb to the slaughter, like a sheep before the shearers, I was led forth to have a go.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many other women followed, including South Australia's Dame Nancy Buttfield, who became the fifth woman to enter the Senate, serving our state with distinguished representation for a total of 16 years. Today there are five women among South Australia's 12 senators and there are 23 women in the Senate—the highest number ever. Together with the 22 female members of the House of Representatives, women are now, on merit, clearly taking their place as elected representatives of their communities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The state I represent of course led the way when, as Helen Jones has written, `On a hot December morning in 1894, a week before Christmas, the South Australian House of Assembly resounded to loud cheering as the parliament acknowledged its decision to give votes for women.' The youngest Australian colony was the first not only to give women the vote but also to allow them to stand for parliament.

         I particularly mention the efforts of Catherine Helen Spence, a courageous campaigner and social reformer—and a journalist by profession—who stood, unsuccessfully, for selection as a representative of South Austral ia at the Federal Convention of 1897. Her personal commitment to the care of women and children, and their education and personal development has been well recognised by grateful generations who have followed.

        South Australian women have continued in more recent times to make this special mark at a national level. Dame Roma Mitchell, who recently retired as South Australia's first female state governor, has been an inspiration to generations of women as she, with brilliance yet quiet modesty, blazed a trail across the legal pathways of Australia.

        My own entry to national politics followed valuable experience as a member of staff both in federal parliament and with the South Australian state Liberal government. I worked for several years as a lobbyist here in Canberra as a member of a quite special team of people at the National Farmers Federation. A unique combination of commonsense and courage, together with great leadership, delivered some very important national milestones.

        No-one in Canberra on that crisp winter's day will ever forget the 45,000 farmers and their families who gathered on 1 July 1985 outside Old Parliament House to make their own peaceful and well&amp;hyphen;mannered protest about the effect of interest rates and spiralling farm costs. There were no bills for damage on that day, no riot shields were required, no shops were looted and certainly no injuries were inflicted on our police. That special day, when the farmers came to town, must surely be Canberra's most successful political rally.

        As a resident of Canberra during the early eighties, I watched with some awe the construction of this great white House on the Hill. With my two sons, I came to the top of Capital Hill the day before the road closed to begin the construction of the new building. Two rabbits and a large red kangaroo, early inhabitants of the hill, scuttled across our pathway through the grass and scrub on that day—a reminder that this was once considered the Bush Capital.

        South Australia's magnificent Imperial Black granite from the Black Hill quarries, north east of Adelaide, is well represented in this national parliament. It is in the forecourt, it paves the public foyer, and a single piece now forms the reflective pool in the Members' Hall.

        The construction of this new parliament building offered me a special time for reflection and an opportunity to consider what kind of Australia those men and women elected to this place would frame for my children's grandchildren, to wonder what effect their decisions would have on future generations each time they passed—or failed to pass—the myriad of legislation crucial to our nation's future, and to consider whether, as teenagers in another half a century, my great grandchildren will face the future with optimism or despair.

        Our task here—not only as elected men and women but also mostly as mothers and fathers, and some as grandparents—is to take on the task of restoring this sense of hope and optimism to all of our young people.

       Where a person has a legal right to enforce or a legal defence to offer to another's claim, the imposition of substantial fees restricting access to the courts of law may place that person, unless he be affluent, outside the law's protection.

       These measures proposed by the government in their budget of betrayal deny so many Australians access to the judicial system. We are talking about raising some $72 million from the Family Court system with these measures—a system which is there to assist families in times of crisis. What does this government want to do? It wants to rip $72 million off litigants in that system over four years. It also wants to take some $32 million from other litigants in the Federal Court system. For instance, your average small business claim will rise from just over $1,100 to over $12,000. The cost of enforcing a medium sized debt through bankruptcy proceedings will rise from $730 or so to at least $1,600 for an individual and over $3,000 for a company. A typical disputed family law claim will rise from $368 to over $2,000. An unlawful dismissal claim, which currently can be lodged free, will cost the applicants more than $2,700—and that is before one has to consider paying one's lawyers.

Individually, these fees are harsh and a real denial of justice to workers, family people and small business owners. Not only are they harsh in their instant application but also in respect of some of them there is a continuing application.

For all the pain in respect of these fees, you might have hoped, you might have thought, there would be some compensatory gain. But you do not find any additional resources put into our justice system to make it fairer and more equitable. These fees are a part of the single largest attack on access to justice that we have ever seen in this country. The measures in the budget attacking access to justice, altogether, will recoup for the government $320 million over four years from access to justice programs. That is twice the amount that the previous government's Justice Statement measures were calculated to cost.

       There is one area where we can act and this is the one that is before us this evening, that is, we can tackle this particular issue. We can tackle it in a number of ways. We can tackle the government on their arguments. In terms of the estimates process, it became apparently clear that the government was committed to these increased recovery rates because it said that user pays, to a certain extent, should apply and we should try to link our cost recovery to the states.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The one principle that should not apply in the justice system is user pays. The words `user pays' came quite often from the officers who are trying to defend the government's moves here. But once again, it is the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia who has demonstrated why user pays is plain wrong in respect of this particular issue. In his speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration, his Honour said of `user pays':
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">

      <para>
       Justice should not be for sale. What the government is doing here is making it accessible to the highest bidder. Justice should not become a commodity for sale to the highest bidder. It is a public good and to that extent the principle of user pays should not be appropriate.

        Council of Australia on 16 September, Michael Phelps set out the respective fees and charges in the state court systems. It is interesting to note that it only costs between $140 and $520 to commence an application in the state or territory supreme courts. It will cost $800 under this particular proposal to do so in the Federal Court for an individual and $1,600 for a company. Across the spectrum, when you look at the comparison of Federal Court and supreme court fees throughout Australia provided by the Law Council of Australia, you will find that this government's commitment to matching 30 per cent—which was the benchmark used—of state and territory fees is just plain wrong. It is a plain deception.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       When you look at what it costs to commence an application in the Federal Court under these fees and charges raised by the federal government compared with existing fees and charges, you can see that their argument is a dishonest one. Of course, that is only in areas where you can make a comparison. You cannot make a comparison in respect of the High Court, the Family Court or the Native Title Tribunal. The states and territories do not have those sorts of jurisdictions. There are many inconsistencies and many injustices.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Another injustice is the injustice embodied in the principle here where individuals might be charged so much but companies will be charged double. There is no distinction drawn by the government between the mega&amp;hyphen;corporations—like BHP—which are used to using litigation as a means to drive small players out of the markets, and so on, as opposed to the $2 family company owning the corner shop, the video store, the petrol station, or whatever. They all have to pay the same. Whether they are big, mega&amp;hyphen;, international or national organisations, or the local family company, they will have to pay twice as much as an individual.

       I have said for some time now that we have been prepared to be reasonable in terms of trying to accommodate a CPI based increase in the fees and to have this discussed by the parliament. But I must say that my patience has worn out. We have waited at least for two weeks from the last time that we deferred these disallowance resolutions. It was flagged two weeks ago that there would be negotiations between the parties to see whether we could come up with an alternative set of fees, a set of fees that may be acceptable to the Senate, or at least to some aspects of the Senate.

In fact, we rang them this morning asking for more details for us to consider and nothing substantive has been put to us in terms of the government's negotiating capacity on this particular issue.

We have had two weeks to get some indication from you. Having had that indication from Senator Vanstone last time, we moved very quickly into the estimates process that afternoon. I asked the officers what was on the table in terms of renegotiated fees and whether anything was being seriously looked at by the government and none of them knew anything about it. None of them knew that the scales were being reviewed. In fact, they assured us a number of times that

       We have had no negotiations. We have had no information. I think it is a very poor situation that we find ourselves in now. After two weeks, when there had been quite an amount of time available, we are in a situation where the government still seeks to take over $70 million from poor families who have gone through a family court process—I must say that they are not so poor but, of course, they are poor afterwards—and over $30 million from others who might appear before the Federal Court.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It causes a problem because if there is an attempt to amend these regulations, it is now impossible to do so. Procedurally, under section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act, the government cannot make these regulations while they are subject to the current motion or any other motion for disallowance. I think we are in a position where we cannot really amend on the run. I think we have to make a decision on the basis of what has been before us.

       In the opposition, we are not prepared to have, at this particular stage, promises of vague amendments further down the track. One particular problem with that, of course, is that for every day that these regulations are not disallowed, many Australians are currently paying court fees at a level which they may not be paying in the end, and they should not be paying. In fact, many litigants are paying court fees for matters where, just a few weeks ago, they were not paying fees at all.

It is not good enough to come in at the last moment and suggest that maybe you might look at this down the track. In terms of the Federal Court, we are currently talking about a typical small business claim incurring some $12,500 in Federal Court fees. That is 10 times more than the amount currently charged. If you are going to come in with a last minute offer, Senator Vanstone, it is going to have to be

       You have argued in the estimates process that there is an exemption clause but, looking at that exemption clause, it was pretty clear from reading the legislation that, unless you are a legal aid recipient, a pensioner or concession card holder or a person who is described in the legislation as a person who, because of their financial circumstances would suffer hardship if the fees were imposed—and hardship has been interpreted, on my understanding, as meaning someone who is very close to being a legal aid recipient or a pensioner or concession card holder—then a general comment from the minister saying, `Well, we are going to broaden this' is really not good enough. It is the guidelines that need fixing, and they need fixing to ensure that the hardship provision means more than being closely linked to legal aid recipients and pensioners and concession card holders.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As I say, the hardship test, as it currently operates, basically ameliorates what could otherwise be a very strict test and it does not provide a suitable avenue for access to justice for the vast majority of low, lower and middle income earners.

       I have received recently a letter from the New South Wales Young Lawyers, dated 4 October. They have asked me and the opposition to support their submission to the Attorney-General to revoke these fees. It is interesting to go to some of the issues they raise. They raise, for instance, the question of industrial law matters. They say:
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        The new fees will require an individual applicant to pay $800 to lodge the application, $1,000 to set a matter down for hearing and $550 per hearing day. A company or trade union would have to pay fees of double those amounts. There will be additional fees for issuing subpoenas, obtaining transcripts, lodging notices of motion and other standard procedures. The absolute minimum fee for an individual applicant would be $2350 and for a company or a union $5700. Many matters would incur fees 50% to 100% higher than those amounts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Applications for matters of law to be referred or appealed to the Court from the Commission can be made by employer representatives or unions. Under the proposed new fees they would now have to pay an application fee of $1600, a setting down fee of $2000 and a daily hearing fee of $1100. This is a significant departure from the tradition of industrial matters being conducted for minimal cost. Since there is effectively no power to award costs the applicant will have to bear those costs even if successful.
       </para>
       <para>
        So you have here a significant departure from established practice in industrial law—not just an increase but a significant departure. In respect of unfair dismissals, they say that that is a matter of particular concern to them. As they say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Court fees will be waived for those eligible for Legal Aid and on other limited grounds, very few persons who had only just lost full time employment would qualify on those grounds. They would have to make a difficult decision to pay an $800 application fee, and face the prospect of paying a $1000 setting down fee and $550 per day in hearing fees at a time when they do not know whether they will obtain employment again in the foreseeable future. This would discourage many deserving claimants from making a claim.

       <para>
        They go on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The claimants would also be advised that they would be very unlikely to get back those costs even if successful, under the essentially `no cost' jurisdiction.

        What is really interesting is their reference to the AIRC annual report for 1994-95. The letter states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . more than half of all awards for compensation payments for unfair dismissals were $6000 or less. I understand the soon to be released Annual Report for the 1995/96 year will show an almost identical result. The 1995/96 report will also show that 24%

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Based on those statistics, an applicant, who would have to pay a minimum of $2350 for a one day hearing and a minimum of $2900 for a two day hearing, would get an average order of compensation of $6000, and 24% would get less than $3000. These figures show that once the fees are introduced many claimants would find they were financially not much better off—

       <para>
        That is in terms of running cases. In fact, they would be worse off. They would be deterred from running the sorts of cases that are so critical in terms of unfair dismissal. The letter goes on. It is a rather useful letter because it does make the point that these sorts of fees would also hinder early resolution of claims. One does not need too much of an imagination to realise that employers would recognise that litigants would find it difficult to pay the fees and serious offers to settle would be rare in coming forward.

        There are a host of our industrial relations matters, but what we are talking about here is a new precedent in industrial law. It is particularly important for instance in unfair dismissal, where a claim that a dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable would go to the AIRC for determination. But if the claim is on other grounds, such as on the ground of race, sex or religion, it would be heard initially in the Federal Court where an applicant would have to pay, from the start, additional fees.

        —In commencing, can I say that, if the Labor Party in its 13 years in government had never come into this place and sought to put up fees for courts and tribunals, what Senator Bolkus had to say might ring as being something he genuinely believed and had always practised himself. Since that is not the case, what he said today stands in stark contrast to Labor's record. I leave that to others to judge in that respect.

       Senator Bolkus has made a point which has highlighted the ineptitude of the opposition in this respect. That is, he would have liked to have had some sensible negotiations. The two weeks have past and no offers have been made. What he has not spelt out to this chamber is that an approach was made and it

        was very clearly conveyed to the government that the opposition were not prepared to negotiate other than on the most unrealistic terms. That is, they put their peg down a very large distance from where the government wanted to be and indicated that that was that—we were either talking turkey at that level or we were out of the ballpark.

       I make another point: Senator Bolkus at least once, if not on other occasions, indicated that this aspect—that is, the cost of courts and tribunals—is the one critical issue where we can have a say vis-a-vis the cost of justice. With the greatest respect, he is mistaken in that view. The fees in courts and tribunals have a role to play in the cost of justice. But, as Senator Cooney would know—and as I and other senators in this place who participated in the cost of justice inquiry know—the fees of courts and tribunals are but a part of the high cost of justice. They are not the sole indicator of it. They, like the cost of justice itself, move with time.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Clearly, the government wishes to oppose the disallowance motion as tabled by Senator Bolkus, but I do want to underline that the government—I in particular, along with other senators here—as I have indicated, has an abiding commitment to access to justice. We may go to that path by a different route than the previous government would have gone, but that does not mean we do not have that commitment.

       We are also committed to ensuring those who make use of government services make a reasonable contribution to the cost of those services. On attaining office, we were faced
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        with the legacy of the $8 billion black hole, the Beazley bankcard. This government was not afraid to take the decisions which had to be taken to deal with that legacy of our predecessors. We were not prepared to walk away from that black hole, as the previous government did. If we did walk away from it, we would be walking away from the weakest in our community, those who would benefit the most from having a government that has the strength of character to keep the fiscal matters in order.

       One of the major commitments we made to the Australian people was a preparedness to make those hard decisions—they made the mess; we are prepared to fix it. We also said that, to the greatest extent possible, the pain would be shared across the whole community.

      <para first-indent="16">
       One area where it seemed clear that an adequate contribution was not being made was in relation to those who use the resources of the Commonwealth's courts and tribunals, many of whom stand to make significant gains. Indeed, until the major increases levied by our predecessors on 1 January this year—and I just wonder whether Senator Bolkus was aware of that—the level of cost recovery in Commonwealth courts and tribunals had fallen from a high of almost 21 per cent in 1989 under a Labor government to about 12 per cent in 1995.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       For the information of honourable senators, I might point out that the cost of running the Commonwealth's courts and tribunals has risen from about $81 million in 1989 to over $230 million in the current financial year. These are massive increases in outlays. The cost of running the Family Court alone has risen to in excess of $100 million per annum. Perhaps as an indication of the cost of providing these services one need only look at the Federal Court, which has estimated that it costs in excess of $6,000 a day to keep a judge in a court.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       To make some assessment of what was a reasonable contribution, the government looked at the average levels of cost recovery in the states and territories, and this averaged at about 30 per cent. We have taken decisions to move cost recovery across the Commonwealth system to that level. We continue to
       <break page="3824" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        believe that this assessment was not unreasonable. The increases were spread across all the courts and tribunals, but they were not uniform in their impact. The government recognised, for example, that the special nature of the Family Court and the matters it deals with mean the same fee levels should not apply to the Family Court as to the Federal Court.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The changes we enacted meant that the level of cost recovery in the Family Court was estimated to rise to only 23 per cent whereas the increases in the Federal Court would raise cost recovery in that court to in excess of 50 per cent. So the differences between the Family Court and the Federal Court, as highlighted by Senator Bolkus, were in fact acknowledged in the lesser cost recovery being sought by the government in the Family Court.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We were concerned to ensure that the disadvantaged would not suffer because of these increases. At the same time as we moved to increase the level of cost recovery to its current estimates, we also moved to ensure that there was a uniform and fair system of exemptions and waivers in place to protect those who could not afford to pay. I remind the Senate that the Family Court now waives fees in approximately 40 per cent of the cases. Let us not pretend that every litigant in the Family Court is hard up. No-one pretends that, hopefully. Let us acknowledge that that court waives approximately 40 per cent. Clearly, those who cannot afford to pay, do not. This will continue to be the case.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Having set out the government's reasoning in bringing in these fees, we are aware of concerns that have been expressed about some of the impacts that the fees as currently imposed may have. While these concerns have not been expressed across the whole community, there have been issues raised by those in the legal profession and some in other groups that the government is concerned to deal with.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We do not believe that there needs to be significant movement from the fundamental structure of the fees as currently imposed. They have been designed so that those who use more of the system's resources should make the greatest contribution. The new daily
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        fees for hearings in both the High Court and the Federal Court are examples of this approach. The introduction of a one-off hearing fee in the Family Court is another example.

       As I indicated earlier, the government has considered the concerns that have been expressed. I would like to outline now for honourable senators the revised position that the government believes will take account of many of those concerns. Some concerns have been expressed in relation to the new fee regime in the Family Court. The government attempted to restrict the increases in that court and will make further efforts in that regard. The major reason behind the introduction of the fees for ancillary relief and the one-off fee for hearings was to ensure that those who use the greatest share of the court's resources—those seeking additional relief and those taking matters to a hearing—should make a larger contribution.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       To partially offset this reduction, the government has decided to make a small additional increase to the fee for principal relief. The current fee will rise from $460 to $500. We propose to reduce the fee for ancillary relief from its current level of $250 to $150. Given the high level of waiver in the Family Court and the reduction in the fee, we believe that such a fee should be well within the reach of those who do not fall into the approximately 40 per cent of those whose fees are waived. In addition, the government will reduce the one-off hearing fee from $400 to $300 to reduce the impact of that fee.

Firstly, we will ensure that for unlawful dismissal matters, the fees payable in the Federal Court will be no higher than any payable for a similar matter in the Industrial Relations Commission under the new workplace relations legislation. There will be other reductions in fees in the Federal Court. The application fee for a non-corporate litigant will be reduced from $800 to $500 and from $1,600 to $1,200 for a corporate litigant. Applications to the court by creditors under the Bankruptcy Act will have the current fee reduced to the same level. The

       The daily hearing fees will be reduced from $550 and $1,100 to $400 and $800 respectively. In addition, the first day of hearing will not incur a fee but will be regarded as being included within the setting down fee. Fees for setting a matter down for appeal will be reduced from $1,500 and $3,000 to $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. All other fees will remain the same.

       As I stated earlier, the government believes that this approach to the new fees in each of the courts and tribunals was reasonable and necessary in light of the difficult budgetary position that it found itself in. We have, however, made these significant concessions to deal with the express concerns. I point out that these concessions will significantly reduce the revenue expected.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The opposition has made much of its claims about the impact of the new fees. I could pick a number of significant holes in the figuring of Senator Bolkus in his worst case scenarios but, given the concessions made by the government, those scenarios will no longer even be a possibility.

       I would like to make some comment on those who repeatedly say that the courts are only for the wealthy or the very poor. It is a criticism regularly echoed by those who offer no evidence to support their sweeping claims. Indeed, Chief Justice Gleeson of the New South Wales Supreme Court noted in 1992 that, despite the claims I mentioned earlier, the great majority of litigants in his court appeared to be neither very rich nor very poor. Such evidence as there is suggests that most individual litigants come from middle income groups.

       Making reasonable charges for the use of Commonwealth courts and tribunals does not deny access to those who need to use the system for the resolution of their disputes. For some only a system which is free of any fees would be appropriate. But for the vast bulk of the community there is support for those who can afford to make a contribution being obliged to do so.

        Dependent on the result of this debate, obviously, the government will move to make the necessary changes to the existing fees as from 1 September 1996, with the exception of the new fee for applications for divorce and nullity, which will operate as soon as the necessary changes to regulations can be made.

        The judiciary exists as an essential and functioning arm of the government in this country. It is not a luxury that should be paid for. It is something that should be provided as a public utility. It should not be governed by privatisation, by user pays or undesirable corporatisation. I think that that is the direction in which the government is moving today with these regulations. It is, along with the legislature and the executive, part of our functioning and constitutional government.

It is not an extravagance. Senator Bolkus has outlined many of the costs and how in many cases the fees are exorbitant and prohibitive. In some cases, the fees that we discussed today represent a 172 per cent increase for individuals and as much as a 443 per cent increase for corporate Australians.

        According to the Australian Democrats, the most disturbing aspect of this money grab by the government is that it will negatively impact upon families, those families who are using the Family Court's jurisdiction. Incidents of domestic violence and child abuse are some of the most disturbing dimensions of what happens when a family becomes dysfunctional. The proposition that health care card holders will be given exemption denies the fact that not all deserving cases will be holding health care cards. I cannot think of anything more abhorrent than a woman who is suffering from domestic violence in the home having to argue her case, having to argue why she should be exempt from filing fees.

If the honourable senator was aware of restraint orders that are made—I do not know how often or on what regular basis I used to do restraint orders on behalf of clients—she would know that they are filed 99.9 per cent in the state jurisdictions because they are so much quicker and cheaper. To get a domestic violence restraint order in the Family Court these days is virtually unheard of. These days emergency ones are quite often brought by the state police or, indeed, by private practitioners but in the state jurisdiction.

       It was further suggested by the previous contributor to this debate that this was an outrageous attempt to try to grab money from those less fortunate within the community. Madam Acting Deputy President, you have to ask yourself the question: how many people do you put into that category when you take cognisance of the fact that 40 per cent of people making application to the Family Court get their fees waived already? Are you going to say that there are more than 40 per cent of the population who are underprivileged? I do not think that argument is sustainable.

       If you look at the usage of the Family Court in particular, which is the one area that has excited a degree of interest, the socioeconomic range within the community at large is, in fact, reflected in the Family Court. Those who we might say are very poor as a percentage of the community use the Family Court just as much as those whom we might call absolutely filthy rich; they use the Family Court according to their percentage as represented within the community. I do not think we can honestly argue that this will hurt those in the lower socioeconomic group, unless you assert that in excess of 40 per cent ought be considered to be in that category. With the greatest of respect, I do not think that that argument is sustainable.

       We were then told that there are some people who are clearly unable to afford the fees but who would not necessarily be in possession of a Medicare card or a health benefit card which would provide automatic waiver of fees. That is correct. But what the family courts are preparing—and this used to be the case, I might add; those of us who practised in the jurisdiction who are not dealing with cheap political points but with the facts and know what occurred are aware that this used to happen—is a form that you simply fill in stating your financial circumstances. It used to be the case that, on face value, the details stated on that form were accepted as being the truth, and the registry would then waive the fee. You would simply
       <break page="3828" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       Of course, those accessing the Family Court have to fill out and sign forms in front of a Justice of the Peace or whomever in any event, before they can actually lodge documents and get an appointment with the Family Court. So it will not be any extra work, and the person who is making application for the waiver of fees will not be put on the stand to be cross-examined by the Registrar of the Family Court to see whether or not they have told the truth in that form. Of course, a penalty ought apply in the event that they are shown to have misled the court. But that really is not something that is likely to occur.

       If, as expressed, there is all this moral outrage about these fee increases, Madam Acting Deputy President, you have to ask the question: why wasn't there this same moral outrage previously? If we look at the cost recovery rate within the community at large, we see, for example, that in the High Court in 1992-93 the cost recovery rate was 3.3 per cent; it will go up to about 8.9 per cent. In the Federal Court where we might be looking at about 53.9 per cent, do you know what the recovery was in 1989-90? Fifty three per cent. Under the Labor regime, they were pursuing 53 per cent cost recovery rate from the Federal Court—yet they come in here only a matter of seven years later beating their breasts about the injustice of a cost recovery of an extra 0.9 per cent. How shallow, how hollow, is that sort of assertion when confronted with the facts of what their administration used to engage in.

       It is very easy to get emotive about these issues. I am simply trying to provide some facts and figures, and set out how the system has worked in the past. In 1989-90 the Family Court had a cost recovery rate of 17.9 per cent; under our proposals, it will slip up to 22.5 per cent—hardly the sort of percentage increase that would make people pull out their hair. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal had a 2.1 per cent cost recovery; our proposals would increase that by one per cent to 3.1 per cent. It is hardly anything of great moment that we are discussing.

        It does perturb me that I need to make a comment about the submission of the Law Council of Australia because I am, in fact, a member of it and the family law division. As Senator McKiernan would know, I asked a question at Senate estimates in relation to the quite emotive letter of the Law Council of Australia about the consequences of these fees. Let me read to you what they wrote to honourable senators. In the second paragraph of a document dated 6 September 1996, they stated:

       <para>
        Keeping in mind that the first 40 per cent of the lowest socioeconomic groupings will be exempt in any event, you have to ask yourself: how are the family law fees that lawyers charge set? Unless there is an agreement outside of the regulations, we are required to charge as per the regulations of the Family Law Act. And do you know what? Each year or every two years, whenever there has been a fee increase for lawyers, which will impact and have the inevitable economic consequences on these struggling families, not once have they complained and said, `These poor struggling families cannot afford our fees.'

        The Law Council of Australia has always accepted the fee increases for its membership and accepted that as being completely acceptable and reasonable. I have to say to you, all in all, that that is a reasonable attitude for them to take. But when they themselves accept the fee increases they cannot then turn around and beat their breasts, and prevent the government—indeed, we not talking about the government as such but the average Australian taxpayer—from trying to get some cost recovery back from a system that those people are using.

        The reality is that we as a government would prefer that nobody access the Family Law courts—that people could come to some arrangement between themselves. If they cannot come to that sort of arrangement, they want the benefit of a taxpayer funded mechanism called the Family Court of Australia. But the question has to be asked: why should
        <break page="3829" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that total burden fall on the taxpayers at large without there being a contribution from those who are unable to come to a resolution? Of course, if you do make an application and you are successful, there is always the possibility of getting an award for costs against the other party, so those fees that may have been paid up&amp;hyphen;front can potentially be recovered. I suggest to my friends in the Law Council of Australia that it is somewhat disingenuous to accept fee increases for yourself but then deny the taxpayers of Australia the same right.

        A previous contributor in this debate made comment about the opposition's policy backflip on this and also the government's policy backflip in relation to these fees. When we were in opposition and joined forces to disallow some of the increases in fees that were being pursued by the then government, we on this side said that we were not necessarily opposed to some measure of cost recovery where this would enhance sound management of the judicial system. We are on the public record as saying that we do not oppose fee increases per se, just as long as they can be shown to be of general benefit.

        When you look at the state jurisdictions having, in general, a cost recovery of approximately 30 per cent from the users, there are no cries from those on the opposite side that that is somehow inherently unjust. If it is not inherently unjust for the states to get a 30 per cent cost recovery from their judicial system, why is it that it is somehow inherently unjust for the Commonwealth to do so? That really is the argument that they have to put up in this place to try to convince those people who are genuinely thinking through the real issues on a logical basis—not those motivated by politics or cheap calling upon the emotions of domestic violence and other very unfortunate situations that we face within this community. We will be looking for the answer as to why it is not inherently unjust for the states but somehow it would be for the Commonwealth.

        Those opposite try to be critical of us by saying that this is a grab by government for money. It is not a grab by the government because, if we as a government do not get the money, who foots the bill? That is something that those opposite still fail to grasp. That is why they got this country into such a horrible economic mess. They only thought about government, and if the government did not raise the money, well, they put it on bankcard. The reality is that one day the chickens do come home to roost, and who has to foot the bill? It is going to be our fellow Australians—the taxpayers whom we are obliged to represent in this chamber.

        I believe that we owe a duty to encourage people not to use the system and if they do avail themselves of a taxpayer funded system to make some, albeit very small, contribution to the overall facility that is thus provided by the ordinary taxpayers of Australia. Those who want to use the court system—and I accept that the vast majority of them don't but circumstances unfortunately make it such that they find themselves within that predicament—ought to make a contribution if they can afford it, and that is a very important caveat.

        There are a lot of other matters that can be raised but what I think the salient point for those opposite to come to grips with is: why is it okay for states to get a 30 per cent cost recovery but somehow inherently not for the Commonwealth to do so? Why is it just for
        <break page="3830" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the ordinary Australian taxpayer, the battlers out there, to help fund and subsidise, especially in the Federal Court jurisdiction, those actions that have been taken by companies against each other and have reduced filing fees in that jurisdiction? It really does defy logic.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The other matter—and I think this is the most serious one—is in the family law jurisdiction where 40 per cent of those users accessing the Family Court already get all the fees waived. Are you going to tell us that more than 40 per cent of the community are somehow in a poverty trap that they cannot make a contribution? If that is your argument, it is a very real indictment on the mess that you left this country in on 2 March when the government of this country was handed over to us courtesy of the Australian electors.

There really are some fairly fundamental issues that those on the opposite side have to come to grips with if they are to sustain their argument against these fees.

         We are in this mess because the Labor Party through its years in government adopted the economic rationalist argument of cost recovery. That reached its high point between 1990 and 1992. It is interesting to see in this report from page 91 onwards in chapter 3 where the consequences of this cost recovery doctrine are laid out starkly. It shows that this had its origins in the user-pays doctrine at the time, when the industry was seen as the customer and that the customer must be pleased at all times.

         As I pointed out over the years when this doctrine was being run, the user-pays doctrine is false in relation to aviation.

I argued consistently through all those years that there is a public interest component in aviation, that the community benefits in many ways, and that, particularly from a regulatory point of view, that is a function that should be funded, in part or in whole, by the public purse. You do not ask people in the community to pay directly for every service the police force renders. In many ways the Civil Aviation Authority, the regulator of the industry, is in the same position.

The problem still remains with us because, although the CAA has become CASA, the regulatory authority is no better today than it was then. I hope this Senate passes an amendment to the act which allows the board to be changed and puts people of professional ability onto it. The real problem lies within the CAA administration itself.

What lies at the very heart of all of the debate that this nation has been engaged in on industrial relations changes is whether or not the existing act—the act introduced by the previous Labor government—is conducive to enterprise bargaining with the proper balance of protections for low paid workers and protections for workers in vulnerable positions in society and whether or not progress has been made under that act for enterprise bargaining in Australia.

         can be said about it now is this: that, under the previous government, workplace bargaining or enterprise bargaining had been growing apace.

Workplace bargaining had been slow in those states by comparison.

My understanding of the statistics in the public sector show a similar situation—that workers were readier to enter into enterprise bargains where they perceived the system to be fair compared with states where they have draconian look&amp;hyphen;alike legislation to the federal legislation that is currently before the federal parliament. That says quite a lot.

        This report is fundamental to any critical analysis of progress in industrial relations therefore because the central theme of workplace or enterprise bargaining is to engage workers and their employers in fair bargains in a manner which will create productivity, a greater return to shareholders, greater job security and a return to employees. That is, both sides of the management divide—if I can use what I think should be an archaic term but is coming back into more common usage now under this government—would see a common interest in growing the productivity of their enterprise so that they could share the benefits of that productivity growth.

         If it is done unfairly, one side will not play ball. If it is done fairly, both sides can and the economy benefits. This report—and we have just got it now; we have not had a chance to analyse it—should set out statistically the de tails of how you could compare the two systems. I think, therefore, it is quite an important report and should go to a lot of the debate this chamber is about to experience on this bill.

         —Considering that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is currently before the Senate—a bill which promotes individual agreements over enterprise bargaining—this is, as Senator Cook said, a most valuable report. It allows us the opportunity to compare the success of enterprise bargaining agreements conducted under part 6B of the act with the success, or otherwise, of individual agreements.

        In my home state, Western Australia, the Court government has had individual agreements in workplaces for a number of years. At the Senate Economics References Committee, the commissioner of workplace agreements in that state provided a report on those workplace agreements.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us then compare these two reports, looking firstly at the annual report on enterprise bargaining, which was tabled today by the Department of Industrial Relations. The report says that enterprise bargaining has been adopted in a huge number of workplaces—from 39 per cent in those with 20 to 49 employees to 87 per cent in those with over 500 employees. Forty-six per cent of these are private sector workplaces; 54 per cent are public sector.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Enterprise bargaining has been taken up in a strong way amongst every sector of the economy—from 28 per cent in accommodation, cafes and restaurants to 81 per cent in electricity, gas and water. When one looks at the results of enterprise bargaining, it is no wonder so many companies have become involved. Sixty-two per cent of managers reported an increase in labour productivity after entering into an enterprise agreement, with no manager reporting a decrease. Interestingly, the same figure, 62 per cent, of enterprise agreements awarded wage rises based upon productivity increases. In 1995, the average raw wage increase per agreement was 8.3 per cent.
       </para>
       <break page="3833" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of profitability, 47 per cent of managers reported an increase in profits under an enterprise agreement and only 11 per cent reported a decrease. Furthermore, 50 per cent of managers reported an increase in the quality of their product, with none reporting a decrease. Forty-five per cent of managers said workers' skills had increased, with again none reporting a decrease. Skill development, as we all know, is an important contributor to productivity growth, and productivity growth is the major way—if not the only way—to raise real living standards over time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Wages have also increased under enterprise bargaining. In 1995, 59 per cent of workers under an enterprise agreement reported an increase in weekly wages, with only two per cent reporting a decrease. Both employers and employees have reported their satisfaction with the enterprise bargaining system. Overall, 74 per cent of workplace managers said they were happy with the introduction of enterprise agreements. In terms of overall job satisfaction, 63 per cent of employees were satisfied after enterprise bargaining, and only 12 per cent were dissatisfied.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Enterprise bargaining, under the present system under the Commonwealth act, is achieving strong results—real win-win situations for employers and workers. The reason for this is simple: enterprise bargaining as we know it today promotes cooperation between employers and employees. It breaks down the old idea of divisiveness that unfortunately used to rule the Australian workplace.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us now turn to the report of the commissioner of workplace agreements to see how individual agreements under a Liberal government compare in Western Australia. According to his figures, in 83 per cent of cases, employees reported a wage rise, compared to 4.5 per cent who reported a decrease.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, one must be very careful when looking simply at these end figures because of the methodology of the workplace agreements report. It does not arrive at this figure out of a solid statistical analysis, as the report of the Department of Industrial Relations does. Rather, this figure from Western Australia comes from the commissioner's staff asking the employee's opinion, before the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          agreement is registered, of whether they feel their wages are higher. There are no calculations of all the benefits of penalties, conditions and other entitlements. So, on the surface, a quick glance at the base rate may appear to indicate a rise. However, when all factors are considered by a true statistical analysis, the figure is much lower.

         Wages are not the only indicator of whether or not a worker is better off. Over 50 per cent of workers reported an increase in hours worked—over twice as many as under the federal enterprise bargaining system. These longer working hours are particularly harsh when one considers that 40 per cent of the workers had their penalty rates for overtime eliminated, and nearly 55 per cent of workers lost their penalty rates for work within ordinary time.

         1995 annual report, which was prepared by the Department of Industrial Relations. This excellent report provides an important snapshot of how enterprise bargaining is developing in Australia. The comprehensiveness of this report, building on the base of the first one in 1994, is a credit to the researchers and ensures the report makes a valuable and timely contribution to the industrial relations debate.

        The Department of Industrial Relations is required to produce this report annually because of section 170RC of the Industrial Relations Act. This section was the result of a successful Democrat amendment to the Brereton reform bill in 1993. It requires an annual report on the implementation of enterprise bargaining and its impacts on the employment conditions of employees, particularly women, part-time workers and migrants. This is the second report prepared by DIR and is based on a substantially bigger database than the first report.

        The findings of the report provide both good news and bad news. The good news is that enterprise bargaining is spreading and that workers and managers are basically happy with it. The bad news is that the benefits of enterprise bargaining are not
        <break page="3834" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         evenly spread and that women workers and workers in non&amp;hyphen;unionised workplaces are losing out. I am quite concerned that the gap between male and female hourly earnings widened by 1.4 per cent in 1995, that women reported a larger increase in hours worked than did men, and that this trend was more evident in state employment agreements than in federal certified agreements. This highlights the need for detailed vetting of enterprise agreements to ensure that workers in a disadvantaged bargaining position—such as women—are not disadvantaged.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact that unionised workplaces were far more likely than non&amp;hyphen;unionised workplaces to have enterprise agreements and that over 70 per cent of managers and 63 per cent of employees reported satisfaction with federal enterprise agreements shows that union involvement does not mean bargaining is stymied. It also shows that non&amp;hyphen;unionists are failing to achieve the benefits of enterprise bargaining and highlights the need for the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 to encourage the effective operation of unions and for enterprise bargaining to be promoted in the non&amp;hyphen;unionised workplace by both unions and the Employment Advocate.

        Overall, the report shows that enterprise bargaining is gaining increasing acceptance in Australia and that federal certified agreements are a more productive, fair and satisfactory means of achieving agreements than state agreements such as those in Victoria and Western Australia. Indeed, the level of industrial disputation was higher under state employment agreements, where unions were often excluded, than under federal employment agreements where they were included.

         The report shows that far too many employers were still requiring employees to work harder rather than smarter and that this was affecting family life. There is a direct correlation between an increase in work intensity and stress and a decline in the ability to balance work and family issues. Closer attention needs to be paid to work and family issues in industrial relations to ensure that productivity is not at the expense of family life. The Democrats believe this report high lights the value of regular reporting on major reform issues and provides some strong messages which the government should take into account in modifying its workplace relations bill.

        I believe that this legislative approach of regular reporting on major reform initiatives should be adopted in other areas where governments make huge and grandiose claims of massive benefits to test whether the benefits ever turn up or whether governments need to keep a watching brief on critical issues such as this. I note in passing that the workplace relations bill proposes to repeal section 170RC and to replace this very detailed and specific report with a more generalised report every three years. This is an approach the Democrats have serious concerns with. Governments must be prepared to have their reforms tested rigorously; this is an important part of the accountability process. I commend this report to the Senate.

         —I support the motion to take note of the report. In doing so I want to say that I have not had a full opportunity to review all the commentaries in the report, but I want to touch upon a number of matters which I think are relevant to it. Firstly, in terms of the process that it reviews, I can say that I have had first&amp;hyphen;hand experience in establishing registered agreements under the federal legislation. I have also had experience with the establishment—either directly or indirectly—of agreements under the Tasmanian industrial legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to agreements established under the existing federal legislation, I am able to say that the rigorous testing which the previous government required prior to the registration of the certified agreements was a form of testing which guaranteed that full consultation took place and that all the issues of concern to the variety of parties—present and future—which might be affected by an agreement were given proper consideration and vetted by the commission. It is important to understand that the system that is being reported upon in this report was one which was subject to rigorous tests by the federal Industrial Relations Commission to establish not only was

        I note that, in the proposed Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, a number of those tests will disappear for the limited certified agreement role which is intended to exist with the implementation of the new legislation. I can say that the legislation currently in existence has facilitated agreements which I have been involved in relating to special conditions and special leave pertaining to family arrangements for workers in child&amp;hyphen;care centres, for establishing landmark conditions for workers with disabilities working in the laundry industry and also for dealing generally with industrial prescriptions for manufacturing workers in a number of industries. So it is a very flexible system that we are operating under at the moment under the federal jurisdiction.

        I cannot, however, say the same for the system which has been established by the Tasmanian Liberal government and which exists now, although it is subject to review by an inquiry of the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the moment. I would categorise that system as one which does not involve a true bargaining process and, indeed, the very simple tests to test that bargaining process do not establish the fairness of the system. The previous Tasmanian enterprise commissioner has expressed to the inquiry which was conducted by the Tasmanian House of Assembly his dissatisfaction with that legislation because he was not able to satisfy himself that the outcome of the agreements which he was required to register under the legislation was fair and equitable or that the bargaining process was proper and fair. That is a problem with agreements which are being struck under that type of legislation.

        There are many similarities between the Tasmanian legislation as it now stands and the workplace relations bill which is currently being debated in the Senate. Those similarities will need, obviously, to be highlighted when the debate is conducted and concluded. Consideration will have to be given to the

         actual effects of those types of measures that we can point to in states such as Tasmania and Western Australia when we have a look at the provisions in the workplace relations bill and the Senate determines how in practice the measures in the workplace relations bill will impact upon the workplace.

Initially, 300,000 litres of oil escaped from the fuel tanks and a further 25,000 were spilt into the sea as the hulk was lifted off the reef. An oil slick spread out over the reef and the surrounding coastline, extending eight kilometres up the Tamar River. Smaller traces of oil were spotted up to 15 kilometres upriver, 35 kilometres north&amp;hyphen;east as far as Ninth Island and 30 kilometres west to Port Sorell.

The effective management of the disaster has limited the negative impact and brought considerable benefits. For example, on 2 February this year, the Low Head Pilot Station at the mouth of the River Tamar,

The historic buildings were badly in need of restoration and, as part of its promise to return everything to its previous condition, BHP offered not only to return the grounds to their former standard but also to significantly upgrade the reserve. This project has now been completed and is attracting added interest from the tourists wanting to learn more about the

         The pilot station was built in 1835 and is surrounded by historical buildings which were in need of much work in order to realise their heritage potential. So heritage enhancement tasks undertaken by BHP between September and February included building of a cobblestone type road leading to the station, putting powerlines underground to improve the aesthetics of the area, installing heritage style lighting along the road and also landscaping and regrassing the entire area. BHP also created a display in consultation with the Port of Launceston Authority to be permanently set up inside their museum, which is in the main pilot station building. Some painting was also undertaken.

         —This evening I want to recount a particular incident that disturbed me in my office in North Queensland last fortnight. I had a call from a gentleman who had a particular problem. I do not need to go into that particular problem, but he was rather distressed. In explaining what I had to do about the problem, that I had to refer it to state government because it was actually a state government matter, he got very distressed and said, `Of course, you federal politicians,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          you're not interested in me. I came from Germany 20 years ago and you're not interested in me.' I had to spend some considerable time on the phone explaining to him that it had nothing to do with his cultural background; it was more the processes of government and that, in order to assist him, I had to deal with the issue through a state government department, which I subsequently did.

        It occurred to me that, if, here in North Queensland a person who had been in Australia for 20 years and is of German background was feeling so vulnerable as to accuse me of discrimination and disinterest—whatever you like to call it—how would our more recent migrants be feeling in the current climate after the debate that has occurred following Pauline Hanson's speech?

        That prompted me to go back to some work that first started in this place on 9 May, when the Senate accepted a motion of mine after a particularly rare and harmonious debate on a controversial matter. It was a motion that I had brought forward about considering a code of ethics. I would like to remind senators of what the Senate accepted, and I want to qualify it for a number of members in the chamber. The resolution states:

        That was quite specifically in response to Ms Hanson, who had said very early in her parliamentary career that she would not represent indigenous people.

         —I wish to take some moments of the Senate's time on the adjournment debate tonight to complete the few points I was making during presentation of documents an hour or so ago with respect to the royal commission inquiry into the Seaview accident. I was saying that the cost recovery policies of the Civil Aviation Authority, which was the regulatory authority of the time, had its origins in Labor government policies of the user pays doctrine of the mid-1980s, and that the application of that user pays doctrine reached its high point with the Civil Aviation Authority in the 1990-92 period, when it was known under the notorious title of the affordable safety doctrine. This is detailed to some degree in chapter 3 of the commissioner's report, from page 90 onwards.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The application of the cost recovery doctrine to aviation had its origins in an inquiry called the Bosch inquiry in the mid-1980s. The Bosch committee recommended that there were a lot of inefficiencies within the then Civil Aviation Authority and that they needed to be corrected first. When they were corrected, then it may be possible to go to 100 cost recovery from industry in a 10-year period. In actual fact, the CAA, with the support of the government, went to 108 per cent cost recovery inside a period of two
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         years, and quite radical changes were made in the authority. As I said at the time, the baby was thrown out with the bathwater. The regulatory authority ceased to have the authority that it needed, or ceased to exercise properly the authority needed, to regulate aviation within Australia safely for the travelling public.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Civil Aviation Authority made another mistake in its quest for commercialism. There is nothing more bizarre than a Public Service body when it tries to enter the commercial world. They do not have the skills, the experience or the system of reward and censure that the commercial world applies to its operators in industry. They made a mistaken definition of who the customer was. They saw the customer of the regulatory authority as the aviation industry itself—the airlines and the operators of aircraft for hire and reward and other operators of aircraft. The consequence of seeing the airlines and the industry as the customers, rather than the general public, who are the real customers of the industry, led to a policy of appeasement with all the flaws that flow from a policy of appeasement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The flaws were manifested in the form of a degradation of surveillance on the industry. They invested this in the buzzwords of the time. They moved from what they called quality control—direct, hands-on surveillance of going around and inspecting companies, aircraft, aircrew and maintenance organisations and seeing for themselves what happened—which they said was now old fashioned, to what was called quality assurance, where they designated various people to discharge that responsibility subject to audit. In itself, that is not necessarily a bad thing, but it fell down because the Civil Aviation Authority failed to run adequate audit checks on the people that it gave delegated authority to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="3840" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         In the report of the commission there is a very appropriate quote from an in&amp;hyphen;house journal of the Civil Aviation Authority at the time. One of the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority wrote in the journal that if Moses had believed in quality assurance rather than quality control he would not have come down from the mountain with the Ten Command ments; he would have come down with 10 guidelines. That is a rather tragically apt commentary on what happened here.

        This report is absolute proof of the failure of the regulatory authority at the time and the operational doctrine that it followed. If this were all behind us, there would not be any point in my taking the time of the Senate tonight to talk about it.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have been mixed up in the aviation industry for over 30 years as a pilot and for about 29 years as an aircraft owner. I have had an intimate involvement with the regulatory processes over a period of years from the time when it was the old Department of Civil Aviation through the move to the Department of Transport and back to the Civil Aviation Authority and now CASA. I have a very great fear that the situation today is no different from what it was two years ago when this dreadful and avoidable accident happened.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I cannot see any evidence at all that the quality of the regulatory authority has improved in any way at all. I do believe that the changing of the name of the authority has left the same practices in place. It is not the same people there. A lot of people carried on from the old CAA, but the same practices, the same mind&amp;hyphen;set and the same ineffective surveillance are still there.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is still a very great tendency to pick on the little rabbits of the industry, to pick on the people who do not fight back. Within my own personal experience, I have seen cases where people in the industry have been wrong, they have been quite culpable of breaching regulations, but they have fought back with ferocity and the regulatory authority has backed off. With a soft target, the authority will go in hard. They will take them to court and pursue that person relentlessly but, if someone fights back, the authority will not stand up and exercise its power responsibly and effectively. This report from the commissioner is testimony to that fact. I advise everyone to read it. It is a litany, an endless chain, of a lack of application of power at the correct time and in the correct way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the same time, the board in pursuing rabbits really exercises power very, very
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         crudely. The ability to suspend licences of pilots summarily on the spot before any evidence is collected, and to do that with severe economic penalties on individuals who are operating in the industry, is without parallel in our society. No-one else can have their livelihood taken from them without due process being applied.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I come back to the point: I see no evidence at all that this authority has changed in any way at all. Its principal fault is a lack of professionalism in its ranks. The Senate has before it a bill to remodel the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. I think it is very important that that is done. While the members of the board at the present time are estimable people with worthy lives, ability and all the rest of it, very few of them have any knowledge of the industry at all.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a very complex industry. It does need people who have both an extensive exposure and knowledge of the industry and have been at it for a fair while. It does need as its chairman someone who is a professional airman or a professional aeronautical engineer. It is not a job for people who are motivated by good intentions or something like that. But, at the end of the day, the board really sets policy; it does not set the detail of what the regulatory authority does.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The real problem with cleaning up the Civil Aviation Authority—or CASA, as it is now known—lies not with the Chief Executive Officer but that line of managers below the Chief Executive Officer who, in a general sense, are not capable of discharging the duties they are required to perform. There has to be a change there, otherwise the authority will not improve. Sure, we need to revise the regulations because in many ways our aviation industry here is very over&amp;hyphen;regulated compared with other countries. Those regulations, when they are revised, need to be applied correctly, fearlessly and responsibly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We need to get people back into the Civil Aviation Authority, or the CASA, the way it was back in the days of the DCA, who know the industry intimately at all levels. We need to have a clear objective of not looking after the customer, but of looking after the public interest, the travelling public, the people who
        <break page="3841" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         pay fares to be flown on either charter or regular public service flights. We need to look after those who send freight by aircraft and those who live under the flight paths of aircraft. That is the primary responsibility and it requires targeting and the setting of priorities with respect to surveillance.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do believe we have to take the authority back in as a department of state. We as a parliament do need to be able to oversee it. I mention that because one of the former heads of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Baldwin, when all this nonsense was carried on in 1990&amp;hyphen;92, absolutely refused to explain it to the parliament. He said he was the chief of a government business enterprise and he was not answerable to anyone in parliament. This is a matter that urgently needs addressing. The authority must be answerable to the parliament so that all of us can have oversight.

        In 1995-96 the Australian Heritage Commission engaged consultants to initiate a review of the National Estate Grants Program's effectiveness. The proposed review is expected to consider (i) how well the program is achieving its objective to identify, conserve and promote the national estate, and (ii) what impact the Commission has had on the program's direction and outcomes. The review is being undertaken in two stages:  a planning phase (still in progress) and the actual audit (proposed for 1996-97). CALM grants maybe among projects sampled in the review.

Exports of wildflowers are subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. Controls apply both to wild harvested and artificially propagated specimens. In the case of wild harvested specimens, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 requires my prior approval as the Minister for the Environment of management arrangements which are designed to ensure the

        (a-e)  Under the Program grants in 1994-95, a project undertaken by WA CALM investigated mechanisms for the management of commercial harvesting of flora on all lands both private and crown. CALM regulates the flora industry in WA under the provisions of the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 (WA). The project sought to prepare general management plans for several species and their associated ecosystems to assist private land owners in the development of sustainable vegetation management practices. The species selected encompassed the main species types harvested on private property and also provided a geographical cross-section of the south-west of WA. None of the species investigated are listed on the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (Cwlth).
