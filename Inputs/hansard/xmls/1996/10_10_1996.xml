         —Madam President, on 27 June 1996 I reported on action by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in respect of certain instruments made under the Native Title Act. The committee had ascertained that an important legislative determination made on Christmas Eve 1993, the very day that the Native Title Act received royal assent, was never tabled and so ceased to have effect 15 sitting days later. The committee was alerted to the failure to table when a subsequent determination, made some two years later, purported to amend the earlier determination. After the committee notified the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the, by now, more than two years invalidity, a fresh determination was made, gazetted and tabled, all on the same day. That fresh determination, however, could legally only operate from that date and could not validate any action taken in putative reliance on the earlier determination. Any such action taken during that period of more than two years was, of course, totally void.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I reported to the Senate earlier, I advised that the committee would continue to inquire into this matter. The committee then wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) about the practical effects of the invalidity and of the steps proposed to remedy the
        <break page="3855" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         situation. We have now received the minister's reply, which illustrates the need to comply with the statutory requirements for tabling delegated legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The invalid determination provided for mandatory action in specified circumstances by the Commonwealth minister, the Commonwealth itself, the states and territories and the native title registrar. One of these circumstances was notification by governments of their intention to do a future act, such as grant a mining lease. In response to the committee's inquiry, the minister advised that there may have been thousands of these actions, all of which were totally invalid. Another circumstance concerned applications for determinations of native title, in respect of which the minister advised the committee that there were hundreds of invalid actions. Another aspect of the invalidity related to actions by state and territory agencies, the minister advising the committee that there was little likelihood that the range and extent of these could easily, if ever, be ascertained. This result is scarcely a flattering picture of Commonwealth public administration, with thousands of invalid actions, some of which date back more than two years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The minister also advised the committee that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had asked the state and territory governments for their preferred option to correct the situation. As a result of these consultations, the proposed amendments provided for by the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 would include a provision to validate retrospectivity of all of these thousands of actions. The committee in this case will not oppose such amendments, if only because to do otherwise would result in the considerable financial expenditure in this area over the last two years being wasted, and because of the waste of time if the whole process had to start again. Moreover, it would adversely affect thousands of people who had acted in the honestly held but incorrect belief that their actions were valid. The committee nonetheless has substantial reservations about the Commonwealth legislation providing for prejudicial retrospectivity. The minister did not expressly advise that the retrospectivity would be prejudicial but, if it was not prejudi cial, the problem could be corrected by delegated legislation.

        Under the Acts Interpretation Act legislative instruments may operate retrospectively only if nobody apart from the Commonwealth is adversely affected. The final outcome, therefore, is that thousands of ineffective actions will be validated years later by prejudicially retrospective provisions of a Commonwealth act. This is an unfortunate result but one which, as I say, cannot be avoided without much time and money being wasted. The committee was assisted in this matter by the prompt actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, for which the committee is grateful.

        Winston Churchill is said to have remarked that when he was told that a battleship was being launched he did not ask whether it had a bottom. In the present case, on behalf of the Senate, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances asked whether the native title battleship had a bottom. In this case, it did not.

         I sought through the Selection of Bills Committee to have this matter referred to the Senate Education, Employment and Training Legislation Committee with a reporting date of 28 November. Given the sitting times that are already set down and the fact that we have a number of estimates days already reserved, that will leave very few days free for the committee to hear evidence and to consider this very important bill. As a consequence, I sought to have a reporting date of 28 November.

As parliamentary secretary, I have complied with the guide of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and I have given a detailed register of my interests to the Prime Minister.

I can assure the Senate that I have had no conflict of interest during the last six months, nor do I expect one to occur. But, if a potential conflict did arise, then I assure the Senate that I would follow proper procedure: that is, not deal with the matter and pass the matter back to the Treasurer. I am not involved in banking. With regard to the family trust, I have disclosed full details of the two family trusts to the Prime Minister.

       By Senator Short's admission today that he is going to sell his shares in ANZ, he is admitting that, for the past six months, there has been a direct conflict of interest. If we firstly go to the
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Guide to key elements of ministerial responsibility
       </emphasis>
       which was published in April this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), there are two key elements to the document. The first element I want to refer to is on page 10, and it says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity. Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or a trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
      </para>
      <para>
       This code of ministerial responsibility was set down by the Prime Minister shortly after the election. It is now seven months since the election and just over six months since Senator Short became Assistant Treasurer and Senator Gibson became Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       These two senators are the persons responsible on behalf of the Liberal government for handling economic matters in this chamber, but their duties obviously extend far beyond that. I would like to refer to a press release from the Treasurer that outlines the responsibilities of both the Assistant Treasurer and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. In the case of Senator Short, I specifically refer to issues relating to insurance and superannuation. The press release details his responsibilities in this area. In respect of Senator Short's responsibilities, point 6 refers directly to the administration of the banking laws. In
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        the case of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, there is a range of duties outlined in respect of companies and securities and cheques and bills of exchange. A range of other representational duties is also outlined.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       But, in addition to the direct responsibilities that they have, Senator Short sits in the ERC and, on occasion, he attends cabinet meetings. I am sure that there are numerous copies of Treasury and Department of Finance briefings that cross the desk of both Senator Short as Assistant Treasurer and Senator Gibson as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. They have a detailed knowledge of the economic planning and management of this government. They have a highly detailed knowledge of what goes on in relation to economic decision making in respect of the Liberal government, and obviously in respect of the budget.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In respect of the shareholdings involving banks—in Senator Short's case, the ANZ Bank; in Senator Gibson's case, the National Australia Bank and the Bank of Melbourne—there is no doubt that there is a direct conflict of interest in those areas. But I submit to the Senate that, if we look at the shareholdings of both senators, and they are very wide&amp;hyphen;ranging shareholdings, it is not just banks we are talking about. If we look at Senator Short's shareholdings, BHP, CRA, CSR, Boral, Pasminco, Jennings Industries, Centroproperties, MIRVAC, AGL, Cornwall Resources, Valero Energy and Parkwick Pty Ltd are shares directly owned and directly controlled by the Assistant Treasurer. For Senator Short's information, he has not corrected his entry in the register of interests: Bridge Oil ceased to trade two years ago. If we look at Senator Gibson's shareholdings, he has shares in the Bank of Melbourne, the National Australia Bank—he has not said whether he is going to sell those shares; he has not said anything about that today in the Senate—Woolworths, CRA, AGL, Amcor, BHP, BTR, Boral, Brambles, CSR, F.H. Faulding, National Foods and Simsmetal.

       If we look at the interests of other senators, ministers and parliamentary secretaries in the register of senators' interests, no such conflict of interest exists that we can find in respect to any other ministers or parliamentary secretaries. Senator Parer, for example, had direct shareholdings in a mining company which he disposed of. He did the right thing, but not Senator Short and Senator Gibson. Senator Short has been caught out and today has admitted he has had to sell the shares in ANZ.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Senator Short is directly involved in policy development with respect to banking. Why weren't these shares sold six months ago when he became a minister? That is when they should have been sold. I submit to the Senate that all the other shareholdings should have been sold six months ago because we have a Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who makes a great virtue of honesty and integrity in government. We now have a new document of ministerial responsibility. What you have done as minister and as parliamentary secretary is directly defied the Prime Minister's instruction which is very clear in this area—you are required to divest yourselves of shares and similar interests in any company or business. You have failed to do so.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Your other ministerial and parliamentary secretary colleagues in this place have done so. Why haven't you? You are involved in direct decision making in respect of banking matters that affect the share price of ANZ.

       On behalf of the Labor opposition, we highlight this issue in the Senate today. This is not the first mistake Senator Short has made in this place in the last six months.

        Essentially, this bill provides for the repeal of sections 25A and 25B of the 1988 act. These sections enable the Commonwealth minister under the so-called SOS program, the student organisation support program, to provide funds for student organisations in states that have passed legislation relating to voluntary student unionism and prohibiting universities from levying compulsory student membership fees. The sections also enable the Commonwealth to recoup from the states the Commonwealth funds given to student unions. Over $14&amp;half; million of taxpayers' money has been redirected to student organisations under these arrangements by the previous Labor government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The committee agrees that student associations are an important element of tertiary education experiences and, where these associations are valued by students, they will enjoy student support. For example, at the University of the Melbourne, since the Victorian government has enacted legislation on voluntary student unionism, 85 per cent of the student bodies are members of the student association. We note, however, that similar support is not forthcoming from students at the University of Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the committee's view, the matter of funding for student organisations is one that must be resolved between the universities themselves and their state governments. It is not appropriate for the Commonwealth to
        <break page="3867" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         intervene where the states' jurisdictions over their universities are very clearly defined. The Commonwealth should not legislate to undermine or to prevent the states from exercising their properly constituted responsibilities for the universities. The SOS program is an example of this and should be removed from the Commonwealth statutes.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another difficulty relating to the SOS program concerned the issue of ministerial discretion in determining the level of Commonwealth funds payable to student organisations under the SOS program. We have already seen the Victorian government take action in the courts against the Commonwealth, alleging that the funds approved by the Commonwealth minister for payment to certain student organisations were in excess of what was lawful under the federal legislation. The Victorian government was also concerned about the inadequacy of the consultative mechanisms between the Commonwealth and the state in determining the appropriate level of payment to these unions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems, therefore, that the legislation under which the student organisation support program has operated is both problematic in principle and in its implementation. Not only does it intervene in an area of university operation which is the jurisdictional preserve of the state government, but the manner of its operation, in particular the way in which ministerial discretion is exercised, is substantially flawed. In the committee's view, sections 25A and 25B of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 should be repealed. The committee  recommends that the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 be passed without amendment. I commend the report to the Senate.

The concerns we have with this proposal are that, essentially, it is motivated by a vindictive desire by this government to settle old scores which arose as a result of disputes within student unions a few years ago when the present Treasurer (Mr Costello) and senior members
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        Labor senators take the view that student organisations are a crucial element of tertiary education and that they have a formal and statutory role to play in representing students of the universities on boards, in councils and in various other representative forums. To that extent, they should not be subject to unreasonable constraint in the exercise of their responsibilities or in the delivery of a wide range of services to students. We share the views of the executive director of the AVCC in that student organisations represent an important part of the educational experience and the learning culture, and all students should be able to and should participate in them, if they so desire.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have seen that states, particularly reactionary governments in Victoria and Western Australia, have undertaken legislation to prevent universities from levying fees for student organisations. In so doing, in my view they are interfering with a university's right to decide on what conditions of enrolments in the institutions should be. They are deciding that on an unjust basis; that is, on the vindictive basis that because a few senior politicians in the Liberal Party lost out in political battles in the universities in their youth others should bear the cost of that. Those states that pull the funding plug are denying students access to a whole range of services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under state legislation, students are required to participate on a variety of university management committees and councils, yet universities are not allowed to levy fees to fund the student organisations, required by statute to represent students on those councils. The Commonwealth, in my judgement, has a responsibility to monitor the running of universities, especially given the huge funding commitment made by the Commonwealth to Australian universities.

         those situations and to protect those student bodies from the vindictive actions of the Liberal Party.

        The Commonwealth has an obligation to provide protection and to ensure that such acts mitigate against the worst effects of such threats. That is why the Commonwealth SOS program was introduced. In my judgment it was right to do so and it is right now to maintain that provision within the act, to ensure that ministers have the capacity to provide assistance to student organisations so that there can be a proper functioning of student representation within our universities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sections 25A and 25B of the current act should remain. Even if this government does not have the courage to protect representative democracy in universities, the provisions should be available so the discretion is there for future ministers. That is the position that is clearly in the interests of the Commonwealth—to ensure that the quality and standing of our universities is maintained. This government is once again abrogating its responsibilities of national leadership to protect our universities and educational institutions.

        Billions of taxpayer dollars are spent on universities in this country, funded by this parliament. Yet we have the legal fiction presented by petty state politicians that universities are state institutions. It is a legal fiction. The Commonwealth funds these institutions to an extraordinary degree. Public funding going into universities in this country is well in excess of 95 per cent and comes as a result of the actions of this parliament. It is an extraordinary proposition for this government to say that these are state institutions and that, as a consequence, the petty actions of provincial politicians should override and should allow this vindictive matter to be followed through.

        While the Victorian government has outlined compulsory membership of student associations, it has nonetheless provided for the collection by universities of compulsory fees for a range of 16 specified services. It seems that the principle of compulsion is not in itself the motive for the Victorian legislation but rather a specific instance—namely, the compulsion to join a student organisation as a condition of student enrolment. This instance is what we suggest is wrong with this provision. It goes to the very heart of whether or not this government has a commitment to

        On the committee we heard the submissions from the University of Western Australia. The Western Australian Student Guild revealed that, quite clearly, the Western Australian university continues to be unable to levy compulsory amenity fees and, if the SOS program is withdrawn, the guild will become bankrupt and cease to function unless the university undertakes a rescue mission to support the essential student services. That move would entail a total financial commitment by the university of some $345,000 per annum.

        Given the dramatic reductions in university operating grants, and the enormous cuts to higher education spending within the present budgetary arrangements, university resources of that magnitude are not available and will impact very severely upon the university's core functions. This is a matter which this parliament will have to consider in some detail. It will require considerable debate within this chamber to ensure that this government provides for the option in the future of allowing for effective student representation and of allowing for the funding, if necessary, through the SOS program to be maintained.

         —I rise on the same matter as a member of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee. I wish Senate O'Chee had provided those views to the committee because we had a very fulfilling and satisfying day of hearings, to which Senator Carr has already referred. Eight submissions were presented to us on that day and all the people, including those people representing various bureaucracies and departments in Western Australia and Victoria, expressed their regret that the Commonwealth or the state governments had found it necessary to interfere with the workings of student organisations.

        I make the point that the term `union' is quite a misnomer in this case. It is something that was repeatedly referred to by witnesses on the day. It was also pointed out by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that student unions or student associations, as they are more appropriately called, have been around for centuries. They are a tradition of university and campus life, but they are not akin to trade unions and formal trade unions as such. In fact, student unions, guilds or associations—whatever we choose to call them—are more akin to a community, council or shire.

        I have to take up a couple of points that have been raised in this debate. The point of choice is not about compulsion; it is about universal membership of a student organisation, as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee agreed. The members of the Australian Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellors Committee are hardly a radical bunch of people, but they were amongst the strongest defenders of universal membership of student organisations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They made the very clear point that, if a student chooses to enrol, the point of choice is at enrolment. It is at that point which they contribute fees to the student organisation which assists those people Senator O'Chee was referring to—those people who are perhaps from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are more disadvantaged on campus, those people who benefit from the
        <break page="3870" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         types of services and facilities that are provided by a student organisation.

        The Australian Democrats believe, along with many of the witnesses—including the National Union of Students, the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations and the Australian Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellors Committee—that student organisations are a vital part of campus life. They provide a range of services such as subsidised catering, recreation facilities, meeting rooms, sporting clubs, student newspapers or even representation, which seems to be the major sticking point.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That point seems to be why we have seen this attempt by certain state governments to emasculate these services that student unions and student organisations provide. The evidence presented to us showed that that was the case. In Western Australia, for example, we have guilds, as they are known there—student organisations—that are close to closing because they cannot afford to sustain and maintain their activities.

        I probably should not say some of these things, but the reason this has happened is that some of the people who are now in parliament were students at the time when there were some unfortunate goings&amp;hyphen;on in the national student body.

        I think the motive behind the higher education funding bill is quite a dubious one. It seeks to repeal sections 25A and 25B of the Higher Education Funding Act, which allow the Commonwealth to compensate those higher education institutions that have lost money as a result of state interference. It is an appropriate measure. It is one that the Democrats supported in 1992, 1993 and 1994 when the changes were made. We will continue to support it because, as I reiterate, we consider student organisations a vital part of campus life.

        The overwhelming evidence provided in submissions, both in public hearings and in written form, was that all those organisations in the know—those organisations that work with or understand students and student organisations on a daily basis, as well as Australian vice-chancellors and administrators of universities—believed that it was regrettable that the government was considering this stance.

        To that effect, the Australian Democrats and opposition senators have provided a dissenting report which recommends that the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 not be passed by the Senate, but also offers a constructive recommendation in the form of urging the federal government to develop a more coherent approach. Even if those opposite believe strongly in the concept of so-called voluntary student unionism, at least you should seek to develop some kind of uniform standards. We have institutions in WA operating under a so-called process of
        <break page="3871" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         VSU, but operating completely different from student organisations in Victoria. At least the Commonwealth minister, in liaison perhaps with the state ministers, could work out some uniform standard so that students, especially those seeking to move interstate, are not faced with different and draconian principles and laws wherever they go.

        There is also a requirement in this country that we vote. The government supports that requirement, and the majority of people in this country support that requirement. The student representative organisations play a vital role, not just on campus, where they provide essential services and a flux for debate on the campuses, but for the wider community itself. They are a very important part of the development of thought in this country and the development of political activity and ideas. The government does not like them because they do not always agree with the government's point of view. That is what the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 is about.

         It is great that the committee has listened to the wisdom not only of student representatives through this committee process but also of the university hierarchies themselves, which say that the federal government and state governments should keep their hands off student representation and move to endorse and support it as an enormously important part of raising community debate as well as providing services to students, who, at that critical period in their lives, are very often formulating an independent way of thinking and an independent way of assessing life which needs, and adds to, the support that is given by student services.

        After all the nonsense we have had in the chamber this morning, this report is a piece of good news. The committee, comprising members of the government and opposition—the Labor Party and a member of the Democrats—came to a unanimous decision. There was a minor disagreement on a major issue about whether the setting up of the Natural Heritage Trust should depend on the sale or otherwise of Telstra. The committee was of the opinion that, as there had been an inquiry on that and sufficient time and energy was spent on it, we ought to devote our time to the task before us, which was referred to us by the Senate on a motion by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill).

        I take pleasure in tabling the report of the inquiry by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Committee into the Natural Heritage Trust Bill 1996.

        The bill was referred to my committee on 25 June 1996 by the Selection of Bills Committee. The reference was unusual in that it was referred by the Government for consideration rather than the Opposition. This is because the Government wished to obtain the views of the community, environment groups, landcare groups and other interested parties on the structure and objectives of the bill.

        It bodes well for the environment if we on the committee with our different political colours can get together and rationally discuss these vitally important issues and that there are people out there willing and able to achieve success—as one submission said—we can forget our petty turf fighting and get on with the job.

        The committee certainly came to the view that the public is waiting for action from this bill. It has the potential to provide the vehicle for historic environmental action and with funding of the magnitude planned, care must be taken to get it right.

Some were concerned that Primary Industries would dominate the Environment Portfolio, others saw advantage in finally ensuring a closer relationship.

The point that Senator Patterson makes about disagreement over the link with the sale of Telstra totally overrides the thrust of this legislation itself. The government is predicating the good works that may come out of the proposed legislation on a totally different, unrelated matter—their wish to privatise Telstra.

        Senator Patterson has commented on the near miraculous work being done in degraded areas of Australia by the good citizens. You have only to look at the Murray-Darling Basin to know what she is referring to. But at the same time, the same government is licensing the broadscale destruction of native forest ecosystems in the forested areas of Australia. So you have near miraculous repair work on the one hand but shameful, embarrassing environmental degradation being licensed by the government on the other hand.

While this committee has been sitting and drawing up this report, the government at the same time has been giving the go-ahead to the Hinchinbrook tourist resort, the mega&amp;hyphen;resort.

         Prior to the 1996 election, the Hon. John Howard, now Prime Minister, gave a commitment to the Australian people to establish a completely independent Auditor-General who would be an officer of the parliament as part of a broader strategy to restore authority, dignity and meaning to the parliamentary institutions. The existence of a strong and independent Auditor-General is absolutely fundamental for the effectiveness of parliament itself and its scrutiny of the executive government. Indeed, former Auditor-General John Taylor told the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1994 that he considered the question, `Who will control the Auditor-General?', to be one of the great battles between the parliament and the executive. It is a battle which has a long history.

         In 1902 the first Auditor&amp;hyphen;General in his first report to the parliament stated that his office was inadequately resourced for the discharge of his audit functions.

         In report No. 331, tabled in 1994, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts made a series of recommendations to amend the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill 1994 to enhance the functional independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General from the executive and to provide for greater parliamentary involvement in the performance of the audit function. Today, seven years on from the original JCPA report, the question of where the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General fits in the framework of government still generates heated debate, as the committee discovered during its inquiry. However, the incumbent Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, Mr Pat Barrett, was in no doubt that he considered parliament to be his employer.

         In this report, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has recommended that in the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General be declared an `independent officer of the parliament'. The title encapsulates the role and status of the office of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General performs a function that is essential to parliamentary scrutiny but which the parliament itself has neither the technical expertise nor the resources to perform.

         While acknowledging that debate about the status of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General is essentially about symbolism, we believe that symbolism is important. To a very large degree, the way in which the position of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General is described influences public perceptions of the role and the significance of the office. It is important to note, however, that in the legislative model proposed by the JCPA the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General would not be subject to direction by the parliament. I think the Clerk of the Senate would be pleased to note that.

         The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), in referring this matter to the JCPA for inquiry, drew the committee's attention to concerns that the appointment of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General as an officer of the parliament could damage the independence of that office. The committee has reviewed the legal opinions obtained by the Australian National Audit Office on this issue. The committee is concerned that these legal opinions were obtained in a vacuum of policy advice about the intentions or will of the government and the parliament in appointing the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General as an officer of the parliament. This is neither a criticism of the legal opinions or those who sought them, but it is the reason why some of the legal concerns raised in the inquiry are not relevant to what the JCPA is recommending in this particular report.

In the JCPA's legislative model for guaranteeing the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, both the position of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the Australian National Audit Office would be established as statutory offices for which the Prime Minister would take portfolio responsibility.

In particular, the Audit Committee would approve the appointment of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, examine the proposed appropriations for the Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to the parliament and to the executive on appropriate levels of resourcing. It would also monitor any executive directions to the

         In this report the JCPA has also recommended a range of measures that would be incorporated into the new Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill to support the functional independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It will be apparent in this report that the JCPA considers the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to be absolutely fundamental to public accountability in Australia. If the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General is not properly resourced or does not have the legislative mandate to carry out an effective and broad scrutiny of the public sector, then parliament itself is compromised in its ability to hold the executive to account.

          I commend this report to the parliament. I urge all senators to take an interest not only in this report but in the work of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, whose future effectiveness will have a major impact on the effectiveness of parliament itself. This report contains a series of recommendations which pose a challenge to government. If adopted, these recommenda tions will go a long way to restoring authority and meaning to the parliament and securing the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's independence from the executive. It has taken seven years to get to where we are today, and I regard this as a hallmark decision.

In particular, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, my colleague Mr Somlyay MP.

But on top of that, Senator Woodley comes in here today and says he needs another return to order and he needs it today—no reason why it cannot wait until next week and no reason why it cannot be debated in general business under the normal way. All of a sudden it has such enormous priority that it should be given precedence over all other business on the

        There is no case that has been made out in these circumstances for that urgency. Interestingly, it does not even relate to documents within my control. It relates to documents alleged to be signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer).

        I would have thought that, at the very least, Senator Woodley would have given us the opportunity to discuss what was being sought with both of those two parties. That is why notice of motion is normally given and is subsequently debated after a reasonable period of time. But there was no such courtesy from Senator Woodley in this matter. He has

        Senator Faulkner asked where the $40,000 came from. My advice is that we have to search the bottom of the e-mail trail, the hard disk e-mail records, and that it would cost in the vicinity of $40,000. That is the advice I have been given. I have not calculated what it has cost the taxpayer to date to meet the requirements of Senator Woodley, but it has been a considerable sum of money as well.

        Furthermore, I tabled the documents as rapidly as I could and, therefore, it was impossible within that time to have them indexed. I have offered to the Senate, because I think the Senate officials are put in a very difficult position here, to have my department subsequently index those documents for them. We have bent over backwards to meet the requirements of Senator Woodley. No urgency has been made out, and this should be defeated.

         —A very clear and cogent case exists for the urgency of this matter. Work is proceeding for the resort at Hinchinbrook that the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) has given the go ahead for. There has been an injunction holding up that work, but that injunction was lifted last week. Amid claims of environmental damage, the developer, Mr Williams—who has no record of environmental sensitivity which I would accept as legitimate—has begun what will end up being a very destructive process of establishing a completely unwarranted and untoward development in the region of the World Heritage areas of the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics.

         The minister says there is no urgency. That is because he is becoming a master of the pre-emptive. His delivery of the documents to Senator Woodley to the Senate at midnight the other night shows how sneaky the process can become when there is simple manoeuv ring going on by the minister to hide from the real debate, which is his abrogation of authority as chief environmentalist in this country when giving the go ahead for this destructive proposal on the Hinchinbrook Channel.

        He says that he withheld internal memos. I, for one, want to see them. I think everybody involved in this process wants to see them. He says there is transparency even though we cannot see. He has failed to respond properly to Senator Woodley's prior request for a return of all information to the Senate. He says that those internal memos are not our business, or are too hard to get or are going to cost money. They are sitting on his desk. He says he cannot get the e-mail or he has not got e-mail to provide us, which is a clear come on to anybody who wants to be secretive in the future to exchange information with Senator Hill's office by e-mail.

        That is the way you are going to be sheltered. He is going to hide that from those people in the public who want to know what this minister is doing when, on the one hand, he purports to be the Minister for the Environment and, on the other hand, he is saying, `Go ahead,' to Keith Williams. It would be nice if he would modify this destructive proposal. When Keith Williams says, `No, it's the mega-proposal or nothing,' the minister goes weak at the knees and says, `Let's have the mega-proposal.'

        Already we know that there has been further environmental damage at the site over the weekend. It is posited in all sorts of terms about what is minimal and acceptable and so on, but environmentalists on the scene reported damage to the mangroves by the removal of dead logs coming from previous destructive activities of Keith Williams and his bulldozers on this fragile site. The authorities themselves—and I mean by this the authorities under the protection of this minister—have reported that they had to remove plants for later replanting elsewhere, because they would have been destroyed by Mr Williams's activities.

         Senator Woodley. What is he coming at? That is an insult to the Senate's intelligence. It is an insult to the people of Australia who are watching this issue and the people at Hinchinbrook, and in Queensland in particular, who are horrified by this mega-proposal, by this mega-developer who has caused such environmental crassness in his previous developments such as the one at Hamilton Island.

There is a concern to complete the disallowance motions. Having looked around the chamber last night and got some feedback this morning, I think there is a fair chance that there are probably four speakers to go on the disallowance motions, together with the reply, which may consume all the time that we have this afternoon. If we were to put this motion on after the disallowance, we would have problems there.

        Despite Senator Harradine's concern, I would be more inclined to have this motion dealt with now than to take a chance on whether or not we would finish the disallowance motions. I am also concerned that we do have an order for this afternoon which takes us to the end of general business and I would be very concerned if we interrupted anything between 2 p.m. and the completion of the general business items, No. 15 in particular. I am sure senators would also be concerned. I suggest that we either go ahead with it now or we list it after general business and make it come on after item No. 15 for the day.

I do not know what the intent of the Attorney-General is in doing this. I do not know why he should treat the Senate with such contempt. It is something that the Senate should address. It is certainly something that the members of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee will be addressing when the Attorney-General's Department appears before it in two weeks.

       The committee met on 17 and 19 September, where we addressed questions to the Attorney-General's Department. Late on 19 September, and then on 25 September, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs appeared before the committee. That department, which appeared two days later than the Attorney-General's Department, and in another case a week later than the Attorney-General's Department, has been able to supply the committee with responses to a large number of the questions that were placed on notice. But the Attorney-General's Department has not been able to do so. I suggest—I actually accuse—that this is a deliberate tactic by the government and the Attorney-General to keep information from the committee.

       Very early in the piece—on Tuesday, 17 September—we asked what modelling had been done in the High Court of Australia and in the other courts and tribunals in relation to the impact of the fees on the public and, indeed, on the work of the court. We asked for that. The secretary to the department took the question on notice. You cannot say that that is a highly detailed question that the government may take time to answer. That is something that a couple of officers of the department would probably have sat around with over a cup of coffee, maybe even with a cigarette in the barbecue area, and worked out some details and then provided it to the committee. It was a very simple request, but it has not been delivered. It is not one of the most important questions that the committee put on notice to the Attorney-General's Department. I am not suggesting for one minute that it is.

       The information that we requested would be helpful to us in arguing this matter before the committee. The matter that we are arguing is not an inconsequential matter, despite what Senator Abetz said in his contribution to the debate last week. The matter in front of us has prompted the Law Council of Australia, one of the premier legal bodies in this country, to write to members and senators on at least three separate occasions in the lead in to the deliberations of the Senate estimates committee which took place last month. One of the letters that was addressed to the committee was incorporated into

       Some idea of the impact of the fee increases in the Federal court may be ascertained by taking a typical case, say one in which a small company complains that a competitor is engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. Under the old Schedule, the originating application would attract a filing fee of $368. That will now be $1,600, an increase of 335%. In the interlocutory stages, if (as is often the case) it is necessary to file a notice of motion, under the old Schedule the filing fee would be $62. That is now to be $246, an increase of 297%. When that notice of motion comes on for hearing, that would occur, under the old Schedule, without further fee. Under the new Schedule, that small company would need to pay $400 to the court for each half day (or part thereof) occupied. If this hypothetical case could not be settled, and had to be set down for hearing, under the old Schedule the applicant would then pay a "hearing fee" of $616. Under the new Schedule, that small company would now pay the sum of $2,000 for the privilege of having the matter set down for hearing, and this sum is no longer described as a "hearing fee". The new "hearing fee" is now a fee which accrues at the rate of $1100 per day . . .

       Truly, these proposed fee increases are dramatic and, indeed, draconian. To the best of my knowledge, I have never stood up in this place and been a defender of the Law Council of Australia. I have actually very rarely been a defender of the legal profession at all; I have usually left that task to my colleague Senator Cooney and some of the members on the other side of the chamber. Usually when I have had to speak about the legal profession it has been in a critical sense.

I have no doubt that there are some corporations in this county who can afford the new fees and, indeed, will probably thrive on the fact that the new fees are there. The new fees that are being introduced and proposed by the government, and, indeed, which are actually in action and have been since 1 September, will keep many companies and many individuals out of the court system. That in itself may be a good point.

        I am not standing here as a member of the opposition who is opposed to fees being imposed on those who want to participate or have the need to participate and be involved in the judicial system. Indeed not. It would be hypocritical for me to do so. I know that when I sat on the other side of this chamber as a backbench member of government, I in turn supported the increases in fees that were levied on people and corporations who wanted to participate in the judicial system. I never, from that side of the chamber, participated in or supported actions that go to the extent that these actions go to. I doubt very much that I would have supported them. I do believe that they are truly draconian and should be opposed and dismissed.

        As I said, we have increased fees in the past. We have from time to time imposed fees where no previous fees were in existence. But, if you take the words of the minister in her contribution to this debate yesterday and the words of Senator Abetz in his contribution, you will find that the levels of cost recovery of the administration of justice were not punitive under the previous regime. They certainly were not punitive in 1992 when the then Senator Sid Spindler proposed a disallowance of the fees—that proposal was supported by the now government.

In March 1992, in a Senate debate on the matter of the disallowance of judicial fees, Senator Tate said:

        Coalition senators, together with the Democrats, opposed that statement at that point in time. They opposed the proposal to increase fees when it was before the Senate chamber. The figure quoted is $500. With the fees that are being considered now, we are running into the tens of thousands of dollars. I ask coalition senators: if it was quite right and proper in 1992 to oppose the introduction of an increase in fees to the level of $500, is it not right and proper at this time to oppose the introduction of and increases in fees to many tens of thousands of dollars? I say it is. I am glad to have the opportunity to stand here and make that point.

        Just while I am on Senator Abetz's contribution of last evening, I would make another point; it is the one which I said I would return to. In his opening contribution, he referred to Senator Stott Despoja's contribution to the debate and then raised the matter of applications relating to domestic violence. I do not disagree with where Senator Abetz said that domestic violence applications are filed. They are filed within state jurisdictions, generally speaking, around the country. Part of the reason for that being the case is that there is then the ability for people who are making applications for orders relating to domestic violence to be legally aided.

        Under the proposals of this government, the legal aid system that we enjoy in this country now will be emasculated. I would suggest that, if the attorney's proposals which restrict the use of Commonwealth funds for legal aid to Commonwealth matters only go ahead on 1 July next year, what we are witnessing now with the applications relating to domestic violence orders being filed mainly in state jurisdictions will indeed change; that people will want to file those applications in the Family Court of Australia—which, indeed, is

        I was pleased that Minister Vanstone, coming in here representing the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, did give some relief, as she promised she would three weeks ago, in her contribution last evening—some relief. I do not know what worth can be gained from that relief. However, going to the detail of what she said, in the first instance she talked about the Family Court and said—and I will use her words:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To partially offset this reduction, the government has decided to make a small additional increase to the fee for principal relief. The current fee will rise from $460 to $500.

       <para>
        I now go back to the attorney's statement that he released at the delivery of the budget and bring this relief that the minister suggested last evening into some form of perspective. On 30 August this year the fee was actually $368 dollars, it was proposed in the budget to increase it to $460, and last evening the Minister representing the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General announced that it will be increased further—to $500. That is wonderful relief for those people who are participating in the Family Court of Australia! Just over a month ago, to make an application cost $368. That was to be increased to $460. But last evening we were told it is now going to $500. There was an offset on it, and to do the minister justice I will continue on with what she said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We propose to reduce the fee for ancillary relief from its current level of $250 to $150.

       <para>
        That, again, is welcomed for what it is worth. But it should be pointed out that on 30 August this year, just over a month ago, that actual fee was nil. To make an application for ancillary relief, it did not cost you anything in August of this year—or in July, or preceding 1 September when the new fee increases that were announced in the budget came into effect. So the minister last evening graciously has reduced from $250 the fee that was announced in the budget to $150.

         Again, I welcome that for what it is worth. But it should be pointed out that, in August of this year or prior to 1 September, the fee that applied for the one&amp;hyphen;off hearing was nil. We have gone from nil to $400 back to $300—nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.

         The minister last evening also announced some other decreases and changes that apply to the Federal Court. Then she stated:

        </para>
        <para>
         Previously there was no fee. So we accept the magnanimity of the statement of last evening! The minister then continued:

         to $400 and $800 respectively.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, great magnanimity! The minister, however, failed to point out what the fee was prior to 1 September of this year. There has been a reduction, certainly. But in the appendices attached to the attorney's statement, which I am quoting from now, that fee up to and including 30 August this year was nil. I suppose we do have to be grateful for small mercies—small  mercies, indeed! I think the Law Council of Australia, in writing and addressing letters on this matter to senators and members of the Australian parliament, did themselves and, indeed, the public of Australia a great service.

         I hope that they are watching this debate with interest because it is of great concern to them—though not of concern to them in the sense that Senator Abetz raised last evening when he related these increases to the fees that lawyers charge.

         The final point I want to make is that a great deal of store has been put in what the cost recovery is from state judicial jurisdictions as opposed to what it is from the federal jurisdictions. In the figures that were given, I do not know why 1989 was used. Had we more time in the debate, I think it would be worth while putting further questions—or perhaps I am flagging questions for the estimates committee proceedings in two weeks time—to get the cost recovery figures from each of the years, not just 1989.

In fact, what he was saying there was that the increased court fees would be very helpful indeed in contributing to the expensive cost of our judicial system. It would be no surprise to the community at large to know that the Family Court alone costs in the region of $100 million a year to run. But it was this opposition, which was formerly in government, that sought to increase fees. Not only did it do that, but also the previous government looked at a fees review in 1992. It made a decision last year to continue with the increase in fees.

In fact, as an average, the Commonwealth recovers about half of the costs that the states do. The states have a recovery rate in the region of 30 per cent. The Commonwealth, unfortunately, has a recovery rate of something in the region of 16 per cent. You have this situation where the judicial system in this country is expensive. By its very nature it is costly, and that is a fact of life. The government needs to have some recovery in relation to the running of those courts.

       Of course there has to be a safety net. There are people naturally who could not afford to pay the necessary fees. So there is a provision for the waiver of fees. In the Family Court—we were told this in the estimates committee—38 per cent of applicants have their fees waived. Not quite 40 per cent have their fees waived. So if you are receiving social security or legal aid, you do not have to pay the fee. That leaves some 60

       The government has listened to representations made to it and it has agreed that in relation to applications in the Family Court the fee will be reduced from $250 to $150. The one-off hearing fee of $400 will be reduced to $300. Let me make this point: in the Family Court only five per cent of matters go to trial; 95 per cent of matters settle. That means only a small sector of litigants will find it necessary to pay the hearing fee because most matters settle without going to trial. So in the family law jurisdiction these fees will not have such a drastic effect as the opposition would make out.

       In relation to the Federal Court, the Attorney has announced that the filing fee for corporations and  individuals respectively will not be as high as first proposed. For individuals it will now be $500 instead of $800. In relation to corporations, I understand the fee is coming down from $1,600 to $1,200. That affects the scenario that Senator McKiernan portrayed in relation to a small business engaged in a section 52 action which relates to misleading or deceptive conduct. He said that the filing fee would be $1,600. That is wrong because the government is now proposing it be $1,200. He said that the hearing fee would be $1,100 a day. That is now being reduced to $800 a day.

       Importantly, the government has recognised the situation in relation to industrial relations matters.

        Another aspect that has been raised is the question of domestic violence and the use of restraining orders. Unfortunately, it is becoming a matter which is quite  prevalent in our community that people have to resort to these applications but they do not go to the Family Court. Senator Abetz was quite correct when he pointed out that 99 per cent of matters would go to the magistrates courts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why do people go there? Because the relief is more substantive and it is instantaneous. You can obtain your relief much more quickly in the magistrates courts than you can in the Family Court. So people do not go to the Family Court for restraining orders where there is an allegation of domestic violence. They go to the magistrates courts, and those courts are not affected at all by any of these proposals. For the purposes of this debate, the question of domestic violence is really quite irrelevant.

        With respect to the proposals in relation to family law, I would point out that only form 7 applications attract a fee. Form 8 applications do not attract a fee. Form 8 applications are quite important during the course of an action because they can relate to such matters as urgent access. It may be that a party to a Family Court action is being denied access and they make an urgent application. That urgent application would not attract a filing fee. I believe it is quite appropriate that it not attract a filing fee as such. The initial fee is paid when a form 7 application is lodged and that is it. It is a one-off payment.

        The government has to address the budget deficit. This measure, as has been stated, would look at addressing that in part in relation to the judicial system. A figure of over $100 million was mentioned over the period of four years. That is a substantial amount. As I pointed out, the opposition when it was in government recognised what an important issue this was. In 1992, the opposition when it was in government—when Senator Bolkus was a minister in that government and when Senator McKiernan was a part of that government—tried to raise court fees. It tried to raise court fees because the cost of
        <break page="3894" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para first-indent="16">
        I also concede the point that even then the opposition recognised there should be a safety net, that people on legal aid should not have to pay the filing fee. We, too, with these proposals recognise that safety net. It is not a question of anyone who is in pecuniarius having to pay these fees because they can apply to have them waived. There is a form they can fill in and a means test can be applied. If they are on legal aid the fees are automatically waived. If they are on social security the fees are waived. These fees will not have as wide an application as the opposition would make out.

        I believe that the question Senator McKiernan raises in relation to the civil action of a section 52 matter is incorrect. One point that should be made is that most of those sorts of actions would be conducted in state courts in any event. So that would not apply.

        The Australian Animal Health Council bill and the seven consequential bills are being introduced into the chamber at this particular time because they are non-controversial bills—that is, there is no disagreement on them. It does not mean that they are unimportant bills. I do want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we are passing very significant legislation today for Australia that is not just of relevance to Australia's primary industry. It is of major relevance to the national economy, to the national wellbeing of this country and to the environment of Australia in a broader sense.

         I had the great privilege—and, indeed, it is a great privilege—to be the minister who had the carriage of this legislation through ARMCANZ. I mention that simply to acknowledge the full&amp;hyphen;blooded support the Commonwealth government received from the states and from all of the state ministers for primary industry, all of whom recognised the vital importance these bills constitute today for Australia.

         Australia is one of the great trading nations of the world. We are an island continent. With the level of trade increasing—and I hope it will continue to increase at an expediential rate every year—Australia needs to be prepared against an outbreak of an exotic animal disease which could absolutely devastate multibillion dollar industries for Australia not just in the immediate term or even in the medium term but in some cases in a way which might never be altogether successfully addressed. Those concerns can never be overstated.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Animal Health Council, which this bill will give life to, is going to be the foremost national body—and it will be recognised internationally with that status—to stand between Australia and that prospect. It is also being set up to deal with day-to-day problems in respect of our pro&amp;hyphen;active position on trade. I am talking here about problems such as chemical residue in the commodities that Australia produces into our all&amp;hyphen;important export markets.

         It was absolutely essential that this national approach be taken. It was a complex matter. Many bureaucrats from both the Commonwealth and state bureaucracies cooperated fully over a long period of time in dealing with the whole range of complex issues that are normally there in this federation of ours to get the agreement necessary to put all of these things into place at both the federal level and the state and territory level. That level of cooperation was there and that is why we have got this legislation here today—the formal agreement being reached in ARMCANZ in August last year, from memory.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing that needs to be noted that is also important is that the council subsumes
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the vitally important responsibilities of the body formerly known as EXANDIS—the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council. The legislation that established EXANDIS lapsed in December last year. This body subsumes the responsibilities of EXANDIS.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In its final annual report, EXANDIS urged all governments and industry to maintain through this body an extremely high level of continued activity at protecting Australia against the outbreaks of exotic diseases that I have just referred to.I want to pay tribute—as I am sure the government would pay tribute—to the work that was done by EXANDIS in assisting Australia to maintain those protections and in assisting in the formation of the body that we are giving birth to here today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is worth while pointing out because it is always a matter of topical discussion in this country—and so it should be—that, in the handover set of recommendations, if you like, contained in the final EXANDIS annual report, EXANDIS considered that foot&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;mouth disease, newcastle disease, blue tongue and classical swine fever remained the major potential exotic disease problems for this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, all these things will always be topical. Newcastle disease obviously is in the news right now as the major concern of the Australian chicken meat industry, as there is a proposal currently before us to import chicken meat from Thailand—a country, of course, in which newcastle disease is endemic. These will always be issues of topicality in a country such as ours that depends entirely, as we do, on the health of our trade for our national economy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="3896" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          There are just a few things that were recommended by EXANDIS as well that I do want to simply draw attention to very briefly. One—and it is a matter that was brought to me on a number of occasions—was the concern that EXANDIS had about the recognised current deficiency in the epidemiological database in Australia, which is needed for a totally effective disease surveillance system in this country. It was a matter that was drawn to my attention on a number of occa sions by EXANDIS during its life. It took the trouble to note in its final annual report that this is a matter that should be of continuing concern for the body that we are launching here today—the AAHC.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         EXANDIS also called upon the AAHC to continue the national disease&amp;hyphen;watch hotline to facilitate reporting and investigation of any unusual animal incidents in all states and territories and to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for this service to continue. Again, I guess this is something that we are so conscious of in those areas of Australia that are so close to the countries where these diseases are endemic. Things like screw-worm fly—which, thank God, do not exist in Australia yet—are just hundreds of kilometres away from our shores. There is the never-ending potential for destructive pests such as screw-worm fly to enter Australia and cause consequent devastation to Australian industry. Of course, there is no need to canvass the never-ending potential for foot&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;mouth disease outbreaks to occur in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not simply luck that these diseases and pests have not arrived here. Luck has something to do with it. Luck always has something to do with it. It is, in fact—I am pleased to say—a high degree of management also that helps to prevent these diseases and pests from infesting our shores.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I said earlier that this is not and cannot be considered to be an issue that simply affects primary industry or primary producers. The introduction of a disease like newcastle disease into Australia—a disease that EXANDIS rates among that handful of half a dozen diseases of the highest exotic disease concern to Australia—would have a devastating effect on the Australian environment at large. It is a disease which, if it ever got a foothold in Australia and got into the wild population of birds in Australia, would be almost impossible thereafter to ever eradicate; it would simply become part of our disease landscape as well as those of the countries that are close to our shores.

         I will conclude on one small point of detail. There was some concern expressed, and there was some lack of certainty, about whether the Australian Animal Health Council would have to, or would be required to, report on its operations to the parliament through the estimates committee process. That matter has been resolved—certainly to my satisfaction. The answer to that particular question is yes, it will. The payments that are made to it—by this legislation, I might add—that constitute those levy collections do, in fact, provide the grounds for that reporting to be done. That is an important matter for all members of this parliament. They can be assured that the Australian Animal Health Council will, if it is required to do so, appear before Senate estimates committees to give reports on its progress.

        I would remind the Senate that the Senate animal welfare committee's report on the issue some 10 years ago acknowledged as much, but said that economic and other factors had to be taken into consideration. I agree with that; there is always a balance in these things. The main thrust of that report was to encourage the development of an alternative carcase trade. This does not appear to happen to any great degree, and the government's focus seems to be very much on expanding the live animal trade.

         The Democrats would be interested to know whether, if the government were inclined to accept and take up the recommendations in the report some years ago of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, a differential in the levy between live sheep and carcase sheep would be an incentive for moving from live sheep trade to the carcase trade. The final question that the minister may be able to give me an answer on is whether or not it would be possible to use the levy to provide funds to pay for the presence of a vet on export ships.

         —We have a bundle of eight bills before us, and I wish to speak principally to the Cattle Export Charges Amendment (AAHC) Bill 1996 and the Cattle Transaction Levy Amendment (AAHC) Bill 1996. I recognise the need for me to be brief. This is yet another levy being put on cattle producers, who have been going through a very hard time in recent years. Particularly in my state of Queensland, we are well into the sixth year of a major drought, the biggest in living memory, and we are facing a market collapse with respect to cattle prices. Anything that increases the costs of production is not viewed with favour in any way at all. But we recognise that there are some virtues in this if it is taken to the objectives that are stated in bringing the bill before the parliament.

        I would like first of all to declare my financial interest in this as a cattle producer. It is interesting to see from the statistics here in the parliament that, in the last four parliaments, between five and 10 per cent of legislation that has gone through has related to the primary industries portfolio. A significant part of that legislation has related to increased charges or the imposition of new levies. For example, in 1982&amp;hyphen;83, $391 million was raised from the rural sector. Ten years later, in 1992&amp;hyphen;93, around $719 million was raised from levies, almost a doubling in the charges that are applied to the primary industry sector.

        These two bills are concerned with funding the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd, at an initial operative rate of 5c per head for cattle or a prescribed rate up to a maximum of 50c per head. Charges are to be imposed on cattle other than dairy cattle exported from Australia by the Cattle Export Charge Act 1990. Additionally, I draw it to the attention of the Senate that the cattle producers pay a levy under the Cattle Transaction Levy Act on the sale of cattle, delivery to a processor and the slaughter of certain cattle. Both of the principal acts are amended here to take account of the need to provide funding for this new body, the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd.

We do that not by meeting standards on residues but by having zero residues. While it might be a utopian ideal, that is the objective that we ought to have. Going back to the objectives of the AAHC, it ought to have international status as the national animal health policy and advisory body to arrange for and assist in research and development matters pertaining to animal health.

There has been a great deal of vigilance in the past to prevent exotic diseases coming into Australian pastoral herds. The point is that the geographic isolation of Australia was our greatest asset, and with the permeability—for want of a better word—of the boundaries that once existed, that isolation is now greatly reduced, with relatively free and untrammelled access, legally and illegally, into the country.

         I would like, in conclusion, to say a few things about the cattle industry. We are in a market downturn at present with respect to cattle prices. It is, far and away, the worst for 20 years. The returns to producers are really very poor. In parts of the country we have drought and, as I was saying earlier, a major drought is in its sixth year in many parts of central Queensland, which is the principal export cattle producing area for Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are coping with—and it is one of the factors driving the market price down—an oversupply of meat on the market, principally from the United States, where their herd numbers have peaked and they have had good seasons. Coupled with this excess supply, they are marketing very aggressively into our traditional markets in Japan and Korea and around Asia. We cannot compete with them. While we are producing beef through the farm gate at about 60 per cent less than the United States, we are paying three times what the United States pays on average to process that beef. That means that American beef can come in here cheaper than the consumer can buy it from Australian sources. We have got to do quite a bit to improve our processing to get into a competitive position.
        </para>
        <break page="3900" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          We are in a position where we do not have any stability with respect to overheads. Year by year those costs are going up, and the returns to producers have shifted in a major way. Once upon a time, if you took a notional value per kilogram of beef on the consumer's table the major part of that would have gone to the producer. Today, the processor, the wholesaler and the retailer take the major part of that price for the kilogram of beef and the producer gets the minor part. The difficulty with that is that the producer's costs, as I have said, keep going up and up.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is a competitive industry. You have to have herd improvement, improvement in pastures, water retention, and the rest of it. Those are really big sums that have to be met, and they do require a higher profit level than the industry is getting at the present time if the industry is to be sustained. The whole of rural Australia is declining in population and that has some significant sociological consequences. I do not want to get into that, but I was reading the other day that the ABS has claimed that in the last 30 years we have lost over 100,000 farms. That is a pretty significant factor.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To turn back to the industry itself, it really is in crisis. I look at an industry such as the cotton industry, which is one of the great rural successes in Australia, and I wonder why it has been so successful compared to the beef and sheep industries. One of the conclusions I reach is that the cotton industry is a new industry and it does not carry the baggage in its haversack that the older, established industries which have been around for a hundred or a couple of hundred years do. They can use new and efficient management practices and, starting with a clean sheet, they can optimise their size to maximise their results.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I do think that, to survive, the cattle industry has to change—and change significantly—from what it is today. I say `to survive' advisedly because, for the first time in my life, I have doubts about the long term survival of the cattle industry in the export field in Australia. It will be a tragic loss for us, economically and in other ways, if we lose this great industry which I think is probably
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           the biggest of all Australia's export primary industries.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The only area where we have had any success in recent years has been the live cattle exports from northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. That has undeniably been a godsend for us. There would have been many more people driven out of the industry but for that. But, at the end of the day, that is not the field that we want to focus on and put our emphasis on, because there is no value adding in that. In a sense, it is just a rather feudal way of trading—you are just producing young cattle and exporting them. We want to be in the business of value adding and exporting high quality carton beef. But, before we get there, the industry has to be reorganised very considerably.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of our principal problems relates to abattoirs. I would say—just off the top of my head—that we are down to between one&amp;hyphen;third and a half of the abattoirs that existed 20 years ago. The significance of that is profound because the abattoirs are very important players in this. They are really the price setters for the producer. The producer is a price taker, and if the abattoirs are not buying the producer cannot get rid of his stock. There is now no competition between abattoirs. They are enjoying a degree of natural protection because of their few numbers. And the geography of Australia means that if you are going to truck 500 miles to a competitor you are going to pay an economic penalty, whatever price he is offering you, and you are not going to recover that. So the shrinkage in the number of abattoirs is very important.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The relationship between producers and abattoirs has changed very considerably in my lifetime. Once upon a time, established reliable producers, working with abattoirs, had a good give and take relationship based on mutual trust. In other words, if an abattoir got an export order and wanted to fill that order, it would ring up a reliable producer and the producer would let cattle go even if they were not ready for market. The producer would take a little bit less than the payment for them, because they were not as far forward as they might be. The producer would know in return that if he got caught out with the dry
          <break page="3901" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           season, or a drought or something like that, he could ring up the abattoirs and they would oblige him and, even if they did not want the stock, they would take them.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A totally different relationship exists today between the suppliers and the abattoirs. It is one dictated by the abattoirs and it is on a very hard commercial basis that favours the abattoirs at all times.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other thing that the abattoirs do is that they write the export orders. Therefore, they have a dominant role in selling and moving the product. When a percentage are owned by overseas interests—and a very high percentage of those abattoirs are now owned by overseas interests—you have got to wonder at times what is happening. It is certainly very much in the interests of the Japanese or Korean owners of a abattoir to pay the minimal price in this country and maximise their returns in their country of origin, or where the final sale is made.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am very much of the view that we ought to be seriously looking at the ownership of abattoirs. I have no objection at all to overseas interests owning the source of production—owning cattle properties and sheep properties—subject to following good farming and environmental practices. But I think that it is a different matter again when we get into the abattoirs. I do think that we ought to have in place some mechanism which maximises Australian influence and control over those. I am not interested in seeing vertical integration in the industry from the field to the table.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If we do not do something seriously about this, I believe that we will end up importing carton beef from somewhere like Indonesia for consumption within Australia. The live beef trade will go on. It will be processed overseas and come back to us in polythene wraps. I think that would an economic tragedy for us of enormous proportion.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So, getting back to the abattoirs: I think that the important thing there is to encourage new players into the industry. We cannot encourage them unless they are profitable, and they cannot be profitable with many of the work practices that exist at the present time. The passage of the industrial relations bill is absolutely essential for us, so that we can get
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           good employer and employee relationships there that are based on productivity and provide an incentive so that we can get our unit costs for processing down to about a third of what they are.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other thing that we have got to do is to be able to market a consistent product with known grades of quality. This is a very difficult problem. The Americans are moving well down that path and the Australian exporting industry also has to get to the stage where it can market beef that is graded and consistently reliable in quality, so that the consumers know what they are going to get when they buy it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have also got to establish an Australian brand. I think that the industry may well go to a regional basis. I would like to see the feasibility explored of something like the Central Queensland area running Capricornia beef, or something like that, and marketing that internationally with a consistent product available with consistent quality, and having it recognised as such.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I do not really want to take too much time in the Senate this afternoon, but I believe that the industry is in crisis at the present time. I think that it has to do a great deal of analysis of where it is going, and take the steps itself to address those problems. Along the way it does need support from government in things like maintaining the health of herds through quarantine procedures and through government allowing it to operate in an economically competitive way, by passing legislation that allows competitive international practices to be introduced into the abattoirs.

One of the questions Senator Woodley asked was whether the AAHC handles animal welfare concerns and, if not, why not. Included in the objectives set out in the AAHC's memorandum of association is the requirement to:
       </para>

        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        This does not cover the full range of community animal welfare issues. The Government's peak animal welfare policy advisory body, the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare, will continue to operate, and state and territory governments have legislative responsibilities for administering animal welfare.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare was established by the previous government, and its current chair is Dr Judith Blackshaw from Queensland, whose work in the area of animal welfare is well known and long standing. The council also has representatives from the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal

         Societies, the NFF, the NHMRC, the Australian Veterinary Association and RSPCA Australia. It provides advice to the minister on a range of animal welfare issues and is an appropriate forum where the wider community's concerns about animal welfare can be addressed.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Woodley also asked about the veterinarians for New Zealand live sheep and the fact that New Zealand has vets and Australia does not. The New Zealand live sheep trade supplies only one market in the Middle East, and that is Saudi Arabia. The Saudis insist that a vet accompany each voyage to their market. New Zealand shipments also have a higher incidence of pasteurella pneumonia which can be treated on board, thus lessening mortality rates. On Australian ships, vets have been employed on trial shipments or where an exporter wants to check up on practices on board. Vets on those ships tend to carry out the odd post&amp;hyphen;mortem and, at the end of the voyage, write a report. Rarely do they influence the mortality rate on any shipment. Exporters, though, employ experienced stockmen, often with long periods of service, to accompany the shipments.

        Another question the senator asked was about the trade. If I may seek the concurrence of the Senate, I would be very happy to table a document expressing the trade to the Middle East, which began in 1960.

        A fire broke out on Saturday 31 August in the engine room of the Italian owned (Sistren Services), Panama flagged, live sheep vessel `Uniceb' which is chartered to exporters Wellards. The vessel left Fremantle on 23 August carrying 67,500

        Most reports indicate that the fire broke out on either Saturday 31 August or Sunday 1 September, but this is yet to be verified. It is most likely the ship as 900&amp;hyphen;1000 miles  north&amp;hyphen;east of Seychelles when the fire broke out.

        It appears the fire commenced in the engine room and spread rapidly to accommodation areas above causing the crew to abandon ship. The ship's engineer was lost overboard during this time.

        The crew later reboarded the ship and endeavoured to fight the fire, but were driven off by heat and smoke. They then drifted in life rafts for 20 hours or more until picked up by a passing ship the `Mineral Century' on Monday 2 September. (This vessel arrived in Suez on Tuesday 10 September.)

        We are not aware of any radio, phone or beacon contact during the fire. Upon hearing of the fire by radio from the rescue vessel on the Monday, the Italian owners dispatched on Tuesday a fire fighting tug from Djibouti to the vessel in salvage/rescue attempt. The owners also on Tuesday diverted the `Cormo Express' to the scene. This vessel had just completed unloading sheep in Karachi.

        The ship's charterers, Wellard Rural Exports, believed the ship sank soon after the fire began. This is based on the fact that two explosions were heard by the crew drifting in lifeboats after they were forced to abandon the ship and that, in the period between the ship being abandoned and the sighting of the debris, there were no reports of a ship on fire in a major shipping lane into Suez and the Middle East.

Therefore, I think it is necessary for me to correct the record on a couple of important matters.

        Firstly, the claim was made that job cuts have occurred under the guidance of the previous board of Telstra. I think that is really saying that, under the ALP, Telstra embarked on an efficiency drive which was necessary at that time in order to ensure that it could compete effectively and deliver lower prices to consumers. It is doing precisely the same thing again. It has nothing to do with privatisation. Senator O'Brien went on to say:

        There is no reason to think that the likely reduction in the number of its employees by 500 to 700 will be changed by the new board.

        I do not know where these figures come from. The total number of Telstra jobs in Tasmania in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 was 1,460. If there was that sort

        This seems to have been borrowed from another new recruit to the debate, Senator Allison, who is running around suggesting that cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation would disappear if Telstra were partially privatised. Of course, the fact is that this is absolutely incorrect. Anyone who has read the Telecommunications Act—I suspect that not too many have—would know that there is already a provision entrenched in that legislation which guarantees that, to the extent that services in rural and remote areas are uneconomic, they must be cross&amp;hyphen;subsidised out of a universal service

        That will continue unless, of course, the Labor Party is proposing to move an amendment to open the system up. I am not aware of that. Maybe Senator Schacht has it up his sleeve for later on. But I would not support it, I have to tell you, Senator Schacht. If you want to remove the current legislative prohibition on the guarantees, the cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies to rural and remote areas, you should tell us about it now, but, for one, I could not support it in a fit. It would be very unfair. It certainly would not be in the best interests of Tasmanians or in the best interests of the country.

        Just to make doubly sure that those arrangements stay in place, we have reaffirmed the commitment in the Telstra (Dilution of Ownership) Bill. So it is going to be there in spades. I do not know why you would want to remove that. It seems extraordinary to me and I hope you will reconsider. I know it is an important issue and I know you want to take it seriously. If you want some advice on that, we are happy to give it to you, but I am putting you on notice here and now that we are not prepared to support any amendment that you might move on that basis.

The special auditor process has been a positive step in the push for greater accountability, and I believe it has been long overdue. We can now move forward and concentrate on better service delivery in indigenous communities and improved living conditions for indigenous people. ATSIC has agreed to complete the special auditor process and use the material provided and gathered by the special auditor to assist in funding decisions.

        At the time of the court decision, the special auditor was seeking additional information on a further 130 organisations that received $89.6 million in their latest funding. Of these organisations, the special auditor says that `there is the potential for some or all to be declared not fit and proper'. The special auditor has found a further 184 organisations were in such serious breach of grant conditions that they require immediate and close attention. They received a total of $124 million in their latest funding.

        That is a total of 374 of the 1,300 organisations funded by ATSIC in serious breach—either not fit and proper or requiring immediate and close attention.

In fact, after investigations, senior management at the mine now admit that there is a minimum of 3 million litres of diesel fuel oil which has leaked from the mine's tanks down into the terrestrial environment. Others put this figure as high as 10 million litres. Have you been paying a diesel fuel rebate to this company? If so, how much? Have you deducted for the amount that is now under the island? Will your government continue to give the mine a diesel fuel rebate, if you have been doing so? Effectively, you are subsidising this company to continue damaging the environment.

If the diesel fuel being used at that particular mine, or any particular mine around Australia, was in keeping with the customs legislation, they would get the diesel fuel rebate on the fuel that was used for those mining purposes. In relation to the point you are making with regard to fuel that has disappeared, I am not too sure about that and I will just check with Customs on it. My understanding is that it has to be fuel that is actually used, but I will check that.

If they are right, the amount in question owed back to the government is roughly $1 million. If the experts and those who have done the other assessment are right, there is some $3.2 million in rebate owing back to the government. Will you give an undertaking to collect it if indeed it has been paid? On the matter of principle, shouldn't any mining company found to be blatantly in breach of environment regulations be refused any further diesel fuel rebate?

Not only am I but also the mining companies themselves are very conscious of their environmental requirements and they do not deliberately go out of their way to waste diesel fuel or any other material they use in their mining operations. But the two are totally unrelated. The usage of fuel where it is legitimate under the Customs Act would attract the diesel fuel rebate. As I say, the environmental matters are a

         —This is actually a very important question because the extent to which people in rural and remote areas have access to services is obviously critical if they are not to be left behind in keeping up with the latest technologies. Before we came to office, Labor had simply allowed what is called the future mode of operation, the roll&amp;hyphen;out of digital exchanges, to limp along past the year 2000.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result of discussions we have had with Telstra, they are now committed to the effective completion of that roll&amp;hyphen;out program by December 1998. That will mean that Telstra will be able to provide many enhanced services to customers served through a digital exchange including call diversion, call waiting, e-mail, caller line identification—all very important enhanced services. Furthermore, by December 1997 the digitisation rate—in other words, the percentage of total exchanges which will be converted to digital—will be the same in metropolitan as in country areas: 85 five per cent. That is, of course, very good news for those in non-metropolitan areas after years of neglect by Labor.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="3917" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         There is more good news because, from July 1997, 93.4 per cent of customers will be able to obtain an ISDN service within 90 days of request. That will mean that both business and domestic users will be able to dial up fast digital connections as easily as making a phone call. Those sorts of new services will include multiple phones and faxes on the same line; much faster access to fax machines; fast EFTPOS links; fast access to the Internet for educational, cultural and information services; small-screen video confer encing; shared screens; and virtual production groups, so that people in different locations can collaborate and produce high fidelity sound and fast text and graphics.

        All of these will be available only because of the actions that the government has taken. In many countries areas they do not even get the speed that the normal telephone service delivers to people in metropolitan areas of 28.8 kilobytes per second. In some areas they are down around the level of 3 kilobytes per second. As a result of the introduction of ISDN, you will have 64 kilobytes per second. Indeed, on the two lines that are available, that can be conformed so that you get 128 kilobytes per second.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, that will be an enormous advantage for those people in rural areas who are wanting to get access to the Internet for a whole range of reasons, commercial and educational. Farmers will find it of great use to be able to tap in for weather reports, for changes in commodity prices and for the latest research on farming programs. Students living outside the metropolitan areas will also have enormous opportunities to get access. They will not have to wait forever, as is often the case now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the principal things that put people off using the Internet, as Senator Patterson, Senator Hill and I discovered recently, is the enormous amount of time that it can take for downloading, and particularly for graphics to come up on the screen. That is a function of the speed of the system and that is why an ISDN link, and a number of the other technologies that will be much more readily available, will make a huge difference to people who would otherwise have had to languish under Labor's previous approach.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Telstra is also actively pursuing options to use emerging technology to provide similar digital and ISDN services to those who are living more than five kilometres beyond an exchange. Similarly, for those who are on digital remote concentrator systems, there will be other improvements that Telstra and others will be wanting to introduce as quickly as possible. We are doing what Labor never contemplated doing. Indeed, I can remember Michael Lee running scare campaigns and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         suggesting that this was going to cost billions of dollars. I was delighted that Senator Schacht, by his inaction, effectively endorsed this initiative when we released it recently and I am therefore glad that we have bipartisan support.

But while she is asking the minister the answer to the previous question, firstly, could she also find out from the minister what the net worth of the rebate will be in light of the premium increases in private health insurance since the budget; and, secondly, could the minister tell us what increased percentage participation in private health insurance is anticipated to come about annually as a result of the private health insurance rebates?

        It is estimated that in the absence of the incentives the private health insurance participation rate would have fallen to around 31 per cent by July 1997. It is estimated that the announcement of the incentives will slow the rate of decline, resulting in a participation rate of 32 per cent by July 1997. The incentives are estimated to increase the participation rate by 2 percentage points through the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 financial year. Together with the estimated impact of the Medicare surcharge for uninsured high income earners, the participation rate at the end of the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 financial year is estimated to be 35.5 per cent.

          The fact is that Senator Short has owned up until today nearly 7,000 ANZ shares. His explanation to the Senate today after he had been caught out by the Labor opposition was to say that he is going to direct his broker to divest of them today. Of course he should have done that as soon as he had been commissioned as Assistant Treasurer in April because in that role he is directly responsible in the government of Australia for banking and superannuation matters. This is a clear conflict of interest. There is no question that he has been involved in high level discussions and has helped make decisions. There is a clear conflict of interest.

The Prime Minister in the parliament put down the guidelines on ministerial behaviour. Today in the House of Representatives he confirmed that Senator Short was in breach of those guidelines. He said he was in breach. He also said that last night he did consider whether to dismiss Senator Short. He decided against that because, and I seek to paraphrase only, he did not see—

         —It was a hanging fence and, as Senator Collins interjects, this may have been inadvertent. That may be true, but why did the Prime Minister set up these guidelines, set up a system where ministers declare not only their shareholdings but the value of their shareholdings, the value of their debts? I assume that all that material was put in in time, by 27 May, across to the Prime Minister. The responsibility for examining that confidential material rests with the Prime Minister so that he can determine whether there will be any future potential conflict of interest.

        That is where the weakness is. Do we have a lazy Prime Minister who did not bother to go through the 27 declarations from ministers and the 10 from parliamentary secretaries? Did the Prime Minister delegate that to a staff member? Was there a failure at that particular level? It is quite clear from the very statements and answers today that Senator Short still does not concede properly that there was a breach of the guidelines. He goes back to the fact that he does not believe that, in his past record—I believe him over this part—any of his decisions in government were influenced by his shareholdings. That is not the point: the point is that Senator Short continued to own these shares—in a very sensitive area that he had direct responsibility for—for six months. It was the Prime Minister's responsibility to draw this to

        There is nothing new in this, because we know that, on 20 March, Senator Parer—either at a profit or a loss; I will not speculate either way—sold his shares in mining companies so that there would not be a conflict of interest. As well as that, we know that Mr Anderson sold his shares so that there would not be a conflict of interest. It is all very well for Senator Panizza to volunteer here today that Senator Short is going to sell all the rest of his shares. With due respect, that ain't on the record anywhere. It has not been said—you presumed it. Senator Short said today that he would sell his ANZ shares. The point about the profit from those shares is that it is not the profit from when Senator Short bought the shares to when he sells the shares, but the profit from when he should have sold the shares until today.

        Here we are—we must be the great mugs of the world. We expose the conflict of interest, we shame the Prime Minister into directing Senator Short to sell the shares—and what happens? He is nine grand better off! He is $9,000 better off. He should donate that to charity or somewhere else. I will even let him claim against the tax so that he gets something out of it and everyone wins. There is just a modicum of unfairness that, having absolutely breached the Prime Minister's guidelines—unlike Senator Parer and M Anderson—he is a few bob in front, according to Senator Panizza. You mentioned Lindsay before: the mob out there would love to make an extra nine grand in a few months, having just breached a minor guideline.

The first time we try to apply that particular principle when someone is in breach of the guidelines, does he dismiss that minister? No, he does not. He does not touch him at all.

Mr Keating was the Treasurer at the time that he failed to lodge his tax return. What a great example to the rest of Australia! What a fine example!

On 30 July 1996 the Queensland Government announced the selection of the three preferred bidders to provide the State with a total of 744 MW of new generating capacity. Longer term (beyond 2000) energy options could include the expansion of the Tully Millstream hydro-electric scheme, the expansion of other renewable energy sources, construction of new coal based generation plant and interconnection options other than along the route under consideration for Eastlink.

         The other thing that has been missing from this debate is a proper assessment of the energy efficiency alternatives in Queensland. Neither Labor nor conservative governments in that state are properly able to get their minds around these as the best alternative. They have been looking at Tully&amp;hyphen;Millstream, at thermal alternatives and even, in the back of some people's minds, the nuclear option as an alternative to piping electricity from the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          New South Wales grid north into Queensland. By far the best and cheapest option and the best job generator is energy efficiency whereby those industries in Queensland, as elsewhere, can save up to 40 per cent of the current consumption of electric power through simple, judicious, technical care and investment. I use as my authority the world&amp;hyphen;renowned Rocky Mountains Institute—if the report disagrees with that—which comes down with a different point of view from this report. The senator opposite has had the opportunity to read that report, but I have not as it has just been tabled.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a repeated failure of government, a repeated failure of bureaucracies and, certainly, a repeated failure of the energy utilities throughout this country to look at that option, which, by the way, produces cheaper electricity and has not only minimal impact on the environment but also environmental advantages. It means there is less leakage of energy and less wastage of power into the environment and certainly it obviates the need for alternative sources of power to be built to supply future needs of power.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Economically, employment wise and environmentally, the energy efficiency option ought to be brought forward and does away with the need for the debate on the capital&amp;hyphen;expensive and environmentally negative options such as Eastlink. That is something I intend to pursue in the Senate. As I said, the Greens in Queensland have fought long and hard to have that option brought up. It may be dismissed by a report like this, but then, I guess, even a report like this has not counselled global wisdom like that from the Rocky Mountains Institute in coming to the conclusions it has.

Let me tell you, Senator Brown, that we had experts from both sides of the fence—wide-ranging opinions—from people who came in from overseas specifically to give evidence to this inquiry. This report that was brought down by the committee, which I chaired at the time, was, apart from a very small minority report by Senator Woodley, which highlighted one or two other issues, a unanimous report by the members of this Senate.

         The other thing that Senator Brown does not understand is that we have got a response from the government in a far quicker time than we got a response from the former government on many of the matters that were reported on by the committee that I chaired. I think specifically of CSIRO. The previous government refused to comment on the report or respond to the report. The current government has already done that, and the response was made available to members of the committee within the past week or two. That was a report that the previous government failed to respond to.

         In response to the unanimous recommendations of this committee, which included three members of the then opposition, two of the then government and Senator Woodley, there is only one of the recommendations in the whole of the report that this government says that it does not support, and that is for a variety of reasons. The recommendation was that:

        <para>
         That is the only recommendation, amongst a large number of recommendations, that the government does not support, and there was a reason for that. It was not supported because consideration of Eastlink alternatives was an important element of the Eastlink environment impact assessment process which was being conducted in accordance with the relevant state and Commonwealth legislation.

         Senator Woodley says that certain things have taken place since the report was brought down.

         This was a good example of a reference to a committee, which was handled in a very short time because of the urgency that was required because of potential work that was going to take place. We held extensive public hearings over a very short time. This is an example of how Senate committees can work for the betterment of this chamber and for the people who made the representations to us. It was certainly done with far more effort to come out with unanimous recommendations than some similar committee references that I have been on in more recent times—the IR bills, to suggest just one of those.

         It was clear from community reactions that the most pressing need on Christmas Island is the availability of land for private development. The Committee has made a number of recommendations designed to reduce risks from rockfalls and to hasten the release of land. If implemented, they will substantially reduce the need for the Commonwealth to continue investing large sums in housing.

         Finally, I should mention the Christmas Island Boat Club, which has premises in what is seen as a high risk area. The premises were subjected to a potentially catastrophic event in 1972 involving several large boulders. The consultant recommended that the premises be demolished.

        —In responding to this debate, let me say briefly that we on the opposition side argue that the case against the disallowance has not been made. We have had a last&amp;hyphen;minute backdown by the government, signalled yesterday by Senator Vanstone, but we do not see that as in any way addressing the fundamental issues that have been raised in this debate, issues of access to justice and issues of access to people's rights in our legal system. We have had a last&amp;hyphen;minute backdown, but it is one that is not good enough, in terms of both the magnitude and the individual fees involved. It is a backdown which still embodies a very large increase on the fees that currently apply in our legal system.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As has been rightly indicated by the government, we increased fees at the start of this year, but I alert senators to the fact that when we did increase fees earlier this year our formula was based on a CPI adjustment basis. What we have here is something which has absolutely no relationship to CPI adjustment.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In terms of the magnitude of the backdown, when the increase in fees drags some $72 million out of those in the Family Court system and some $32 million out of those who find themselves in the Federal Court system, the level of the negotiating position put up by Senator Vanstone is not good enough. In fact, one problem is that we have had no indication from the government as to the level of the reduction of the slug they will impose on individuals using the court system.
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        There is some feeling that it might be as high as 15 per cent or 20 per cent, but in the absence of statistics all we can do, once again, is look at the individual instances involved.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The government has also argued that we need to somehow relate our fee structure to the fee structure imposed by the states. No doubt the consuming public, those who are in the court system, would not try to work out some complicated formula between state and federal court systems and their fees; they would look at it in terms of what they have to pay. What they have to pay is going to be a lot more than what they are paying now.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       For instance, in the Family Court system, even if you factor in the reductions that have been offered by Senator Vanstone you are still talking about at least $1,700 for a typical family law case. At the moment one has to pay only $368. If you take into account the reductions that have been announced by the government, we are still talking about 4&amp;half; times more than what is currently being paid.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       If you look at the Federal Court system generally, at people pursuing small business claims, you are still talking of them having to pay over $10,000 in court fees and charges, whereas at the moment the current fee is only over $1,000—a $1,600 application fee down to $1,200 with the first day free in court and whatever, the hearing fee down from $2,000 to $1,600 and so on. You will still find yourself paying $10,000 for your piece of the court action as opposed to $1,108 now. It is a 1,000&amp;hyphen;fold increase for a small business claim.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       And it goes on. For a review of government decisions, where at the moment people pay less than $1,000, in the future an individual trying to fight the government—for instance, over their pension payments, over an FOI act, over a tender, or whatever—will be paying over $3,500. At the moment they are paying only $984. We do not think the offer made by the government is good enough. We do not think the offer goes anywhere near the sorts of considerations that need to apply in the system.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       User pays is not appropriate. We have had this argument out. The fact that people will
       <break page="3942" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        have to pay so much to access their rights I think is unconscionable. I am not the only one who thinks that. As I said yesterday, the highest ranking judicial officer in this country, Chief Justice Gerard Brennan, has also made it very clear that, with respect to user pays:
       </break>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . that profoundly mistakes the constitutional function of the judicial power of the State which, as I have said, is to apply the rule of law in resolving disputes and thereby preserving the peace, order and good government of society.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I said yesterday, the exemption is one that really does not help us all that much. I do welcome the commitment in respect of the unlawful dismissal applications and applications which previously were available through the industrial relations system but in the future will have to be pursued in the Federal Court, but I do say that we will be looking very carefully to make sure that any claim for unlawful dismissal, whether it is in the Federal Court or the commission, will not have to incur anything more than the fee that that claim has had to incur in the past, not just in the arbitration system but also in the Federal Court system. There may in fact be a loophole there we are going to focus on.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I am a bit concerned that maybe the government has made some inroads in terms of their negotiations, negotiations which I said at the start are not as acceptable to us as they would appear to be at first viewing. They are not as acceptable because they do not reduce the impact of fees and charges in a manner that is appropriate. They still embody astronomical increases in claims, whether it is in the Family Court system or whether it is in the general federal court system.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       On this particular note, in respect of one aspect of the disallowance resolutions—that is, the one that goes to the question of claims under the Native Title Act—the government has made no concession. I would have thought it totally appropriate for them to have made a concession, particularly in this area.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, with respect to native title, there is going to be an increase in fees. With respect to the AAT, there is going to be an increase of some $2 million or $3 million over four years. With respect to the High Court, there is going to be
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        an increase of some $2 million over four years. I would have thought these particular increases in fees, exorbitant as they are, should not go ahead. With that, I close the debate. The opposition is very keen to ensure that the disallowance motions are successful.

       The events of the Port Arthur massacre were a horrid reminder of the brutality that can exist in our society. Port Arthur was an event that shook this nation to its very soul. In fact, it forced us to rethink the direction in which our nation was heading. In so doing, it actually put in place a particular process that led to the agreement establishing uniform national gun laws, an agreement which was concluded on 10 May this year. This was an outcome that Labor had worked hard to achieve in government and an outcome that we were very happy to give bipartisan support to in opposition.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       An important part of the new national gun laws is the national amnesty, an amnesty that is already up and running in a number of states and territories. The aim of that amnesty was to encourage as many gun owners as possible to hand in their prohibited weapons—to choose voluntarily to comply with the new laws. Given the considerable anger and the distrust of the government amongst some gun owners, this was never going to be an easy task. It was a task that was going to have to be handled sensitively and by the best advertising campaign possible. It was something that politics should never have played a part in. Unfortunately, it is quite apparent that this has not been the case.

       The evidence which I will set out in the next few minutes clearly shows that advisers close to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) interfered with the tender process that led to the awarding of the national gun laws advertising contract to the firm DDB Needham Adelaide, a firm close to both the Liberal Party and the advisers concerned. In so doing, those advisers and this government have not only sought at the first available opportunity to corrupt the tender process to benefit their mates but, and more importantly, they put an advertising campaign, the success of which is fundamental to the national interest, in the hands of a firm which, according to the independent evaluation, is simply not up to

       I will now explain how this sleazy episode eventuated. On 4 June this year, the federal cabinet agreed that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), following consultation with the Prime Minister, would conduct an advertising campaign in support of the national gun amnesty. In July 1996 the Office of Government Information and Advertising, together with the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board, issued a creative agency brief for the national gun control public education campaign. The purpose of the campaign was clearly stated:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       To design a creative advertising and media strategy to explain, promote and encourage voluntary compliance for the Australian wide gun amnesty.
      </para>

       The brief stated that the government had allocated $2 million to cover `all communication activities until the conclusion of the national gun amnesty on 30 June 1997'. The brief also set out three key objectives of the campaign: one, to promote and encourage voluntary compliance with the gun amnesty; two, to explain clearly which firearms are banned and which ones are restricted under licensing categories; and, three, to promote and encourage the surrender of unnecessary, illegal firearms. The brief was circulated to some 200 advertising agencies and marketing firms, all of which were contained on the register, maintained by OGIA.

       I have been advised—I raised this in my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) on Tuesday this week—that DDB Needham, Adelaide was not on this register as at 30 June this year. I have also been advised that the Prime Minister's chief political adviser, Mr Grahame Morris, contacted Ms Cathi Moore, the Assistant General Manager of OGIA, and asked that DDB Needham, Adelaide be added to the list of four firms initially asked to make a pitch for the contract—the first dose of interference. Senator Hill, on behalf of the government, had the opportunity on Tuesday to deny both of these matters. He chose not to. In fact, he

       We then move to 8 August, when five firms, including the imposed DDB Needham, were asked to make a pitch. Representatives from the offices of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Administrative Services, OGIA, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board were present. Mr Morris attended the meeting.

       As is standard practice, all of the presentational materials were then taken from the five bidders and were submitted for market testing by independent assessors—Elliott and Shanahan research. The testing consisted of target group analysis of the messages contained in the advertising campaign. They had 13 group discussions across eight locations in New South Wales and Queensland. They were conducted in urban areas, in rural towns and amongst our farming community. The groups were made up of gun owners, both males and females, and partners of gun owners—all over the age of 18.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       DDB Needham's campaign theme was `Gun control: it's time to bite the bullet'. To say that this pitch was not warmly received by the target group would be a major understatement. Elliott and Shanahan, the independent assessors contracted by the government, concluded that DDB Needham's pitch `generated considerable anger because of the emotion of the approach'. They said that it `resulted in claims of non-compliance' with participants reacting by `digging their heels in'. Elliott and Shanahan noted that the pitch produced `a very emotionally charged response which always elicited a negative response'. They said that overall DDB `received the most negative response' of the five.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       But the response of some members of the discussion groups better expressed their reactions. One described the DDB proposal as kids stuff; another said, `It's overboard.' Another described it as a `kick in the guts'. More graphically, one member was quoted as saying, `No f. . . ing way. You can take that and stick it up your . . . .' This is the evaluation. This is the response.
      </para>
      <break page="3945" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
       <para first-indent="16">
        OGIA, in its advice to government from their assessment of DDB's submission, noted that it `barely met the requirements of the brief'. They went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In its submission DDB have not displayed strong application of critical logic or consistent application of communications theory in their submission.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, basically, they failed. They failed the test of the target groups. They failed the test of the evaluation. OGIA also noted:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        DDB Needham have suggested an unlikely communications solution to the task at hand . . . delivering a highly emotional creative strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        They also said, `DDB have not demonstrated a strong understanding of the creative task' and showed a `lack of attention to detail.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All these assessments are part of the documentation available to the government, documentation and evaluations sought for and paid for by the government. It is also understood that the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board also conducted separate evaluations of each of the bids, and they were equally as scathing of the quality of the campaign suggested by DDB Needham as OGIA.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to look at the comparisons. It would be valuable for the Senate to understand the quality of some of DDB's competitors. For example, after the initial assessment, John Bevins was ranked first. Elliott and Shanahan concluded that their campaign—the theme was `Amnesty: once and for all'—received `the most positive response across all groups'. It was `non-threatening and non-contrived' and achieved a `positive reaction' to its `matter-of-fact approach'. That is a stark contrast to the DDB evaluation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The comments made by the test groups once again supported the conclusion. One person said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is down to earth whereas the other ones are trying to give you a threatening image and they turn you off.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another said, `They're not playing on any emotions.' Another one of the target groups said:
       </para>

        All the information is pretty clear. You can see what you can't have and you can see who can own a gun.

       </para>
       <para>
        So what is very clear is that John Bevins's submission was seen as not just better but highly superior by all those who independently assessed it—OGIA, Elliott and Shanahan and even the test groups. What can also be clearly seen is that DDB Needham were not up to scratch in any sense at all.

        On 23 August OGIA wrote to John Bevins Advertising advising of the arrangements for the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications to be held on Tuesday, 10 September 1996. The role of the ministerial committee was to make the final determination as to which tender was to be preferred. It is curious that in that letter OGIA informed John Bevins that only two tenderers had been short&amp;hyphen;listed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        However, just a few days later in a subsequent letter dated 2 September, just over a week before the ministerial committee met, John Bevins got another letter from OGIA. This time they were told that three agencies had been short&amp;hyphen;listed. Why was it now three and not two? The answer is pretty simple: in the interim Mr Morris, chief political adviser in the Prime Minister's office, contacted OGIA again and insisted that DDB Needham be included on the short list again.

        This brings us to the meeting of the ministerial committee that occurred on 10 September 1996. The committee currently has five sitting members: the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Minchin, Mr Petro Georgiou, Mr Grahame Morris and, in relation to each advertising campaign, the relevant minister. In this case, of course, it would have been and was the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General.

        On 10 September 1996 Mr Williams, as he stated in the House of Representatives today, was not able to attend as he was involved in a cabinet meeting. He sent in his place one of his advisers, Ms Melanie Granger, an adviser who had been with him in opposition. Mr Williams also invited the New South Wales Minister for Police, Mr Whelan, and the ACT Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Mr Gary Humphries, to attend. They were invited to represent the interests of the other state and territory police ministers, obviously those with a very direct and clear interest in the matter due to the nature of the campaign. They had a very close
        <break page="3946" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         working relationship with the national gun amnesty. However, it is important to note that neither Mr Whelan nor Mr Humphries were voting members of the committee; they were there in an advisory capacity only.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The meeting commenced at about 5.30 p.m. Departmental agency officials were present. The initial plan was to hear the final pitches for the advertising contract and to determine which tender would be successful before moving on to the public relations contract. Following the pitches for the advertising contract, it was clear that the initial discussions favoured John Bevins Advertising. However, after a side discussion between the Attorney-General's adviser, Ms Granger, and Grahame Morris, Ms Granger left the room for a short period and returned saying, `Daryl wants DDB Needham.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is somewhat in conflict with what the Attorney-General told the House of Representatives today. It is not in conflict to the extent that Ms Granger left the room and saw him. But the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General wants to wipe his hands of any involvement. He claims that he gave no indication at all. But Ms Granger went back and said, `Daryl wants DDB Needham.' It soon became apparent that the decision was unlikely to be reached quickly and, accordingly, the committee adjourned for dinner, then went on to hear the pitches for the PR contract and then to reach a decision on the advertising contract. So this was the process that was followed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to note that at about 9.30 that night, four hours later, an officer from OGIA then rang the representative of John Bevins. The representative was advised that the field had been reduced to two but that the final decision was `vociferously being debated'. The OGIA officer went on to say that it was `not looking good' and that John Bevins's prospects did not `have much to do with the quality of their work'. Four hours later, John Bevins was told, essentially, `Your quality is pretty good but you're not looking too good and it's got nothing to do with the quality of your work.'

        When the pitches for the public relations contracts were concluded at about 10 p.m., something quite extraordinary happened: the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         committee then proceeded to do their work basically in the dark. They kicked out the public servants; they kicked out the bureaucrats. They were not present. They were not allowed to be present. No minutes were kept at that stage; no records were kept. There was no public accountability because they were up to a dirty act and they wanted to make sure that there were no public servants around to witness it.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As to what happened next, we only know some of the details. At about 11 p.m., as a result of his disgust at the process that was being adopted and because he believed that the fix was well and truly on, Mr Whelan left the meeting to return to Sydney. The next public signal was at 12.10 a.m. when the staff of OGIA were informed that DDB Needham had won the contract.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In summary, the great dark horse in this race for the advertising campaign, a company that only gave a sales pitch because of the intervention of Mr Morris from the Prime Minister's office—a pitch that was ranked last, fifth out of five, but which was miraculously short&amp;hyphen;listed after further intervention by Mr Morris, a pitch that was ranked third on a short list of three and of which it was said `barely meets the requirements of the brief' and which had received `the most negative response overall'—jumped from being a non-starter to fifth, to third, to first. You would not have been expected to believe that DDB could have won it at the start. If you had put a bet on DDB at the start, it would have been a pretty exciting race to watch and it would have won at extremely long odds.

If that is correct, why then did his adviser, Ms Granger, indicate otherwise at that meeting on 10 September?

        Further, on 1 October 1996 the Prime Minister, curiously enough, admitted that three advisers on the committee—Senator Minchin, Mr Georgiou and Mr Morris, as the Prime Minister claims—had voted for another firm. If both Mr Williams and the Prime Minister are right, then at least three out of the five members of the committee did not vote for DDB Needham. This raises two direct questions: first, who did vote for them; and, secondly, how did they end up getting the contract if the majority of the committee did not vote for them?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, it is not clear whether either Mr Williams or Mr Howard are telling the truth. On the same day that Mr Howard made his comments, the ACT Attorney-General, Mr Humphries, said on ABC radio that the decision to award the contract to DDB Needham had been unanimous. They might have organised the fix but they did not organise the cover-up afterwards. Who is telling the truth: Mr Howard, Mr Williams, Mr Humphries, or none of them? Why was DDB Needham—and you have to ask this—the beneficiary of this government's largess? Why did DDB Needham, with no merit, get the preferred treatment coming from nowhere in the race and finishing up in front? The answer is pretty simple: DDB Needham has close connections with the Liberal Party.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principals of the firm, Mr Ted Horton, Mr Toby Ralph and Mr John King, worked on the 1996 federal election campaign. DDB Needham had also worked on state election campaigns for the Liberal Party. In fact, in their respective capacities as state directors of the Liberal Party in South Australia and Victoria, Senator Minchin, Mr Morris and Mr Georgiou had all worked with and had all given work to DDB Needham.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To tackle the argument that the Prime Minister tried to use this afternoon in the House of Representatives on the other side, the Labor Party has absolutely no problem with a firm with Liberal Party connections winning government contract work, providing
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that firm is the firm best suited to perform the job and wins the tender process fairly and squarely. But that is clearly what did not happen in this particular case.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us get an overview of the impropriety. Let us get an overview of the corruption of the process here. I have already discussed how DDB Needham's pitch was patently deficient for this crucial national advertising campaign. I have already discussed how Mr Morris interfered in the tendering process to ensure that Needham received consideration that it simply did not deserve. I have also discussed how Needham seems to have won the contract despite the fact that the majority of the committee claim not to have voted for them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Just as importantly, Senator Minchin, Mr Morris and Mr  Georgiou, the apparatchiks of the Liberal Party, should have absented themselves from the decision to award this contract on the basis that there was at least a clear perception that they had a conflict of interest, if not an actual conflict of interest, given that each of them had previously awarded contracts to DDB Needham and had worked with them in a very close, personal and political capacity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is clearly the case in relation to the person who actually voted for DDB Needham, but it is even the case for the other two. They should have exempted themselves, and that is very clear. When a judge or other decision maker exempts themselves from a decision on the basis of conflict of interest, they do so not just because of any perception or actual conflict that may arise from the ultimate decision; they do so because it is critical that the very process must not be tainted by that conflict or that perception of conflict. Clearly, regardless of who voted for DDB Needham, the contact of Senator Minchin, Mr Morris and Mr Georgiou is deserving of censure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It does not end there. There is more. Since the tender was awarded, cabinet decided on 24 September to increase the amount of money available for the advertising campaign from $1 million to $3 million. This decision was made ostensibly to allow a television component for the campaign. It is no surprise that, in its pitch, DDB Needham, the favoured
        <break page="3948" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         son of the Liberal apparatchiks, recommended a $2.88 million budget for the campaign.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst I note and accept that the move to expand the campaign to provide a TV component was supported by Mr Whelan  and Mr Humphries, in the circumstances I think we are entitled to ask whether this tacky exercise was just as much about getting `more pork on your fork' as it was about the genuine interest of the advertising campaign. You have to ask whether the only reason this campaign received the extra $2 million was that the contract had been awarded to Liberal Party mates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Regrettably, this was not the only contract fix engaged in by this government. I turn to the public relations contract. The PR contract in the same matter was also the subject of political interference. When the bureaucrats and the political advisers met on 8 August 1996 to settle the short list for the PR contract, only two firms were initially short-listed—only two firms, Senator Minchin. They were Hill and Knowlton and Turnbull Fox Phillips. That was on 8 August.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, less than a month later, on 7 September, those firms were advised that a third firm—Burson Marsteller—had also been short&amp;hyphen;listed, once again thanks to the intervention, the interference and the corruption of the process by Mr Morris. The ultimate decision taken on 10 September 1996 to award the contract to Burson Marsteller is still a curious one. In its evaluation, for instance, OGIA described the Burson pitch in the following terms: `Whilst innovative, it is considered risky for the government.' The other short-listed firms' pitches were described by OGIA as being `sound and achievable'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Once again, what we have here is a public relations contract, the awarding of which raises questions of why Mr Morris interfered from outside directly into the process and corrupted it. The reason once again is clear: Burson had strong connections with the Liberal Party. The final sales pitch was given by Jonathan Gaul, who has worked—Senator Minchin knows this; you are as guilty as hell on this one, Senator Minchin—on the committee of many Liberal campaigns, including
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         working in the party's national headquarters during the recent federal election campaign.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to also note that the Burson bid relied upon research conducted by Mr Mark Textor. Mr Textor has conducted polling for the Liberal Party in many state and territory election campaigns—the Northern Territory for instance. He has been employed by the Liberal Party as a staffer and, most recently, he was the director of polling and research at the Liberal Party's federal secretariat. Most notably, Mr Textor is the person who is known for that shameful exercise during the 1995 Canberra by-election when he designed the Liberal Party's push polling campaign. So, once again, across the spectrum on a critical issue where bipartisan support is critical, we have political interference in a process that should have been only merits based.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a shabby affair to say the least. The government has a hell of a lot of explaining to do if it is to provide a rational explanation as to how a bid as poor as that submitted by DDB Needham Adelaide ever won this contract. There is compelling evidence through the estimates committees and in documentation that the government interfered in this tendering process to ensure that the advertising contract was undeservingly awarded to its mates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the concern goes way beyond the sniff of corruption that we have here. The decision to award this contract to DDB Needham has already had practical consequences. The advertising campaign, which was due to start on 1 October, has been delayed. The gun amnesty has commenced in a number of jurisdictions and there is no advertising campaign to support it. It has just about finished in Adelaide and there is no advertising campaign to support it. And why? Because DDB Needham was not ready. It had to go off and redesign its campaign. How can the government expect us to trust a company that was shown through the independent evaluation process to be unfit to conduct this campaign—a company which designed a campaign that not only did not encourage gun owners to hand in their weapons, but incited
        <break page="3949" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         them to resist the amnesty and to bury their weapons in the backyard?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the interests of trying to fix up its mates with the old payback system, the government has placed in jeopardy one of the most important advertising campaigns ever conducted by an Australian government—just to reward its mates. The longer it goes on, the longer we get the dissembling, the more the government gets itself into trouble.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have put on record exactly what the evaluation said of DDB Needham. But what does Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, say through his spokesman?  He says that there is no reason to take action since he saw no flaw in the process. The whole process was corrupted. It is quite evident it was corrupted. You do not have to talk to the advertising industry to find that out. The documentation shows that. The minister sees no flaw in the process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister also went on to say, laughingly I must submit, `DDB was selected for their overall strategy which was considered to be the soundest strategy.' It was a strategy which his department knocked back and his department and its independent contractors determined was the weakest. He says, `They had a strong creative team their strategy fitted well with the successful public relations firm Burson Marsteller.'  What a lot of rubbish! The team was not even known at the start. The evidence is quite clear. This firm should never have been in the ring, but the minister laughingly tries to defend them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has not just jeopardised the campaign but has sent the wrong message to a very important industry. The advertising industry has to be concerned because they are in great contractual relations with government and they have to have confidence in the process, but what confidence will they have now? I think the feeling in the advertising industry is best summed up by John Bevins in Sydney. They said that agencies would be `mad to pitch for government accounts the way the process is now'.

         putting in a firm which was not ready to run when the amnesty took off. I think there is more than enough evidence here to indicate there was political interference by the apparatchiks of the Liberal Party deep in the heart of the Prime Minister's own office, with the Prime Minister's parliamentary secretary and Prime Minister's chief political adviser. They have corrupted the process. There is a need for a judicial inquiry and that is why the opposition has moved this motion this afternoon.

       I am very pleased to participate in the debate to set the record straight, to get rid of come of the rewriting of history that Senator Bolkus tried to engage in in his presentation, and to show exactly what the facts were in relation to this particular contract. As all Australians know, the national firearms control education campaign is one of the most important public education campaigns ever undertaken by government. I do not think even the Labor Party could deny that. It follows on from an historic agreement that was reached by all Australian governments in May this year. Under that agreement, certain high powered firearms were to be banned and uniform national minimum standards on the availability, use, ownership and storage of firearms were to be introduced.

        The launch phase of that national firearms control public education campaign is now under way. Its purpose is to explain the new laws to all Australians, and I think everyone agrees that is needed and necessary, and also to inform gun owners of their rights and obligations under those laws. To suggest that the government or the committee would jeopardise such an important campaign by fixing the results, as apparently the Labor Party is suggesting, detracts from that very historic agreement of all governments.

        To claim that the selections were made on the basis of mates rather than merit is insulting, small minded and, most importantly, wrong. The simple fact is that both the successful advertising agency, DDB Needham, and the successful public relations agency, Burson Marsteller, were selected on the basis of merit. The committee selected DDB Needham because the agency offered the strongest creative team, because their overall approach best addressed the wide range of target audiences and because they provided the best fit with the successful public relations agency. The committee selected Burson Marsteller because the agency displayed the strongest grasp of the brief and the issues and because their proposed approach was more strategic and comprehensive than the other agencies.

        The opposition has alleged that because members of the committee had dealings with members of DDB Needham this somehow translates into a conflict of interest.

It is of course quite incorrect.

When assessing the proposals, the committee felt that the Bevins approach, whilst it did not offend anyone, contained no motivating factors and would not significantly advance the aims of the campaign.

He did not consider it necessary to remove himself when these sorts of things were being awarded to Mr Singleton. Mr Singleton got a fee of $33,000 from that 1986&amp;hyphen;89 Australia made campaign and in 1989&amp;hyphen;92 he got another fee of $240,000. Mr Singleton got a fee of $700,000 for the Qantas public share float. There seems to be a deathly silence over on the other side now. What happened to Graham Richardson with all these? What about the fact that Mr Singleton was the ALP man? He got another $124,000 from the Australia made campaign.

          While I have the time, I want to raise a couple of other things that Senator Bolkus said. Senator Bolkus made a lot of the fact that the advertising agency that finally got the campaign, Needhams, recommended an increase from $1 million to $2.8 million—I think that is what he said. He forgot to tell us that Bevins agency—which it seems he was supporting—recommended an increase in funding from $1 million to $3 million, which was how it turned out.

Senator Bolkus went on at some length to suggest that, because Needham suggested $1 million up to $2.8 million, there was something quite improper about that. But he forgot to tell the Senate that all five agencies had apparently recommended more. The actual figures that we ended up with—$1 million to $3 million—were those recommended not by DDB Needham, but by Bevins.

          There is another matter that I want to briefly cross. There was, apparently—according to Senator Bolkus—some real problem with the selection of the public relations agency Burson Marsteller.

I am sure Mr Whelan would not divulge any information on what happened at that meeting, but perhaps in a quiet moment you might ask him whether or not he supported that agency and why he did support it.

The real issues that confront Australia seem to be quite irrelevant to the Labor Party. They will not let us get on with the budget; they will not let us deal with the industrial relations bill, which, when passed, would do magnificent things for employment and for our export trade. The Labor Party prefer to try to mislead the Australian public by this exercise in political muckraking. There is absolutely no substance to the allegations they have made. They have not produced any facts before the Senate which would justify them and it is a pity they do not get on with the real job of doing something decent for Australia.

       The issue under discussion today raises grave doubts about the probity of the Howard government. It raises questions about conflict of interest and could well border on the edge of corruption. In the absence of an anti&amp;hyphen;corruption body like the ICAC at a federal level, it is the duty of this Senate to pursue these matters. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has made much of his new standards that will operate under this government.

OGIA found that the strategy of John Bevins Pty Ltd—Amnesty: Once and For All—`demonstrated superior understanding of the communications task outlined in the brief'. The submission met the requirements of the brief very well and met the budget specified. It went on to say that the message represented `a creative solution which successfully delivers the key messages in a manner that will assist to defuse the emotionally based arguments from pro&amp;hyphen;gun lobbyists'. Bevins included non&amp;hyphen;English language press in their media schedule and OGIA found that:

       What did the same qualitative polling organisation have to say about the DDB Needham Adelaide proposal? The research showed that the DDB Needham proposal `Gun Control: It's Time to Bite the Bullet' generated considerable anger because of the emotion of the approach. The research indicated that the approach would result in non&amp;hyphen;compliance with the laws and was seen as dictatorial and with government `coming to get you'. It was seen as an anti&amp;hyphen;gun lobby approach and elicited the most negative response overall.

       The research showed that gun owners rejected the approach proposed. It encouraged gun owners to fight the government and it was found to position the government in the most unfavourable light.

       The key question in this is: how did DDB Needham Adelaide get on the list originally? There is great doubt whether they were ever on the original register of several hundred firms. However, the decision on this occasion to go for selective tendering was a sensible one—to pick out four or five to tender—because the assessment cost, if 20 or 100 firms had applied for this work, would have been prohibitive and a stupid expenditure.

       Let us have a look at the question of the 1995 billing rates for these firms: George Paterson Bates Brisbane, billing rate $30.6 million; Foote Cone and Belding Sydney, $55.4 million; John Bevins Advertising, $27.3 million; Grey Melbourne, $78.2 million; DDB Needham Adelaide, $5.8 million. Needhams are not in the same class as the other four firms. They do not sit with them; they stick out like a sore thumb. You have to ask: how
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        in heaven's name did they get chosen? It is a very murky process, let me tell you.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What happened on this occasion was that OGIA drew up suggestions. They had to put those suggestions to ministers and the final five firms emerged. I can tell the Senate that OGIA did not have Needhams on their list when they sent it to ministers. What happened on this occasion was that the Prime Minister's chief political adviser, Mr Grahame Morris, contacted the assistant manager of OGIA and requested that DDB Needham Adelaide be on the list. If anyone doubts this, just ask the Department of Administrative Services whether such a letter is on the file. Let those opposite deny that the chief political operator out of the Prime Minister's office put the fix in and got DDB Needham Adelaide put on this list when OGIA never considered them a worthy contender or in the same league as the other firms.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       After that, you get a short list drawn up—after everyone has come in and had their pitch, and I will come back to this later. A short list of two firms is drawn up: John Bevins Advertising and George Paterson Bates. That was to be the short list to do the second pitch. What happens? Chief political adviser Grahame Morris comes back on the scene. He agrees that Bevins is a pretty good bid and, just to make sure Bevins wins, he suggests that DDB Needham go on the list because they are like chalk and cheese—that the contrast would be enormous: they lob in a no&amp;hyphen;hope firm in order to show how good the winning firm is going to be.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Following a process of qualitative testing carried out by Elliott and Shanahan, these firms happened to make their second pitch to the ministerial committee. The crucial point is that these firms are not supposed to change their pitch from the first pitch to the second pitch; otherwise all the qualitative research is useless. The only assumption we could ever have made was that this absolutely hopeless bid by Needhams must have improved massively on the second pitch. But you are not allowed to do that.

       Of course, we have other evidence here now, and that is that Mr Wayne Kingston, the chairman of DDB Needham Australasia,

        on 3 October, he said that his agency had made some amendments to its submission between the first and second pitches, but that these were minor. You cannot have it both ways. If the first pitch remains virtually the same as the second pitch, with only minor amendments, how could you possibly think of using this firm that is so bagged by OGIA and so destroyed by the Elliott and Shanahan research?

       What has happened subsequently, Needhams having won this contract, is that all that first and second pitch has been thrown out. DDB Needham Adelaide are now working on a new creative pitch. They have thrown out the bite the bullet campaign, I am told, and they are now working on a new campaign. What that means in terms of billing is that everyone only gets $5,000 a pitch and, if you do creative work post the pitch, you get paid full tote odds. Not only have the others been skun—and some of these bids have cost them up to $80,000 to put together—but now Needhams are going to get paid not $5,000 for their creative work but an enormous amount more.

       Let me come to the decision making day, because this is crucial to our argument. The ministerial committee began meeting at 5.30 p.m. The members of the committee present were: Mr Grahame Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister; Mr David Jull, Minister for Administrative Services; Senator Nick Minchin, parliamentary secretary; and Mr Petro Georgiou, member for Kooyong. I would just like to take a moment to congratulate Mr Georgiou on being the first backbench member of this committee in its history. Then finally, because Mr Williams was unavailable due to going to cabinet, an absolutely proper excuse, Ms Melanie Granger, an adviser to him, represented his interests on this committee. Also present, as I think Senator Ian Macdonald said, were police ministers Whelan and Humphries and their staff. There were OGIA staff and staff from the Attorney-General's Department and related agencies.

      <para first-indent="16">
       All the firms came in and made their pitch. Then Elliott and Shanahan came in and gave
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        their assessment in summary. The general view in the committee, as I understand it, was that Bevins were a mile in front. There was then a confab between Mr Grahame Morris and Ms Melanie Granger, who then left the room. From answers given in the House of Representatives today by Mr Williams, she put the case to the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, apparently gave him some papers, and he said, `I can't make up my mind. You'll have to do it for me.' What does Ms Melanie Granger do when she goes back inside the room? She utters the immortal words, `Daryl prefers DDB.' Who do we believe? The staffer or the minister? I believe the minister. I believe that the minister was telling the truth today that he gave his staffer no instructions and that she came back into the room and said, `Daryl prefers DDB,' on the basis that she was suborned by Mr Grahame Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister.

       Of course, this throws great confusion into the meeting, and they determine, `We can't resolve it now. Let's take a dinner break. Let's hear the PR firm's pitch and we will come back and decide this matter later.' Of course, later in the evening all the OGIA officials leave the room and the decision is made, and they are informed at 10 minutes past 12 that the contract has gone to Needhams.

       But here is the interesting point. At 9.30 that night, OGIA rang John Bevins's people at their hotel and told them that the field had been reduced to two—Bevins and Needhams—but that the decision was being `vociferously debated'. They were also told, `It wasn't looking good,' and that their poor prospects `didn't have much to do with the quality of their work'. So someone from OGIA has let the cat out of the bag. Someone has rung John Bevins and said, `Look, it is still being debated. We can't give you a result. However, you are not actually going to win'—that was the hint—or `you're not looking too good, but it is nothing to do with the quality of your bid'.

She observes that they were sought because `they knew just how to get down in the gutter'. This pair was `complemented by John King and Toby Ralph from DDB Needham Adelaide to advise on strategy'. She further noted that they, King and Ralph, had vast experience from state campaigns in Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory, where they had worked for the Liberal Party and the CLP.

Mr Georgiou had contact with them over time and was also, I think, responsible for getting them to become the master agency of the newly elected Kennett government in 1992 before they could give the contract to Leeds Media, even closer mates than Needhams. There is no doubt that Senator Minchin and Mr Morris, as employers of DDB Needham and supervisors of their efforts during the federal election, were intimately involved with these two particular people.

       One of the crucial points here, though, is that the various losing firms are entitled to a debriefing. That sort of debriefing indicates to the losing companies where they went bad. When the principals at John Bevins Pty Ltd learnt that the DDB Needham proposal had barely met the requirements of the brief, had tested poorly and was full of contradictions, they immediately contacted OGIA for more information. They wrote to the Assistant General Manager seeking an assurance that their proposal was judged on its merits and an undertaking that they received a fair go.

Let me tell you what Bevins' mistake was: it did not hire Ted Horton, the creative manager, to run its election campaign; it did not hire Toby Ralph from Needhams in Adelaide; it did not hire John King; and it did not have Senator Minchin and Mr Grahame Morris to supervise them all the way through the federal election.

       What we have here is the very first test of the Howard government in awarding of a tendering contract, not determined by public servants but by a ministerial committee. It went to a firm with a billing rate of only $5.6 million a year, not in the league of the others, whose two directors—owning 60 per cent of it—had worked actively in the federal election campaign. They use a creative director from the overall organisation to help with the pitch, who also worked on the Liberal campaign,

They will be able to bill full creative rates when everyone else had to subsume that in their $5,000 pitch fee.

       Every day of the week all of us face potential for conflict of interest. The real issue in terms of public policy and public behaviour is whether action is actually taken which is in conflict of interest with our responsibility as public figures.

       None of you were able to say that there was such an actual conflict of interest. Indeed, I think the furthest Senator Bolkus went was that there might be `a perception'. Even the strongest point that could be made by Senator Ray—who I thought usually was fairly fiery in these types of debates—was that there was `an interactive interest' between some people. That is not a conflict of interest. Just because you know some people and deal with them, having an interaction with them, all of a sudden it is a conflict of interest?

       Mr Deputy President, until you can show that there was an actual conflict of interest, there is just no basis to your assertions. The strongest thing that could be said is that at one stage some of these people were state directors involved in the Liberal Party—and, might I add, as employees of the Liberal Party—and that, therefore, they should not in any way be dealing with that advertising agent, in Senator Minchin's case, three years on from his time as a state director; in Mr Georgiou's case, about two years; and in the case of Mr Morris it would be, I suggest, even more than three years.

       The only paragraph that stands is paragraph (ii), which notes that the people who happened to have got this contract also assisted the Liberal Party in the last election.

Senator Ray himself said on 30 September 1996 that the fact that an advertising agency which had worked for a political party should not disqualify it from getting a government contract. In Senator Ray's own words, that argument fails as well.

        Some comments were made during the debate that really do need to be answered. It is wrong to assert that only two advertising agencies were put on the short list by the preliminary panel and that Mr Morris or whoever had the other one added later. In fact, three companies were on the short list right from the beginning and it included the one that we are talking about today, DDB Needham. They were all selected by the preliminary panel. The preliminary selection panel, which drew up this short list, was made up overwhelmingly of departmental officials. There were several OGIA people and bureau crats from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department and departmental agencies. The only representatives of the government on that panel was the person from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's office and one person from the Prime Minister's office—hardly able to roll the situation and manipulate it, as has been asserted.

You have made these bland assertions. I am telling you what the facts are and you are unable to respond. The answer is that OGIA were in support of DDB being on the short list. I really ought to say to the opposition: if you want to come up with hard&amp;hyphen;hitting motions in this place, do not rely on Senator Bolkus because his performances of late have been so pathetic.

The bad grace of Senator Bolkus was shown. Everybody else from the opposition came across to congratulate Senator Ferris; there was Senator Bolkus sitting by himself in his seat. In fact, I beckoned him to come across, show some good grace and congratulate Senator Ferris. But the mean spirited nature of the individual was such that he could not move himself across the chamber to congratulate Senator Ferris on an excellent first speech.

       As has been outlined and not seriously disputed by the government, it is relatively clear what occurred. The government, in its wisdom, made a decision to conduct an advertising campaign arising out of the terrible events at Port Arthur. There was nothing wrong with that. It sought voluntary compliance with its future gun legislation and allocated something in the order of $2 million for all communication activities.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The brief that was sent out to the advertising agencies sought voluntary compliance. It sought that the public be informed which guns, rifles, et cetera, were barred and which of those guns or rifles had restricted activities. It sought to influence the community so that the community surrendered its firearms. The brief, as I understand it, as customary practice, invited 200 advertising firms to tender. Those firms' names were maintained on a public register. The first point, as we understand it, was that DDB was not on that register; it was added later.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       On 5 August, after reviewing submissions, five firms were asked to submit. All of those bids were submitted for market testing in a range of areas and occupations of both genders in metropolitan and rural areas across the nation. It was a very wide testing exercise that the government sought on the five bids.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The pitch that was put by DDB Needham we were told by OGIA was `Gun control: It's Time to Bite the Bullet'. This particular pitch was not received well. The test groups comprising the focus groups found it negative, discouraging and offensive. OGIA's evaluation was that the DDB brief barely matched the terms of reference. They did not meet the
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        demands of the brief. They were difficult to assess. It generated considerable anger. It was seen as dictatorial, and the research showed that gun owners rejected the idea of the campaign. On the advice of the evaluation department, the DDB brief was poorly put together, contrary to the purpose of the government and tested badly.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       OGIA, the Office of Government Information and Advertising, also tested the other briefs. What emerged is also clear and on the public record from the estimates committee. The information in a range of the other briefs was very clear. There was widespread approval by the focus groups. The Bevins brief was determined to be superior. It had strong branding and a positive response. It did not confuse and it generated interest and impact. The participants said the Bevins brief was down to earth and its pitch clear. So the focus groups, as reported by OGIA in their evaluation to the estimates committee, gave virtually zero out of 100 to the DDB brief and very high marks to the other briefs, in particular the Bevins brief.

       In late August a ministerial committee was established. We were told, as I recall, at the estimates committee that two tenders were short&amp;hyphen;listed. Senator Abetz made some comments on that, and I will return to that later. A week later, on 2 September, the short list was increased to three. The third firm, being the eventual successor, was the firm which had been rated most poorly by the evaluation agency. We were told today that Mr Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, insisted upon the DDB brief being included and the number being increased to three.

We were told there were also other state ministers and their advisers present—Mr Whelan from New South Wales and Mr Humphries and their advisers in an advisory capacity but not in a voting capacity.

Around about 9.30 p.m. there was a break and Bevins was informed that the final decision was being vociferously debated. Bevins's poor prospects were nothing to do with the quality of its work and it was indicated that its brief would be unsuccessful.

       Then we come to the interesting part of the evening, as outlined by Senator Bolkus and Senator Robert Ray. Around about 10.30 p.m. it was thought that the deliberations should be concluded. Public servants were asked to leave. The note taking process ceased, no minutes were kept, no records were taken and no independent witnesses were available.

      <para first-indent="16">
       Around about 11 p.m. before the vote, Mr Whelan from New South Wales left the meeting to return to his home. What we know occurred after that was that DDB was given the contract. It had the poorest rating from OGIA. It had the last ranking of fifth out of five. It was short&amp;hyphen;listed at the request of Mr Morris, but it was given the job and the revenues at around about 12.10 p.m.

       The aftermath, according to the
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       newspaper, is relatively clear. Three of the five persons who participated—and I will not repeat the details, because they were outlined by Senator Robert Ray—apparently voted for another firm, not for DDB. But, as we now know and as was explained at the estimates committee, the DDB firm gained the contract.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That firm has been engaged in extensive work for the Liberal Party over a number of years in South Australia, Victoria and at a national level. Indeed, I must concur with what Senator Robert Ray said. I do not have any particular problem with advertising agencies, professional firms, legal accounting or whatever gaining work from governments or political parties. The only caveat I would offer is that the process needs to be clear, it needs to be transparent, it needs to be noted and it needs to be capable of independent verification.

      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the complaint is not that the contract was awarded to the DDB firm; the complaint and the nature of this debate is about the process of awarding that contract. It seems to me, looking on from the outside, that there was a degree of chicanery and a degree of improper involvement, and a decision that is improper. I do not share Senator Robert Ray's view that it is the greatest political rort of the last 15 years or the greatest political rort of all time. It strikes me as being mean, pithy and a very poor effort. I suggest that those who were involved in the decision making process should have disqualified themselves; they should not have participated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next thing we are aware of is that the size of the contract increased from the original amount of $1 million or $2 million to over $3 million by a decision of cabinet on or around 24 September. What are the consequences of this decision making process and the awarding of the contract? We know that the advertising campaign has been delayed. It is non-existent in a number of states. Even though the campaign is non-existent in those states—it has not been run, it is not currently being run and, apparently, there is no intention to run it in the immediate future—the guns are still being surrendered.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why has this occurred? As it was explained today—and not rebutted by Senator Macdonald or Senator Abetz—DDB was not ready. It was not able to give effect to the large contract that had been awarded to its firm. So the original campaign by DDB was poorly put together; there was little to no merit, as said in the evaluation process; the brief was not completed; and the job has not been delivered.

         I would like to turn to the contributions of Senator Macdonald and Senator Abetz. Sena tor Macdonald did not rebut any of the points raised by the prior debaters. He tried to colour the issues, to confuse us by making references to Senator Richardson, to Mr Singleton and to Mr Cameron. He expressly denied any illegal or improper activity on the part of any of those men or their organisations. He expressly denied that. He kept dancing around the sides, hinting at improper behaviour. He then covered himself by saying, `Nothing occurred. I raise nothing. I make no allegations.' He simply sought to confuse the issue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So it raises what criteria were used to award the contract? What were the criteria that defeated the Bevins firm? We do not know. All we know is that a decision was made. What was the mistake of Mr Bevins? He was not involved with the Liberal Party. That was his mistake. He had no influence in the decision making process. His submission had a lot of merit. It was the best submission. His fault, his mistake, was that he had no influence. He had no contacts. He had a lot of merit, a lot of hard work and a lot of skill, but no influence.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So we should now turn in that context to the contribution of Senator Abetz. Senator Abetz made nine points in his submission. Firstly, he made some references to trade unions and members of parliament who were formerly union officials, and he suggested they should disqualify themselves from participation in this debate. How that related to the motion, he did not explain. It was a gratuitous aside.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        His second point—and it seems to be a feature in his debating style—was that he referred to the report by Gary Gray after the last federal election. That report, of course, was a report to members of the Australian Labor Party as to why we lost the election. It bore no relationship to the motion before us, to the awarding of the contract, but it is worth while to throw into the debate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        His third point was that he chose to misunderstand or misinterpret the significance of paragraph (ii) in the motion. His fourth point was an arcane legal point as to the legal status of the Liberal Party and its agents at law in terms of the signing of documents.

        His fifth point was Mr Grahame Morris's role and his apparent responsibility for the temporary high standing of the Prime Minister in the polls. His sixth point was some off-the-cuff reference by former Senator Gareth Evans, and he thought it was so worth while that he repeated it five times.

        His seventh point was commercial benefit to persons individually in paragraph (iv). He made reference to the selection panel. My memory of the evidence at the estimates committee was that two firms were short-listed, that it was the advice of the officer from OGIA that it was not three—that the third firm, the firm that eventually gained the contract, was added at a later time. Finally, Senator Abetz gave us his assessment of Senator Bolkus's character. How any of that related to the issue under discussion escapes me. None of it addressed the merit of the motion.

        So, in summing up, it appears that there has been a degree of impropriety in the process of awarding this contract. It involves senior members of the government and officials of the staff of the Prime Minister. There is conflicting advice given to the Senate via the estimates committee and in the contributions today as to what actually occurred. There is certainly enough evidence put before the Senate today to suggest that an inquiry is needed to establish what the facts were, what the facts are—indeed to review this entire process. So I would urge the passage of this motion before us today.

There may, in fact, be a conflict of interest in this matter, but it is not the conflict of interest alleged by those opposite. I will explain to the Senate why, in fact, there is a prima-facie conflict of interest and where that conflict of interest lies.

But what they may not have known—or maybe they knew and withheld it from this Senate; that, in itself, would be a shameful act—is that it is our understanding that one of the principal authors of the report prepared by the Office of Government Information and Advertising has, in fact, been offered a lucrative position with Bevins advertising agency: the very advertising agency which that mob on the other side claims should have this contract. That is the apparent conflict of interest. It is not a conflict of interest that affects Senator Minchin, it is not a conflict of interest that affects Mr Georgiou, nor is it a conflict of interest that affects Mr Morris. What we have is an apparent conflict of interest within the government office that prepared the assessment on which the people opposite have relied for over two hours this afternoon as the only substance for their debate.

       In the course of the debate earlier on this afternoon Senator Bolkus told us that an officer from the department absented himself from a meeting at 9.30 in the evening and phoned Bevins to say, `You've got a great presentation. I don't think you're going to get it and it has not got anything to do with the quality of the presentation.' Was that officer the same officer who helped prepare this report? Was it the same officer who, we understand, has been offered a very lucrative contract with Bevins? I suspect that the silence from the other side of the chamber now is proof positive that the opposition have been caught out. They came in here wanting a debate on sleaze and wanting to smear people's integrity, and yet the truth is that they did not have the integrity to tell the Senate chamber all that they knew or should have known about this sordid matter.

It would be even more disturbing if an opposition, knowing all these facts, used that report—selectively used that report, as they have this evening—to attempt to smear the good name, the character and the integrity of an honourable senator in this chamber and an honourable member of the other place.

They do not have to worry about the facts because, if you believe in hypocrisy, you never let facts get in the way of your prejudice.

If they do not apologise then they are not men of integrity and they are not men who seek the truth; they are men who will use any device and any opportunity to twist the facts—not to achieve the truth, but for their own grubby political ends. Those who live by the sword die by the sword. And they are dying a gruesome death on the other side of the chamber. What we have here now are the facts. Those facts are very clear and the opposition can have no answer to those facts. That is why they ought to have the decency to apologise and to

       We could go on at great length about all the impropriety that occurred when the previous government was in power. When former Senator Richardson was the minister responsible for choosing advertising, the only protection we had against impropriety was that he had two other members on the committee who were not as friendly with Mr Singleton as he was! They were not bosom buddies, but that does not say that they were going to ensure propriety; they just were not as friendly as he was. That was the only standard of propriety that existed when the Labor Party were in government, and now they come in here and want another standard of propriety. And yet, when the truth is brought out and when we say, `Yes, there may have been a conflict of interest, but it wasn't Senator Minchin's conflict of interest and it wasn't Mr Georgiou's conflict of interest,' they squeal like stuck pigs—and so they ought, because a little bit of the truth can be a painful thing.

We have had two hours of the people on the other side in this place alleging the most appallingly defamatory things against an honourable member of this chamber and an honourable member of the other place—and not once did they bother to step outside and say it. And yet, when the truth comes out, they say, `Step outside, step outside, step outside.'

Maybe this matter does deserve further investigation but not further investigation in this chamber—further investigation on the proper procedures to ascertain how it was that this shameful debate could have been given any semblance of credibility by the people on the other side and how somebody could have fed them the information which they have used to smear the integrity of two fine people on this side of the chamber.

As the program shows and as you have rightly described it, this is a government response to the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities dealing with the annual
          <break page="3972" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           reports of the Australian Securities Commission and other bodies. The Securities Commission has attracted—and does from time to time—critical analysis and appraisal in the popular media as to its effectiveness. Obviously, it does that because, as the watchdog on corporate governance in Australia, it has reposed in it the key responsibility on behalf of taxpayers to ensure that the affairs of the corporate world are run with probity and in compliance with the law. The obligation on the Securities Commission is to detect fraud when and if it occurs and to refer matters to prosecution should there be a case for that.

         In terms of white collar crime and corporation corruption, it is a major responsibility and, within its resources, I think the Securities Commission handles its responsibilities with great effectiveness. Nonetheless, what also has to be said is that there are, increasingly, comments about the number of corporate criminals that have been brought to justice in this country and questioning of how effective the ASC is.

         It is a matter of public record that only two people have been convicted of insider trading in Australia in the most recent past and that does not seem to accord with marketplace experience of how extensive this practice might be. Indeed, as a consequence of the foreign takeover of TNT, the Australian owned transport company, last week there were quite strong allegations that some inside knowledge of the impending takeover may have governed particular investments in share purchases that resulted in massive windfall gains to those individuals who exercised those share purchases.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If one reads the published information—and I only have access to what is in the media on this—certainly, prima facie, there is a case to say that massive gains were made and that the circumstances in which they were achieved raise reasonable doubt as to whether or not they were done honestly. I am sure that matter is being investigated by the ASC. I mention that only to illustrate the point that there is, behind the comments about corporate criminality, some empirical evidence in the marketplace to suggest or to justify continuing concern about the effectiveness of the ASC.

          We recently went through the estimates processes with the ASC and discussed with them at considerable length, as the estimates processes enable us to do, measures that they are taking in order to improve their circumstances.

          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          He took the ASC quite carefully through some of the allegations made, to test how their detection and scrutiny processes had benefited from those learning experiences and whether or not those experiences were capable of being created again in Australia. I must say that, while the answers of the ASC were professional and persuasive, nonetheless there still is a nagging doubt as to whether the ASC is as fully equipped as it ought to be to discharge its obligations to the community.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In saying that, and in referring to that nagging doubt, I want to say very clearly and very publicly that that is not to question the professionalism of the officers of this body. Indeed, one would see that those officers, in being questioned in an estimates committee process, in any case have an obligation to defend the integrity of the commission. It is certainly not the purpose of the questioners, in this case, to in any way reflect upon the commission, for fear that that may encourage or embolden actual or potential corporate criminals into believing that they can get away with their nefarious acts.

          Faced with those considerations, I have to say that the decision in this current budget to reduce the funding to this body does raise some doubts in my mind as to whether or not the ASC is adequately funded by the government to do the task it has and to shoulder the heavy responsibility that it has before it.

Therefore, I took the view that this inquiry arose from special pleading by a sectional interest rather than because of a general concern about the nature and suitability of the administration and vital nature of the CSIRO at the time.

It is certainly the grandest of all the science institutions we have in this country. It rightfully and properly enjoys a large reputation for excellence in Australia and has a peerless international reputation as well. I think there is a degree of common view about that. Because it is so large, it has reached so wide and the issues with which it deals are so important, there is also a constant audience of criticism as to whether the CSIRO as a major organisation has all of its settings absolutely right. The first thing the CSIRO would say is that it is absolutely sure it hasn't, but it tries to get them right and works as closely with advisory panels and with community needs and sectional interests as it can in order to do so.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What is also fundamental to this is that the board that governs the CSIRO, which has under its act the statutory responsibility for administering the organisation, is not something which ministers should tinker with. The board has an obligation under its act. The board is appointed. The board has to clear with the minister its corporate plan and its strategic plan for addressing the issues that it has responsibility for, and it does that. But it is for the organisation to deliver and not for ministers to politically interfere and push the CSIRO down the course of picking winners or direct how the CSIRO should deploy its funding in order to meet the needs of sectional interests. That has to be quite categoric. That has to be quite clear between all of us.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is for those reasons that I, as minister at the time, resisted pressures placed on me, some of which emanated in this chamber, to interfere with the CSIRO and direct its research effort in a way in which particular honourable senators would want me to do. Having said that, the other factor here too was that the CSIRO itself was undertaking a major review of its operations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said earlier, the CSIRO is sensitive to public criticism and is aware of the weighty responsibility it has under its act. It is an organisation that is conscientious about
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          pursuing its goals. The board had introduced a major review of its management structure and even if I were tempted to intervene, as the pressure was pushing me to do, it was prudent not to for the very reason that the board was itself addressing issues that it felt important.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That has been quite a major review by the CSIRO. The former director of the CSIRO has to take a lot of credit for the way in which that review was conducted and for the extensive public consultations and intra&amp;hyphen;organisational consultations he undertook so that the outcome of the review was effective from the point of view that it did the job that was required and it did not forsake honest scrutiny for internal peace. It addressed the real questions head on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, the outcome, once formed in the mind of the reviewing body, was consulted through the organisation in a way in which the members of that organisation felt part of it, owned it and were able to apply themselves to the new direction the organisation had adopted. The government response to this Senate committee report shows, in relation to many of the recommendations, that it acknowledges that the CSIRO restructuring has been quite considerable and very effective.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second ground is that the CSIRO was doing the job, has now done the job and the government of which—that is, the senators who were then in opposition and were criticising me—does endorse the restructuring self-imposed by the board on the CSIRO with the consensus and support of workers and stakeholders in that organisation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What also has to be said about this is that there is a tendency to think of a body like the CSIRO in a static way. When the CSIRO was first created, the major industries in this country were pastoral, agricultural and mining and the CSIRO in its early days achieved part of its international reputation by breakthrough research in those particular areas, meeting the needs of those industry sectors. The science that it did in the manufacturing sector added to its reputation, but its main preoccupation was in the other areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Science is not a static thing. The frontiers of science are exploding exponentially all the
         <break page="3975" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          time. It is refining itself and becoming more detailed. Areas of science which are now a gleam in the eye of some scientists, or do not even exist in fact, will in five or 10 years time be areas of public demand and of great importance, such is the exploding nature of knowledge in the science area, and the CSIRO as a body has to keep abreast of that.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, under its mandate, this is an organisation under considerable strain at all times to meet its obligations to the community. It has to be said that it is an organisation which would have it no other way. The rise of information technology, the rise of genetic research and the rise of a whole range of new areas of science and research in light metals and across areas of environmental technology are specialities that now are obvious to us which were not on the map 10 years ago.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So it is not surprising, given those strains and those pressures, the CSIRO is in a constant state of reorganising its priorities and focusing the effort where it will do most good in the national interest. In constantly restructuring itself to deliver that outcome, it is not surprising from time to time that when sectional interests divine particular needs may not be serviced as they choose to require them to be there will be outcries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I ask that the Senate remind itself always that this is an organisation with an incredible mandate which is expanding all the time. It does behove governments to give it the support necessary to address those issues, and that includes rural research. It does behove the government to do that, but it also behoves governments to support it in being at the leading edge in the frontiers of the new areas of research that are developing.

          . We had in Senator Cook a very good minister. Since the change of government we have seen a reduction in the funding to the CSIRO. Out of this report I wanted to look specifically at rural research, particularly at Chiswick, Arding and Longford. These are properties up near Armidale.

          In the report it was recommended that these not be sold. However, the government and the CSIRO have decided to do differently. There were 80 staff employed in that area. It is now down to 35. We actually had the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) up there last week saying this was wonderful, they were saving it, but a number of those projects do not have a particularly long lifespan. I am not sure what happens to Armidale's Chiswick after that is completed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is a rural community in the middle of the wool growing area and in the middle of the beef industry. It is close to grain production and a wide range of other agricultural pursuits. Yet we have the government saying that reducing the scientific staff from 80 to 35 is a plus for CSIRO. It is certainly not a plus for Armidale. It is certainly not a plus for those who have been involved with CRCs and every other sort of research that goes on in the area.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is a synergy between CSIRO, the CRCs and the University of New England. I would have thought the government would have been looking at ways to maximise that synergy to provide for the employment of people in rural areas because CSIRO has such a significant contribution to make in the area of rural production and rural research, but that does not appear to be the case. It is becoming easier and easier these days to actually site institutions in rural areas because with the advent of improved technology, improved telecommunications and the like, communication is not a problem and the transfer of information and material between the various institutions of the organisation also is not a problem.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In relation to this reduction and sale, I am concerned that a lot of the money that has gone into the development of these sites has actually come from the wool growers through Wool International. I wonder legally just how many of those sites are owned fully by CSIRO and how many might well be said to be owned by the wool industry. They are very concerned about that.

           Armidale and the mayor of Dumeresq. They have every right to be concerned because they are seeing the bleeding by this government of the intellectual base from their area. There is nowhere else in the region that scientists can hope to get a job, that the 40-odd who have been given redundancies can hope to get similar employment. The university may be able to take one or two. The state government's vet labs may be able to take one or two, but that leaves the rest. What are they going to do? We are going to see a continuation of the brain drain from rural Australia, in this case rural New South Wales.

          What it costs people to sell their houses in Armidale is nowhere near the replacement cost of housing the people will have to buy. If they move to get a job in science, they are likely to move to a capital city. So they are going to be discriminated against and have hardship placed upon them in the purely physical sense of having to sell their house for a value that is less than an equivalent house in a capital city or a much larger centre that they will be forced to move to.

Presumably a number of the spouses also have employment in the area, so what is going to be the impact?

          As I said, we are seeing this government cause a brain drain from the rural areas of Australia, especially New South Wales in this case, to the cities. This is the government that is supposed to be concerned about rural areas. From talking to the people in the region—many of them are National Party voters and card&amp;hyphen;carrying members of the National Party—I have found that they are very angry about this because they feel that they have been let down by their party and by their government. That is something that people need to be very conscious of.

A number of extremely good projects are being run. It would be very sad to see these not continue or not receive extensions to their time when the current funding levels are completed.

          This government is determined to reduce the scientific work that is carried out in this country. It is not only going to lead to a brain drain out of the rural areas but it is also going to lead to a brain drain as scientists will have to leave Australia to find gainful work and continue to undertake their extremely important research work. I urge the government to think very carefully about this. This appears to be just another example of the attitude that farmers are beginning to think this government has of not caring about the future of agriculture in this country. They think they are more interested in other pursuits and other forms of income revenue and sources of revenue.

         —This report of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Telstra: To sell or not to sell?
         </emphasis>
         contains a huge number of issues that go not only to the issue of the partial privatisation of Telstra but really explore where our telecommunications industry is going in Australia. As a member of the committee that conducted the inquiry during the winter recess it was interesting to see the behaviour of the government members on that committee and the way in which they complained bitterly about having to go through the exercise of conducting the inquiry. Whilst I do not want to dwell on that point, I would like to make the comment that that leads to a very clear situation of the government having something to hide on this issue. The basis of it is as follows.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The association between the partial sale of Telstra and the environment was motivated out of a cute political trick. It was a cute political trick engineered by the government with no policy substance but done in a way to try to link the numbers in this place to pursuing a piece of legislation that solved some of their financial problems in their overcommitments in the election campaign to funding $7 billion of an alleged deficit and so forth. The fact that that has not worked has been exposed thoroughly through the subsequent experience we have had with the exploration of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. The relevant legislation committee heard that the environment groups in Australia are not convinced that it is a necessity to partially sell Telstra to fund the environment program.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those environment groups have said that the linking of the sale of Telstra in funding those crucial environment programs sets a very dangerous precedent. It sets a precedent on the basis that this government proposes to sell public assets to fund recurrent expenditure programs. The programs listed in the natural heritage trust bill are recurrent expenditure programs. This flies in the face of the comments made in the coalition's policy document that the revenue created from the sale of public assets, specifically Telstra in this case, will go towards capital expenditure only and capital programs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This serves as evidence of the motivation of the coalition to linking the sale of Telstra with the environment program. It is a political con. They know it has not worked. The coalition has prepared its minority report and are saying, `We have the evidence to show that there is some merit in the partial privatisation of Telstra.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is where this report is so crucial and important to this debate. It exposes the very point that this government cannot produce evidence. They cannot produce evidence that the partial privatisation of Telstra will benefit the community in this country and the competitive position of Telstra and its development. They cannot produce any evidence that there will be any benefit with respect to the issues that were raised about the future of our telecommunications industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the course of the inquiry, the only groups to really come out in support of the coalition's policy were—lo and behold!—Telstra themselves, the Department of Finance and, of course, the Department of Communications and the Arts. There were certainly other groups that supported the notion of partial privatisation, but their evidence was based on the same flawed evidence put forward by the departments in the period this inquiry was conducted. That evidence was based primarily on a World Bank study, which looked at overseas privatisations and tried to extract specific areas where productivity improved as a result of privatisation as distinct from competition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is where they failed to draw any comparison. They could not prove in any
         <break page="3978" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          way, shape or form that there was a benefit in introducing partial privatisation as opposed to increasing competition in telecommunications. One shambly bit of evidence emerged regarding two companies in Chile during the Pinochet regime, where the figure 1.5 per cent was scrupulously extracted—I am sure—to try to demonstrate that something was there. The bottom line is that there is no empirical evidence to prove that privatisation itself improves the competitiveness, the efficiency or, in fact, the level of services provided to customers with respect to telecommunications.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Opposition to the sale of Telstra is far and wide. The terms of reference were broad enough to bring in many issues. There is no evidence that the revenue return to the government from this privatisation would outweigh the returns that can be gleaned from dividends over a period of time. The record profits of Telstra this year only serve to reinforce that point and further expose the arguments of the government and the departments in that regard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The impact on regional jobs is massive. A third of those jobs are to go. Many of my senatorial colleagues have spoken previously about the impact of this on jobs. This is where this inquiry has proved very important. It exposed project Mercury. If this inquiry had not occurred, we would not have known about the 24,000 jobs that would go throughout Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Research and development is another crucial area where, through this inquiry and subsequent estimates hearings, we have been able to show that R&amp;D will suffer hugely from the move towards privatisation. It is an area that Telstra, in preparation for privatisation, is paring back and battening down—`removing the fat' in their language. But they are denying Australia the opportunity to expand the telecommunications industry and really look to the future to see what Telstra can provide to the public, the community, through public ownership of that organisation.

        I want to make the point that some time ago the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, particularly my colleague Senator Newman, took part in a report to the Senate on the safety or otherwise of visits to Australia by nuclear powered ships. It was a very comprehensive report. Some hundreds of pages were put together, using all the available information and advice that was given. It virtually has become the bible around Australia in relation to visits of nuclear powered vessels.

        In Hobart, the capital of my home state of Tasmania, where there is one of the best harbours in Australia if not the world, an emergency management plan was put in place to deal with any vessel having problems—and I do not ever suspect that they would have problems, but if they did have—and ensuring that the safety of all residents of Hobart, including even those in hospitals, would be catered for.

        Prior to the Senate election I was listening to Senator Brown one night—and he was not Senator Brown then but just Bob Brown—giving a bit of a policy speech and talking about what he was going to do. I noted with interest that he was highlighting the fact that, as a senator, he would work for Tasmania, promoting small business and jobs for young people. So far his track record and that of the Tasmanian Greens has been anti-development, anti-everything—and this is just another example of how they work against the interests of the people of Tasmania.

       <para first-indent="16">
        For instance, it is estimated that the visit of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         USS Carl Vinson
        </emphasis>
        will put something like $10 million into the pockets of the local economy. Just as an example, six local companies will be receiving over $1 million for the aircraft carrier's rubbish removal and ferry services. A Tasmanian company has won a contract to clean and paint the 317 metre carrier. Those two things in themselves are very significant for the Tasmanian work force. We have a very high unemployment rate in

        We have the ludicrous situation where the Tasmanian Greens and the Labor Party in Tasmania banded together to force the Speaker of the House of Assembly to send a letter to the American President saying, `We don't want you in Hobart' while on the very same day the Premier of Tasmania had to send a letter saying, `We do want you in Hobart.' It really is, as was pointed out in today's editorial in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Mercury

       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have said, there are positives to this particular visit. This is not the first visit of an American naval vessel. The reason given for personnel liking to come to Tasmania is that the people of Tasmania make them very welcome. I believe that, if a referendum were to be held on whether Tasmanians would like to continue to have visits by American naval vessels, there would be an overwhelming response.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In conclusion, I just wanted to refer to the nuclear debate in Hobart and point to the associated debacle. It has happened before; this is not the first occasion on which we have had these anti-development, anti-everything Greens trying to stop the local businesses receiving some well needed cash. For instance, I note that, when the aircraft carrier arrives, more than $1 million in cash will be taken out by ferry to the people on that aircraft carrier so that they can spend that money in Hobart—which will be to the benefit of the local community.

        I note that Senator O'Brien is in the chamber. I do not know whether he supports my views about the visits of the American navy and ships into Hobart. But I am very disappointed to see that the state Labor Party and the Greens joined together to create this situation where we have conflicting advice going to the American government. I just think, in the interests of Tasmania and small business in the area, it is a pretty poor effort

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australia's Foreign Investment Challenge: The Harsh Realities
         </emphasis>
         . It outlined the views of managers from over 50 multi-national corporations on Australia as an investment destination. The report gained significant press in the national media. According to the report, Australia accounts for only one to two per cent of global sales, therefore we are not a high priority at the boardroom tables of multi-national corporations. One manager said that, since Australia only has one per cent of their sales market, we `get about one per cent of the board's attention'.

        Australia will never be a country which has a large domestic market. However, our location provides us with the opportunity to be a production and support site supplying the fast&amp;hyphen;growing Asian region. The key point to come out of the report is that there is a real perception amongst managers that Australia lacks a coherent and consistent industry policy, both at the macro&amp;hyphen;economic level and for many specific industries. The managers in the report complain that it is not obvious who is in charge of industry policy in Canberra. They say that `existing policies change too often'. I would like to quote one manager's experience. He said:

        But in the government's scramble to cover its deficit it cuts the tariff concession order so we now pay a 3% import tax on materials that are not even produced in Australia. Policy changes like these seem to come out of the blue with no clear direction or aim and seem to totally ignore industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The hesitance of many multi&amp;hyphen;nationals to invest in Australia because of a perceived lack of industry policy is concerning in light pf the report's revelation that many of the world's leading multi&amp;hyphen;national corporations have already decided to put their next world&amp;hyphen;scale plant in Asia—but are yet to decide where.

        The government's irrational fear of industry policy should not prevent Australia from missing out on the huge export revenues that will flow from multi&amp;hyphen;national corporations locating their regional manufacturing plants in this country. These plants will export to the entire region. The average multi&amp;hyphen;national plans on more than tripling its sales in this region. This means huge export revenues for the countries where they choose to establish their headquarters. And the establishment of value&amp;hyphen;adding, export&amp;hyphen;orientated manufactured plants in Australia will create real jobs and contribute significantly to lifting our standard of living.

        Strategic industry policy was pursued successfully by the previous Labor government. According to the report, 11 per cent of the firms interviewed were involved in the Button car plan, which lifted automotive exports from under $400 million in 1984 to $1.5 billion in 1995. Sixteen per cent were involved in factor F, which increased pharmaceutical industry exports to their current levels of $1.4 billion per year. Twenty seven per cent were involved in the successful partnership for development scheme. Other industry policies include the book bounty, which increased book exports by 200 per cent; and the shipbuilding bounty, which saw production rise nearly 200 per cent and exports grow by 150 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The report's statement that the biggest magnet for multi-national corporations is a broad, cohesive industry policy should come as no surprise. Report after report, all by prominent organisations such as the World Bank, have said that a key reason for East Asia's stunning growth over the past three decades has been the effective industry policy of countries in that region.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is clear from the report that we are facing strong competition from Asian countries when multinational corporations consider where to locate. As the report says, `The Asian countries Australia competes against are all driven by industry policy and, if you want to win investment away from them, you have to focus on having a coherent industry policy.'
        <break page="3981" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Seventy&amp;hyphen;four per cent of managers feel Australia does not have a clear industry policy. Seventy&amp;hyphen;nine per cent believe we do not have a consistent industry policy and 72 per cent believe industry policy is not consistent across federal ministries.

        One senior manager explained that he had worked in a number of countries, but he found Australia's system of developing industry policy the strangest of all. He outlined how the industry department consulted industry whilst Treasury preferred to look at academic studies of economic studies of efficiency. He said managers did not know which department to believe, and described it as `a system guaranteed to create confusion'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is clear from this report that there needs to be a debate in this country regarding the development of an effective industry policy. We should look at our competitors in the region and develop policies which will ensure that we meet the challenge of competition. The current idea of simply opening a textbook and following it to the letter does not work. The report specifically criticised `frequent government statements that they are not in the business of picking winners or providing "corporate welfare"'. Rather, it must be recognised that the government has a responsibility to create truly level playing fields. We must have the same concept of the level playing field as our Asian neighbours do. This means public policy directed towards assistance to high value, high yield, expanding export&amp;hyphen;oriented manufacturing industries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has a responsibility to nurture these key industries and a responsibility to ensure good economic policy that delivers results is followed, not some blind ideological pursuit. This report is a deafening warning bell to the government: unless you develop a strong industry policy, Australia will not attract the foreign investment which is so integral to the growth in our economy and, over time, the living standards of all Australians.

          It involves coverage on
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          . That program involved a story involving the Christian Brothers. What has come to my attention has caused me a great deal of concern, to say the least. In fact, Stuart Littlemore described this whole affair as `breathtakingly dishonest'. What happened was that Geoff McMullan interviewed Brother Tony Shanahan, the provincial head of the Christian Brothers. During the course of the interview, he asked him:

        put on air as being the reply to the question. What in fact
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         60 Minutes
        </emphasis>
        did was it showed Brother Shanahan being at a loss for words, frowning and having to grasp a glass of water and take a drink from the glass. That was not his response to the question. In fact, what it gave the viewer was an impression of some sort of guilt, some sort of concern by Brother Shanahan, some sort of amazement or surprise. Indeed, that was not the answer that Brother Shanahan gave. That was not his response. The wrong segment was put in as the answer and passed off dishonestly as his response to that question. Of course, that misled any viewer who would be looking at that.

        I also wish to refer to the question of these so&amp;hyphen;called unexplained deaths that were raised by the program. Brother Shanahan mentioned, in a letter dated 4 September 1996:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is perhaps significant that no other mainstream media have seen fit to pick up these stories over the last few years. They refer to four students who are buried at Bindoon and one who died in a fall at Tardun in 1949. Two of the students buried at Bindoon died in road accidents after they had left Bindoon and were brought back there for burial. The other two died in accidents, one falling under the wheel of a cart on the farm, and the other striking his head on the stairs as he fell from a balustrade down which he was sliding. The lad at Tardun was a sleep walker and was discovered one morning below an open verandah on the first floor where he slept, with other students. It is presumed that he walked over the edge of the balcony in his sleep and was killed in the fall.

         —I rise this evening to speak in relation to an enterprise agreement which has been recently ratified by the enterprise commissioner in the state of Tasmania. The enterprise agreement relates to a number of businesses and is known as the Margate bakery enterprise agreement. This is one of a number of agreements which have been approved under the Tasmanian industrial relations system which operate to reduce the conditions and wages of employment of future employees, not those employees who are party to the making of the agreement.

        I make the point that with agreements such as this, future employees have no recourse at law in relation to the signing away of their rights to wages and conditions otherwise prescribed by awards by employees who are not so affected. However, in this case, there was a very grave question raised with regard to the fairness of the bargaining process which took place with the making of this particular enterprise agreement which applies to three baking establishments in southern Tasmania.

        The agreement was drafted by a representative of the employer who was employed by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and presented to the employees.

Subsequent to that meeting and during the process of a ballot of employees which was properly conducted in other respects, a representative of the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union sought to have distributed to employees a one page document which set out some of their rights and inviting them, if they had any questions on any matters, to contact the union.

        It is uncontested—and this matter has been raised before the enterprise commissioner and in correspondence that I am in possession of—that a representative of the employer advised the employee who received those documents to tear them up and throw them in the bin. The employer was concerned on the one hand to have the employer's view made clear to the employees but when there was an alternative view, albeit a one page document which was prepared by an official of the union, that was not to be seen by the employees. I suggest that in those circumstances there is a very questionable practice of fairness being followed by the employer.

        In a response to that, the letter from the young man's mother, which I have tabled, says, amongst other things, that the letter had been sent to the minister because he was the minister responsible for the act under which the agreement was being reached. In reference to that letter—and I strongly urge senators to have a close look at these papers—it is clear that the young man's mother, Mrs Lincolne, is not an opponent to enterprise bargaining but rather an opponent to the unfair way in which this agreement was reached. It is a very considered letter and I strongly urge senators to have regard to it. This is, in my opinion, a very unfortunate set of circumstances.

In a somewhat gratuitous comment he referred to failed union officials on this side of the Senate.

       (1) The role of regional universities in providing access for rural and regionally based students has been recognised by the Government in its Budget package. All publicly funded higher education institutions, including those in regional Australia, will have time to plan and adapt as the reduction to grants has been deliberately timed to fit university planning timeframes.
