        The Petition of the undersigned draws the Senate's attention to our serious concerns at the Government's announced funding cuts to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and in particular the impact these cuts will have on the maintenance of ABC services to regional Australia. We are of the view that the loss of $65 million in funds will decimate the ABC and force it to commercialise by seeking corporate sponsors. This in turn will destroy its independence and quality.

        —by leave—On Monday I asked the Australian Democrats a question in relation to their Internet page and in it indicated that I did not believe we had received any communications that had their source from that Internet page. Perhaps I will make that a bit clearer, Madam President. The Democrats' Internet page indicates in a number of areas that, if you want to send a protest, you should click on a particular word on the screen and the protest will be sent.

       I raised a concern that we had not received the protests and asked whether what the Democrats were in fact doing was using the Internet to improperly collect issue based mailing lists. Having raised that question in the Senate, I took the opportunity of raising the matter with Senator Kernot later that night, because I think privacy principles and the use of the Internet are a genuine matter of concern to everybody. She indicated to me, not in these precise words, that this was not a matter that she had direct knowledge of, but that she would investigate the matter. And she did, promptly.

       She sent me a letter yesterday before question time  indicating that she believed we had received some messages from an Internet page—if I can be forgiven for being uncharitable, a peculiarly small number of messages. I then took the opportunity to go back to my department and say my office had been advised by the Democrats that they had sent something. A further search was done and the

        Madam President, the second measure contained in the bill deals with the treatment of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds.

        Before March 1993, compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets were exempt from the social security income and assets tests until age pension age. From March 1993, all superannuation benefits held in superannuation or rollover funds have been exempted from these tests until age pension age. This initiative involved estimated additional outlays of $4.1m in 1992&amp;hyphen;93, increasing to $17.1m in 1995&amp;hyphen;96.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given that superannuation savings are generally not subject to compulsory preservation after a person reaches the age of 55 and retires, people in these circumstances (including people who may not wish to retire but who have poor prospects of returning to work) can access their superannuation savings if they choose to do so. Consistent with the treatment of other savings, the Government considers that a person's superannuation savings should be taken into account in working out how much income support can be paid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, from 20 September 1997, the assets test exemption of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds by social security pensioners and allowees under age pension age will be removed for people aged between 55 and age pension age after 39 weeks on income support since turning 55. For income test purposes, affected customers' superannuation and rollover assets will be added to their other financial assets and assessed under extended deeming rules.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The anticipated savings from this measure are much greater than the estimated costs of the 1993 initiative. One reason why the latter estimated costs are significantly smaller is because they reflected only the additional costs of exempting non&amp;hyphen;compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets from the social security assets and income tests until age pension age. However, a significant reason for the difference is because of the extent to which customers who are effectively retired, invested in superannuation and rollover funds as a means of avoiding the operation of the assets and income tests.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Neither the assets nor income test treatment of annuities and pensions, including allocated annuities and pensions, will change. These products will continue to be assessed under existing rules. This situation is, however, presently under review.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Madam President, the Government is committed to ensuring that social security customers receive their rightful entitlement. At the same time, the Government considers that the Australian taxpayer has a right to expect that the Government will do all it can to minimise the scope for overpayments.
       </para>

        Overpayments often arise during holiday periods such as Easter when social security allowance payments are programmed in advance to be paid automatically on predetermined days that are earlier

        The constitutional framework within which a nation goes forward into the future is crucial to its welfare. Australia's constitutional development is always in process, perhaps in most dramatic form through the decisions of the High Court. It is essential that the constitutional development of the nation is anticipated by the various parliaments around Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the developments that has been going on for some time is the growth of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         national schemes of legislation. It is a process that will become more and more pronounced as time goes by. National schemes of legislation are schemes like the Corporations Law which guides the way our companies and securities are controlled throughout Australia. Legislation with respect to these schemes is passed in the various states and territories and at the Commonwealth level. Such legislation guides the way we go about our corporate business.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another uniform scheme is the censorship scheme which controls the censorship of various material in Australia. Another scheme is the consumer credit code. That is an interesting scheme in the sense that the Commonwealth is not part of it but the states and territories are. This is an illustration of the growth of common schemes throughout this nation. They can only become common legislative schemes when they are agreed to by the governments of various states and territories or the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Ministers or heads of state come together at SCAG, the Standing Committee of Attorneys&amp;hyphen;General, or COAG, the Council of Australian Governments, and agree upon a common legislative scheme that is for the good of Australia. That is a good process. We do not cavil with that. The effect is that once ministers gather around and come to an agreement on a common piece of legislation it is then a problem whether the parliament can have a sufficient say in the standard and status of that legislation and the way that legislation has been brought forward. The particular concern that the scrutiny committees have is that there might be in that legislation, innocently of course, provisions which take away from human rights and human liberties.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no effective way for the various parliaments around Australia to look at the common legislation which has been agreed to by the ministers. The ministers do not want what has been agreed to unravelled. If it is unravelled months and perhaps years of work will be lost. They want the legislation to stay as it is. They are concerned that parliament would undo the bill before it becomes an act. The various scrutiny committees around
        <break page="4212" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Australia have attempted to develop a scheme whereby members of parliament can have an effective say in the making of this common legislation or, once it is made, to have an effective say in how it goes through parliament in the same way they would if legislation discrete to their individual parliaments was processed.

It is an important matter. As a committee we hope that some productive ideas are advanced.

         —Yesterday I talked about the particular impact that the deregulation of the labour market would have on women and that proposed deregulation, as indicated in the bill, would disproportionately affect women. I was backed up in my comments by a book that had been prepared which looked specifically at this issue. It states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Because women have generally relied more heavily on legislation to protect them from the adverse effects of the market, labour market regulations have been necessary to remedy market failures and distortions which are likely to affect women more than men.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Removal of such regulations, especially those dealing with labour market discrimination, could leave women exposed to important disadvantages. They would be subject to unequal hiring and promotion standards, unequal opportunities for training and retraining, unequal opportunity for occupational mobility, unequal pay for equal work and/or unequal likelihood of being retrenched.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The danger is that deregulation sanctions and encourages bad practices. The weakening of the protective framework and institutional safeguards may very well open the floodgates for more serious exploitation with no guarantee that standards will be reinstated by employers of their own accord even in the long term.

        I think that quote is very relevant to this debate. I remind honourable senators that this comes against the background that I mentioned yesterday of John Bradford, a member of the coalition, calling for the abolition of the Affirmative Action Agency, not to mention the ministry for the status of women.

         community—a change of practice. But not all women have yet benefited from these changes of attitudes and changes of practices. We cannot assume that just because there have been so many changes—with women participating much more in the workplace, being involved in non&amp;hyphen;traditional areas of the workplace—it is a trend that will continue unless there are protective mechanisms in place. Those protective mechanisms include the Affirmative Action Agency and, certainly, the Industrial Relations Commission maintaining its watching brief over award conditions.

        In the time remaining, I would like to address a particularly good submission by the National Pay Equity Coalition to a Senate committee. Not only did it have an excellent submission—I will come to the executive summary in a moment—but I will later seek leave to incorporate or table its bibliography, because it contains 37 articles and reports, seven wage cases and five Australian Bureau of Statistics publications. It is a very useful reference.

         The National Pay Equity Coalition's submission raises serious concerns about the likely impact of the proposed new industrial relations bill on women workers.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The book draws on a wealth of research—which is why I will seek leave to incorporate the bibliography—which shows that, the more deregulated the labour market, the more women are disadvantaged. In the last decade there has been a significant shift in the industrial relations system from national wage cases and conditions regulated by awards to one where more and more decisions affecting people's working lives are determined by their bargaining power at workplace level. The proposed system, the National Pay Equity Coalition argues, is not deregulation but reregulation, and reregulation in the interests of employers. It is cloaked in rhetoric about choice and freedom for women but under the proposed bill women will be less able to access their rights, less able to protect their existing entitlements and less able to improve their labour market position.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The National Pay Equity Coalition, after it had participated in its presentation to the Senate committee and had had some consultations with minister Peter Reith, wrote again to
        <break page="4214" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         me and, I am sure, to other senators. It made the point that, notwithstanding some of the clarifications the minister had made, it still remained concerned about these issues:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We believe that the legislation will widen the pay equity gap.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present the ratio of women's earnings to men's earnings, the hourly rate, stands at 83.3 per cent. In spite of this evidence of structural inequality in the work force, the draft legislation substantially reduces the pay equity provisions of the Industrial Relations Act of 1988 by restricting provisions to equal pay rather than equal remuneration. This means that the over-award rates and conditions are not subject to equal pay provisions. That has not been emphasised enough in debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I see that my colleague Senator Rosemary Crowley has just come into the chamber. I am sure she will be pursuing this issue because, although many honourable senators on this side of the chamber have raised it, it has not been an issue that the government has wanted to debate publicly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no evidence to suggest that a deregulated industrial relations system will contribute to improving the labour market position of women. To the contrary—both domestic and overseas research proves that a substantial loss of pay equity occurs with a movement to enterprise and individualised bargaining systems. On this point it is important to note that the highest pay equity ratio achieved by women in Australia, 84.6 per cent, was prior to the onset of enterprise bargaining.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The patterns of enterprise bargaining that have taken place reveal that a significant number of agreements exclude women and that women are more likely than men to be covered by agreements that provided for an increase in working hours. Despite this evidence, the legislation does not provide for scrutiny of the proposed Australian workplace agreements through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that women are not disadvantaged in the process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is substantial evidence to prove that women will be disadvantaged by the restriction on the ambit of awards. At present the minimum requirements for awards excluded a number of areas—I detailed them earlier in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         my speech—which have a key impact on working women.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The changes proposed by the government will have a serious effect on all workers, but particularly on women workers. I reiterate them: weakening the power of the Industrial Relations Commission to set employment conditions and to vet workplace agreements, both of which changes seriously limit the commission's capacity to protect those most in need and particularly women; and reducing the coverage of awards to a bare minimum of conditions, which means that women will lose important protections relating to hours of work, including the operation of part-time work, meal and clothing provisions, sexual harassment and equal opportunity procedures and conditions above the standards such as paid maternity leave.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Jocelyn Newman, has been outspoken in a number of areas of importance to women, and I commend her for that, but has not been vocal on this issue. I wonder to what extent she was consulted. Finally, removing the commission's powers to deal with discriminatory over-award payments, which remain a key component in women's battle to achieve equal pay in practice, will put the onus on individual workers to make complaints about discriminatory or otherwise unlawful agreements. That puts the worker in the position of having to prove that discrimination and prove that disadvantage.

         —For the record, I am not listed to speak at this time. Senator Reynolds said that she felt sure that I would want to reiterate all that she said, and indeed I do. I thank her for her contribution to this debate. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is, as the government has made clear, an absolutely pivotal part of its policies. That is why the Labor opposition is so strenuous in fighting it.

         This pivotal legislation makes clear the government's view about a whole lot of things—in particular, their view of how the world ought to be. They have introduced into this community a budget that is without any doubt a Thatcher&amp;hyphen;Tory budget. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is exactly in sync with that. It is legislation that is ideologically driven. It is a bill designed to reduce the power and the rights of workers. It fits absolutely with the changes in the budget that do away with many services and hard won gains for many people in the community.

         Prime Minister Howard promised that he would have a country that will be comfortable and relaxed. Under this bill, most workers would certainly cease to be relaxed, and many of them would be much less comfortable, even in terms of `comfortable' meaning `reasonably paid'.

         The other important thing about this piece of legislation is that it will not create one new job. It will do nothing to help the unemployed, and this government does not put a figure on the number of unemployed. It cannot do that because it has policies that have already seen an increase in the number of unemployed, such as direct cutbacks in the Public Service, but also policies that are quite clearly intent on seeing the unemployed figures rise—hence no commitment to any estimate of getting the numbers down. At least Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in a moment of forgetful honesty, said that if they do not get the figures down they will not be re&amp;hyphen;elected. But even she baulked at putting a figure on it.

         The legislation has a goal of cooperative workplace relations.

         It will do away with many of the things that the workers and the union movement have fought for for 100 years. It will remove equal pay provisions and the award protection for part&amp;hyphen;time and casual workers, most of whom are women. Indeed, I am very pleased to follow my colleague Senator Reynolds because this legislation is very damaging to women workers in particular. When you put that with this government's policies of increasing the costs of child care, despite earnest promises that they would not, and if you put it with their policies to have a modest tax benefit for families where one spouse is at home—usually the woman—you see a package of policy, secret not overt, in which this government would like to see women out of the work force and back into the home.

         I noted over the weekend that there was an article by Geoffrey Blainey saying that the decade of the century was the decade of the 40s. Certainly, if you have to have a decade that encompasses the Second World War, it is not without significance. As I read it, one of the points that Professor Blainey wanted to make about the significance of the 1940s—and maybe the article did not do full justice to him—was that, despite all those men who returned to Australia, all those people out of the forces coming back to Australia, some hundreds of thousands, there was no loss of employment; they were just absorbed into the work force and `Wasn't that fantastic!'

          Yes, indeed, Professor Blainey, but did you count what happened to the women? The reason that so many men went into the work force was because so many women came out of it, and I am surprised that a historian of Professor Blainey's standing did not actually make that point. How do you measure unemployment? How do you measure full employment if you are not talking about labour force participation and if you are not talking about the huge contribution of women to the work force in this country during the war—if you are not talking about large numbers of the jobs being taken by men after the women were removed back to the home? That is what is on the agenda again.

          Sometimes we talk about Mr Howard taking us back to the 1960s. Personally, I think we should go back to the 1950s and, after reading that article by Professor Blainey, I believe that, no, it is right back to the 1940s. `A woman's place is in the home' is certainly the view of a large number of the government, particularly those in the Lyons Forum. And we were assisted in our thinking about what they have to say by the Queensland member, Mr Bradford, who has come out in the press over the weekend saying that we should abolish the Affirmative Action Agency and the Office of the Status of Women because women are too advantaged in this country and men are disadvantaged. There is another example of very conservative thinking hauling us back into the past, and here is this piece of legislation that is making its contribution to exactly that.

Well, Senator Patterson, I am sure that there are situations like that in Australia, but come with me to the small businesses and the big businesses around Australia that are closed shops to anyone who smells of a union. How dare you suggest that there is only fault in one direction. There are thousands of people who cannot get near employment if they have a union card. There are closed shops absolutely preventing and proscribing anybody from a union—even a worker who is a member of a union—from coming into that workplace let alone giving the opportunity for union representatives to visit those workers.

             are quite right. Every time it says `you' the record should note that it should be `Senator Patterson'—who proposed this quite curious argument that there are closed shops, that this is a bad thing and that the coalition's industrial relations legislation change, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, is somehow going to free up workplaces from being closed shops. If you can give us a guarantee that the closed shops that will not let a non-unionised person in will be equally matched by closed shops that will not let anybody who has a union card in, that might be a gain. But we know you do not mean that.

           The next point that Senator Patterson made in her contribution was to use that very disappointing argument: nobody in the Labor Party has ever been in a small business; therefore, they cannot talk about it because they do not know what they are talking about. As a doctor, I have often thought that argument would mean that I could never talk about the pain of a broken leg, having not had one myself. It is a nonsense argument and Senator Patterson knows that.

           She went on to illustrate the point by saying that nobody on the Labor side should talk about small business because none of them is in them and they do not know what they are talking about. She then went on to talk at great length about the evils of unions, about which she knows nothing, of which she has never been a member and about which she has, in the past, made points about how she would not be a unionist. If Senator Patterson wants to argue that we cannot talk about small businesses because none of us has experienced them—and I would not test the facts of that statement—then strictly, according to her own logic, she cannot talk about unions because she has no knowledge of them.

           Senator Patterson can make her points about unions and, equally, the Labor Party can make its points about small business. What the Labor Party did with its previous legislation was to move towards enterprise agreements and freeing up the labour market, freeing up opportunities in the workplace and encouraging small business as well as large

The coalition failed to address it, even though that would have been of great benefit to small business. It depends on the size of the small business—and, having looked at all your share dealings over the last day or so, it seems that many of you travel very closely with very large business indeed. That is a spurious argument of Senator Patterson and I sincerely hope she does not use it again.

           The next person I want to take issue with is Senator Troeth who actually argued that what we were suggesting in debate was that women would be incapable of making or negotiating an agreement for themselves. That is about as stupid a remark as it is offensive from Senator Troeth. Women are very capable, in certain circumstances, of negotiating agreements. It was Senator Troeth and her colleagues on the other side who regularly got stuck into the Labor government, complaining that women would be disadvantaged in all sorts of situations if they had to, for example, return to the work force after some years out of the work force.

           Those opposite also seem to contradict themselves entirely if you consider the case of a 16-, 17- or 18-year-old young woman going for her first employment after leaving school. What is her capacity to satisfactorily and on her own negotiate an agreement when she no longer has the protection of an award? Where does she go? Does she ring up somebody and say, `I'm going off for my first job interview; I need to know the legislative requirements and the terms of the possible agreement that I can negotiate?' Most young people going for work are desperate for a job, will settle for what is offered to them and will certainly not be in a position to bargain on their own behalf. You know and have argued in this place, as I have, the difficulties facing women returning to the work force after years out of it. They are people who are not fully confident and not people who, with all the assurance, can go in and negotiate a fair agreement for themselves.

         That is an example of what is happening now. If this bill were to pass into law, that is what would happen in practice. That is not in Australia's interest.

         I just think there is a real case for some truth in advertising or truth in politics about what really is at play rather than what people claim to be at play. This bill is predicated on a number of principles. They are that it will uphold the rights of individuals, that it will encourage greater productivity, that it will streamline dispute settlement and that it will be in the national good. Those who wrought this legislation and explain it use those principles and invoke the majesty of those ideals as their defence. The trouble is it does not deliver on any of them and while this bill is called reform one could hardly call something reform when it makes the situation worse. While it is continually bruited abroad as reform, people think it may have elements of good.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I wish I could find some elements of good so I could balance my remarks from a considered point of view and say, `On one hand there are all these bad things but there are some elements of good.' That would be a reasonable position to take. I cannot find those elements of good in this legislation to try to find a balanced position. I am therefore put in a position of having no alternative but to reject the legislation. The truth of this legislation does not fit the facts and so those who have promoted it have decided that the facts are expendable.

         Let me go to the details so I do not just say that as rhetoric. It is said that this bill will introduce greater wage flexibility. In fact, that is true. Greater wage flexibility will be introduced by this bill, but it will be flexibility for wages to fall, not rise. There might be occasions on which some wages for workers in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          very strong bargaining positions, in key positions of the production process, are able to use their bargaining power to lift wages. But for the vast majority of Australians, this bill means that the flexibility that is bruited abroad and claimed as a key feature of this bill is the flexibility for wage cuts, not wage increases or greater recognition of productivity.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is said that this bill will introduce greater choice for individuals and, therefore, on the basis of freedom of choice this bill should pass. That choice takes the form that you can choose an award or a contract or an individual contract. The fact is that those words are meaningless and superficial. They are used because they have an appeal and seemingly embody a good ideal. But the truth is that you cannot consider choice without considering the bargaining strengths of the participants in the process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last week we saw a key example of what bargaining strength looks like. We saw an advertisement for 40 apprentices in Newcastle—and 1,900 people applied for those jobs. For the individual choice argument to hold, any one of those 1,900 people who are trying to obtain employment as an apprentice has to be assumed to have equal bargaining power with the employer who will engage them. They can then stand up for their rights and demand higher wages if they believe their productivity and contribution to the workplace justify it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Can anyone seriously comprehend that any of those young people seeking the job of an apprentice—the 1,900 of them—has an equal bargaining position with their employer in those circumstances? That is an extraordinary proposition yet we are told that this is a freedom of choice. The assumption is, therefore, that all of those 1,900 young people are free to make a choice. In reality the free choice they are entitled to make in these circumstances—the only one they have open to them—is a choice of accepting what is offered or accepting unemployment; and that is no choice at all. When we hear those words `greater freedom of choice' one has to bear that in mind.

          We also know that not all employers are going to be unscrupulous. There are many employers in this country who are committed to achieving a good outcome for their workers. The problem for those employers is that they are undermined by this bill too, because if they are in competition with employers who are unscrupulous and who will drive down wages and exploit workers, and produce a product or a service at the end of the day because of that exploitation, which is cheaper than the employers who want to do the right thing by their work force, the good employers go out of business and the bad employers succeed. They succeed because they have exploited their workers and cut their wages. They have reduced their costs and made a bigger profit; and they have driven their competition off the block. When one talks about flexibility and greater choice one has to bear that in mind.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We are told that this bill will ensure that third parties do not interfere in the bargaining process. The third party, unspoken but malevolently referred to here, is of course a union. A union exists to protect and represent the interests of its members and not to do it individually so much as as a collective. If that body is unable to speak in this bargaining process, the bargaining power of which I spoke a moment ago is unequal. If all of those 1,900 apprentices who applied for the 40 positions in Newcastle last week were represented by a common bargaining agent, namely their union, and it could negotiate a reasonable wage all of them would be competing equally for those 40 positions, knowing that the wages and working conditions were not a factor.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If you remove that union from the equation, those people are competing on their merit as potential employees as well as bargaining away their rights and reducing their cost. That is a key case of exploitation. So when we hear this argument about third parties not interfering, that means we are shifting the bargaining strengths away from the two parties being in balance to one in which one party is predominant and the other is open to exploitation. Workers in those situations have limited choices.

           It is said of this legislation that it will allow unions to compete for members—but compete with whom? It will mean competing with their employers as this legislation is set out because if it is true—as it is—that the clarion cry of unions is `Unity is strength; together we can bargain' then the clarion cry for unscrupulous employers is `Divide and conquer.' That means that the so&amp;hyphen;called competition for members, which sounds on the face of it to be a reasonable thing to do, means that you undermine the strength of unions by dividing and conquering them, and by separating out the members individually and dealing with them away from the collective and away from their common good. Thus, you again succeed in the goal of reducing wages.

           It is said of this bill that Australia will become a more productive nation and will focus on productivity, and that that will be a good thing. It is a good thing to focus on productivity. Historically, in labour productivity and capital productivity, this nation enjoyed record rates of productivity growth under the previous government. By international comparisons within its peer group economies of the OECD, Australia's productivity growth has been growing much faster than that of many other countries. So what is the problem? The problem is that this is claimed to be an increase in productivity by making people work harder—not by making people work smarter, not by being better trained and skilled and thus better able to work the complex and sophisticated plant and equipment to deliver high quality services, but, rather, by working faster and harder as in the concept of the old days of the industrial revolution. That is stupid.

           The argument here is that it does not matter how poor or lacking in strength you are; if there is a process of arbitration, the merit of your case and your claim can be determined.

            I said that in the 1890s Australia went through an upheaval in its industrial relations system. It did. The outcry that rang across the nation then was `There must be a better way. We can't be continually racked with the major disputes that go on endlessly with no possibility of resolution and with the bitterness of their aftermath that endures endlessly. We can't do that.' Australia then created the system of arbitration. That has evolved over time. It is predictable, understandable and is what Australians know as the way to industrial justice. That is what we are used to. It is a system that works. The old cry `If it ain't broke don't fix it' does not apply. This system ain't broke and it does not need to be thrown out and recast through this legislation.

            This system always needs improvement; it always needs to be upgraded according to the circumstances. Over time the arbitration system has been, and during the last period of the Labor government it was. It was broadened and deepened and made more flexible to meet the needs of Australia's economy moving into the global economy and reduced levels of protection in this country. It was done in a way in which it protected the rights of Australians but with a safety net protection that ensured that no&amp;hyphen;one could be exploited, while the opportunity and encouragement was there for workers to choose collective bargaining as a way of collaborating with their employers to increase the productivity of their company and, by increasing their productivity, get a greater income for that company on the basis that shareholders and management, workers and employees would share equally and fairly in the increased productivity that those that provide the investment, those that provide the managerial skills and those that provide the practical workplace skills to make a product or deliver a service participated in so the shares would be equal, no&amp;hyphen;one would

We have had a system that has served this nation well, has evolved over time, has been modified to the circumstances, has worked well, was predictable and understood, was known about and was not broken.

It is none other than a report by the Department of Industrial Relations into enterprise bargaining in Australia, the annual report in 1995, which is a voluminous document, too complex to go into now.

            Essentially, it is able to compare how many workers went into enterprise or workplace bargains at the federal level under the industrial regulation of the former government and how many and what type of bargains they went into at the state level under the Kennett government and the Court government, how those bargains operated, what the satisfaction level was and what the productivity outcomes were.
           </para>

            The unequivocal finding is that the system that we had worked; that 60 per cent of workplaces with 10 or more employees under the federal system went into those bargains, compared with hardly any, unless they were forced, at the state level; that 75 per cent of all those employees that went into those bargains expressed a high level of satisfaction; and that, from October 1991 to April 1996, 8,000 federal agreements were ratified.

             So the system is working. The arguments that we need to make a revolutionary change are not justified and the proposals here therefore should be scotched. I reject the legislation.

         —It occurred to me, when I was considering comments that had been made by various senators about workplace agreements during this debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, and the reality of those documents in the real world in terms of, for example, the points that Senator Cook has just been making in respect of young people who will not have access to the significant resources that are provided by trade unions and so on, that the reality of what will actually happen in respect of employees' real knowledge of those agreements at that level of the community could not be exemplified any better than by the current debate that we are engaged upon, which has so far claimed the scalps of two government frontbenchers. Were the rules to apply fairly, as of this day, as of this moment, it would certainly equally claim the scalps of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, and of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, without going any further through the cabinet.

        As Senator Cook and others have said, the real core of this entire operation, and we all know it, is to strike down the award system in Australia, to remove that safety net which underpins employer&amp;hyphen;employee relationships in Australia, and to substitute a free&amp;hyphen;for&amp;hyphen;all.

The repercussions, of course, of letting the marketplace rule in respect of the conditions and pay of employees who did not enjoy the same negotiating strength as the people who sit on the other side of the table from them has been well known in the past and no doubt will be revisited in the future.

        It has been very largely a product of the situation in New Zealand and, without question, in terms of the debate that led up to their election, was instrumental in bringing about the result that we have now had; that is, that this prosperity which New Zealand has enjoyed in terms of its overall economic statistics has not been enjoyed by the majority of the population in New Zealand, who have in fact been used as the pawns to produce some of that wealth, none of which they are the beneficiaries of. In fact, as the leader of the Labour Party and the potential new Prime Minister of that country has observed in the past few days, all of that national prosperity is not much good at the end of the day when people are still needing assistance to feed their families.

         point was very well made by my colleagues Senator Reynolds and Senator Crowley, who spoke a short time ago, and who talked about these one&amp;hyphen;way rules that apply in the debate on industrial relations. We on this side of the house are continually being accused of not being in business and never having had experience in small business. I am not quite sure what a doctor's surgery is if it is not a small business, but these epithets are constantly thrown across the chamber in an attempt to make a platform for saying we should therefore not discuss these issues. It does not stop the same people, who constantly give you the impression they would not sit in the same room as a union official and certainly would never join one, going forth at great length about the sins and omissions of unions.

        People go on at great length about the declining membership of unions in Australia. That is a fact of life, and it is a fact of life that the unions have to grapple with. I certainly know from first-hand experience as a workplace union delegate one of the reasons for that declining membership, but I am pleased to say that it did not happen in the small workplace that I was involved in. Nevertheless, one of my jobs was to discuss with new employees the work that the union did on their behalf, to discuss the dues that would need to be paid—whether they wanted them deducted from their salary, et cetera—and, indeed, to discuss whether they wanted to join the union at all.

        There was a reaction which I often got during those discussions. After I had explained that there was an annual round of discussions between the union that represented us in terms of our wages and conditions, after I had discussed the fact that the union was always available as a resource when employees needed it and after I had particularly discussed the wages, conditions and service that we negotiated, one question that I would be asked was, `If I don't join the

In respect of my workplace, the answer to that was, `Yes, you will—if you want to ride on the backs of the rest of us who actually provide our union dues out of our salaries in order to help you secure the wages and conditions that you get.' I am pleased to say that in all cases—certainly while I was there—that was an argument that won the day, and there was a 100 per cent union membership in that workplace.

        There is no question that there are a lot of workers who are quite happy to accept the benefits—and they are significant—that the resources of an organised and professional union can bring to a workplace without having to endure the obligation of paying the dues.

        Other speakers have canvassed a whole range of issues to do with this debate which I will not go over again. I want to highlight one potential negative result for workers if this legislation is carried through this house. This legislation will have an extremely detrimental effect on workers in the part of the world where I come from and, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds—if I may be forgiven for addressing the chair directly—where you come from, that is, in the more remote and regional locations of Australia.

        None of the conditions that workers have had unions fight for and achieve over many years and that are provided for them in northern Australia will be protected if this legislation passes through the Senate in the way it is currently drafted. The conditions will be all up for grabs and will be all, potentially, dumped. There is no question at all, considering the track record of the negotiations that I am very familiar with in northern Australia, that the first reaction of many employers will be to dump the conditions and the enterprise agreements in this brave new world.

         What we are talking about are things like the district allowance, accommodation assistance and airconditioning subsidies that are provided in remote locations in northern Australia, where climatic conditions, I con fess, are very stressful at certain times of the year. We are also talking about the annual recreation leave air fares that are provided as part of awards and the additional recreation leave, which we have had in the Northern Territory for as long as I can remember. All of those additional benefits to workers will be up for grabs. Also, there are the fares out of isolated localities for specified purposes—that is for medical, dental and specialist treatment or on compassionate grounds—which are also commonplace. None of those will be protected if this legislation passes through the Senate as it is currently drafted.

        I have received just in the last week letters from territorians who have been in the position of having to utilise these additional benefits for medical treatment. I am actually talking about real people—not the Wright family; the manufactured, fictional family of Senator Vanstone. I am actually talking about real people with real experiences who have only recently been alerted to what might happen. I might add that they have been alerted by the activities of the Community and Public Sector Union in the Northern Territory, by the submissions that were given to the Senate committee which sat in Darwin and by the publicity that ensued.

        I received these shock, horror letters from people—and this is the way it happens in the real world—who suddenly realised for the first time that none of these conditions which were part of their awards would be guaranteed under this new legislation. One letter described in graphic detail the serious problems that one family would have been in had they not been able to exercise the condition they had for getting an air fare out of the Northern Territory in a medical emergency. Due to our small population we do not enjoy a number of specialist services—such as oncology, for example—that the more popular centres of Australia have. Those additional benefits can be fully justified and, in the past, they have been justified and approved by the Industrial Relations Commission as a result of the hard work that the unions have done collectively on behalf of us all in the Northern Territory.

Just to give honourable senators who may be interested an idea—probably in most cases I think they would be completely unaware that these things exist—of just how far-flung these effects will be, I want to make the point that these remote locality benefits are not confined to the Northern Territory. A number of them are linked to areas of Australia that qualify for district allowance, and that is how the link is made in the awards.

These places include Broken Hill, Burke, Cobar, Coonamble, Moree, Narrabri and Walgett—all of which are in the more remote regions of the state of New South Wales. It also includes places like Atherton, Ingham, Innisfail, Mareeba, Roma, Sandy Cape, Townsville, Tully, Charters Towers, Charleville, Cairns, Bowen, Biloela and Ayr—all in Queensland. They all have award conditions, none of which are protected by this legislation. Other areas include Ceduna in South Australia, Queenstown in Tasmania, and Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse in Victoria. It is getting harder to find remote locations in Victoria but, nevertheless, they are still there. Of course, there is a long list in Western Australia, as you would expect, Madam Acting Deputy President. All of these places have significant additional provisions in their awards, none of which are protected.

         I will give the Senate an example of the airconditioning subsidy that is provided as part of awards. Let me tell the Senate it is a significant expense if you live in the north. Again, there is a long list of communities in Western Australia that receive this subsidy, including Broome, Carnarvon, Dampier, Derby, Exmouth, Halls Creek, Karratha, Kununurra, Port Hedland and so on. It also applies to many localities in the Northern Territory and in Queensland. There is also a whole range of localities that currently enjoy additional leave. All of these areas are con tained in the evidence before the Senate committee inquiring into this matter. That is why I do not need to go into it any further in here.

        As I said before, the reason I wanted to raise this particular aspect that has not been canvassed before in this debate is that, when you consider the very large number of remote localities in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, I would put a very large sum of money indeed on the fact that the majority of senators in here—certainly on the government benches—would be completely unaware that so many workers in their electorates are going to be potentially disadvantaged by the lack of protection of these conditions. I am sure that I would win that bet.

I did pay the $5 to Senator Faulkner.

        But I was so encouraged by the investment that the following day I had a standing bet with Senator Faulkner as a job lot covering the entire ministry, including parliamentary secretaries, at $5 a head and lost another $5 on the following day. I have now paid to Senator Faulkner the $10 that I owe him. I think it is an extremely good investment in terms of the good governance of Australia at $5 a head. I am doing rather well. I am prepared to place a large bet—and I think I would win—that very few senators and I might say many government members that represent these areas in the House of Representatives would be totally unaware that the legislation that they are so enthusiastically pushing through this parliament will so severely disadvantage the workers in their regions.

        They noted that the economic results in New Zealand, `taken in isolation', may be regarded as impressive, but to favourably compare the New Zealand economic reform path with that of the previous Labor Australian government is premature, based on the

       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, New Zealand's better growth performance appears to be due more to a more rapid accumulation of raw factors of production (capital and labour) rather than to relative improvements in resource utilisation or in the quality of human capital.

        Secondly, much of New Zealand's recent strong economic growth can be attributed to temporary factors.

        These experts claim, quite rightly, that a lot of New Zealand's recent growth is merely a catch&amp;hyphen;up period. New Zealand's economy performed so poorly in the 1980s that a period of improvement was inevitable and this cannot be  attributed to the New Zealand process of economic reform. The third and most telling point is:

        This bill, like the New Zealand employment act, the keystone of their reform package, is a short&amp;hyphen;sighted or visionless quick fix. It is about providing a pool of cheap labour. It is about increasing profit for a few—and at whose expense? It can be shown that some New Zealanders have benefited significantly during the period of short&amp;hyphen;term economic recovery—at the top end, might I say, similar to the United States.

        During the Senate hearings, we heard evidence on how the Employment Contract Act has been working and why it was introduced in New Zealand. Tony Short, from the school of law of the University of South Australia, told the committee he spoke to the

         New Zealand minister for labour at a conference in 1990. When he asked the minister what arguments persuaded him that this industrial reform was the way New Zealand could go, the minister simply could not answer the question.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question was then answered by the chief executive officer of the employers federation, who basically said, `Our members wanted it.' That was the primary reason for the legislation. They wanted the legislation for a reason: because it provides a pool of labour which is cheap, a pool of labour which they can exploit in a relatively unfettered way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is clear that this legislation was introduced purely for ideological reasons, not for the benefit of average New Zealanders. Let us look at what it has `achieved'—I say somewhat facetiously—for the workers of New Zealand. I would enlighten senators as to some of the practices taking place in New Zealand, again from evidence given to the Senate hearing. A local supermarket hired children for weekend and evening work. They were paid from $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for that work. Is that what we want to happen in Australia? I and those on this side of the chamber do not want that to happen.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Tony Short gave an example of an employer on New Zealand's South Island, a Mr Schwartzberg ,who inserted a clause in the contract for his employees which stated that employees have to go to the bathroom in their own time. I am not sure how you would measure that. It is unbelievable, but true.

        Nobody seems to dispute that the deregulation of the labour market has seen real wages fail to keep up with inflation. For the vast majority of employees in New Zealand, the Employment Contracts Act has been a failure. The Employment Contracts Act has created a new class—the working poor. Is this the path we want Australia to take? I hope not. This is the path this bill is leading us down.

        I would like to remind senators of a statement made by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Mr Howard said that the current award system will remain in place and be available for all workers.

        This bill does not give workers the right to choose a current award and it clearly gives primacy to Australian workplace agreements over awards. You may ask what workplace agreements will give workers. I will tell you—uncertainty in wages, uncertainty in working hours, an imbalance in bargaining power and the threat of `no sign, no start'. They will not get the choice that the coalition bleats on about.

        Let us look at some very real examples of what could and would happen if the coalition is successful with this bill. A year 12 student who worked as a casual shop assistant told the Senate committee:

        . . . I went in to work one day to find that my name was not on the roster.

       <para>
        Upon reflection, this young woman changed her mind and indicated that she wanted that agreement cancelled. This act resulted in her being taken off the roster and receiving no hours whatsoever. She now has no job and no money. Another case—and this person contacted my office—is that of a person who is a qualified mechanic with 10 years experience.

        It is clear there is no choice for employees whose employers require them to sign a workplace agreement as a precondition on being offered a job. Unfortunately, these cases—and I can assure you that there are too many like this—clearly show that the government's proposal that workplace agreements can be entered into before employment commences can only lead to intimidation of workers, diminution of wages and exploitation of workers. The signing of an agreement before you get the job is a very real concern for workers. The only choice this gives them is take what you are offered or remain unemployed. This is the government's idea of choice. This is the level playing field the government has been talking about.

        This government seems very keen on employees signing employment contracts before they are offered a job. Why? It is leave workers with little bargaining power and out on their own without the protection of an award or a union. The only reason workplace agreements are elevated in status is so that individual arrangements are accorded supremacy over awards and primacy over any other sort of legislation, including state legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The emphasis of this bill is to take what little bargaining power workers may have through the process of collective bargaining and give it as a thank you for their support to those who already possess considerable power over workers in this nation. This government would like to see an end to collective bargaining and an end to the protection of workers through the award system. This bill in its present form will clearly allow unscrupulous employers to design workplace agreements which will remove the fair terms and conditions which workers in this country have fought long and hard for.

        I will give a case in point. In Western Australia, under similar legislation, an employee had an agreement that said he had five days sick leave. The minimum conditions are 10 days sick leave. How could this agreement be registered? How could this agreement be valid? The employee's union wrote to the Western Australia Commissioner of Workplace Agreements, and the reply was:

       <para>
        With workplace agreements accorded these secrecy provisions, how can unions represent the interests of their members? How can workers ensure that they are actually getting a fair deal? These secrecy provisions are only in place to ensure that the erosion of workers' wages and conditions are kept hidden, are kept secret, so people do not know what is going on.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Another way this government has devised to further isolate workers and deprive them of bargaining power is this bill's right of entry provisions. In their submission to the Senate references committee on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the International Centre for Trade Union Rights set out a number of fundamental objections to the bill's implementation. Objections to this bill put forward by the centre concerned the breaches of international law that this bill will entail, particularly in relation to the right to strike, the undermining of the organisational autonomy of trade unions, and the dismantling of trade union structures and the right of entry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to the right of entry, the International Centre for Trade Union Rights submitted to the Senate committee that `the provisions relating to right of entry are clearly and directly in breach of international law'. The
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         majority of the Senate committee agreed that there is strong evidence to support this objection.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under the current situation, right of entry gives the union official the right to enter workplaces for the purpose of ensuring that workplace award obligations are followed. This right is fundamental to a union's ability to protect its members' interests, ensure compliance with workplace awards and maintain contact with its members. In relation to the union's right of entry, the majority of the Senate committee conclude:
       </para>

        Basically, it is bad business, apart from anything else. The majority of the committee also said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This compliance function will be severely curtailed by the proposed need for a written invitation, and a proposed requirement that this invitation or a certificate obtained in lieu be shown to the employer. These limitations seem burdensome and bureaucratic, and could permit intimidation of employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is putting it mildly. Clearly, the threat posed by this bill to employees is the very real possibility of workplace intimidation by some employers—not all employers, probably not a majority of employers, but there is a proportion out there who will use it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition's proposal limits the right of entry in number of ways. It can only be exercised where one or more employees who are members of the union invite it to enter the workplace—therefore clearly allowing for identification of the employee. This will lead to workers being too scared to talk their unions about breaches, too scared to talk to anybody—their fellow workers—about breaches.

If this bill had gone to the correct committee, if it had gone to the legislation committee, Senator Sherry would not have had to be put on this committee to replace another senator. Senator Sherry would have been a member of this committee as a member of the legislation committee, and so would Senator Cook. Many would not have had to be replaced. There is a suggestion that Senator Sherry was desperate to be on this hearing and reference was made as to how important it was that the shadow minister was on the inquiry. Let me say that in my time in this place shadow ministers have rarely been on committees. For Senator Collins to use the example that a shadow minister was needed—and the shadow minister then cleared out for two weeks—I am afraid is drawing a very long bow.

          It seems extraordinary to me that, in the face of evidence that women are still not treated equally in the workplace, this government sees fit to further undermine the quest for women to be treated equally and to have their work and talents equally recognised. Currently, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has the power to make orders to ensure there is equal remuneration for women in straightforward wages or in over&amp;hyphen;award payments. The fact is that women will be seriously affected by the repeal of this power. The present situation where women receive only 85 per cent of wages received by men will slip further and further as time passes and as their over&amp;hyphen;award payments are not kept equal to those of men.

Further, there is some debate that their orders are not enforceable.

There are many things that I would have liked to have spoken about in this debate, but for reasons which I will mention briefly I have been asked to curtail my remarks quite considerably, as have all of those on the government side.

        As all honourable senators will know, the coalition was elected by a huge majority at the last election. In my state of Queensland, the Labor Party is left with two electorates out of 26. That showed what the people of my state thought about the Labor Party, it indicated what they wanted done and it indicated their support for our policies.

        In the Senate generally, at the last election, the coalition received a unique vote of confidence and achieved an almost unique victory such that in this chamber we now have the quite unusual situation where the coalition has 37 seats, nine more than the Australian Labor Party. Even if you add to that the Labor Party hangers&amp;hyphen;on, the Australian Democrats, the coalition still has more seats in this chamber than have the Labor Party and their hangers&amp;hyphen;on, the Democrats, combined.

        Given the way this chamber is elected, that is quite unusual.

        In spite of this massive endorsement for the Liberal Party and the National Party at the last election, we have a situation now where the reforms and the legislation that we pledged to bring in have been hijacked by people, like the Greens and the Democrats, who received virtually no support from the Australian public. It is because of this selfish self&amp;hyphen;indulgence—if that is not a tautology—of the Greens and the Democrats particularly, chatting away on matters in which Australians generally were not interested at the election, and because the Labor Party keeps regurgitating their tired old union line of class hatred, arguments that really belong to yesteryear, that we are curtailed in what we on this side have to say.

Secondly, I want to mention that this bill, when it is passed, might bring about a change to the quite scandalous situation in the sugar industry whereby the AWU holds that industry to ransom, insisting on compulsory unionism; otherwise the cane will not be harvested. Hopefully, this bill will address that particular problem.

        Thirdly, an approach was made to me and to a lot of my colleagues—and, I am sure, to people on the other side too—by a Christian group, the Brethren, which has some real concerns, not about our legislation, but about industrial relations generally. They have said,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         as I put to Mr Reith, that some concessions should be made in this bill, as has happened in the past, to ensure that the unions do not interfere in workplaces in a way that interferes with people's religious beliefs. I hope that Mr Reith is able to take that into account.

        The next point I will briefly mention—although I did want to talk about it at more length—is that of the terrible waterfront situation, one which, hopefully, can be overcome by this bill. The people working on the waterfront, the wharfies, are getting average wages of $75,000 and their supervisors some $90,000. Consequently, the ordinary, average, battling Australian—the sort of person who will be voting in Lindsay on Saturday—pays more for all of the goods that come into Australia because of present waterfront practices. I certainly hope that with the passage of this bill ordinary, average Australians, battling Australians, can get a better deal on the goods they buy because the enormous add&amp;hyphen;on costs currently incurred across the waterfront will not be there.

        A colleague from Queensland, Senator MacGibbon, has asked me to refer briefly in my presentation to a pretty illogical argument put by Senator Ray in his speech. I mention it because Senator Ray usually can be relied upon for at least logical arguments in this chamber. But in his contribution to this debate he said, according to the AAP report, in relation to the Seaview Air disaster, that the aeroplane company exploited the vulnerability of pilots in order to drive down conditions and safety standards. He later went on to say that unscrupulous employers would misuse their powers over employees for commercial gain. He also said that, currently, this exploitation is illegal and able to be scrutinised by union presence.

If you people knew so much about it, why didn't you do something about the working conditions? So that argument is quite illogical. I indicated to Senator MacGibbon that in my contribution I would make a brief reference to that.

The right to organise and take collective action is essential to the development of the Australian trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party. I believe that in unity is strength.

        Australian society has developed with that principle as one of its cores. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act and its successors have since 1904 had among their primary objects the encouragement of the formation of trade unions of employers and employees. For 93 years the Australian Senate has held that Australian workers need the protection of trade unions and need the right to bargain collectively. That has been a view shared by both sides in the parliament. Parliament has continued to insist on ensuring these protections against the unfettered making of employment contracts between Australian workers and their employers.

         The parliament has accepted that the balance of interests would otherwise be unfairly tilted in favour of employers. But this bill takes us back to prior to 1904, by rejecting the years of development of industrial relations practice in this country. This bill elevates once again the individual employment contract to a place where it is the pre&amp;hyphen;eminent method of regulating industrial relations.

         The protection provided by our industrial relations system is to be removed to allow the free interplay of market forces. The bill goes much further than merely providing the choice the coalition members claim. It systematically dismantles any protection against the power of the employer in the relationship by undermining collective bargaining, restricting the rights and roles of trade unions, emasculating the role of the industrial commission and shrouding the agreement processes in secrecy.

         The fundamental dispute in this debate, in my view, is the withdrawal of legislative support for the encouragement and promotion of collective bargaining and the bill's replacement of that approach by giving primacy to individual workplace agreements. Those of us who support collective bargaining start from the premise that an individual employee or prospective employee is at a power disadvantage in negotiating employment conditions with their employer. By joining together in a union workers can bargain collectively with their employer and a more equal power relationship is established. That is why, as part of regulating industrial relations in this country, we have always provided positive encouragement for the formation and activities of unions. As a counter measure we have always then sought to regulate their activities and make them accountable.

          Employers and those who represent their interests have long feared the impact of the combination of workers and collective action. The English combination acts were designed to prevent workers combining in order to advocate their rights. Civilised society has long since recognised the fundamental importance of collective bargaining in redressing the unfair power balance faced by individual workers in dealing with their employers. Australia's international obligations to encourage and promote collective bargaining are clear and unequivocal. These obligations include support for the principle that collective representation and collective agreements or awards should be promoted and encouraged, and have primacy over individual representation and individual agreements.

          Secondly, that employees and their unions must be lawfully able to engage in industrial action to support and advance claims made in the bargaining process. Thirdly, in keeping with the principles of freedom of association and the right to negotiate freely about terms and conditions of employment, the scope of collective agreements ought not to be restricted by the authorities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This bill clearly fails to give effect to these principles and fails to honour Australia's international obligations. The bill instead gives primacy to individual contracts of employment. These individual contracts are no longer an adjunct established over and above award entitlements but will be encouraged as a superior method of regulating industrial relations. The framework of the bill provides encouragement for the development of Australian workplace agreements negotiated without the involvement of unions and largely without the involvement of the Industrial Relations Commission.

          Conservatives always seek to represent this attack on workers' rights to act collectively as redressing the imbalance that they claim was brought about by the power of unions. If they are to justify this bill, they must do more than assert that unions are too powerful. They must establish their case that an individual worker or job applicant in seeking an employment contract with an employer is not in an unequal bargaining position. I accept that in

          Many other provisions of the bill serve to confirm the point that there is no obligation on the employer to bargain at all let alone in good faith. The bill severely curtails workers' ability to seek third party intervention in the case of a dispute, a worker's right to take industrial action is curtailed and the rights of unions to organise are severely restricted and limited. The bill is about removing the 90&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old protection of workers from exploitation in individual bargaining situations where the employer enjoys superior bargaining power.

          It is not purely for parochial reasons that I now turn to a discussion of industrial legislation in my own state of Western Australia.

          Firstly, the provisions of those two acts are similar to those contained in the workplace relations bill. Secondly, John Howard's stated view is that he `would like to see, throughout Australia, an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition government has implemented in Western Australia'. Thirdly, the workplace relations bill provides that a registered agreement in a state jurisdiction overrides a federal award.

          Fourthly, the claims made on behalf of this bill are largely the same as those made on behalf of the WA legislation at the time of its introduction. Claims, I might add, that are not seriously argued by anyone these days. Pre&amp;hyphen;eminent among those claims are that: the employees will be offered choice and flexibility in the workplace; and that no employee will lose wages or be worse off as a result of the legislation. The WA experience clearly proves that those claims cannot be met. The experience of WA workers is quite different to that claimed by proponents of this bill.

          There is a difficulty in establishing the case either way based on the experience in Western Australia because of secrecy provisions similar to those contained in this bill. It is very hard to get a clear analysis of the impact of workplace agreements in Western Australia. I and my office have done a lot of work collecting case studies, examining their impact and comparing them with the relevant awards. A number of other groups have tried to do the same. But you have to search out and get private access to those agreements because they are not publicly available.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I want to make it clear that there is a dichotomy in experience of workplace agreements under the WA legislation. The first group is that in highly unionised, well paid employment areas where a number of employers have successfully bought out the role of unions. They have gone to a group of workers and said, `In return for you signing individual workplace agreements, we will increase your total rate of pay and conditions instead of the award or agreement system that was in place.' That has been the experience in a number of mining company operations. It has largely occurred in cases where there were highly unionised work forces on very good wages and conditions. Some of those people would see the system as having delivered them benefits because their individual contract is now superior to that of the award. Employers have decided, to rid themselves of unions, by paying, in some cases, a very high price.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The key issue advocated on behalf of this bill, as with the WA legislation, is this argument about choice. In Western Australia the legislation was much heralded as providing choice for employees. But a legal opinion written by Ian Viner QC and Regno Le Maire QC for the trades and labour council clearly established that there was no protection and no choice for employees under the WA legislation. They could sign or resign; they could sign a contract or not accept a job; and no recourse was available to them. Our experience has been that there has been no recourse for these individuals.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Large numbers of people in Western Australia have gone public on their experiences under the individual contract system explaining where they have been refused a job because they refused to take a workplace agreement, or where they had their conditions diminished as a result of being forced to sign a workplace agreement if they wanted to take or retain a job. It is now common to see signs in shop windows which make it clear that if you want to apply for a job in that particular shop or establishment, you will be required to sign a workplace agreement.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          No&amp;hyphen;one seriously argues any longer that there is a choice for employees in Western Australia. They either take the agreement, which is in many cases inferior to the award, or they do not get or keep the job. Many employees are now faced by standardised contracts drawn up by organisations such as the WA chamber of industry. All the employer does is fill in the amount of the hourly rate and hand it to the employee. Some contracts are less than a page long and barely cover the most basic conditions. It is clearly established that the contracts in place in Western Australia provide for a `sign or resign' situation or a `sign or no job' situation in terms of individual workplace agreements.

           Australia so that even a federal award properly obtained can be overridden by a worker signing an individual contract placed before them by an employer. The government is seeking by this bill to institutionalise and further spread the workplace agreements experience we have had in Western Australia, an experience which leaves no choice to employees, which leaves them in a totally unequal bargaining position and which has seen many thousands of Western Australian workers exploited.

          The other claim often made in support of the bill is that no worker will be worse off. But this bill does nothing to provide minimum conditions for those on workplace agreements in Western Australia that will be recognised under the bill. The list of minimum conditions contained in the bill to apply to AWAs do not apply to individual contracts operating in Western Australia and which are recognised and given primacy by this bill. There are no provisions for a no disadvantage test applying to those WA contracts and there are no provisions for providing for conciliatory, arbitral or judicial review of those contracts.

          As I said, the secrecy provisions make it very hard to do a proper analysis of Western Australian experience, but two reports have been completed. One is by the Commissioner of Workplace Agreements,

           Summary Statistics and Other Information, June 1996
          </emphasis>
          . The other is a WA TLC commissioned report by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training compiled in late 1995. The Commissioner of Workplace Agreements' report claims that the majority of agreements provide for a higher rate of pay. I think he claims that is the case in 83 per cent of workplace agreements.

          <break page="4243" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
           Although I cannot check the figures because of the secrecy provisions, I suspect they are probably right. My experience of looking at agreements is that what usually occurs is that the contract replaces the penalties, the overtime and all the other conditions applicable under the award with a flat hourly rate. So it is easy for the employer to offer a slightly higher base hourly rate because that is the only rate payable on all occasions. On Sun days, Christmas Day or whenever the one rate is applicable. So while the hourly rate might be slightly higher, the total remuneration package at the end of the week for a worker in a job which does not involve working Monday to Friday, nine to five, is considerably lower.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The places where these contracts have become popular have been in those sorts of industries where workers are working unsociable hours. They are not getting rewarded for those unsociable hours. They are entering into agreements which provide only for a base hourly rate to be paid on all occasions. For that, they are often employed as casuals. They are employed as casuals despite the fact they might work 40 hours or more a week and they might have worked for the employer for many years.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we are seeing is the total downgrading of conditions in Western Australia, the abolition of penalty rates, overtime rates, annual leave—a whole range of conditions that we would consider minimums and which the federal government in this bill says ought to be minimum conditions in terms of the operation of AWAs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The TLC commissioned report confirms that pattern of activity and confirms that workers, despite on occasions getting slightly higher hourly rates, are in fact having their total package largely reduced, which has an enormous impact on their way of life. A large number of them are having to work a huge number of hours as a result of signing the contract. As I say, they are largely employed on a casual basis. This trend has been confirmed by the Workplace Agreements Commissioner, who indicated, by way of a letter to the

          Clearly, in Western Australia, those with low bargaining power are having inferior workplace agreements forced upon them. The young, women, migrants and unskilled workers all face accepting contracts that diminish award conditions if they are to work. This bill incorporates that system into the federal

          Finally, I wish to address some remarks to the role of the Democrats in this debate. I am not one of those who seek to constantly denigrate the role that the Democrats play in this chamber, but they must recognise the fundamental conflict at the heart of this bill. As I said earlier, this bill is about repudiating the right to collectively bargain and the right of unions to organise. It seeks to overturn 90 years of encouragement and protection of those rights and, in place, elevate the individual work contract.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I know the Democrats have determined that they have a political imperative to let this bill pass. They have decided they will not deny the government its Telstra sale and also its industrial relations legislation. They have announced they will give the government their bill largely intact. It is obvious that the secret negotiations they are holding with the government on the package have not gone as smoothly as hoped. I must say I am not surprised. That is because the core principles of this bill must be anathema to the Democrats. They have been the self&amp;hyphen;styled champions of the battler. They have claimed to represent those in society without power—the unemployed, the consumer, the student, the social security recipient.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They have argued for countervailing intervention in the market to protect the weak and those without power on numerous occasions. They have done this so often that Senator Ian Macdonald often refers to the Democrats as the fourth faction of the Labor Party. I know how much that hurts both of us. But it does reflect the fact that we agree on some of those fundamental principles.

           John Howard cannot claim victory in his long campaign on industrial relations without the core principles of the bill surviving the Senate. The Democrats cannot give him what he needs without abandoning the philosophy they have championed in the Senate for years. This fundamental attack on basic employee rights which are recognised by the ILO and all civilised society cannot be ameliorated. You cannot patch over the inherent contradic tions in promoting individual contracts and then pretend a collective bargaining system still exists. A fundamental clash of principles is at stake. There is no win&amp;hyphen;win situation for the Democrats and the Liberals here. One must lose or one must sell out their principles.

         —Possibly no issue is guaranteed to get a unionist and an employer hotter under the collar faster than the prospect of changes to workplace relations. I make that statement with some confidence, having spent the first seven weeks of my time as a senator sitting on the Senate committee inquiring into this bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That committee proved to be an incredibly valuable experience. For anyone with an open mind and the interests of our society at heart, it provided a conduit for concerned unions, business and community groups—and a wide range of concerned workers and individuals—to participate in Senate decision making on a vitally important piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats approached the committee process with an open mind, with a genuine desire to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current system and to make recommendations which improve the current act and the proposed bill. In analysing the evidence, we started from three basic principles already alluded to by Senator Kernot. They were support for a strong award system, support for an independent umpire in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and support for John Howard's pre-election commitment that no worker be made worse off as a result of the government's reforms. From those principles and based on that evidence, I submitted a supplementary report to the Senate committee report outlining the Democrats' response to the workplace relations bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was these recommendations which we carried into our consultations with the Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith. They are the recommendations which I believe will, if accepted, ensure that an unfair and unbalanced workplace relations bill becomes a positive and evolutionary piece of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         reform legislation worthy of the support of the Senate.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As Senator Kernot has said, our discussions with the government do not preclude a full debate of the bill in the committee stage in the Senate. Some senators in the second reading debate, out of inexperience, inadequacy or irrelevancy, have been motivated to question this consultative process. We felt that private consultations with the government have been essential to permit open and frank dialogue with them designed to overcome the many conflicts that arise from our often opposing philosophies. I can say that, after over 45 hours of meetings over eight weeks, we have comprehensively canvassed all major elements of the bill. The outcome of this consultation and the amendments which we expect to flow from it will be fully disclosed when they are finalised before the committee debate commences.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to briefly outline the 10 most essential ingredients for a bill to be passed by this Senate with Democrat support. The first key principle is a fair, up-to-date, enforceable and user&amp;hyphen;friendly award system. The award system must be capable of covering the essential elements of the employment relationship. In areas like public sector employment, this should be able to take the form of a paid rates award covering all conditions of employment and the actual rates of pay.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We support the strengthening of the award modernisation process commenced by the previous Labor government. The process in this bill is more effective than Labor's section 150A process. We support a process that will lead to awards which are easier to understand and easiest to apply. The government has put up a model of award modernisation and simplification which we believe at this stage is too draconian. It appears to leave out many matters which are necessary for the effective operation of awards. Because the section 89A list of allowable award matters also acts as a limiter on the arbitration powers of the commission, it also fails to ensure that the commission can intervene to correct employment conditions which are harsh or unjust.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This leads to the second key Democrat principle—maintaining the central role of the
        <break page="4245" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         AIRC as the umpire and watchdog. This is particularly important in the vetting of Australian workplace agreements. Workers, particularly the two-thirds of workers not represented by unions, need to know that they are not being dudded by their industrial arrangements. Every conservative state but Victoria has provided pre&amp;hyphen;approval vetting of workplace agreements, and this bill should also do so. The fact that the bill as it stands does not do that is one of the worst failings of Mr Reith's package.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The president of the Victorian Employee Relations Commission has been very critical of the lack of vetting of agreements under her act. Many employees, she argues, believe that agreements which have been lodged with the commission have been approved by it when this is not the case at all. As a result, many employees end up accepting substandard conditions in the mistaken belief that they have been approved. Mr Reith's bill, requiring AWAs to be merely lodged with the employment advocate, would result in similar misunderstandings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our third key principle is providing an appropriate interchange between the state and federal systems. The Democrats have in the past supported the fast-track arrangements for employees to move from the substandard Victorian system to the federal industrial relations system. That process of transfer of workers is now almost complete and should be allowed to conclude. The fast-track provisions also included the ability to obtain interim federal awards for pre-election where state award coverage was threatened. These provisions also remain of value.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill as its stands seeks to not just appeal these provisions but to allow state agreements to override federal awards. These provisions create major problems for the Democrats, as was outlined in the speech by my colleague Senator Allison.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our fourth area of concern is the ability of unions to organise effectively and responsibly. This bill contains a range of anti-union provisions which will make this much more difficult. The proposals to do away with the conveniently belong rule and open up union coverage—to severely restrict union rights to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         enter and inspect workplaces—will make life extremely difficult for unions.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Industrial action could dramatically increase as unions try to prove how hairy chested they are as they seek to poach members off each other. Combined with the proposals to set up enterprise branches, the confusing disamalgamation provisions and the open-ended allowance of new unions to open up, union officials can expect to be tied up in legal wrangling in the courts for years as a result of this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats support freedom of association and the removal of compulsory unionism, but an orderly conduct of trade union affairs remains an essential element of a workable industrial relations system in Australia. In the committee stage we will be seeking a fairer balance for the rights of trade unions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fifth key principle is the establishment of a decent no disadvantage test for AWAs and certified agreements to ensure that workers are not worse off as a result of entering into agreements. We believe that such a test must have three elements. It must firstly ensure that the conditions in the agreement, considered as a whole, are not inferior to the conditions provided in the award. The test is the one currently applied to certified agreements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It must secondly ensure that the workers have genuinely agreed to the agreement. This goes further than the government's proposed very narrow test of looking at whether the agreement was entered into under duress. It looks at the whole negotiating process instead. It must thirdly not discriminate against or unfairly exclude different classes of workers. The special interests of disadvantaged workers should be taken into account.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The sixth key principle the Democrats believe must be reflected in the legislation is the protection of particular groups of workers with special needs. I would list three groups of workers—part-timers, juniors and independent contractors. Awards should not be allowed to restrict access to part-time employment to suit the whim of trade union officials. Quotas, minimum hours which are set too high and maximum hours which are set too
        <break page="4246" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         low all act to do this and should be taken out of awards.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Provisions which would significantly improve the lot of part-time workers—the guarantee of regularity of hours and pro rata entitlements—should be required in all awards and agreements by the legislation. That way we can prevent the casualisation of part-time employment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to young workers, the Democrats in 1993 supported the insertion of the provision in the current act giving the parties three years to eliminate junior rates in awards. It remains, in our view, a fundamental unfairness that a 15-year-old worker can be paid just half the salary of a 21-year-old, working side by side and doing exactly the same work. We believe that junior wages should be replaced by wages rates determined on the basis of skills, schooling, experience and work value under the supervision of the Industrial Relations Commission. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja has already outlined our views on this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to independent contractors, the Democrats believe that there should be access to a low cost dispute resolution process, allowing contractors and other small businesses to challenge unfair contracts. Such a jurisdiction could be modelled on the provisions in the New South Wales and Queensland acts—inserted, I might add, by conservative governments. The prospect of repealing the provisions in the Industrial Relations Act for independent contractors and replacing them with nothing but the common law is, in my view, simply bad policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The seventh key principle is enforcement. The Democrats believe that the flip side of allowing responsible unions to organise without undue restriction is that irresponsible unionism, irresponsible industrial action, is subject to appropriate and effective directions. The commission does now have the power to make orders, but too often unions have ignored commission orders. The Democrats believe that the powers of enforcement of AIRC orders need to be strengthened.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are also prepared to review the operation of current secondary boycott provisions inserted three years ago to ensure that they
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         are working effectively. In doing so, we would always insist that the enforcement provisions properly balance the commercial considerations of the employer and the industrial considerations of the dispute, particularly boycotts that are essentially primary in nature. We will oppose the extension of secondary boycott provisions to cover consumer and environmental boycotts and primary boycotts. To pick up such provisions in the Trade Practices Act or the Industrial Relations Act and to threaten environmental protesters or consumer lobbyists with injunctions, contempt of court and civil damages is, in our view, a draconian restriction on the right to peaceful protest and must be opposed.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The eighth key principle is ensuring that the industrial relations system is responsive to the needs of small business. I have already spoken about the need to put some teeth into the modernisation of the award system. Given that the majority of small businesses rely on the award system for key information about the labour market, this is vitally important. But I think we should also be encouraging small business to improve their workplace relations and arrangements through formalised but low cost enterprise bargaining. Small businesses wanting to negotiate an agreement at present face high potential costs engaging consultants or employer bodies to assist them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The absence of unions from this sector—90 per cent of small business employees are not in unions, just as 70 per cent of small businesses are not in employer organisations—means deals are often done in an information vacuum to the detriment of both parties. The Democrats believe that a pro-active employment advocate, geared specifically to the needs of this growing non-unionised sector, could play a major role in encouraging and mediating quality enterprise agreements for small business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ninth key principle, also important to small business, is reform of unfair dismissals. The Democrats support the thrust of the government's legislation, provided the government guarantees that the system will still be open to Victorian employees. There are only a few minor technical issues which we will deal with in the committee stage.
       </para>
       <break page="4247" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The tenth and final principle is ensuring that the bill improves the balance between work and family responsibilities. The overall package of principles I have outlined will go some way to achieving this, but more pro-active measures should also be enacted to ensure that this important object of the bill actually means something. This we believe should be developed as an effective role of the employment advocate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Democrats will be proposing a number of amendments in the committee stage. These are still being developed in discussions with the government, the Department of Industrial Relations, the ACTU, the ACCI and others. We aim to ensure, through our consultations with government and through our amendments, that the bill is fair and balanced while moving reform of industrial relations and workplace practices forward.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We want to ensure that the capacity for productivity improvement is maximised by this bill, while also ensuring that workers and their families are adequately protected. That balancing act is not an easy one. I do not expect to win any popularity contests by attempting it. My aim, and the aim of the Democrats, is to ensure that the review of this legislation is governed by good policy and practicality, not by ideology or political grandstanding. I am confident that the result of the committee stage review by the Senate will be a much fairer and more workable bill than the one presently before us.

Unfortunately, Senator Brown has, as a result of that resolution, sought to misrepresent the government's position on East Timor. I think it is important that the government's position, although it is well known by all, is nevertheless restated on the record.

         —I would like to take the opportunity today to address the issue of statehood for the Northern Territory. As a senator for the Northern Territory, I am pleased to take this opportunity—and I will seek leave at the end of my speech to do this—to table the final draft constitution for the Northern Territory, which has been prepared by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development. I will also seek leave to table an accompanying speech that the chairman of the committee, the Hon. Steve Hatton MLA, delivered in the Northern Territory parliament when the final draft constitution was tabled in August.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My interest in tabling the final draft constitution and Mr Hatton's speech in this place is twofold. Firstly, it is to inform my fellow senators and members of the House of Representatives of the progress the Northern Territory parliament has made in the area of constitutional development. Secondly, and more importantly, it is to highlight the futility of the current debate surrounding the proposal that the federal parliament override the Northern Territory parliament's legislative capacity in light of the Territory's current move towards statehood. I refer very particularly to the debate that is currently being proposed in the House of Representatives on the matter of voluntary euthanasia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Upon attaining statehood, the parliament of the Northern Territory will be within its rights, as all states currently are, to legislate without interference from the federal par liament. Given the constitutional maturity of the territory that I would argue very strongly for, I envisage—as do my Northern Territory parliamentary colleagues—that statehood for the Northern Territory will not be too far over the horizon.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is certainly a view held strongly by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, whose leadership in recent years has steered the Northern Territory on a new and determined course towards statehood.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would now like to take some time to examine a number of the unique features of this final draft constitution before revisiting the significance of the Northern Territory's constitutional maturity in relation to this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Northern Territory has a proud history of constitutional development as progressed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since its inception in 1974. At that time, I was personally involved in the Northern Territory parliament as a member of the initial working party on constitutional issues which involved the federal and Northern Territory parliaments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1978, self-government was achieved under the Everingham&amp;hyphen;Perron leadership. Since 1985, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development has published a number of discussion and information papers in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the tabling of the final draft constitution. Mr Hatton said when tabling the document in August:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The process of constitution&amp;hyphen;making should be an open, democratic process, with maximum opportunity for input by all the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many of the unique features of the final draft constitution are a testament to this open consultative process—acknowledging the territory's cultural diversity and, perhaps most importantly, acknowledging the affinity the Aboriginal people of the area have with the Northern Territory. The first paragraph of the preamble reads:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Before the proclamation of the colony of New South Wales in 1788 and since immemorial all or most of the geographical area of Australia that now constitutes the Northern Territory of Australia (the Northern Territory) was occupied by various groups
        <break page="4250" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of Aboriginal people under an orderly and mutually recognised system of governance and laws by which they lived and defined their relationships between each other, with the land and with their natural and spiritual environment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        This will be the first Australian constitution to acknowledge the prior existence of Aboriginal society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Throughout the consultative process, the committee received a great deal of representations from Aboriginal people who were concerned about the implications statehood would have on issues such as land rights and the protection of sacred sites. In order to safeguard existing Aboriginal interests and rights from amendment by future state parliaments of the Northern Territory, the committee has borrowed the concept of `organic law' from the Papua New Guinea system of government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the transition towards statehood, the committee has envisaged that existing Commonwealth acts pertinent to the interests of Aboriginal people, for example the Land Rights Act, will be transferred across to the Northern Territory and be enacted as organic law. The concept of organic law, as it applies in this context, was explained by Mr Hatton in his tabling speech as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . such a law can only be amended in the future with bipartisan support under a special majority in the parliament, and following extensive opportunities for public debate and after inquiry and report by a standing parliamentary committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final draft constitution also suggests that Aboriginal customary law be recognised as having the same constitutional status as common law. With Aboriginal people constituting over 25 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory, this is a very important initiative. Customary law remains an integral part of the lives and social order of many Aboriginal people in the territory and, as such, should be recognised within the constitution of the Northern Territory. The final draft constitution states that Aboriginal customary law `shall be recognised as a source of law in the Northern Territory'. In his tabling speech, Mr Hatton explained:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . this is not a `two law' concept. Rather, it is designed to recognise that the Aboriginal people in the territory are presently faced with two systems of laws, one recognised by our existing constitu
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         tional system and one that in the main is not presently recognised, and can put these people in a position of double jeopardy. The challenge before us is to bring these two systems into a form of mutuality and reciprocity within a common constitutional framework, a gradual harmonisation of laws, but without any undesirable or unfair side&amp;hyphen;effects.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps one of the most unique features proposed by the  committee in this final draft constitution is the incorporation of a series of rights. Whilst these rights do not constitute a bill of rights as such they do enumerate a number of rights which will in future go a long way to ensuring Aboriginal people and people who practice different cultures have their place in what will be an open and tolerate system. I note the 15th item of the preamble reads:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The people of the Northern Territory are concerned to preserve a harmonious, tolerant and united multicultural society, and to this end, it is desirable that no person should be unreasonably denied the right—

       </para>
       <para>
        Part 7 of the final draft constitution deals specifically with the protection of Aboriginal land rights and Aboriginal sacred sites. Part 8 is titled `Rights in respect of language, social, cultural and religious matters'. Whilst I acknowledge the problems associated with the incorporation of a bill of rights into other constitutions, I believe the particular rights enumerated in this draft constitution will serve all territorians well, securing the future of a multicultural, multiracial community.

        Overall, the current system of government will, for the most part, continue unchanged by statehood. The same Westminster model consisting of the legislature, executive and judiciary will remain, as will the unicameral parliamentary model for the Legislative Assembly. The committee has envisaged that in the transition to statehood, the current Northern Territory (Self&amp;hyphen;Government) Act will be repealed and the final draft constitution enacted. Disruption to the current system will be minimal, with the fundamental and most important difference being that the federal parliament will no longer have the power to interfere in Northern Territory legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am confident that fellow senators and members of the federal parliament will acknowledge the hard work that Territorians from all walks of life and all political persuasions have contributed to its development. The concept of Northern Territory statehood enjoys overwhelming support not only within the territory but right across Australia, and this support is growing. Australians are obviously familiar with the territory's track record of nearly 20 years of responsible government and are receptive to the message that the territory has proven itself more than a worthy candidate for statehood.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Northern Territory economy and population is growing faster than any other jurisdiction in Australia. With an average growth rate of 5.4 per cent over the past decade, its growth is more than double the national average and is comparable with the growth of the newly industrialised countries of South-East Asia—the world's fastest growing region. The territory is perfectly positioned on the edge of this region to link Australia with what is widely anticipated to be the economic hub of the world for the next two decades.

        In conclusion, I recommend that all senators and members obtain a copy of the final draft constitution for the Northern Territory and give serious consideration to the points I have raised today. Whilst in the short term this parliament may very well be able to overturn the legislation of the independent jurisdictions of the Northern Territory, in the longer term any such attempt will prove futile.

         —Today I rise to discuss a matter of great public interest and importance—that is, standards of parliamentary and political integrity and leadership. Events of recent days, involving the shareholdings and conflicts of interests of certain ministers of the Howard government, demonstrate clearly that when it comes to the crunch, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is all talk and no action.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Howard has long trumpeted that he is a person who demands and expects the highest standards of integrity and honesty in public life. It was John Howard who went to the people on 2 March claiming that he would raise the standards of politics and of parliamentary debate in this country. I do not accept for one moment that the standards of honesty and integrity of former ALP governments under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating were anything but of the highest order. They were governments of high integrity and high standards.

         The record shows that in over 13 years of ALP governments, from 1983 to 1996, there were only a couple

          of isolated instances where ministers were required to resign. Indeed, in nearly all of those cases there was no fundamental breach of guidelines or principles. But, in accordance with Westminster traditions, the ministers nevertheless took the honourable course. The record of the Labor government contrasts markedly with that of the previous Fraser government, where it became almost a monthly occurrence for ministers to be required to resign their commission for breaches of conflict of interest or of misleading the parliament.

        When John Howard, the now Prime Minister, set out to be holier than thou, when he established his code of ministerial conduct, he said to the people and to the parliament that he would expect nothing less than absolute adherence to those guidelines that he laid down. What have we seen within a period of only six months since the government came to office in March? We have seen at least five ministers be in breach of those very guidelines. Ministers Anderson, Herron and Short, Parliamentary Secretary Gibson and now Mr John Moore. Who knows? There may well be more to come as the days pass and events unfold.

        Faced with this situation of these ministers being in breach, the Prime Minister has been left floundering. He has failed to act, notwithstanding that day after day proof has been given of conflicts of interests and of non&amp;hyphen;adherence to or breaches of the code of conduct. The Prime Minister failed to act until forced to do so by circumstances and by embarrassment caused to him and to his government.

         What do we get still from the Prime Minister? We get pathetic attempts to defend the conduct of his ministers—conduct which should be condemned. But, more so, we get a pathetic counterattack—a disgraceful attack—by members of the government upon opposition members simply because they happen to be members of trade unions. They attack people because they are members of trade unions, as if that meant that you are some lower form of human being and not fit to represent the people in the parliament, or indeed in any form of public life; that, some how, if you have been a trade unionist, you have never had a real job or a real commitment.

        We do not attack members of the opposition because they happen to be shareholders or because they happen to be company directors. We happen to believe in, and have advocated through all of our existence, the importance of the private sector in the economy of this country. But what we will attack is the hypocrisy and the failure to comply with standards of conduct demanded of ministers. It is nothing short of pathetic and disgraceful for members of the government to single out people in the opposition simply because of their membership of trade unions. I remind members of the government that people such as Lech Walesa, Nelson Mandela or Caesar Chavez have proudly spoken of their membership of trade unions—and I do not think anybody would ever suggest that they are not people of integrity and commitment.

        Similarly, on the issue of the disgraceful racist rantings of the member for Oxley, Ms Pauline Hanson, the Prime Minister has failed to demonstrate the leadership necessary, and has singularly failed to stand up for the very principles that he espouses and that I believe he adheres to. But it is not a question of Mr Howard's beliefs so much that is at issue here; it is the question of his responsibilities as Prime Minister. He has declined until very recently, I understand, to condemn in any real way the outrageous, divisive, inflammatory, scurrilous, despicable, erroneous and racist views of Ms Hanson. Despite numerous calls for the Prime Minister to speak out, he has declined. Rather, he has responded by saying that he believed in freedom of speech, and that he actually believed this had somehow been suppressed under previous governments and he was going to stand up for it.

        Frankly, the right to free speech is something to be defended, as Voltaire so correctly put it many years ago.

Voltaire believed in the dignity and the equality of all people. That is what is at issue here and that is what the Prime Minister should stand up for.

        The matter I wish to raise in this debate relates to the field station, Chiswick, outside Armidale, which is part of the CSIRO. What I want to do is put the cause for not only the retention of Chiswick but the expansion of this excellent facility. This issue began in June this year, following a decision by the CSIRO bureaucrats, which initially was to close the station altogether. This decision led to howls of protest from the local area because of the enormous contribution that people at the Chiswick Research Station have made to the northern New South Wales area. They have carried out vital research in relation to drought effects and the drought tolerance of particular pasture species. The establishment of temperate pasture species has also
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         been investigated. They have done excellent work in soil fertility and soil science research. They have carried out world leading research in animal production and reproduction and other matters relating to that, including animal health, bacterial and viral disease and the effects of parasites.

        It seems strange that the CSIRO has decided to close such an excellent facility. I believe the original advice from the CSIRO on this matter was flawed. I would like particularly to note for the Senate that the CSIRO's action ran totally counter to a committee inquiry and report to the Senate which was tabled at the end of 1994.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The effects of such a closure in the New England area were going to be quite major. It involved the loss of over 70 staff, including senior scientists and technical staff. It involved the removal of on&amp;hyphen;site property based research and evaluation of products for the wool and the beef industries. It would involve the curtailment of vital long&amp;hyphen;term applied research projects and, curiously, the transfer of many of those projects to Prospect, in the middle of Sydney. Here we have a field station that involves research and involves field trials in controlled environments in a rural area, yet much of this research was going to be moved to Sydney—a very curious decision indeed, particularly when you consider that the facilities that were actually built at Chiswick, with the new laboratories, were only three years old. It was with some pride that I looked through those labs three years ago in their final stages of construction. Not to use this facility that has been set up in a rural area seems a most curious decision indeed.

        When the original plans to close Chiswick were announced, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, the Chief Executive Officer of the CSIRO, was inundated with protests from the New England and north&amp;hyphen;west region of New South Wales. Local government councils, including Armidale and Tamworth, carried out major protests. The mayor of the rural shire of Dumaresq, which surrounds Armidale, Councillor Peter Monley, led the charge to save Chiswick—to his great credit. The New South Wales Farmers Association, the University of

        Following the representations of a number of coalition MPs, the Minister for Science and Technology, Peter McGauran—to his great credit—revised this decision. Minister McGauran came to Chiswick in late September and announced that the facility would remain open indefinitely, initially with a staffing of 20, which has now been revised up to 35. The minister, when he did come to Armidale, set out a long&amp;hyphen;term plan to retain Chiswick in that area. The plan involves the attraction of more private funding and collaborative research projects so that they can build on the number of the 35 staff that are left there. The government, the CSIRO, industry and the community are now working together to secure the future of this excellent research facility, and I welcome the minister's announcement.

It is another example of the coalition being flexible and listening to the concerns of people in rural and regional Australia, which is quite a change after the last 13 years of Labor government—particularly, a change from the decision of the New South Wales Labor government to close the vet lab in Armidale. I do not see that government revisiting that decision. What we have done is in great contrast.

        Following discussions with senior researchers at Chiswick, I believe that the staff level should be increased from the announced level of 35 to ensure its long&amp;hyphen;term viability. I have spoken to the minister about that, and will continue to make the case for Chiswick with increased staffing. The minister, I assure the Senate, is listening to that argument and that is a possible outcome.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are excellent reasons why this overall facility should remain in place with viable staffing numbers. Firstly, there is value in applied research in primary industry carried out by the CSIRO in the country on property
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that it owns. It is central to the Chiswick research effort. It is crucial, particularly with applied research, and this cannot be carried out in the centre of Sydney, at Prospect.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Chiswick and its associated properties must be retained. Research on pharmaceutical products for animals requires an intermediate stage to assess the impact of the product, and it must be carried out in a controlled environment where the scientists can actually monitor the research. This cannot be done effectively by the CSIRO on private farm animals.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To take one example, there is research by the CSIRO on an agent that would de&amp;hyphen;fleece sheep. There are real risks, if products like this are not evaluated properly, of chemical residue problems and animal welfare issues. The evaluation of this de&amp;hyphen;fleecing agent showed a major side effect which would not have been picked up in laboratories: you had to do field station research to see it. The product did de&amp;hyphen;fleece the sheep, but it also induced spontaneous abortions in pregnant ewes. Obviously, if you had not had the field trials, you would have ended up with a product on the market that would have had that sort of effect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, the case for retaining Chiswick relates to the collaborative research projects that are carried out by the CSIRO in the New England district and the University of New England; and the case for keeping that collaborative research going is overwhelming. The two institutions—the CSIRO and the University of New England—have been involved in collaborative research in this area for over 50 years. Both institutions have derived huge advantages, with young researchers gaining valuable field experience within the CSIRO. We need to retain that link and the link with cooperative research centres, because it is in the synergy between these sorts of bodies that new developments take place and Australia helps maintain its world&amp;hyphen;class record in groundbreaking research. This is particularly the case in relation to primary industries.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="4257" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         I believe the minister will, over time, further review the staffing levels at Chiswick. Let me place on record some powerful arguments which I hope affect the eventual deci sion by the CSIRO. The current decision to keep Chiswick open with 35 staff leaves the research effort weakened. Of the 35 remaining staff, just six are research scientists. Important research projects of great value to Australia may need to be terminated or severely reduced in the current situation. For example, integrated parasite control in sheep and cattle, which has produced international cutting&amp;hyphen;edge research, may under the plan be relocated to Prospect; a project examining the relationship between stress and immune competence in beef cattle is being severely downsized; and the sustainable grazing system project is to close, and it will be tragedy if that decision goes ahead. This project, which is now 50 years old, has been carried out on lands near Chiswick, and it is irreplaceable in terms of the way the history of the sustainable grazing system has developed. It should also be retained, particularly the world&amp;hyphen;class work of Dr Jim Scott of UNE and soil biologist Dr Kath King.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have pleasure in putting the case for continuing a strong federal government and private sector investment in Chiswick, as the work is too valuable, and the commitment of those researchers is too dedicated, to be overlooked. Some scientists who have accepted a redundancy package will, fortunately, remain in the Armidale area, and the opportunity is there for those people to be re&amp;hyphen;employed if Chiswick does expand further.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I close by thanking the minister for the turnaround in the position and the leadership he has taken in keeping this world&amp;hyphen;class research facility open. I urge that the government now move on from this position and that, as well as getting private assistance, it bring back to Chiswick a number of those world&amp;hyphen;class projects to make this a viable long&amp;hyphen;term research facility into the next century.

         —The matter that I wish to raise in the matters of public interest debate this afternoon is the ever mounting and growing bill occasioned by the taxpayers of Australia as a result of the ACTU's activities here at Parliament House on 19 August 1996.

         The reality is that the damages bill to be faced by the Australian people will now, in my estimation, exceed $1 million. That is a huge sum of money. Honourable senators would be aware of my interest in this matter because on 21 August 1996, only two days after those events, in this very debate I addressed the Senate about my concerns as to what had happened on the previous Monday. At that time I pointed out that our Parliament House is a symbol of the Australian way of life and our democratic process, and that any assault on our parliament is, in fact, an attack on our way of life and our democratic process. It is an attack on our freedoms. I dealt with the matter on the basis of principle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Madam Acting Deputy President Patterson, if I recall, you asked a question of the President of the Senate in relation to the damages bill that was known at that time, and it was in the vicinity of $90,000. I then used the opportunity of the Senate estimates committee to determine how much actual damage had been occasioned to Parliament House itself. That questioning revealed that the damage to Parliament House and the gift shop amounted to slightly in excess of $300,000. When I got that information, I issued a media release headed `Outrage as riot bill tops $300,000'. I can tell you, now that I know that that figure was a very conservative estimate, I am a lot more outraged because of the costs that the Australian taxpayer will have to bear.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You will recall that we were advised in this Senate that a damages bill of $91,000 to Parliament House was determined by Madam President some time ago. She then advised, through the Senate estimates process, that that figure would more likely be $300,000. I then had occasion, through the Senate estimates process, to ask the Australian Federal Police as to the costs that were occasioned by them in relation to the riot. I have got to say to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the statistics are quite horrific.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One hundred and sixteen officers were injured in the riot at parliament. Chances are that most of them would have been members of the police union, and there they were being attacked and bloodied, their ribs being broken, allegedly, by fellow trade unionists. It is
         <break page="4258" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          hardly the sort of behaviour that one would expect. Out of those 116 who have reported injuries, 74 members have submitted accident and injury claim forms and 12 have completed Comcare claims. In addition, as at 17 September, 560 hours of compensation leave has been utilised by members.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is not possible to provide details of the costs to be incurred by Comcare at this time as it may be several years before the extent of injuries and claims are fully known.

         So the people of Australia will not know the damages bill that they face, courtesy of the ACTU, for approximately another few years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Simply, the cost of overtime and penalties—just that alone—that had to be paid because of the events on 19 August 1996 occasioned to the Australian taxpayer an extra payment of some $78,800. Damage to police property was $1,341.91. Damage to the personal property of police officers was estimated at $1,894.95. Travel costs for the investigations which are still under way were $2,347.40. They are the costs that can actually be quantified.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are, however, a lot of unquantifiable costs at this stage, such as the cost of medical treatment and the Comcare costs, which undoubtedly will be huge because personal injury claims may well flow in consequence of the broken ribs and other injuries sustained by the 116 officers who were injured courtesy of the ACTU inspired rally. Up to 17 September, 560 hours of leave had been taken by various police officers. The cost of the investigation and the prosecution costs, to date and ongoing, are still not known. We already have actual costs in the vicinity of $400,000. It would be fair to say that, after all the legal costs, investigation costs, prosecution costs, medical costs and compensation costs are paid, all of which are not quantified at this stage, the Australian taxpayer could well be looking at a bill in excess of $1 million.

          they will be paying courtesy of the ACTU was described by their secretary as one of the most successful rallies ever held by the ACTU. One wonders how Mr Kelty and the others in the trade union movement judge success. One would have thought that the extent of the havoc and cost to taxpayers of the ACTU riot might have made the trade union movement engage in at least some apology and acknowledge what they were involved in, but they seem to have no shame and no concern for the odium which the ACTU and Labor must carry for their involvement.

         Whilst it is quite clearly on the public record that people such as Jennie George and Bill Kelty are unwilling to apologise, we do now know that there are genuine trade unionists within the community who are prepared to apologise and who are desperate to disassociate themselves from the trade union movement and the extreme elements within it. To highlight that, as a result of Senate estimates inquiries, I was provided with certain information which included this letter from a trade unionist. I will read it into the record:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         As a member of a union, I was appalled at the behaviour and the destruction caused by those involved in the demonstration at Parliament House last week. I was also disgusted at the comments by Mr Kelty about the demonstration and, as a result of this, I have resigned from the union.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Enclosed in this letter is a cheque of $117, which is the amount that I owe the union as I have to give three months notice and dues when you resign. Therefore, instead of giving these dues to the union, I am redirecting the money to the parliament to help pay the damage that the union caused to our House.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a view, I suggest, which is reflected by many trade unionists right around this country. What was also revealing was two letters that were sent to the Australian Federal Police, by people who will remain nameless, indicating what their involvement in the rally and violence was. This is a letter dated 19 August, which you would recall was the day of the so&amp;hyphen;called rally, more aptly described as a riot. The letter reads:

I have not enclosed my name in fear of prosecution.

When I got home I realised what I had done so I wanted to return the stolen goods to you.

The budget was very much bad news for the regions.

        The government has particularly attacked regional Australia by targeting regional programs and closing government offices in regional areas. The coalition abolished the Department of Regional Development and this has sent a big signal to regional Australia, particularly to regional areas such as the Central Coast, that to this coalition government the people of regional Australia are not important. Frankly, I am a little bit surprised at the lack of interest in this issue that the National Party, the coalition partner, has shown. The major preoccupation of the National Party and its leader, Mr Fischer, seems to have been ensuring that the fuel rebate was retained for its constituency. But, at the same time, regional and country areas of Australia have been ignored. In fact, the whole department of regional development has been abolished.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Previously the Labor government provided $150 million for the regional development organisations, RDOs. For the short period of time that these organisations existed they were quite successful. The Orana gas pipeline was established by the Orana Regional Development Organisation (ORDO) with just $2 million. This RDO covered the Riverina and Orange areas and was able to secure from the New South Wales government $42 million. As a result of receiving those funds it was able to construct a pipeline. The areas now receive natural gas at a cost which is comparable to that in the metropolitan areas of Sydney.

        Regional development is particularly important for the Central Coast as a unique and fast growing area north of Sydney. The cuts to regional development funds have really hurt the people of the Central Coast but do not seem to have caused a concern to be recognised by this coalition government. The Central Coast Regional Development Organisation—relatively new—received approximately $150,000 and was expected to receive further funding before the election. That has changed, of course. No further funding has been provided for RDOs whatsoever.

         The RDO on the Central Coast was instrumental in trying to find further employment opportunities for young Central Coast residents.

Unemployment has risen 2.6 per cent over the last month generally on the Central Coast, to 9.1 per cent. Youth unemployment in just one month has risen 4.5 per cent. Yet the vehicle for doing something about this problem, the Central Coast RDO, has no longer been provided with funding.

         At the same time as the coalition abandoned the Department of Regional Development, it abandoned significant job programs on the Central Coast. Also, through a convoluted process, the government has cut flood mitigation funding in regional areas.

Prior to regional development being wound down, urban flood mitigation was transferred to the Department of Transport and Regional Development. Included in this transfer was funding for the Gosford City Council amounting to $1

The problems that were going to be dealt this year will not be dealt with for many years to come. Flooding on the Central Coast is a problem, but it is only one of a multitude of problems that regional areas have. I highlight it today because it indicates the priorities of this government. Despite it being a coalition government which includes the National Party and, despite what would be a normal assumption that the National Party would be seeing the interests of rural and regional areas as uppermost in their priorities, we see that regional areas are being forgotten. Putting this

        It is interesting, however, that, although Mr Beazley and the Labor leadership might not know how serious the problems are, within the Labor Party they do. Since the election, there have been two studies done. The first I want to refer to was from the New South Wales Labor Party Committee. Its report included such people as Leo McLeay and Laurie Ferguson. What they pointed to as the reasons for Labor's defeat included: rampant insecurity; wage stagnation and sacrifice of conditions for every wage increase and unemployment.

        It is not surprising that the last one is mentioned again. These are all the things that apparently Mr Beazley, the now leader of the Labor Party, wishes to overlook. They went on to include real wages decline. How often did we say from the coalition side of the chamber, that under Labor real wages were declining? But they refused to accept it. Denial, denial and more denial. And there is still denial from Mr Beazley.

        Which, of course, the Labor Party was so carried away with at that time. There you have it again.

Let me just explain this to you. Between the time that you were elected to government in 1983 until the time you went out, $92 million was granted by your lot to the trade union movement, and $130 million in terms of tax exemptions to the union movement. In 1992-93, the Labor government granted $5.6 million to 18 trade union bodies and $2.2 million of that came back through the revolving door. By 1994-95, $16.5 million was going to the trade union movement.

Further, is it true that the Prime Minister also defended Mr Moore on the basis that his shareholdings were in related companies rather than a parent company? Given that Senator Gibson resigned because of a decision regarding a subsidiary company to the one in which he held shares and given that Mr Moore now finds himself in the same situation, why, apparently, is Mr Moore more deserving of the Prime Minister's loyalty than Senator Gibson?

         —A subsidiary is owned by the principal company. I think the point you are missing is that the guidelines that I am reading and you have been reading do not in fact provide for tracing down through investments in companies that are the subject of the issue. The guidelines provide that ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. As I interpret that, if the company in which the minister holds shares is the company out of which the conflict arises, there would be a need to divest. But if you are going to get to a situation where you have to explore further within the investments of that company, and that company may well be investing in another investment company, and trace that through to the investments of that company, it obviously becomes ridiculous and they are not intended to be interpreted in a ridiculous way.

Whilst we are still critical on the human rights issue from time to time, we also try to give some credit where it is deserved. What has happened under President Suharto has been an unprecedented level of stability and growth that has brought great economic benefit to many, many millions of Indonesians. I am not trying to discount the other side of the equation, but I do think it ought to be put in  the context of the whole picture. In relation to the hypothetical question, I can refer that back to the Prime Minister, but I think at this stage he would probably regard it as hypothetical as well.

        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, to questions without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to senators' and members' interests and the Prime Minister's Guide on key elements of Ministerial Responsibility.

        The Prime Minister, John Howard, has been caught, has been engulfed and has been swamped with his
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility
        </emphasis>
        . We all remember after the election the puffed up self-importance with which Senator Hill came into this chamber to present the Prime Minister's guide and with which the Prime Minister presented this guide to the parliament and to the people of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We all remember how he waxed lyrical about these guidelines on ministerial responsibility. He was asked as recently as this morning in a press conference what action he took to ensure that these guidelines were complied with. The simple answer to that question is:
        <break page="4276" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         none. This Prime Minister, who thought this guide was so important to the parliament and people of Australia, has done nothing, since it was tabled in April of this year, to ensure that his ministers complied with the guide.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He went on to say the onus was not on him as the Prime Minister; the onus was on the individual ministers themselves. They had to take all the responsibility. It is the Prime Minister's guide but he was not going to do anything to ensure that it was complied with by those who had taken the Executive Council oath. That is the situation that we are faced with—a Prime Minister who did nothing about his own guidelines.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, the Prime Minister was willing to take all the credit when these guidelines were brought down. When the guidelines are exposed as a complete fraud, which they have been in this parliament by the opposition in both the Senate and the House of Representatives over the last week, he moves away from them. He now says these guidelines were very similar to those brought down by the Labor Party. The much trumpeted guidelines of Mr Howard have suddenly changed. He said when he brought them down, `I understand this is the first time that such a document has been produced. The guidelines that were laid down in this document will be complied with in full.' Senator Hill said in this chamber in April:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It underlines this government's complete commitment to high standards of ministerial conduct and accountability.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Hill said in this chamber:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        They are very demanding standards—there is no doubt about that. We accept high standards for this government.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, once the Prime Minister has been exposed as weak and unable to make his ministers comply with these guidelines, we see a very significant change in rhetoric from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister says now, in October, it is up to ministers to interpret the guidelines correctly and adhere to them. Those are the Prime Minister's words. He says the booklet that was published represents in substance a consolidation of the guidelines that were adhered to, presumably, one expects, by the former government. He
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         said in the House of Representatives on 15 October:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I wish to say that the guidelines which were effectively consolidated by the new government when it came to power are guidelines that have now been in operation for a long period of time.
       </para>
       <para>
        He has left the guidelines behind him. We have had the sacking of Senator Short, who finally fronted up to Mr Howard and said he should go. We have had Senator Gibson hit the fence as well. Now Mr Moore and Mr Howard are exposed as being in a clear conflict of interest situation, in a government of ministers of conspicuous wealth, becoming more conspicuous by the minute despite all their efforts to hide it.

          It would take half an hour or so to go through the lot, but when we look at the LHMWU grant from the government, there was a donation to the ALP of $254,000. So they gave half the money, in round figures, that was granted by the government straight back to the ALP. If that is not a distortion of the use of public funds I do not know what is.

          Let us look at the AWU since Senator Forshaw is over there: a $270,000 grant from the government, but they were a little more miserable—they only gave $56,000 back to the ALP. Look at the ASU: a $470,000 grant from the government, and they gave $83,000 back to the ALP. What a wonderful way to fund your organisation! Let me tell you, that is coming to an end.

         —I want to remind the Senate what this debate really is about and not be diverted into the obfuscations and red herrings that have just been drawn across it. This debate is about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying to the electors of Australia before the election that he was going to introduce a new code of integrity and probity in parliament. He waved around an election promise that he was going to do this by introducing a code of ministerial conduct. That was what he pledged to the people of Australia before the election, and after the election he did introduce a code of ministerial conduct.

         ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is the standard the government imposed on itself, and this debate is about whether or not government ministers are maintaining the standard the government set. We have seen one minister and a parliamentary secretary resign because there was, to use their words, `an apparent conflict'. They resigned, and the issue is whether other ministers in this government are in conflict, or in apparent conflict, with the standard that the government has set.

         In question time there were questions from Senator Schacht and me concerning the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer. It should be said that no&amp;hyphen;one on our side, and certainly not me as a former minister for trade, is complaining in the slightest that the Minister for Trade for Australia supports Australian companies overseas. That is his job. We have no complaint about that. More strength to the minister's arm for so doing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The complaint is, however, that in this case the minister is clearly as well in breach of the code of conduct and is promoting the interests of companies in which he has shares and, therefore, stands to be a personal beneficiary of the public work and public duty he is performing. The problem is not that he promotes the companies; the problem is that he maintains shares in them, and the promotion he engages in therefore can advantage him either directly or apparently. It is the `apparent' part of this code of conduct which
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          is what caused Senator Short to resign. No&amp;hyphen;one said he had necessarily benefited financially, but there was a substantial question as to whether there was an appearance of him benefiting. It is exactly the same position for former Parliamentary Secretary Gibson.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But that is not the same position, apparently, that this government now wants to apply to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, who, in promoting the interests of one of his major shareholdings—a company he only divested himself of shares in just the other day—obviously stood to have some advantage. Whether he did it because of that advantage or because of the apparent conflict is not the issue: the fact is he is in breach of the guidelines.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the Prime Minister has any guts, and if the Prime Minister is determined to uphold the promise he made to electors about parliamentary conduct and parliamentary probity, then the Prime Minister will insist that the Deputy Prime Minister will now tender his resignation. The issue here is whether the Prime Minister meant it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we have seen on television and in the media in the last few days is the Prime Minister backtracking and running away from the undertaking he gave prior to the election. He is backtracking and reinterpreting what the code of ministerial conduct means in order now to protect ministers. He is faced with a political problem. He has found that, on his front bench, many of his ministers did not comply with the standards he set down, and some of them have gone. The government is in crisis and is haemorrhaging. In order to staunch that crisis and prevent that haemorrhage, he now reinterprets the code so that no further ones will resign.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not a situation that is acceptable. The Prime Minister declared these standards; it is for him to uphold them, and it is for him to ensure those ministers uphold them as well. We know that the Deputy Prime Minister has shares in BHP, Western Mining, Qantas, TNT, Jardine Fleming, Asia Pacific and a number of other companies. He divested himself of those just the other day after the expiry of the Prime Minister's deadline.

         —Senator Cook's interpretation of the guidelines is very incorrect. The guidelines precisely say that if a minister or a parliamentary secretary makes a decision that would in any way benefit a company that they have an interest in, then that is a breach. Senator Short and former Parliamentary Secretary Gibson honourably came in here and said that in some way they may have breached that guideline. But that is a long bow from the situation of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who had shares in BHP and who never, in any way, made a determination that affected the price of those shares.

        Senator Cook, are you telling the Senate that the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) should not go on and cheer—we have had some private discussions about this—for Australian companies? He was cheering for Australian companies overseas, barracking for them and promoting them so they could promote benefits and jobs for Australia. These are two very different circumstances. The two people who came in here and honourably resigned—I think they were very honourable in the decisions that they took—met their commitments; they met the guidelines of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

Today we had another bumbling, inept effort by the government to try to get themselves off their own hook; to try to dissemble from their own ministerial guidelines, which were trumpeted before the election and after the election by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as a new standard of conduct for government in Australia. Yet, in the last 24 to 36 hours, the Prime Minister has been dumping on his own ministerial guidelines. I saw at a press conference held only at midday today that the Prime Minister is now saying, `As I read the guidelines.' He wrote them! He is now saying that there is a

He should be able to say, `These are my guidelines. This is what it means.' But now he is saying, `As I read them,' because he is under considerable embarrassment as a result of the actions of his own party.

I think we need have to a closer look at what we are doing.' The President of Senate said that. Winston Crane said, `To be quite frank, I think we have been quite silly.' I know that Winston does not count for much on the opposition benches, but Winston is saying, `We have been quite silly,' and the President of the Senate says, `I think it is quite absurd.'

        With all of that sort of pressure, the Prime Minister is now trying to think of a way to bust and break his own guidelines, which he trumpeted around the place would take the parliament to a new standard. He has now suggested there may be a blind trust established. The only thing that is blind is the Prime Minister, who now cannot see that Mr Moore and Mr Fischer are clearly in breach of his own guideline, which has now been quoted so extensively. It states:

        Black and white, without any doubt. You can understand what that says—even, I think, most people opposite. The question I asked today about Mr Fischer dealt with the fact that as trade minister over the last six months while he held shares in BHP, which he admitted in the House of Representatives today he only divested himself of earlier this
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         week, he made a number of representations on behalf of BHP. If he did not have shares in the company we would all cheer him on and say: `That is excellent. That is what you should be doing.' But it is a sheer conflict of interest, an absolute conflict of interest, to be promoting BHP in various countries around the world while you hold shares in it.

        Maybe if you were in the old Somoza regime in Nicaragua that would be an acceptable practice, but not in a First World, OECD nation. It will be looked on as a pretty shaky operation—in particular, when he is threatening to take the Americans to the World Trade Organisation, which would help BHP. Imagine what they would say in America, after Mr Costello's extraordinary performance leaking on Mr Greenspan. We now have an example of the trade minister owning shares in BHP and on their behalf threatening to take the Americans to the World Trade Organisation. This is an astonishing conflict of interest.

        Finally, if there is no conflict of interest, if Mr Howard is right with these two ministers, Moore and Fischer, why are they selling their shares? Even if it is late, even six months on, if there is no conflict of interest why are they selling their shares? They know that unless they sell the shares, even as late as it is, they cannot get out of the jam that they have placed themselves and their government in. The only thing we need now is two more resignations—that of Moore and Fischer.

So you attack honourable people like Senator Short and Senator Gibson, who have, I would submit, technically breached some guidelines which in my considered view need a great degree of reconsideration. Honourable people like that find themselves in the position of having to resign—but somebody as disgraceful and disgusting as the member for Fremantle can lie under oath and retain her ministerial commission. That is the difference between the standards of the government and those of the opposition in this place. I look forward to the review, and I look forward to the review including the guideline that once somebody is found to have lied under oath they will have to resign their ministerial commission.

        We are aiming to eliminate hollowness in Army units, thereby reducing the overall number of units, and redistributing personnel and equipment so that all established units can deploy within shorter readiness times.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We will increase the number and effectiveness of combat troops by strengthening the contribution of Reservist or Part Time soldiers. Most Reserve personnel will have an initial six weeks full time training. Thereafter, ongoing training will be increased to an average of 50 days per year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Infantry, armour, artillery and engineers will be integrated into Task Forces. This principle is known as embedding. The resulting forces will be independent and largely self&amp;hyphen;contained. They will be able to deploy to different regions in Australia and to defend these areas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We will create a base for adopting new technology to modernise the force. We will develop proposals for acquiring new equipment aimed at increasing the mobility and firepower of the force, including helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and more protected vehicles for infantry mobility.
       </para>

        Higher readiness elements will contain more Full Time personnel. We will ensure that Regular forces will be able to be deployed at short notice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The application of these principles will of themselves significantly increase Army capability. Capital equipment investment after the year 2000 will be guided by these principles as well as the lessons learned over the next few years, to further strengthen Army capabilities.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The shift from the traditional divisional structure towards flatter and more responsive Task Force structures will create units which will be flexible, capable of a range of independent operations and better able to operate in concert with the Navy and the Air Force.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reconnaissance, mobility and embedded firepower of the Task Forces should result in a versatile structure able to operate effectively in both widely dispersed and conventional operations.

         —These two statements before the Senate this afternoon are quite significant statements. They deal with the restructuring of the Australian army and a defence efficiency review. In the Australian army, which is to be restructured under these proposals, we have very many capable people and some very good capabilities and skills but, overall, we cannot put together at short notice an effective land combat force.

        The principal deficiencies are threefold, as identified by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan): there is a lack of personnel in a significant number of the combat units; we have long lead times or training times before units can be committed to operations; and there are significant shortages of basic equipment in many of the combat units—to say nothing of major shortages of advanced technology equipment, which is increasingly seen as essential on the battlefield.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is not an overnight collapse. It is certainly true that things have got a lot worse very quickly in the last 10 years, but the difficulties of creating an effective and affordable land force are very considerable. I do not think they have ever properly been addressed since the ending of the Second World War. Land operations, even with the highest of technology, are always manpower intensive, and you always require a large number of soldiers in comparison to the air force and the navy, particularly in a high technology age where the productivity of the individual member of the navy or of the air force can be really very high indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problems in creating an effective and affordable land force are enormous. I am not implying for one moment that the air force and navy are paragons of effectiveness at the present time. They certainly need some essential support in many ways but in some senses they are much closer to what we require from them than the army is at the present time.
       </para>

        <para first-indent="16">
         Technology has revolutionised the battlefield. Since the Cold War has ended we are faced with two additional factors. First of all, the range of circumstances under which a defence force might be used has expanded. Secondly, at the same time our Defence Force may well be required to stand alone as an Australian force in certain circumstances, whereas, formerly, up to the start of this decade, the certainty was that we would be acting in concert with similar forces from Western democracies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The consequences of this are really very considerable for the ADF. We have a very small defence budget—we spend under half, for example, of what our regional neighbours, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, China and South Korea spend per year as a fraction of our GDP. The minister proposes to overcome these difficulties by restructuring the land force elements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Basically, what is involved is that the brigade and divisional structure will disappear, to be replaced by task forces, which will roughly be about brigade size, but they will have their own slice of artillery and armour and increased mobility, both surface and air.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The magnitude of the changes is very considerable and costly. Because of the scale of the change, it is inevitable that it will be phased in over a number of years. While the government did a very great thing in holding the defence vote and not cutting it back the way its predecessors had each year, the commitment is that, while we hold that vote, we will not be able to increase it through the life of this parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The deficiencies in the numbers of personnel in the combat units will be addressed by reorganisation of regular units and expanding the role of the reserves. It is planned that the numbers involved in the combat force will increase. The deficiencies in equipment are to be rectified but the parliament should recognise that this is a very expensive process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For many years now, the reserve units, which at present comprise 60 per cent of the combat force, have had very little or no equipment of their own. They have operated on a basis of regional equipment pools, which they would draw on for their equipment when
         <break page="4287" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          they went on their annual camps and exercises. But if the capability of the reserves is to be increased, then that equipment has to be provided as of their own right for the units. That is a very expensive process that will require the expenditure of very considerable sums—and you are getting close to a billion dollars, in my judgment, to do that. You cannot put a precise figure on it—no&amp;hyphen;one can—but that is an inevitable expenditure that the country has to meet.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another fundamental objective of the review is to increase the readiness levels of the combat force. Readiness in itself is very expensive and, the higher the level of readiness of a defence unit, the more disproportionately the costs rise. We have one unit, the 3rd Brigade, the ready deployment force, which is at as high a state of readiness as it is possible to hold a unit. That owes its origins really to one of my friends and former colleague, Senator Sir John Carrick, who instituted some years ago the requirement that 3rd Brigade be held at the high level of readiness that it is at present. While there is no proposal at all to raise all the combat forces to a similar high level, the discipline of maintaining 3 Brigade at that high level of readiness will be maintained.

         The program is so big that it will be introduced in stages and there will be careful trial and evaluation of its implementation. In a program of this size it will be very surprising if there are not changes that have to be made in the light of the experience gained, but it is very important that the integrity of the evaluation program is beyond dispute and it is objective. I believe that it is imperative that the assessment of the trial program is carried out by people who are independent and not serving members of the ADF.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That expertise does exist in the Australian community. It is important that the assessment of the trial program is done very objectively and impartially. The parliament, in this statement, is presented with only a brief outline of what is envisaged—and I look forward very much to the details coming on the public record in due course and the debate that will follow in the parliament.

          The second statement of the minister, the defence efficiency review, is a very important step also. The review willl look at, in a general sense and very broadly, the whole of the management practices within the ADF. There is not an area in defence which is more deserving of scrutiny than that. I have no problem at all with the way the defence department goes about its operational duties or runs its combat forces. From the way the air force mans its squadrons, the navy its ships and the army its battalions, I think they are all in good shape, because the operational experience over the years has been developed and tested and we know it works.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There may be a few cases where people are over&amp;hyphen;ranked and could be dropped a rank, and we may be able to drop one or two personnel off various manning strengths in the light of changed equipment. But, by and large, that side of the house is in good shape. But navies, armies and air forces do not consist of combat units alone. They have to be supported by logistic and training establishments, acquisition planning groups and many other things. That is the area that has grown exponentially and at great cost to the effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In one sense, Canberra has become one vast swamp into which huge resources from the defence budget have been poured annually. If you look at the portfolio budget statements that came out last month for Defence, you find that army has an incredible figure of 571 lieutenant colonels or colonels in its establishment—that is for a very small force. We have in the air force something like 475 rank equivalents with the lieutenant colonel/colonel level, and 396 in the navy. There is no way these figures can be justified. The financial cost of this overmanning is vast. We have committees looking at committees looking at committees; we have highly ranked, highly trained officers, both civilian and uniformed, who simply lack the authority to make a decision. The system is very wrong and it is costing us hugely.

        I table for the information of Honourable Members, with a view to ratification by Australia, amended Protocol II and new Protocol IV annexed to the Convention on Prohibitions and Restrictions on the Use   of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (also known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention) of 10 October 1980. Australia is a party to the Convention and participated fully in the Review Conference which adopted amended Protocol II and new Protocol IV on 3 May 1996 and 13 October 1995 respectively. Protocol II deals with Prohibitions or Restrictions on Mines, Booby&amp;hyphen;Traps and Other Devices. Protocol IV deals with Blinding Laser Weapons.

        On coming to office, the Government ordered a review of Australia's policy on anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines. As a result of that review, the Minister for Defence and I announced on 15 April that Australia would support a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines, a policy we promoted at the final session of the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference when it met in Geneva shortly thereafter. The new policy also suspended the operational use of anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines by the Australian Defence Force. While Australia has not used landmines operationally for over 20 years and had never used them except in strict conformity with international legal and humanitarian norms,  it was appropriate for a country with Australia's strong humanitarian record to demonstrate leadership on this issue.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This new policy was and is a major achievement in foreign policy and humanitarian terms. It took Australia to the forefront of the international community's efforts to rid the world of these insidious weapons which kill or main some 30,000 people a year. Since our announcement, other countries—notably the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and New Zealand—have moved their national positions in directions which we hope will contribute to the international momentum in favour of a total ban.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I believe that tragedies caused by the indiscriminate use of anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines concern all Australians who have a conscience. I have received, both in Opposition and in Government, an enormous amount of correspondence from people urging Australia vigorously to pursue a total ban.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We were disappointed that a total ban was not achieved in Geneva. But the Conference did adopt an amended Protocol II which contains much stronger restrictions, prohibitions and other norms and thus provides greater protection for civilians and peacekeeping forces than does the existing Protocol to which Australia is already a party. It is an agreement worth having. And while it does not go as far as we wished on anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines, it is nevertheless a first step in the process towards a total ban.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fact is that Protocol II of the Inhumane Weapons Convention is the only international legal instrument governing the use of and trade in landmines. In the absence of a complete ban on anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines, the revisions to Protocol II of the Convention provide interim measures which will lessen the devastating effects of these appallingly misused weapons. It is also the only international instrument restricting the use of anti&amp;hyphen;vehicle and anti&amp;hyphen;tank mines and so will remain important regardless of when a total ban on anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines is achieved.

        The new measures embodied in the revised Protocol are as follows:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, the humanitarian restrictions in the revised Protocol are considerably stronger—excessively injurious mines are specifically prohibited, anti&amp;hyphen;sensing devices and non&amp;hyphen;detectable mines are banned, the need to discriminate between military and civilian objectives is further emphasised and advance warning must be given of the use of all weapons covered by the Protocol.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We believe the aforementioned new provisions will reduce the blatant use of anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines as weapons of terror.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Third, new prohibitions and restrictions on the transfer of mines will help impede the acquisition of prohibited mines and the acquisition of mines by states which are not party to the Convention or do not agree to apply the norms it embodies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Fourth, the rules relating to fencing, marking, recording and monitoring of manually placed landmines and the self&amp;hyphen;destruction/self&amp;hyphen;deactivation standards required of this type of mine have been tightened.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Sixth, the Protocol provides for annual meetings of the States Parties and a second Review Conference in 2001—measures strongly promoted by Australia as a means of maintaining pressure for a total ban and for further strengthening of the Protocol as an interim  measure.

        Seventh, the Protocol provides for penal sanctions against those violating the Protocol.

        And finally, a number of technical improvements should make a practical difference in the field, such as a standard sign warning of anti&amp;hyphen;personnel landmines and a requirement that mine records be kept at a level of command sufficient to ensure their safety.

        For the reasons I have just outlined, the arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of our early ratification of this revised Protocol.

        In addition, as I announced at the 51st United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, Australia is interested in working with other countries to seek to improve de&amp;hyphen;mining technology, with a view to increasing the rate and scale of the de&amp;hyphen;mining process.

        The bill provides for this government's programme of assistance to the states and territories for government and non-government schools for the 1997&amp;hyphen;2000 quadrennium. It succeeds the States Grants (Primary And Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 which authorised funding for the 1993 to 1996 funding period.

        The bill fulfils the government's commitments to promote excellence and achievement through the provision of quality education and prepare our young people for an active and productive life both in the workforce and as participating citizens in the community and global economy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill fosters a partnership approach with states and territories which recognises both the constitutional responsibility of states and territories for education and the Commonwealth's role in guiding national directions and priorities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The main theme of the bill is the importance of choice in providing for improved educational outcomes for Australian students. The bill further supports the devolution of decision making about education to parents and communities to ensure that education is responsive to student needs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        To support these changes, the bill will appropriate in excess of $14 billion for the coming quadrennium under a rationalised set of programmes which this government believes best meets the needs and aspirations of those in school-level education. The major part of this funding will continue to be directed to the general recurrent and capital grants programmes. The government has, however, decided to replace a complex array of more than 40 school-related programmes of targeted assistance by a streamlined set of 5 programmes, namely:

        A strong determination to secure the foundations of effective learning is behind the government's policy of ensuring that all students are provided with literacy and numeracy skills.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Illiteracy is the worst form of poverty and a blight on society. The government's literacy programme of more than $150 million annually is one of the government's most important equity programmes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The literacy programme subsumes the general support element of the English as a second language programme and the disadvantaged schools programme. It will also replace the early literacy programme which was due to end in 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Funding is to be provided under the literacy programme for a new national literacy and numeracy strategy directed at improving the literacy and numeracy skills of school leavers. The bill will appropriate some $45 million for this purpose for the next three years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many young people, especially those who are educationally disadvantaged, leave school without the literacy and numeracy skills essential for further study or sustained employment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Two factors will ensure the strategy's relevance to the problems being faced by young people. First, it will draw upon the results of the national schools English literacy survey which are scheduled to be released early next year. Secondly, it will identify best classroom practice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All of this will underpin progress towards Australia's first national literacy goal—that every child leaving primary school should be able to read, write, spell and communicate at an appropriate level. Progress towards this goal will be measured by national literacy benchmarks at year three and

        The languages programme, which is the second in the group of priority initiatives, and for which more than $100 million is included in the bill, provides funding for the national Asian languages and studies in Australian schools strategy and for the teaching of community and priority languages.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the languages programme is directed at the teaching of a wide range of languages other than English, it gives particular emphasis to Asian languages and cultural studies.

        Clearly, it is important to the development of Australia's trade relations for businesses in this country to have leaders and staff who are proficient in Asian languages and who have an understanding of Asian cultures.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The special learning needs programme, which is the third priority initiative, includes funding for three tightly targeted areas addressing the needs of clearly identified clients. These areas are:

        The bill contains some $636 million over four years for the special learning needs programme. The programme will have as its objective the full participation in schooling of students with specific educational needs and the subsequent realisation of their maximum potential in the workforce.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Returning to the theme of choice, the broadbanding effected by this bill, which has brought together a number of related programmes, will give schools a degree of flexibility in determining their priorities which they have never had before. Schools will be able to respond to the changing needs of students and direct their resources to achieving the best possible learning outcomes for their students.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to the literacy, languages and special needs programmes, which are directed at particular needs in the school community, the bill also provides in excess of $11 billion for general recurrent grants and some $1.2 billion for capital grants, including an additional $30 million for non&amp;hyphen;government schools capital grants.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fourth priority initiative which I mentioned earlier, and for which funds will be included in other legislation, is the school to work programme. This programme is intended to make the transition from school to work a natural and successful process for all students.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The final initiative, which will be covered by the appropriation bills, is the quality outcomes

         programme. This initiative unites a number of programmes directed at teacher development, the civics and citizenship programme and the projects of national significance programme. The unified programme will provide a sharper focus on the achievement of quality outcomes in schooling while giving recognition to the fact that teachers play a key role in the academic and social development of children.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is vital that teachers have access to quality and regular professional development opportunities to enhance their expertise and professionalism and the programmes contained in the bill will allow for that to occur.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Emphasising the theme of choice, this bill legislates a new and more equitable policy for non-government schools seeking Commonwealth funding. This policy replaces the attempts of the previous government to impose a bureaucratic, unfair and inequitable burden on non&amp;hyphen;government schools seeking Commonwealth funding.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The application process under the previous government's new schools policy was bound in red tape as was the process for reviewing the funding category of those schools already in receipt of funding.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Furthermore, the labor government's new schools policy confined non-government schools approved for funding since may 1988 to a maximum funding level of category 6. This arbitrary restriction has jeopardised the existence of many deserving schools worthy of a higher level of support from governments. It also restricted parental choice in non-government schooling for their children, especially for low income families.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This government's policy for newly commencing schools will make a school's entitlement to Commonwealth funding primarily dependent upon state or territory government recognition. There will, of course, be a requirement that schools be run by an incorporated body, be non&amp;hyphen;profit-making and enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth. Non&amp;hyphen;government school funding will, however, be both simple and equitable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government believes that parents should have the choice between schools in both the government and non&amp;hyphen;government sectors and between schools in each sector. The government has no preconceived ideas about the size of either sector. It is important that Australia has a strong government school sector and a strong non&amp;hyphen;government school sector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The cost to the Commonwealth of a student attending a non&amp;hyphen;government school is more than the cost of a student attending a government school. Conversely, the cost to a state or territory of a student attending a government school is more than
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the cost of a student attending a non&amp;hyphen;government school.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This, coupled with the fact that the proportion of students in non&amp;hyphen;government schools has increased from 24.4 per cent in 1983 to 29 per cent in 1995, has meant that states and territories have had the potential to cost shift and save on the education of students in government schools.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Against this background, the government has decided to preserve for the Commonwealth 50 per cent of net recurrent savings to a state or territory from students shifting from the government to the non&amp;hyphen;government sector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Grants to the states and territories for government schools will reflect the choices of parents between government and non&amp;hyphen;government schools. This decision is to be effective from January 1997 and operate at least for the 1997&amp;hyphen;2000 quadrennial programme for schools.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many of the provisions of the bill are familiar, as they also appeared in the States Grants (Primary And Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. Those provisions have been placed in a more rational structure. This is a reflection of the grouping of some of the previous programmes into the 5 priority initiatives I referred to earlier. It also reflects efforts to reduce the amount of repetition prevalent in the previous act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For the first time, the bill contains provisions to ensure comprehensive reporting on the application of financial assistance provided to schools. This will be achieved through a strengthened national report on schooling in Australia with a range of core data showing what our students are learning and where the greatest needs lie. This information will be a key factor in the Commonwealth's future policy responses in the area of schooling.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill provides the bulk of a 5 per cent increase in total Commonwealth funding for schools. In financial year terms this means an increase from $3.3 billion in 1995/96 to $3.4 billion in 1996/97. This demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that Australia's young people gain the best possible education opportunities to make the most of their future.

        The Government made election commitments to carers. It is now proposed to give effect to these commitments by changing the name of carer pension to carer payment and by extending from 10 to 20 hours per week, the number of hours that carers may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training without affecting their qualification for carer payment. There will also be an increase in the number of days in a calendar year, from 42 to 52 days a year, that a carer may temporarily cease caring without affecting their qualification for carer payment.

        Mr Deputy President, permit me to make some simple observations about this workplace relations bill.

Indeed, the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, of which I was secretary for a number of years, changed its objective from the old one of socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange to one of encouraging the creation of an economic and social order in which persons can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual

        It was against the background of those principles that I operated. It was at times at some considerable cost. In the 1960s there were a number of key unions which believed in what the government now believes, which is smashing conciliation and arbitration. They believed in exercising muscle to the extent that `survival of the fittest' was their motto. That, of course, had detrimental effects on those who were least able to withstand that sort of pressure.

        I am talking about my own state of Tasmania when, because of shipping disputes and the like, that state was held to ransom. It fell to me and the council, and the supporters that we had in the council, to uphold fairness and justice for the workers of Tasmania against those who were attempting to smash arbitration—principally the unions in the shipping and wharf area. But they were very often assisted by their employers because the stevedoring industry was a cost&amp;hyphen;plus industry, and the greater the cost, the bigger the plus for the employers.

        As far as I was concerned, I believed that there should be balance and fairness, and we should not operate on the basis of the spoils going to the fittest; that is to say, the survival of the fittest. In fact, in many of those years the whip hand was held by the trade union movement because in many of the industries there was scarcity of labour. Now of course the government appears to look around and see that there is not that scarcity of labour, that there is a surplus of labour in many areas and that the employers do have the whip hand.

        Another aspect is the allowable items which are down to 18 conditions. I do not quite see how this will ultimately be regarded as constitutional.

         —in reply—The debate over the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill in the Senate over the last few days has been characterised by a large number of inaccurate and misleading statements by the opposition. I will be able to deal with only a few of these statements in the time available.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to begin by addressing some of the more general attacks that we have heard on the government's reforms. In particular, four statements by the opposition misrepresent the content of the bill and the intent of the government. They wrongly claim that the legislation represents a fundamental attack on the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.They wrongly claim that the legislation represents a fundamental attack on the award system. They wrongly claim that it represents a fundamental attack on the rights of workers to participate in collective action. And they wrongly claim that the government is aiming to force workers currently under awards and collective agreements onto individual contracts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Turning to the first of these wholly unfounded assertions, Senator Sherry, among many others, claimed that the workplace relations bill represents an attack on the independence of the AIRC. He is wrong. It is not the government's policy to attack the commission. Rather, the government proposes making a series of changes to the role of the commission and, in some cases, actually enhancing the commission's role.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The changes to the role of the commission are consistent with the other changes shifting the emphasis of the system to agreement making. While there will be less emphasis on arbitration, the commission will maintain an award safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions, including through determining claims for safety net adjustments. It will also oversee the award simplification process and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         review awards to ensure provisions are flexible, easy to understand, non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory and geared to the needs of individual workplaces and enterprises.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The commission's conciliation role will continue and it will have an important responsibility to encourage the making of agreements between employers and employees at the enterprise and workplace levels. The commission will have a strengthened mediation role. As part of the conciliation process, the parties will be able to request the commission to make a recommendation in relation to matters that they cannot agree on. There will be an express provision requiring the commission to make recommendations in such circumstances and where it is satisfied that the parties will comply with the recommendation. If such a recommendation is ignored, the commission will be able to refrain from dealing with matters involving that party—an end of formal bargaining period for a certified agreement—which would end the parties' rights to take protected industrial action.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The commission will have stronger and clearer powers to stop or prevent industrial action. It will have the power to make orders to deal with disputes between registered organisations over the representation of workers where a business is being adversely affected. It will also have the power to resolve disputes where all attempts to reach an agreement have failed and the disputes threaten serious harm to the community or the economy. In addition, the commission will have responsibility for unfair dismissal matters in the federal jurisdiction. I repeat: this is not a weakened commission or a less independent one, but it is a commission whose role has changed consistent with other changes proposed in the bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second claim made by Senator Sherry is that the workplace relations bill represents a major attack on the award system. Once again, this is not the case. The proposed legislation is not designed to attack the award system; rather, it is designed to ensure that the award provides an effective safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions. At the same time it maintains the focus of the overall system of award making at the enterprise or
        <break page="4299" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         workplace level. Awards will continue to provide minimum wages and conditions and the AIRC will have jurisdiction to determine safety net adjustments.

        Consistent with our policy set out in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Better pay for better work
        </emphasis>
        , awards will be simplified. This will involve limiting the matters to be included in awards and ensuring that they are more flexibly expressed, with other matters to be determined at the workplace and enterprise levels.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Award simplification is important. It is important in encouraging employers and employees to agree at the workplace about matters of detail or process that are best settled at the workplace level. It is crucial to deliver flexibility in how award provisions are to apply. It is part of a broader process of encouraging dialogue at the workplace about ways of increasing productivity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Award simplification is not—I repeat, not—a device to reduce wages or key conditions. The allowable matters to be included in awards will cover all key matters relating to pay, allowances and conditions of employment. In addition, awards can include provisions that are incidental to these allowable matters and essential for the effective operation of the award. Labor broke its promise to simplify awards which it made in March 1993 and again in its Working Nation statement of 1994. This government will meet its promise of a simpler, more efficient award system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well as criticisms of the award simplification process, there has been a lot of propaganda suggesting that teachers, nurses and other employees currently covered by paid rates awards will be made worse off when they move to minimum rates awards. The truth is they will not have their wages cut if their paid rates awards are phased out over time and after consultation with the parties. The process of converting these awards to minimum rate awards will occur consistent with the government's guarantee on take home pay and will be overseen by the commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         One of the main reasons that paid rates awards are no longer necessary is that many of the workers covered by paid rates awards have already entered into workplace or enter prise agreements. For this reason, their paid rates awards no longer specify their actual rate of pay. This is the case for many teachers and nurses. In this era of workplace bargaining, the government believes there is no need to continue with different types of awards for different groups of workers. It is true that all awards, including paid rates awards, will be simplified in their scope and reviewed to streamline their operation. But this will not involve reducing the level of existing entitlements for the allowable award matters.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third claim made by the opposition is that the workplace relations bill represents a fundamental attack on the rights of workers to participate in collective action. The opposition is wrong here, too. The government is not attacking the rights of workers to participate in collective action or attacking the legitimate role of unions; rather, the government's policy is about giving employers and employees choice in how they handle industrial relations in the workplace.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The workplace relations bill will provide employees with the right to take collective industrial action in appropriate circumstances. Consistent with accepted principles of collective bargaining, the legislation preserves the right to take industrial action in relation to genuine bargaining for agreements. At the same time, the public will be protected against any strike action that threatens health, safety or lives. In this way, the legislation provides a fair balance and protects the interests of employers, employees and the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to union membership, the government believes that, just as workers should be free to join a union, so they should be free not to join. The government is also ensuring that if workers choose to join a union, they have a choice about which union they join. The bill will make membership of all organisations truly voluntary. Compulsory unionism and preference will be prohibited. This will be achieved by removing matters which relate to preference from the jurisdiction of the AIRC.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Unions will still have right of entry to workplaces. However, the proposed legislation will ensure that this right operates within
        <break page="4300" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         reasonable limits and is not abused. Similarly, Australian workplace agreements are not about keeping unions out of the bargaining process; rather, they are about providing workers with more choice. Unions can still represent employees if employees want them as their bargaining agents. However, uninvited union involvement will be excluded. The new options available in terms of bargaining agents will lead to greater competition and encourage unions to provide better service to members.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fourth claim made by the opposition is that the workplace relations bill is aimed at forcing workers currently under awards and collective agreements onto individual contracts. This claim is again incorrect. The workplace relations bill is about providing employers and employees with much greater choice about how to regulate their relationships. It puts the emphasis on direct workplace relationships and on the mutual interest of the employer and the employee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        More direct employment relationships will give enterprises the flexibility to change and adapt to circumstances and maintain a competitive edge. At the same time, such relationships will enable employees to formalise arrangements which deliver the flexibility that they want. This is not a one size fits all system; it allows people—employers and employees—to tailor arrangements to suit them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under this bill the options for agreement making will be significantly expanded and simplified. The parties will be able to choose whether they want informal over&amp;hyphen;award arrangements or whether they want to formalise their agreements. They will also be able to choose whether they want to negotiate collective agreements with or without union involvement or negotiate individual agreements. If they choose the latter, they will be able to decide whether to bargain themselves or seek the services of a bargaining agent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, all formal agreements will be subject to statutory requirements to ensure that employees are protected. The bill also includes significant protection against an employee being forced to sign the new form
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well as the general claims made by the opposition in this debate, there are a number of specific claims that need to be firmly rebutted. The first of these is the claim by a number of opposition senators that the proposed principal object for the new act does not put sufficient emphasis on fairness and the interests of employees. The proposed legislation is clearly based on a fair go for all so that the system is appropriately balanced and delivers benefits for both employees and employers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The objects are not aimed at taking sides. Instead, they are aimed at providing avenues for mutual choice, mutual commitment and mutual benefit. The objects of the new act will focus the role of awards on minimum standards and the protection of the low paid; encourage the determination of terms and conditions of employment as far as possible by agreement between employers and employees, either individually or collectively, at the enterprise or workplace level; and protect freedom of choice in relation to agreement making and membership of employer and employee associations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A key part of the proposed principal object of the bill is `respecting and valuing the diversity of the work force' by helping to prevent or eliminate discrimination on specified grounds. There is also a new emphasis on assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second specific issue I want to address relates to our proposed amendments to section 152 of the existing Industrial Relations Act which provides employers and employees with greatest choice in relation to state and federal agreements. Senator Sherry has claimed that this amendment breaches the government's guarantee that no worker will be worse off as a result of the workplace relations bill. This claim is clearly nonsense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendment proposed to section 152 will prevent a federal award operating where employees currently have their employment regulated by a state employment agreement or where employees freely enter into a new state employment agreement. The amendment is
        <break page="4301" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         consistent with our election promise to allow employees and employers to choose the jurisdiction and the nature of their legal relationship. Contrary to some claims, employees will not be forced from federal awards onto state awards. For those who are covered by federal awards and who want to make agreements under a state jurisdiction, the legislation will provide access to such agreements.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third wild assertion that I wish to tackle was that made by Senator Foreman, who stated that the proposal for junior rates of pay means that people will be working for amounts that are no more than social security payments. As any reading of the bill shows, juniors, trainees and apprentices will not have their wages cut under the government's proposed new arrangements. The Industrial Relations Commission has established award rates of pay for these employees, and it is those rates that are incorporated into our system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Juniors will continue to be paid at the award rate prescribed for their age whether they are employed under an award or workplace agreement. That is, no change. Where there is an award rate of pay established for the particular traineeship, including a national training wage traineeship or an apprenticeship, that rate will continue to apply whether they are employed under an award or workplace agreement. That is, no change.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only area of change is for new traineeships and apprenticeships where currently there is no relevant training award rate of pay. That will generally occur because a new traineeship or apprenticeship with a different work&amp;hyphen;training mix has been developed under the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. For these, the wage will be the most relevant award rate adjusted for time spent in training. The principle that trainees be paid only for their productive work is already used in the national training wage, which was agreed to by unions and endorsed by the commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Where the training component is increased under a full-time traineeship or apprenticeship to a point where the wage falls below an appropriate level, the government will provide a top up to the weekly wage for MAATS
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         trainees employed under the new wage arrangements. The top up will be to the following guaranteed minimum levels for full-time apprentices and trainees: up to $128 for 16-year-olds, $158 for 17-year-olds and $195 for 18-year-olds and above.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These rates are based on the current minimum national training wage rates. The top up levels are substantially higher than the top up levels implemented for trainees by the previous government and agreed to by the ACTU. Our proposals in this area will not only protect current employment but also encourage more young people to take up traineeships. Under the Brereton laws, junior rates cease next year and some employers estimate this could cost young people 200,000 jobs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The final point I wish to make about the debate on the bill relates to claims by a number of senators that the government's reforms will adversely affect vulnerable employees. Specific concerns have also been raised about the bill's treatment of equal pay for work of equal value without discrimination based on sex and part-time employment. I want to assure the Senate that the government is committed to ensuring that all workers have fair access to the opportunities to be provided through this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Like all employees, these employees will be able to benefit from the broad set of changes outlined in the legislation. In particular, they will be able to negotiate agreements that reflect their individual circumstances. For example, workers with family responsibilities will be able to negotiate agreements which provide for more flexible working hours. Provision has been made for protection against discrimination in awards and agreements. In a particular case of pay discrimination, the proposed workplace relations act in combination with existing provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 will ensure that equal pay for work of equal value without discrimination based on sex applies to awards, agreements and over award pay.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="4302" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         Australia will continue to fully meet its international obligations in this area. Dismiss al based on a range of discriminatory grounds will continue to be unlawful. Awards will continue to provide a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions for all employees, and the AIRC will be required to have particular regard to the needs of the low paid when adjusting the award safety net. Employees will have a range of statutory protections when they choose to enter into agreements with their employers. The employment advocate will be there to provide advice and assistance to employers and employees who want to make use of our new flexibilities.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to part-time employees, the new workplace relations act will ensure that employees have access to part-time work on a regular basis with pro rata benefits. Employers and employees of the workplace and enterprise level will be able to agree to regular part-time agreements. Also, outdated award restrictions on regular part-time employment will be removed from awards.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many unions have opposed the introduction of regular part-time work. Others have included restrictions such as limits on maximum and minimum weekly hours and quotas designed primarily to protect the interests of full-time workers. Workers who have preferred regular part-time employment of more or fewer hours than allowed for in awards are therefore forced to remain in full-time work, to accept casual employment or to remain outside the paid work force. The new act will increase the opportunities for employees to work less than full-time hours while having predictable work hours, greater job security and access to the conditions enjoyed by other permanent employees on a pro rata basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In conclusion, it needs to be stressed yet again that, despite the assertions made by the opposition, the workplace relations bill will provide significant benefits to Australian workplaces and will provide increased opportunities for flexibility for both employers and employees. In addition, by creating opportunities for innovative enterprise agreements that improve productivity, all Australians will be the winners.

         —I rise on behalf of the opposition and, I believe, the large majority of Australians to oppose the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. A majority of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee made a number of recommendations, of which the fundamental one was that Telstra should not be sold.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In this bill, we have a proposal by the government to sell one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra—for approximately $8 billion, the government's estimate—and one&amp;hyphen;third of that will be sold to foreign interests. The Senate committee report on this bill made it quite clear in a number of areas that this bill is unnecessary and that this public asset is worth keeping in public ownership for a range of social and economic reasons.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One thing that surprised all the members of the opposition, including the Democrats, on the Senate committee was that we waited for the government to produce a major reason—major empirical evidence—to justify the sale of Telstra. And we waited and waited.

        DOCA, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), Telstra, the finance department and other supporters of privatisation ended up quoting one report, the 1992 World Bank report

         Privatisation: the

          lessons of experience

        </emphasis>
        . DOCA's submission described the World Bank report as `perhaps the most compelling overall review of the effects of privatisation and its relationship with liberalisation'. DOCA also said `this is the only comprehensive study we are aware of that covers a range of privatisations and also attempts to analyse the outcomes on the basis of comparisons to reasonable counterfactuals in each case'.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Department of Finance also placed great significance on this report, referring to it as a major study and quoting at length from its conclusion.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What does the 1992 World Bank report refer to? It refers to 6,800 privatisations around the world in about the last decade and a half. Of these, 4,500 were in the former German Democratic Republic, the old East Germany, and 6,100 were in Eastern Europe altogether, Latin America and the Caribbean. As an example of the benefits accruing from the privatisation, the study pointed to `a previously near moribund textile company in Niger,' `a finance company in Swaziland' and `an agroindustrial enterprise in Mozambique'. Just 170 of the 6,800 privatisations occurred in OECD countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Other studies relied on by supporters of privatisation included—and this is a classic list—the Polish cement and lime sector, the Odessa meat company, the Swarzedz Furniture Company in Poland, the Trinidad and Tobago Methanol Company, textiles in Tunisia and—the one that tops the whole list—privatisation in Haiti.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have to say that for a report to rely on the privatisation in Haiti as an example of why you should privatise Telstra really is one of the most extraordinary arguments I have heard. We know that for about a century or more Haiti has relied on voodoo philosophy. Now we have the minister relying on voodoo economics from Haiti to justify the sale of Telstra, a profitable company, in a First World economy, by comparing it with Haiti, a Fourth World economy that has been through more unfortunate experiences than most of us care to recount.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those reports clearly showed all the time that privatisation occurred where companies were not profitable. In the Third World, all
        <break page="4304" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         these thousands of companies overwhelmingly were privatised because they were losing large amounts of money. So what is the comparison with Telstra? Telstra is not a loss making company. It is a profitable company, performing very well in public ownership. It was performing very well when the previous government introduced the GBE reforms to how publicly owned companies should run themselves, and of course has since the introduction of competition in 1991&amp;hyphen;92 by the previous government. Every proponent of privatisation admitted under oath at the inquiry into the sale of Telstra that the most significant improvement occurs when you introduce competition. The privatisation issue is really only a little bit on the side where a few percentage points may occur.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I questioned the Department of Finance and DOCA, could they give us examples of the advantage of privatisation over and above competition from any experience in the world that is measurable? We got two stunning examples: two electricity companies in Chile in the early to mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, when the Pinochet dictatorship, noted for its human rights abuses, was running Chile. They were the only two examples the finance department, DOCA and Telstra could come up with to justify some advantage to privatisation in improving efficiency. In one of the cases, the improvement appeared to be no more than 1&amp;half; per cent improvement in productivity. In another case, they said one of the things that privatisation brought about was a reduction in the theft rate in one of those companies in Chile. I must say I have never seen any evidence that theft in Telstra from its own employees is a major problem that has had to be addressed. I have not seen any large numbers of Telstra employees being dragged off to the courts because they are consistently thieving from Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are the absurd examples this government and its departments have relied upon to justify the privatisation of Telstra. Telstra is a profitable company. On 13 September, Telstra announced a profit after tax, abnormals and minority interests of $2.3 billion for the year ended 30 June 1996. On the day these massive profits were announced,

        Mr Ian Martin from BZW, a company strongly in favour of privatisation, gave evidence accordingly before the Senate committee. He said:

        On a range of benchmarks, Telstra stacks up very well against overseas companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telstra's pretax return on capital for 1993&amp;hyphen;94 was 22 per cent; world's best practice is over 20 per cent. In 1994&amp;hyphen;95, return on investment was 21.8 per cent and in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 it increased to 22.9 per cent. Telstra's interest cover for 1993&amp;hyphen;94 was 5.3 times; world's best practice is over 5.5 times. In 1994&amp;hyphen;95, Telstra's interest cover increased to 8.3 times and, in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, it was 8.6 times. This indicates that Telstra is continually improving its capacity to service its debt. Telstra's debt ratio was 35.5 per cent in 1993&amp;hyphen;94 and world's best practice is 35 per cent. The debt ratio improved from 35 per cent in June 1995 to 30 per cent in June 1996—a significant improvement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have heard some advocates of privatisation saying that the problem with Telstra is that its debt is too low. This comes from a government which is saying that our national debt is too high, yet they are saying that Telstra is not performing well enough because its debt is too low. That is an extraordinary contradiction. We ought to congratulate Telstra for having a debt well below the average debt of similar telecommunications companies.

       <break page="4305" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra's return on average equity for 1993&amp;hyphen;94 was 18 per cent; world's best practice is over 17 per cent. It was 17.9 per cent in 1994&amp;hyphen;95 and 1995&amp;hyphen;96. So again that is an international measure. Telstra's credit ratings are amongst the highest of any major Australian company; this has enabled Telstra to access low cost borrowings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All in all, we have in Telstra a company that on a number of international measures is already one of the world's best. Telstra is performing at a rate that we should all be very proud of. Its contribution to national revenues is significant. In fact, I think last year Telstra's profit was bigger than the revenue we gained from the capital gains tax, and the way the profit is anticipated to grow will mean that within a few years it may well equal the revenue we get from the fringe benefits tax. So Telstra is making a major contribution to revenue whilst providing a better and better service to the Australian people.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We also want to point out that privatising monopolies is not without risk. Whatever people may say about a public monopoly, at least it is in public hands. For the future, even under the changes that will be made from July next year when we have a more deregulated market, Telstra will still be the dominant player in providing telecommunications services to anywhere between 85 and 90 per cent of the Australian public.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even those people who came before the Senate committee arguing for privatisation said that, for the foreseeable future, Telstra will be the dominant provider of telecommunications in this country. Yet, if it is the dominant player, is it not much better to keep that dominant player in public ownership and responsible through the minister and estimates hearings to the Australian Parliament in regard to the services it is providing? Once it becomes privatised, those oversight arrangements come to an end.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra will be the biggest dominant player in our economy. We believe that is a major reason why such a dominant player should be maintained in public ownership for the benefit of ordinary Australians. Then, should they have a query about the way it is being run or
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          about its performance, or should there be issues of concern, questions can be asked of the minister in this parliament.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Madam Acting Deputy President, I also want to deal with the sort of telecommunications system this country will have in the future. There is no doubt that early in the next century access to broadband services will be a major issue for the social and economic equity of this country. New definitions, such as information poor and information rich, which have already come to light, will be commonly used. If you have access to broadband services you will have advantages in the way you conduct yourself and in the way you will have economic opportunities within our society. If you do not have the ability to connect with these new broadband services, you will be economically disadvantaged.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With Telstra in public ownership we can ensure that all Australians will have access to a reasonable telecommunications system because, when parliament and the minister direct Telstra, it will be carried out. Once the power of direction, the power of effective oversight, by the parliament is given up, we will no longer be able to guarantee that all Australians will get the new range of services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Telstra committee of inquiry recommended, for example, that universal service obligations should be amended to guarantee, instead of it being a local phone connection on a copper pair, that it should be a bandwidth of 64 kilobits per second. That is the start for everybody to be on the information superhighway.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         People in regional Australia will not get this level of connection. When you ask Telstra and Optus—who are rolling out cable for broadband services in the major cities of Australia—they will tell you they have no plan to do this in Tasmania or in regional Australia. As a result, we will end up with a two&amp;hyphen;tiered system. If you are fortunate enough to live in a socio&amp;hyphen;economically rich suburb in Sydney or Melbourne you will probably get it; if you are unfortunate enough to live in a country town or in Hobart, Tasmania, you will be waiting a long time, whistling in the wind, to get that connection. To get that connection and service Telstra should be left
         <break page="4306" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in public ownership so that not only will its revenues pay a profit to the federal government but also so that capital works can be directed for the benefit of all Australians.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The next matter I wish to raise is the issue of industry policy. Telstra is a major purchaser of equipment in Australia. It has had that policy for decades. As a result, we have many manufacturing companies in Australia which not only have supplied top quality equipment to the Telstra system in Australia, but also are now being able to compete in the world market. I think that, last financial year, exports from Australia of such equipment totalled $600 million or $700 million—a threefold increase over the previous five years. They are getting into that market because Telstra gives critical mass to purchasing in Australia. That creates lots of high quality, effective jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Once you let private sector enterprise into Telstra—foreign interests, in particular overseas telcos—many of them will not want Telstra, which they are part owners of, competing with them in the new markets of Asia. It will be against their interests. As shareholders, and with directors on the board—even in a minority position—they will be able to influence an outcome. Because the minister's power of direction and influence is reduced under this bill, there will be no way to overcome it and say, `We want Telstra to be one of the major leading companies exporting services to the world and creating good quality jobs for Australians.' That is another area in which this bill is extremely deficient. It is silent about what will happen when Telstra is in private ownership.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Though we will get some argument that we are only privatising a third, we all know that the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, spilt the beans on all this about a month ago in a television interview, which he obviously came to regret. He said, `It is not only desirable, but it is inevitable that all of Telstra will be privatised.' The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) publicly admonished him for those remarks. He publicly said that he had rung the minister twice to point out that that was not the policy of the government. The Prime Minister was getting
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          worried at the minister's inability to convince the Senate to support the privatisation and that this may upset some independent senators in this place.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is quite clear that is on the agenda. Mr Costello made similar remarks overseas. He made it quite clear that if he could not get away with privatising it by legislative means, he might look it by non-legislative means. Again, this government is about full privatisation—privatisation that will lead to substantial job losses. The minister has announced at the estimates committee that he is quite happy that Telstra will get rid of 22,000 jobs over the next three years. That is a one&amp;hyphen;third downsizing of Telstra. Telstra itself said that this will improve the profit bottom line by $600 million a year within 12 months—$600 million profit!
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we have to have this downsizing under this government over the next three years, why don't we keep Telstra in public ownership so that that extra profit—which comes at the loss of 22,000 jobs—at least stays with the public; it at least goes into consolidated revenue and can be used, maybe, for education, health or, in particular, labour market reform programs for the 22,000 who have lost their jobs. Some of those 22,000 will overwhelmingly be in the rural areas of this country. The ones who will hit the fence are the service operators, the directory assistance personnel—all of which are operating very successfully in country regional centres. They are the ones who will get chopped by Telstra. That is what project Mercury said, even though it has now been denied.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra is an outstanding public asset of the Australian people. We on our side accept that there always will be some faults in Telstra, that there will always be need for improvement. There always should be. We should always look at ways to improve its performance, to improve its service to its customers, to improve the quality of its jobs for its employees and, above all, to improve its profit to the Australian people.

          Telstra should not be bagged, as it has been, by the minister and this government, who describe it as a 600&amp;hyphen;pound gorilla. They bag it as inefficient, saying that it is a shel tered workshop. Telstra is one of the most successful companies this country has ever seen, and it is in public ownership. It is delivering the goods for the Australian people. That is why this opposition will, in this bill, fight tooth and nail to oppose the privatisation of Telstra. We will fight it all the way through in this place, and we hope that enough senators see the commonsense view of maintaining Telstra in public ownership for the benefit of all Australians.

       I have no doubt that as the present custodians each of us wish to leave our community a better place than we found it. As I see it, the most compelling challenge facing us as a nation today is how to reconcile the need for fiscal responsibility with the provision of a meaningful and adequate safety net for the genuinely needy in an era of rapid technological and social change. To borrow the words of US economist, Arthur M.

       Perhaps at no time in Australia's history has the need to balance these competing notions been so important or so compelling. To respond to this, we need to step back from the siren calls coming from simplistic feelings of fear, prejudice and misunderstanding. What Australians demand of us as legislators and what the community is entitled to have is an examination of the concept of what the community aims to be and wants to pass on to our children. In a fair society, those aims find expression in access to minimum standards of education, employment, health, housing and a decent standard of living for its citizens.

       The problems that face Australia today and over the next decade are intertwined. We need to take a holistic picture of the Australian community of the future. What education do citizens need? What level of education can we afford? What jobs will be available? What will be the requirements of a physically and socially healthy community? Inappropriate solutions for education now will necessarily aggravate the problems of lack of employment opportunities and lack of employment impacts on community health. It is only by devising appropriate solutions to all these problems that we can achieve a fair society.

        Let us start with education. Are our policies well designed to ensure that the students of today are getting an education that will best enable them to obtain employment in areas where jobs will be available? In order to ensure that we train students appropriately, it is necessary to determine the likely employment picture of the future. The future of work and how we deal with unemployment and the unemployed are critical to our vision of the future—about the place we want Australia to be. Unemployment, lack of security, declining living standards and pressure on resources profoundly affect the balance of equity and efficiency. In addition, the social cost of unemployment on families and relationships is often overlooked or hidden. It affects not only individuals but all too often third parties who are the victims of crime and drug abuse born out of hopelessness and despair.

        Not only does Australia currently have close to one million people unsuccessfully seeking paid employment but, as well, unpublished ABS figures show that almost a quarter of those in employment work in casual jobs. One in four casual employees would undertake more work if it were available.

        The composition of the work force has also changed dramatically. Staying in one job for the whole of one's working life is no longer a reality. In its final report in May 1996 the Commission for the Future of Work identified the increase of women in the work force from 51 per cent to 62 per cent in the last 15 years as providing the most significant change in work force participation. The increase, however, is predominantly in part-time or casual work, which no doubt reflects the relentless need of most women to juggle work and family responsibilities as much as it reveals the type of available work.

Figures published by the commission show that almost half of unemployed people are under 30 and young people aged between 20 and 24 years of age comprise the largest group of long-term unemployed. Of most concern in sharing the burden of unemployment equitably is the long-term rise in Australian families that simply have no `breadwinner' at all.

This may lead to widening inequalities between the skilled and unskilled, unless ways are found to train workers in the new technologies and to remove barriers to entry to new jobs.

        Few community needs can be as compelling or deserving of our national attention than the need for access to health care at an affordable cost. We have an ageing population. Not only that, but we are living longer than our forebears and the ratio of those working to those retired will be 40 per cent in a short 35 years. Australia spends 8.6 per cent of its GDP on health services. This is expected to rise to 10 per cent by the year 2000. Unless the health system undergoes fundamental reform it will not survive in its present form. More particularly, unless the private health insurance system, which currently meets about 12 per cent of health care costs and takes some pressure of the public health system, is overhauled, it will disintegrate. The inquiry by the Productivity Commission is timely. The questions seem to be how much of this cost can be shifted equitably to those who can afford to pay and how the costs can be contained.

Until more wealth is created and there are more jobs on offer, tightening family reunion requirements and expanding skilled business migration makes sense. It is difficult to see how newly arrived migrants can be expected to share the values, goals and aspirations of Australians if in coming here they remain dispossessed, poor and on the margins of society.

         Many of my constituents in Queensland are concerned about the excess of foreign ownership in large chunks of Australia's backyard.

         Part 2A sets out restrictions on foreign ownership of equity in Telstra. It will be unacceptable for foreign ownership to exceed 11.6 or 35 per cent of the partial sale. It will be unacceptable for one or more foreign person to take hold of more than a 1.6 stake in Telstra, which relates to five per cent of the equity on offer in the one&amp;hyphen;third sale.

         A foreign person is defined to mean a foreign citizen not ordinarily resident in Australia; a company in which any individual foreign person or company holds more than a 15 per cent stake; a company in which an ownership stake of 40 per cent or more is held by two or more foreign persons or companies; or a trustee of a trust estate in which foreign persons hold a substantial interest. Telstra's head office remains Australian; Telstra's chairperson and a majority of its directors must be Australian citizens.

         If an unacceptable foreign ownership situation comes to exist, the Federal Court, on application from the minister, may make appropriate orders to stop it, including ordering the disposal of shares.

There are even special incentives for individual Australians and Telstra employees to invest in their company, to personally share ownership in Australia's flagship telecommunications corporation.

          privatisation of Telstra, that any change in ownership will not affect their access to telecommunications services. This bill ensures in a number of ways that rural Australians will not be disadvantaged. Firstly, part 2C reaffirms the universal service obligations that already apply to Telstra and other telecommunications carriers under the Telecommunications Act. The universal service obligation requires a standard telephone service to be offered to all Australians. The untimed local call obligation already guaranteed will be retained for residential consumers. Price capping will continue to apply and general price surveillance will apply to other industry players.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On top of this, there are three newcomer safeguards. One is the extension to business of the statutory obligation to provide the option of untimed local calls. This has not been the law until now. The others are the customer service guarantee and the extension of Austel's power to make indicative performance standards. In the place of a voluntary connection and repair guarantee, the new customer service guarantee will be a legislated and mandatory requirement to apply to all carriers, backed up by stiffer penalties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Austel will have the power to determine performance standards in relation to the period taken to comply with the request for connecting and rectifying faults, and the keeping of appointments to meet customers for these purposes. Carriers will have to meet the standards and the statutory requirements or face an Austel determined scale of damages. Austel will report annually on how the carriers discharge their obligations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          Austel's existing power to develop indicative performance standards will also be widened to impose requirements on the industry in relation to most other billing matters. These include requirements to comply with Austel's specific billing standards to ensure timely, accurate and comprehensive financial information. There is a requirement for Austel to set up procedures for the generation of standard billing reports to be made available to customers on request, enabling independent analysis and audit of telecommunication bills. As a minority Senate com mittee report found, the Telstra bill will not in any way affect the legislative and other protection of directory assistance, timed local calls and the provision of public telephones, all of which will remain unaffected by this bill.

         The customer service guarantee and related provisions actually increase Telstra's accountability to and scrutiny by the public while, at the same time, Telstra will still have to report to parliament. The majority report from Labor and, I might add, the Australian Democrats, was illuminating. They found so many faults with the way Telstra is currently operating, it is a wonder they did not do something about it when they were in government. It is a case of selective amnesia with Labor senators forgetting the principles which guided their own privatisation effort.

         I was particularly struck by the way Labor and Democrat senators used the committee as an exercise to say that, far from selling part of Telstra, we should be giving it more money. Recommendation 13 of the majority report says that the committee recommends Telstra's operation be resourced up to a level which allows ongoing improvements in customer service quality. You have to ask: where is the money going to come from? Perhaps the answer is that we should borrow some more. Maybe Senator Kernot and her merry band of Democrats could allow us to take it out of the environmental vote. It is ludicrous when we are trying to restore some fiscal balance and alleviate government borrowings and interest repayments, as well as making massive investments in the environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition is suggesting that government find more money to resource Telstra. Then, in a bizarre twist, they also want to charge Telstra a levy. It is in recommendation 35. On the one hand, Telstra should be resourced up. On the other hand, it should be levied down. They propose so many regulations and qualifiers which would straightjacket the enterprising activities needed to ensure Telstra's survival. The partial privatisation will enable Telstra to increase its flexibility in response to market demands in what is a rapidly changing environment.

          We have to ask whether we would put lead in the shoes of a runner, but that is exactly what the Labor Party and the Democrats are advocating. The public benefit is not served by restraining full public ownership of Telstra. The public benefit is not served by ploughing more government funds into Telstra. The public benefit is not served by rejecting an opportunity to reduce colossal debt and restore the environment. Senator Meg Lees complains the government is being driven by economic fashion. I say to Senator Lees: if helping the environment and reducing debt while, at the same time, legislating for customer service guarantees is economically fashionable, then let's be in it. We want an Australian controlled Telstra out on the international catwalk parading Australia's competitiveness and winning market share. The Democrats and Labor would hide Telstra backstage and not allow it to present itself.

If someone provides it, the Democrats will be neither the government nor the opposition, yet they will sit on the crossbenches and tell all of us how it should be done.

But they are bogged down on some illogical concern and, although the basis of their party is concern for the environment, they do not appear the least bit interested in it.

        In the south&amp;hyphen;west of England there is hardly an empty farm shed that has not been gutted and therefore allowed some small business armed with an on&amp;hyphen;line computer, fax, phone, e&amp;hyphen;mail and Internet to carve out a business where communications is the key and the physical position of the operation is largely irrelevant. The situation is essentially the same in Australia. Because our country is so geographically enormous there is difficulty in providing communication services, the high costs of spreading a network, the diversity of our agricultural and regional businesses, the low density of population in some areas and the increasing number of companies that are in the information and communications industry.

        This government has already insisted on a dramatic speed&amp;hyphen;up of the availability of state&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;art communication services to the bush. Telstra has recently announced the acceleration of the national telecommunication exchange network to digital standard—the ISDN. This will be completed by 1998 and will cover over 97 per cent of the population. Telstra has said it will be upgrading the network at the same rate in both country and metropolitan areas. So city and country exchanges will be 85 per cent digital by December 1997.

        This is a first for country areas because regional Australia normally lags behind, which is hardly surprising, especially in view of the communication explosion that we have seen over the last 10 years or so and the fact that the previous government had little understanding of regional areas. Telstra is to be congratulated on providing these facilities which will allow for educational, cultural and information services, for much faster faxes, fast access to Internet, interactive multi&amp;hyphen;media functions such as video conferencing, faster and more reliable transmission with modern circuits, quicker dial&amp;hyphen;up times and better signal quality, small screen video conferencing, fast EFTPOS links, and much more.

The technological breakthrough will mean both business and domestic phone users will have access to the wide range of enhanced services that I have already mentioned.

They were: inadequate technical capacity of existing telecommunications infrastructure; high telecommunications prices; and restricted access to education, training and user support services. Dr Buckeridge says that Telstra will have to play a major part in the effective delivery of these services as it is by far the dominant owner and current builder of the telephone and data networks.

A continued commitment will be necessary from Telstra.

        In June, the National Farmers Federation conducted a survey to gauge farmers' opinion on the partial sale of Telstra.

In addition, the survey shows that a majority of 73 per cent believe that the partial sale should fund the proposed environmental package. The funding of the Natural Heritage Trust, in addition to the substantial funds allocated in this year's budget, will be very beneficial to all Australians, not just farmers.

         The new government has already shown itself keen to address regional Australia's telecommunications needs, quite apart from the proposed partial sale of Telstra. I would like to mention three initiatives. The first was the July announcement of the review of the standard telephone service. This review will focus on whether the current standard telephone service is adequate or should be up graded to accommodate new technologies such as fax and data transmissions and mobile phones, along with the cost implications.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The current definition of the universal service obligation within the Telecommunications Act 1991 provides for a minimum voice grade telephone service to be reasonably accessible to all Australians, wherever they live or wherever they carry on a business. However, there have been significant advances in technology since that legislation was passed and the community's expectations of access and availability have grown as a result. This review will clearly amend our understanding of what amounts to a standard telephone service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second initiative was the July announcement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, who launched the farmwide online services project. This is a trial project giving 1,000 people living in rural and remote areas cheap on&amp;hyphen;line services and Internet for $5 per hour and for the cost of a local call. This is a joint project of the NFF, the Department of Transport and Regional Development, Telstra, Microsoft and IBM. It is another initiative to provide people in rural and regional areas with access to information equivalent to that of their city counterparts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third initiative was Senator Alston's announcement in which he recently reassured rural mobile phone users that they will not be disadvantaged when the network is converted from analog to digital by December 1999. There is no doubt that at the moment the current analog network is superior to the digital network. It has a wider reach and it does not suddenly drop out, as is the case with some digital services. Senator Alston has said the government will ensure that the draft telecommunications bill will have a safety net for rural mobile phone users after the network is converted from analog to digital. This will preserve the mobile phone service of at least 3,000 mobile phone users who will lack digital coverage at the time of the phase&amp;hyphen;out.

       <para>
        I repeat that: making government funds available for new policy. This particular privatisation will provide additional funds for the environment. The environmental benefits of the sale should be particularly highlighted. The commitment to transfer $1 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust is the most comprehensive environmental package ever proposed by government. It is in addition to existing spending commitments in the budget on the environment. The money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust will be devoted entire

        The five capital projects to be funded from the money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust are: a national vegetation initiative; the Murray-Darling rehabilitation; a national land and water resources system; a comprehensive national reserve system; and a coasts and clean seas initiative. All interest earned from the trust will be devoted to recurrent expenditure on environmental projects and the further development of sustainable agriculture. Some of these projects include: additional funding for the Landcare project; a national river care program; a cleaner air program to address air pollution; and a national weed strategy. At the end of the five-year program, over $300 million will remain in perpetuity in the trust. All interest earned on the capital held in the trust will be devoted to environmental projects.

        In establishing the Natural Heritage Trust, the government is providing a certainty of funding over a long period of time that will be free of normal economic and budgetary constraints which all governments inevitably face. The trust will provide a commitment to the environment which is certainly preferable to a recurrent funding approach. We need look no further than the massive $10 billion debt that the government inherited from the now opposition. The budget has already made inroads into addressing that deficit, but to fund the much needed environmental programs from recurrent expenditure would require savings of a further $1 billion over the next five years. This would simply be too difficult for us to absorb at this time. Any alternative approach to the partial sale of Telstra and the simultaneous establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust would come at an extreme cost to either the environment or our national economy.

        To conclude, the partial sale of Telstra will expose it to the scrutiny of the market place, which will contribute to making it a more dynamic company, both domestically and globally. This will allow Telstra to operate on a commercial basis, rather than be forced to fulfil the ever changing political objectives of the government of the day.

         —Let me commence my contribution to the debate on the second reading of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 by indicating that this bill gives effect to the government's blackmail policy of flogging off our national communications carrier, Telstra, to pay for environment funding through the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, as announced by the coalition during the election campaign this year. The Labor Party, for its part, is committed to a 100 per cent government owned national communications carrier. We took that commitment to the last election. That has been a longstanding platform commitment of the Australian Labor Party.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We really made our position on this crystal clear during the last election campaign when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on 23 January this year: `Telstra is simply not for sale.' Unlike the government, this rabble over here with their core and non-core promises and commitments, we are going to stick resolutely by that commitment that our leader made during the election campaign.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As we all know, this legislation is not just about selling Telstra; it is also about holding environment funding in this country hostage to the sale of Telstra. We on this side of the chamber have always opposed and stand opposed to that sort of political thuggery. I believe that selling part or all of our national communications carrier—Telstra—worth some $24 billion, would be an act of gross irresponsibility in itself. For the government to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         claim that it will be a more competitive company after privatisation is just arrant nonsense.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Telstra has been corporatised, and it is already competing very successfully on the international market. It is fair to say that Telstra is a very strong, very vibrant company which achieved record profits of $3 billion in 1994-95. It is aggressively seeking and claiming new markets in Asia. Its value has increased from $18 billion when John Hewson wanted to sell it—remember him?—to around $24 billion now. It has employed an extra 11,000 people since 1993. We believe that, inevitably, a partial sale of Telstra would lead to its complete privatisation under a coalition government.

        The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has found it very hard to hide his intentions on this particular matter, while the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has not even bothered to try; neither did the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on his gaffe riddled trip to the United States of America. During the election campaign, Mr Howard promised that a third of the company would be sold in this term of government. That was his promise. But he never denied, nor did he at any stage rule out, that all the $24 billion resource would be flogged off in the longer term, including to non-Australian interests.

        This government cannot be trusted on this issue. They are trying to con this Senate and the Australian people into selling off part of one national asset to save another.

        I might say that they have failed to provide any good reason for the partial privatisation of Telstra. Their only defence has been one that the opposition finds thoroughly objectionable.

        The reality is that the coalition's Telstra environment policy was a sham. It was always a sham to con and blackmail the Senate into being part of the coalition's privatisation agenda. If the coalition were really serious about the environment, they would fund the environment off the budget, as we did in government and as we always will when we are returned to government.

        I remind the Senate that the initiatives and policies that are to be funded by the trust—the land and water degradation programs, the rehabilitation of the Murray&amp;hyphen;Darling Basin, national river care, the coasts and clean seas initiative and the national reserves cooperative program—are all essentially Labor's policies. They were stolen by the coalition for electoral reasons. The policies were ours, but the lack of commitment to those policies was uniquely yours. It was unique to the coalition. When it comes to the hard question of economic interest versus environmental protection, the coalition's true colours always shine through. They do not believe, and never have, in the protection of the environment. If they did, we would have had an environmental policy implemented well before now. John Howard showed his true colours in April 1992 when he said that Australia's economic progress was being held up by excessive concern for the environment and that this position was exacerbated by skewed media coverage of ecological issues.

He did not stand up to you, Senator Parer, when he attempted to abolish export control powers for minerals. He has been perfectly happy to give state governments veto powers over listing of World Heritage, and more than happy to support you, Senator Parer, in expanding uranium mining in Australia. He has done nothing—along with you, Senator Parer—in progressing the government's response to the greenhouse effect.

        What a miserable, pathetic, disgusting record for a minister after only seven months in office. After just seven months in office he has basically abrogated all responsibility on the environment and handed it willy&amp;hyphen;nilly to Senator Parer, the resources minister. The Telstra&amp;hyphen;environment link is a shabby link that has been concocted by this government to capture the support of the minor parties in this place. As I have indicated before, the dry agenda far outweighs the wet. I think the coalition failed in this shabby trick. It failed in the election campaign to convince the majority of Australians that this was a reasonable proposal. I have said before in this place that, without doubt, this was the biggest single negative that the coalition had in its election campaign.

         —I remind the Senate that Oscar Wilde remarked 100 years ago that the cynic knew the price of everything but the value of nothing. This is a government driven by economic rationalists who are the ultimate cynics when it comes to social policy and national development. While even these cynics might have some difficulty agreeing on the price of Telstra, Oscar Wilde's observation as to its value is remarkably apt. As far as Labor is concerned, Telstra is far too valuable to ever sell.

        The government has sought to bribe and blackmail the Australian conservation movement and others concerned about  Australia's environment by suggesting that we should accept ill-defined and illusionary short&amp;hyphen;term financial benefits from the sale of Telstra which themselves are overshadowed by the massive disadvantages to the Australian people and national development at large. It is important to ask: what is it that builds a nation? Nearly 100 years ago our federation came into being. It was just at the time Oscar Wilde was making his comments. Federation meant that all Australian citizens could be represented in one place and at one time.

        It is in the last few years that the mainland states of this nation were linked by a common railway. The previous railway system was a blight on our landscape and was a historical monument to our isolation and separatism. One of the first and most significant means of bringing this country and its citizens together was our telephone and postal services. The telephone network became the lifeline and the means by which Australians right across the country could keep in touch, could develop business links and could run public administration properly.

        The telecommunications industry that was built around the telephonic network has brought economic growth and thousands of jobs across this country. Labor's opposition to the sale of Telstra is based upon our recognition of the fundamental place that this

        It is based on a firm conviction that the government's claims about the benefits of the sale offered to the nation are illusory. Many will argue that the short-term budgetary implications for this sale would be of huge political benefit to the government. As far as I am concerned, the budgetary gains will be overshadowed by the long-term disadvantages that must attend the loss of such a profitable and strategically significant public asset. I say the `loss' of the asset because Senator Alston, I think, has made his point very clearly, and no-one in this chamber should be under any illusion about the real issues that we face today.

        Should this Senate endorse the process of the sale of one-third of Telstra, we will see ultimately the full privatisation of Telstra. As far as Labor is concerned, this country should not embark upon that course. Our resolve has only been strengthened by the evidence against privatisation presented to this parliament via its committee, that is, the inquiry into Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have seen that the case for privatisation is based essentially on rhetorical and ideological arguments rather than on any empirical evidence. Telstra is a highly successful company and its record $2.3 billion profit for this year clearly indicates that. Its financial performance is equal to that of its international peers. At the same time, it provides a unique service. Despite the difficulties presented by Australia's geography and its demography, Australian society has one of the highest levels of telephone access in the world.

        Telstra has played an important role in nation building through the provision of affordable communications services on a universal basis. It has pioneered research and development of international importance and has been a leader in the introduction of technologies such as ISDN and fibre optics. It has played a critical part in the growth of the Australian electronics industry. At the

        Its recent record $2.3 billion profit is sure to grow in future years. The industry is growing at 15 per cent per annum. New investment is set to grow at 22 per cent per annum, sales by 20 per cent per annum and exports at 38 per cent per annum. That, to me, indicates the value of Telstra to the Australian economy and it should not be diverted from the 100 per cent Australian ownership that it currently has. One hundred per cent of Australians currently own Telstra and currently enjoy the benefit of that public ownership.

        The government's main rationale for the sale—supposed private sector efficiency gains—clearly fail the test of public scrutiny, and that was clearly demonstrated by the Senate committee. Of the 650 submissions received and 135 witnesses examined, the only real supporters of the sale were government departments acting on the instructions of their political masters; the senior management of Telstra, who stand to gain substantial remuneration increases under a privatised regime; and, of course, government agencies who are under direct political control.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The main argument presented in evidence to the committee was based on a World Bank study which looked at some 6,800 cases. But there were no comparisons with telecommunications companies of equal value or equal profitability to Telstra, no companies that compare with Australia's regulatory framework and no country—even on an international basis—that compares with Australia's demography or geography. After failing to justify the validity of the international studies that had been so heavily cited by the government, the only argument that those supporting privatisation can muster is a mystical and unsupported belief in the power of the market itself.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The undermining of consumer interests—especially in rural communities—that this market power will cause has been ignored by this government in its unrestrained drive to reach the magical world best practice benchmark. The debate about the power of the

        The ramifications of the sale are very clear. Mr Costello, Mr Howard and Senator Alston have clearly indicated that this government is committed to pursuing the full privatisation of Telstra. We have a situation where, despite the fact that legislation has just come in before the parliament, privatisation is already the driving force within the operations of Telstra itself. This is particularly the case when one looks at the areas of the current round of redundancies being pursued by the Telstra management.

        Despite Telstra's desire to reveal only minimal details before the Senate committee, the Senate inquiry was able to clearly identify that project Mercury was operating in such a way as to remove one-third of the company—to remove one-third of the work force within Telstra—and that it was an internal program initiated by the Telstra management in April 1996 to prepare Telstra for privatisation.

        Its objective was to identify areas where cost savings could be achieved, largely through staff reductions.

You do not have to be particularly smart to understand that the aim of project Mercury was to prepare Telstra for privatisation itself.

        Under this plan, Telstra is to be gutted for the marketplace. It is to be trimmed of its capacity to support Australian technological industry, cured of any sense of community service obligation and packaged for potential investors. The restructuring of Telstra for privatisation comes at considerable costs to consumers, to Telstra workers and to regional communities that benefit substantially from the current industrial practices and the current

        This is the international experience of privatisation. Job losses are the most significant common theme of all the international privatisations of telecommunications companies. In the case of Telecom New Zealand, staffing levels declined from 24,500 in 1987, at the time of corporatisation, to 16,000 in 1990, at the time of the privatisation. Now they are down to a mere 8,568. Telstra has already announced job cuts of 9,000 this financial year. Well over fifty per cent of those are coming from the consumer and commercial divisions, which are responsible for network maintenance and installation. The project Mercury process has been followed through to the board level to the stage now where the removal of some 23,000 jobs has been announced—almost one-third of the company's work force. It is clear to me that the first casualties of privatisation are to be the workers themselves.

        The majority report was particularly critical of Telstra's privatisation plans. It identified that, in addition to job losses associated with outsourcing, Telstra hoped to reduce staff through internal rationalisations. Redundancies caused by this process were to be `management initiated'. I note that the Telstra management is seeking to change the current redundancy arrangements to see that that happens. I am sure that, if the industrial relations bill currently before the parliament is passed in its present form, that objective will be much easier to achieve. These are not necessarily to be voluntary redundancies. They will inflict great harm and suffering on workers right across this country.

        Project Mercury has clearly been identified as a means to reduce the work force within Telstra, to reduce labour costs by employing contractors at lower rates of pay than those of Telstra's current award workers, to take labour costs off the balance sheets through mechanisms such as joint ventures, to dispose of assets in areas considered to be non&amp;hyphen;core and to release millions of dollars of investment funds. This process would fundamentally change the character of Telstra in such

         a way as to see it move towards a much more profit oriented, market driven supplier. It would have dramatic impacts in terms of external suppliers and it would undermine fundamentally Telstra's capacity to produce a high quality service to Australian consumers.

        All of this is in line with the program and the policies of this government to pursue the privatisation of Telstra. A lot of this is irrational. It is identifying outsourcing of particular agencies which are currently profitable and are not necessarily a drain upon the company but which will, when removed from the company, reduce the overall employment levels within the company and therefore reduce the company's bottom line for the prospectus. Before the estimates committee Telstra management identified that the net impact to the bottom line profit of the company will be some $600 million per annum.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We can only explain the irrationality of these redundancies by understanding that they are the result of external pressures being placed upon Telstra to meet the head count benchmarks, no matter how crude and inappropriate they may be. It is all part of the process in the run-up to privatisation. These pressures may be coming from the views of the market analysts who have been reported in the media. Such pressures are being transmitted by the CS First Boston Group, which conducted the privatisation scoping study on behalf of the government. In the work of senior Telstra management, senior officials of the Department of Finance and members of the scoping study there has been very close cooperation. This is part of the process of preparing a prospectus which will ultimately identify the value of Telstra.

        The committee was presented with no evidence to establish that particular employees retrenched from Telstra would have the appropriate skills to find work in other sections of industry. The historical pattern is that, whilst this industry is growing at a great rate, that does not necessarily translate into growth in employment levels. It is a capital intensive industry. The removal of unskilled or semi-skilled workers, particularly those over 50 years of age and those in regional areas, will
        <break page="4325" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The international experience is clear. It has to be understood in the context of so&amp;hyphen;called efficiencies and market discipline, which is the so-called driving force behind these reductions. It is interesting to look at the contribution that the overseas telcos being promoted by the government have made to their nations in practice. If we look at Ameritech or US West, two of the US Bell operating companies, we see a similar pattern emerge. We see companies that are being compared to Telstra as their international benchmark that have an absolutely appalling record in terms of their treatment of workers and consumers. This is a good example of the so-called power of the market. But I do not believe it is necessarily an example we should try to emulate.

        In the case of US West, waiting times for customers attempting to reach a representative have increased in recent times. US West's numbers of employees declined by some 13,500 from 1989 to 1995. We see that a drop in employment leads to a drop in consumer service delivery. There have been increased waiting times for new installations, especially in rural areas. We see an increased number of missed appointments for repairs for both business and residential customers. We see cuts in the construction of basic telephone plant. We see that there has been a 460 per cent increase in the number of customer complaints to the Oregon Public Utility Commission. The service standards of these great models that this government holds up so highly are so bad that in April of this year the commission reimposed rate of return regulations on US West.

         A similar pattern emerges with Bell Atlantic. I suggest to the Senate that these are fundamental issues that affect the long-term ability of this parliament to have real influence over telecommunications policy in this country. This policy of privatisation is being pursued at breakneck speed. It is being introduced at a time when the regulatory frame work to operate in the post-1997 environment is yet to be determined. It is being introduced in such a way as to leave huge doubts about the issues of equity and affordability in the provision of key services.

        We see that few in the community believe that social justice policy objectives will survive the privatisation process. We have seen that the recently reconstituted board has been carefully chosen to facilitate a profit driven culture within Telstra in the preparation for privatisation. We see that there is a pattern emerging within this government in terms of not providing adequate protection for parliamentary scrutiny and the commitment that they are prepared to go outside the parliamentary process if necessary so as to have their way, no matter what this parliament suggests. That, to me, is something we should all be resisting with all our political abilities.

        It seems to me that this is a time frame that suggests that the government needs to rush this privatisation process because it will not stand up to public scrutiny, it will not stand up to rigorous scrutiny in terms of the post&amp;hyphen;1997 telecommunications environment. It is quite clear that over the last eight weeks three major packages of legislation have been introduced into this parliament that are yet to have significant community debate. The consumer groups have had little time to analyse these complex legislative packages. in fact, it would need a team of lawyers working around the clock to make sense of the directions that are being followed by this government and to meet the timetable imposed by this government in the establishment of this new environment.

        Of course, is it little wonder therefore that in these circumstances there is still no industry consensus regarding the draft telecommunications bills and the shape of the post&amp;hyphen;1997 operating environment?

        Australia is probably the last cab off the rank in terms of advanced countries in the world and even some of those that are not so advanced.

When you get Fidel Castro part&amp;hyphen;privatising his telco and selling off a fair bit of it over to the people in Mexico you know you are in a rather strange situation in Australia where we have all the opposition parties off to the left of Fidel Castro and Cuba and indeed the former regime in Albania.

        about the privatisation of Telstra. Reporter Kerry O'Brien asked whether it really mattered if
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Telstra was privately or publicly owned. The answer from Mr Keating was both accurate and succinct: `Ah, not of its essence, no.' That was his response, and that was consistent at the time with Labor's other privatisation decisions with the Commonwealth Bank and the Qantas float.

        It is very difficult to understand why you can support the privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and not support the privatisation of Telstra. I fail to see the ideolgocal basis of one set of decisions and not of the other. The reason you cannot sort of work out the ideology of it is that it is just purely a matter of expediency. It is expedient and it is tragic, particularly when such a sale is in the best interests of Australia.

        The Australian Democrats' position is probably even more curious. They have shown some sensible approaches here today on IR, and I would urge them to do a similar thing with the Telstra bill. They claim, curiously, that they have some sort of mandate to oppose Telstra. They have got a very funny idea of what a mandate is. I thought in that last election that the coalition parties in 1996 won 50 per cent of the Senate seats. I thought we won a 45&amp;hyphen;seat majority in the lower house—an outstanding majority in the lower house—and, in the upper house, 50 per cent of the seats. I would have thought that 50 per cent was a pass, and that is exactly what should happen with the Telstra legislation.

        Let us turn to the Telstra inquiry, that famous delaying tactic where the government had totally made up its mind. The opposition sent it off to a reference committee, which was terribly dishonest, because it is a bill. It is called the Telstra bill and, as a matter of fact, at each site for our inquiry they had a sign up that said `Teltsra Bill this way'. So why did it not go to a legislative committee?

How on earth can you come out in a public hearing opposed to it if you have not even had a look at it?

        After all those hearings, all that time and all those witnesses, we ended up with what was a pretty poor report.

It was intellectually dishonest and it produced a report with a very predetermined position. The majority report quotes evidence from the National Farmers Federation and Australian Women in Agriculture, yet fails to acknowledge their pro-privatisation stance. There is no comparable body of evidence to demonstrate the benefits of keeping the business in public ownership.

I suppose the telephone system in Reykjavik goes about two kilometres out of town, and that is about it. In that sort of area, you could probably run a fairly efficient system.

         The National Science and Technology Centre represents a very important national institution in a number of respects. I have to point out that I speak not just as a representative of the people of the ACT, given that the centre's main building is housed here in the national capital in the parliamentary triangle, but also on the basis that the work of this institution extends far beyond the borders of the ACT.

         It takes science and technology right around the country but I would like to note specifically the work of this institution in rural and regional areas of Australia. Its travelling programs have become a feature of this organisation. They have in place a program which takes science and technology issues and quite successfully attempts to popularise them with schoolchildren in country areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Science and technology is an area in which Australia has great strengths. Nothing highlights this more than the context of the debate we are having at the moment about the partial privatisation of Telstra. The very issue on which we are at a turning point in Australia, technology and industry development in the whole telecommunications area, really highlights, I believe, the base from which we are working in our society when it comes to science and the base level of knowledge and participation in areas such as this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point I make this evening is that it is okay to have policies that put in place programs to advance industry research and development but if we have not got a solid base of knowledge or infrastructure on the ground in Australia that really promotes knowledge amongst children and communities right around the country, it makes it very hard for us to establish that base. There has been quite a significant amount of research done to show the relationship between that base knowledge in the community and participation with technology, and the ability of a country to expand in a particular field.

          With respect to this institution, not only do they manage to run their programs with proportionately less funding than every other major institution, but they manage to do it in a way where they actually take the issues to the people. They set some great examples about how national institutions can run in an inclusive and participatory way, in a way that really brings together and involves just about every aspect of our community.

For most of the time covered by this report I have to confess that I had the privilege of being the minister for science. Therefore, the balance of this report covers my period of office. I would like to, first, pay a tribute to the people at the National Science and Technology Centre. They are a fine example of Australian scientists taking the scientific message to the community and encouraging a greater awareness of science in the broad Australian community.

         In science circles there is a bit of a fear of the image science has. The belief is that science is not seen as an attractive area for Australian students to seek degrees in, or for graduates to do postgraduate or doctoral research in. The belief broadly is that science has a threatening, almost science fiction type image, in which scientists are seen as the bad guys rather than the good guys helping society overcome problems and finding answers to complex issues. So the National Science and Technology Centre does, as Senator Lundy has so capably described, take the message of science to the community and provides a series of exhibits and other facilities for people to become used to dealing with issues of science at the centre.

         The situation for Australia is roughly this: we create every year between one per cent
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and three per cent of all the new knowledge discovered in science in the world. That means that our ability to create new knowledge is well ahead of our population as a percentage of the global population and well ahead of our GDP as a percentage of global GDP. We now have nine Nobel Prize winners in Australia which also means that per head of population, or as a percentage of our GDP, measures by which you would assess Australia's standing in the world, we are well ahead of most other countries in the world. We are essentially a very creative country. The trouble for us in this country is that as we sell our commodities like wheat, wool, iron ore and coal in the most unimproved form in the world—we sell them as base commodities at the lowest price and, therefore, get the least return—so too does Australia sell its intellectual property.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Our scientists create this knowledge but other economies take their creations and turn them into developed products which they sell back to us. We have seen a syndrome in Australia of our creative community in the science sector coming up with new ideas and trying to commercialise those ideas only to find there is a lack of interest in the financial sector or hurdles put in the way of commercialisation that make it impossible or very difficult within this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Someone else comes along and buys that intellectual property, turns that intellectual property into a commodity, a good or a service, and we then participate in the world market buying it back. The issue for the previous government was how you build on and strengthen the creative base of Australian science so that we continue to be a site for creativity and intellectual property creation, and then put in place the various steps necessary to take that intellectual property to the market by commercialising it. That was the fundamental core of the innovation statement brought down by the Keating government in December last year. It put a series of steps down so we could value add to the intellectual property we create.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Until we start doing that more effectively there will always be a situation where science is not understood in the community because

          its end purpose is not seen or valued. There is a problem that science enrolments at university are falling—that is a global trend. There is a problem as well with the drop&amp;hyphen;out rate of those enrolled. That is also a global trend.

         The National Science and Technology Centre, by sparking the imagination of young Australians about the potential of science, is aimed at arresting and turning around that trend. They do a very good job of it. I commend them. I wish there was more of it and I hope the now government continues to fund this centre and the budget for science awareness in Australia, to support things like the ANZAAS conference and to encourage the young Helix club of the CSIRO to bring young students into the science realm, and to do all those things to promote science understanding in Australia.

        Marine industries are worth some $35 billion annually to Australia and these have been growing at eight per cent per year. The need for ensuring the natural system is protected and managed for sustainable development is quite evident. I was interested to hear Senator Cook's speech on the previous report and I concur with a lot of what he said about Australia's pre&amp;hyphen;eminence in science.

        The Australian Institute of Marine Science—AIMS—has established itself in strategic basic marine science and is supported by both public and private sector interests. The
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         institute recently restructured its three science programs into 12 projects of national significance, removed a layer of management by abolishing program level management and introduced a formal system of project evaluation.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well, the institute has conducted a voluntary redundancy scheme to enable efficiency gains through restructure of support sections, shifted the budget towards increased support for capital and maintenance and upgraded its computer systems to allow a modern management information system to be introduced during 1996 and 1997.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The institute has built very strong links with Australian industries, particularly in the petroleum, pharmaceutical and computer technology industries and the wider Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. It has established a long&amp;hyphen;term environmental monitoring program and it has built skills, knowledge and resource assessment, especially in tropical mangrove and coral reef systems.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        AIMS is a recognised leader in setting environmental assessment standards. The effectiveness of the improved links with industry, which I mentioned previously, were reflected in the level of the institute's external earnings. In the term of this report, the external earnings of the institute were some $4&amp;half; million. I am personally aware of a number of the people who work at AIMS and of the tremendous work they do and the income they earn for Australia in their science works and in their collaboration with private drug companies in particular, and this is good.

        I do, however, note with just a fraction of concern the National Commission of Audit which reported in June of this year recommending a range of reviews by the government of its objectives and justification for all programs and services. In particular, the commission noted that a plethora of Commonwealth government science and technology programs were inefficient, unaccountable and complicated. The report concluded that there was considerable scope for rationalisation, improved efficiency and achievement of more targeted outcomes.

         somehow joined with CSIRO and loses its independence and its independent function. There is no factual basis for that at this time, but there is that feeling around scientific, academic and business circles in Townsville that this might happen. From the comments that have been made to me by the people at AIMS—and I do not profess to be in any way an expert in this area—I share this concern about a move which may be detrimental to the whole system of science agencies in Australia.

        I know the member for Herbert, Mr Peter Lindsay, has also been approached.

        I thought this was an appropriate time, while discussing this report, to place on record the great work that AIMS does as an independent scientific organisation. Until I can be convinced that some other form of structure would be beneficial, I remain a very strong and firm supporter of AIMS as an independent scientific organisation.

        I relate to many of the things the previous speaker said. We are well served by AIMS; it is in many senses a classic science research institute which delivers a high quality product for Australia and is overshadowed, to some extent, by its bigger brother, the CSIRO. Nonetheless, nothing can detract from its work. It is well known in the fields of research associated with the Great Barrier Reef, fisheries, offshore management of the marine

        The agency is chaired by a board of which Professor Peter Andrews is the chairman, joined by Dr Meryl Williams, Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, Dr Ray George and Mr Geoff Hill. It is a board with a blend of scientific expertise and commercial understanding. AIMS has come up with a number of scientific breakthroughs which, if taken to commerciality, will benefit Australian science and give a return to this nation. Getting the right balance between research and discovery and getting the commercial advantages out of that for this nation is something that AIMS is very serious about. Its external earnings reflect its success in that regard. This board is balanced to achieve that result. I think all of them should be commended. In particular, I would like to commend the Director of AIMS, Dr Russell Reichelt. He is indeed a fine example of one of Australia's leading scientists.

        The challenge for AIMS is not only to maintain and continue its fine reputation, something I am sure it will do, but to look to the future and see what the challenges are for an institute like this. In September 1994, as a consequence of a decision of the United Nations, the territory of Australia was enlarged by 150 per cent—that is, the exclusive economic zone for Australia meant that our seabed boundary was extended from the three&amp;hyphen;mile limit to 200 nautical miles from the low tide mark or the edge of the continental shelf, whichever is the farthest.

        For a continent like Australia, which stretches across many latitudes and, when you consider our island territories as well, covers climatic conditions ranging from tropical to Antarctic and all sea conditions and sub&amp;hyphen;sea surfaces that could be imagined, this is a massive challenge. Australia now ranks as the second largest country in the world in terms of its offshore marine responsibilities.

         —The matter that I wish to raise this evening in the adjournment debate is the question of certain legal aid guidelines that applied in Tasmania in relation to the capacity of certain people to get aid in certain circumstances. As a result of the former government's so&amp;hyphen;called access to justice program, a guideline was developed whereby women would be provided with assistance to institute property settlement proceedings where the principal asset of the marriage was equity in the former matrimonial home of between $30,000 and $60,000. Another guideline provided for assistance to women to obtain the return of furniture and chattels.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have no objection to those guidelines as such, other than that they were framed in a blatantly sexist way. Under those guidelines a husband and wife could be in exactly the same financial position, seeking legal aid to fight or argue over property, and the Legal Aid Commission could say to the wife, `You're a woman, we will fund you', but to the man, `Because you're a male, we won't fund you.' I thought that was grossly unjust and grossly inappropriate. Indeed, I would suggest that that is political correctness gone mad.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result, I raised it at Senate estimates committee with the Attorney-General's Department. They then considered the guideline and provided me with an answer just a day or so ago, indicating that they thought the guideline was in breach of anti&amp;hyphen;discrimination legislation. It would be fair to say that, if it were couched in non-sexist terms, this particular guideline would undoubtedly favour 95
        <break page="4334" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         per cent women and five per cent men. That would be appropriate, because it would be fair to say that in these sorts of disputes the majority of people who do not have the funding to pursue such claims are women. However, to couch the guidelines in such a sexist way was inappropriate. I am glad that I have been fortified in that view by the Attorney-General's Department which, as a result, will be writing to the Legal Aid Commission in Tasmania about that.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What this issue highlights is that the former government, in trying to be so politically correct, unfortunately created injustice and alienated people within the community by having such guidelines. The chances are that they were well intentioned, but it was political correctness gone mad which had an impact of creating this injustice.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would not have raised this matter this evening but for some of the gratuitous comments made by the director of legal aid concerning me. In making these comments, I did not in any way refer to anybody in particular or seek to identify or embarrass anybody in particular. Unfortunately, the director of legal aid in Tasmania made some gratuitous comments, such as, `We have heard nothing from Senator Abetz about legal aid funding in Tasmania.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the record, let me say that Mr Colin Brown has been in my office. We have discussed the very issue of legal aid funding in Tasmania. Further, as chair of the government members committee on Attorney-General and justice matters, I was involved in an extensive campaign to assist the community legal centres to ensure that they were quarantined as much as possible from the government cutbacks that were necessary because of the previous mismanagement of our economy by Labor. I have received many letters of thanks from those community legal centres right around Australia for my involvement. So it is somewhat incongruous for the director of legal aid to have made those sorts of comments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me also say that the director of legal aid gave me what I believe to be a very fruitful avenue of inquiry to try to save money in the Attorney-General's Department
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and thus free up extra money for legal aid. In fact, anybody who is interested can have a look at the

         of the Senate estimates committee where I followed up a number of questions and suggestions put to me by the director of legal aid in Tasmania as to how moneys might be saved. I find it somewhat unfortunate that Mr Brown has found it necessary to make those comments in the media, which I think most people would see as a cheap, political shot, when he was unable to deal with the substance of the complaint.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having said that, I look forward to ongoing, meaningful discussions with Mr Colin Brown, the director of legal aid in Tasmania. I look forward to him providing me with further suggestions as to how savings can be made in the Attorney General's Department. He can be assured that I will continue to follow them up at estimates or with the minister or directly with the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I wanted to place on record a response to those comments by the director of legal aid and also remind those who are administering schemes such as legal aid that they have to be careful no matter how well intentioned they may be to try to couch the guidelines so that they are fair to everybody and not alienate what could be potentially a large section of the community.

        The problem is not so much a previous government's adherence to political correctness but the fact that proper funding has not been put into this area.

        Last Thursday the Senate voted against a motion of disallowance which referred to the increase in fees in the Commonwealth courts. This is a related issue because it deals with the question of how we are going to finance our judicial system, our legal system. Unfortunately, much of the debate centred around the question of whether or not it ought to be user pays. In the end, the Senate came down very largely on the side that the users should pay in this area.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems to me extraordinary that one of the core functions of government should be approached on the basis that the people who are going to have access to that core function have to pay for it. The other core functions are the government itself, the administration of the Commonwealth, and the legislature. It seems to me to be extraordinary that at least one arm of that is looked at in terms of value for money. In that context, there is an article in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         New Statesman &amp; Society

        The arguments about values are disingenuous; calculated to conceal what has become obvious to all over the past 20 years—that monetary values have superseded all others, and that the sublimest expression of idealism, hope and high moral purpose in the world now is "value for money": if money has become the supreme measure of value, why should those who have been so happy to underwrite this development complain?

        That perhaps sums up the sorts of presumptions and suppositions that too many people

         are making about the legal system. Instead of facing the need to make the system fair, just and available, we look for excuses for not so making it. The excuses include the following propositions: that injustice is brought about because the former government adhered to what is said was political correctness; that the guidelines in Tasmania are the problem; and that everything is the problem, except the fact that there ought to be adequate resources devoted to this arm of government so that it can work properly.

        May I say in passing that it is not only the judicial arm that is being starved of resources but also this very legislature. The facilities made available to people both in this place and in the other place are also being cut down. Having listened to the contribution made by Senator Abetz, it is proper that the true picture is raised; that is, a lot of work has to be done to make sure that everybody in the community, no matter how poor or how rich, has equal access to the law. Equal access to the law means not simply being represented by somebody but being represented by a person who is competent, who has time and who has the resources available to give to not only the richest but also the poorest and all those in between. That, unfortunately, is not happening now. I doubt very much whether anybody in this chamber at the moment could afford to run a case that went for any length of time, and that is a tragedy. It is a tragedy brought about—in part at least—by the corruptions of the values by which we live, which have occurred in recent times.

        The minister failed to point out yesterday that the current research is primarily about heat effects of radiation.

These denials are just like the denials which we heard and still hear from the tobacco industry, and which were once heard from the proponents of the asbestos industry.

Some DNA expression is turned on and some is turned off by exposure to electromagnetic radiation. He has also found that proteinaceous water in the body in places such as the eyeballs and surrounding the brain is affected by electromagnetic radiation.

He said, `I think that the Democrats are fools to have promoted recommendation No. 35 of the report of the inquiry, which proposes that a levy be raised from contributors responsible for electromagnetic radiation to finance independent research into public health issues concerning EMR.' Quite obviously, he has not caught up with Senator Alston's announcement yesterday that $4.5 million would pay for such research over the next four years and that it would be funded by increases on industry licences. I will see that Senator Boswell gets a copy of the press release shortly.

         man, I was impressed to learn he had served in the Senate for 37 years. I thought he was an appropriate role model. I also learnt that he had held a number of positions, including chairman of committees. As I asked about him so often, my staff even put a short `biog' against the portrait.

        While it is true that Sir George Pearce did serve for 37 years and was a chairman of committees, he was so much more than that. I was particularly interested in the fact that he was a member of three political parties.

        Sir George was one of 10 in a poor family, his father being a blacksmith in South Australia. His formal education finished at 12 years of age and he walked beside his horse with pick and shovel to Kalgoorlie from Perth to try his luck at the goldfields—obviously none too successfully, because he returned to Perth and started a 57&amp;hyphen;hour a week job as an apprentice carpenter.

        He rose through the trade union movement and was elected as a senator for Western Australia in the first federal government in 1901. He became defence minister in 1910 and, among other credits, founded the Royal Australian Navy. He was also defence minister during the First World War. He had a long interest in aviation being the first politician in Australia to use air travel to cover his vast electorate.

        Before the First World War he set up a flying school at Point Cook in Victoria and in 1921 he brought the RAAF into existence. Other portfolios that Sir George held at the same time as his defence portfolio were external affairs and home territories. He was appointed a privy counsellor in 1921 and knighted in 1927. He retired from the Senate in 1938 and died in 1952, aged 82. In 1964, Sir Robert Menzies said about Sir George:

        I would like to return to some of the issues I raised today in the Senate during the debate on matters of public interest which go to the question of political leadership and political integrity. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my remarks due to the constant interruption of senators on the government side who were obviously most embarrassed about the revelations that I was bringing to the attention of the Senate relating to the infiltration of Liberal Party branches in southern Sydney by extreme right&amp;hyphen;wing elements. In particular, I referred to newspaper reports emanating from
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         more moderate members of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, including Liberal members of the state parliament. Those reports referred to the grave concerns they have about what was happening in their own branches.

        on Saturday, 27 July which dealt with this very serious issue. The Liberal Party hierarchy in New South Wales, at the pinnacle of which is none other than the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has really failed to do anything to curb this issue. The article states:

        Mr White had been involved in the stacking of the Menai branch where there was, and one could describe it as, a right&amp;hyphen;wing almost neo&amp;hyphen;fascist takeover.

Mr Dallas McInerney was on the staff of Chris Downy the Liberal member for Sutherland. He used the telephone in the member's office to make threatening phone calls to the owner of a pizza shop who, according to Mr McInerney, had made a terrible mistake of actually leasing premises to a then Labor candidate for the seat.

We have never really experienced the provision of this sort of information by major political parties before. This type of political
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         I have to say that action was taken by the New South Wales branch officials to stop that. I think that is to be commended. It is unfortunate, particularly given the current climate of some of the political debate taking place in this country, such as the extremist views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), that some people are allowed to put this type of propaganda over the Internet and through other official party organs of the Liberal Party. I believe it is the duty of the Prime Minister to stamp out this sort of thing, to do it at the outset—not to flounder around talking about the right to free expression and freedom of speech.

         Today I heard ministers stand up and attack the Labor Party—the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, did so in response to a question from Senator Boswell—because we happen to have a reasonable percentage of our members of parliament with trade union backgrounds. They condemn individuals for the simple fact they happen to be trade union members. Trade unions around the world have been at the forefront of standing up for freedom and democracy. There are trade unions leaders even today putting their lives on the line in other countries for the right of workers to have democratic and collective representation. Fortunately, that has never had to happen in this country. I think it is about time the Prime Minister, leading ministers of the government and other members of the government stopped these sorts of disgraceful and disparaging attacks upon individuals and started to clean up the mess that certainly exists in some of the Liberal Party branches in New South Wales.

        Sir George Pearce has, I think, a granddaughter in Brisbane—she may be a grand&amp;hyphen;niece; I am not quite sure—who is well known to me. Her name is Mrs Jane Prentice. Mrs Prentice is very much involved with the Liberal Party in Queensland. She is married to Mr Ian Prentice, who was for several years a Liberal member of the Queensland state parliament. In fact, he was one of the group which—those of you who know anything about Queensland history will remember this—prior to 1983 was referred to as the `ginger group' of the Liberal Party in Queensland. He was one of those members of parliament who, over a principle, ended up departing from our then coalition colleagues in Queensland. What happened after that is, of course, all history.

        I just thought that the interesting aspect of history Senator Brownhill raised had that further coincidental element in that the Prentices are people who have been very much involved in politics in many aspects over a long period of time in Queensland. So the fascinating political elements of the life of Sir George Pearce continue on in his descendants. Certainly, Senator Brownhill's speech about a person who was obviously quite significant in Australia's political history made interesting listening. I am sure my friends the Prentices will be interested to read  Senator Brownhill's speech when I forward it on to them, as I surely will.
