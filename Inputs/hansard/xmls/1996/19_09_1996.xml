Minister, I would like you to clear up some of the confusion surrounding the visit to Australia of the Dalai Lama. Did you cancel your appointment with the Dalai Lama? Did the Deputy Prime Minister state that the government did not recognise religious visits? What, therefore, was the status of the foreign minister's meeting with the Dalai Lama? Were only spiritual issues discussed, or did the meeting cover non&amp;hyphen;religious issues? Now that the Prime Minister has confirmed on the

Although they seek to make cheap, grubby political points out of this visit at the moment, in fact the status of the visit and the level of recognition that is being accorded by our government were exactly that that was

        So I regret this.

        <para in-line="1">
         —Yes, Senator Schacht is quoted as saying that profit after abnormals had risen by 31.1 per cent and, indeed, he is correct. There would not be a company in Australia today that would mind being a sheltered workshop if its profit went up by 31 per cent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What Senator Schacht does not understand is that you do not use these sorts of numbers to make comparisons between years, because the whole point of abnormals is that they are one-off. Telstra itself conceded that this is not the right number to use for comparisons. Here is what Frank Blount said—and I hope you will take this down:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In some respects this figure is a little flattering, because it's about 30 per cent higher than last year. In fact there's been a turnaround of abnormals of about $770 million. Last year we were down more than $550 million because we made a superannuation provision. This year a change in our depreciation methodology has bumped us up by $200 million. The number you should use for comparisons year on year is profit after tax but before abnormals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telstra did not report that figure, but it can be calculated. Indeed, BZW, Senator Schacht's favourite investment bank, says that profit after tax before abnormals was $2.1 billion in 1994-95—up by two per cent, not 31 per
        <break page="3580" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         cent. According to BZW, overall a two per cent profit growth is not very encouraging.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So it is quite clear that Senator Schacht still has not the vaguest idea about how one measures profitability in the marketplace. It is very disappointing that he simply has not been prepared to do his homework on this or a number of other issues. As we know, he is still getting around to asking someone to do a ghost draft of his submission to the ABC, to the Mansfield inquiry. About the most he has been able to contribute to this debate so far is that he put out a press release on 1 September apologising for inadvertently referring to Donald McDonald as `Donald Donaldson'. He told the press to `please amend his statement'. He apologised for any inconvenience. That is a pretty good contribution to the ABC debate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was even more perturbed when I was surfing the Net the other night once again to discover that, when you look at Senator Schacht's home page, the last update is 22 February 1996. What do you find there? You find all sorts of goodies, Madam President. Senator Schacht's is listed in his capacity as Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, so time stands still for this lot. Senator Schacht says, `If you want to know what we've been up to, you can go to my home page and see the hot issues area.' What happens when you go to the hot issues area? You get one of the best one&amp;hyphen;liners of all time: `Labor's reality versus John Howard's rhetoric. If you would like to have your say, click here.' You really cannot get much lower than that. He has not got time to update his home page; he has not got time to do any work on his ABC submission; and, he can't even get the name of the ABC chairman right. What is he doing? Why doesn't he go and see BZW and get a sensible briefing, and then he will have an understanding of this issue?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Just in case you might like to start doing a bit of research, what you will find, for example, on the issue of privatisation is that a good friend of yours, Nelson Mandela, has made a useful contribution on the subject. What he said recently was this: `Privatisation is the fundamental policy of the ANC and it's going
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to be implemented.' That really says it all, does not it?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If only you would go and do your homework. I know it is difficult whiling away those long, lonely hours in opposition but, rather than twiddling your thumbs and playing pure politics, why can't you do some homework? Take a refresher course—or probably, in your case, a primary course—on the basic economics, and you will understand that Telstra's profit performance is not all that good.

Sixty per cent of Labor supporters said that we were doing a better job on economic management than 13 years of Labor.

        This is important, Madam President, because it demonstrates that it is still the view of the Australian public that the policies upon which they elected us they wish to see implemented. In other words, the budget that we put down which took the hard decisions they endorse and they want to see passed in this chamber. That is critically important. Why is it? It is because people are still reflecting upon the failures of Labor and the consequences of those failures.

        I remind you, Madam President, that, under Labor, general government debt increased from $17 billion in 1990 to $96 billion last year. If there had not been any adjustment in this budget it would have increased to $120 billion. That is what the people of Australia were not prepared to cop any more. That would have been an increase of over 600 per cent in just 10 years. In underlying terms, debt had increased by $69 billion in the past five years. This is the record of Labor that the Australian people rejected. It has a consequence because it means that 7.5 per cent of this year's budget outlays are going to meet the cost of debt that Labor ran up. We need to spend some $10 billion to pay for debt that could have been spent on much more worthwhile programs.

        Michael Egan, the Labor Treasurer in New South Wales, even recognised it when he said recently that more debt now simply means bigger interest bills in the future and fewer dollars to spend on hospitals, schools, roads and other key priorities. That is what the people of Australia rejected at the last election. They wanted us to take a new direction and they wanted us to take the hard decisions. We have done that in this budget. Now they want this budget passed in order that the benefits that can flow from those hard decisions do flow, to the benefit of all ordinary Australians.

When you are talking about relative costs, the Matthews report on Hindmarsh Island cost over $1 million and ATSIC contributed over a quarter of a million dollars to that. When you are talking about relative costs, Senator Kernot, you really have to consider the value that is obtained from expenditure of funds. I believe that there will be substantial value to ATSIC of these funds that have been expended, albeit that a court decision found on a technical matter that the decision to institute the audit was invalid.

I am sorry, Madam President, I do not remember it being referred to as a reef tax when it was introduced by Labor. When it was introduced by Labor, it was referred to as an environment management charge, but now you are on the other side of the chamber, politics call for a new definition. The budget—

Since the announcement of this scheme on 23 August, there have been an unprecedented number of inquiries to take up this new initiative. Bookings for sea travel across Bass Strait have gone up by 45 per cent. TT&amp;hyphen;Line reported that more than 19,700 ticket inquiries had been made since the announcement of the subsidy. As former Premier Ray Groom said, in the 13 hours following the announcement more than 7,500 calls were made to TT's central reservations office in Devonport. This has been an enormously successful initiative to which Senator Newman was a prime contributor. It clearly demonstrates the superiority of our approach on this important issue.

        The scheme provides for a rebate of $150 for a single trip and $300 for a return trip in the peak holiday season, slightly lower rebates applying in other seasons to reflect the lower cost. The scheme will reduce a driver's net fare when sharing a standard cabin to a similar cost to that notionally incurred in driving an equivalent distance on a highway.

        The scheme has been given the thumbs up by industry, certainly by the Tasmanian government—Premier Rundle and Ministers Cleary and Groom—TT&amp;hyphen;Line and the chairman of the National Sea Highway Committee, Mr Peter Brohier. In other words, everyone who has looked at this proposal says that it is infinitely superior to the Labor alternative.

        There has been some criticism, as you would expect from a carping, negative, going nowhere opposition. Of course, what they fail to recognise is that the funding for this proposal is not capped. It will be demand driven. The scheme therefore fulfils a key election commitment to Tasmania and represents an ongoing recognition of equity for Bass Strait travellers.

        Labor's very second&amp;hyphen;rate alternative approach to this was to put a very large bucket of money on the table in order to enable a second ferry to be built. That would make absolutely no difference necessarily to the level of cost of fares. It would simply be putting money in the pocket of a new owner. That is far from attractive to consumers.

         Labor's funding would have miserably failed to cover future operating costs, would have provided no guarantee that travellers would have benefited from lower fares and would not have provided any competition. In other words, we are giving assistance where it is needed. It goes to the consumer; it makes travel more affordable. It is very much in line with an approach that is sensitive to consumer needs rather than simply the old Labor handout mentality.

         I would have thought now that we have seen the reaction—universal acclamation from industry, from consumers—that the least that people like Senator Sherry should do is perhaps follow Senator Schacht's example and put out a corrective statement admitting that this is yet again another very successful budget initiative. As you would know, the recent Morgan survey indicated that our budget was the most popular since 1978. One of the reasons for that is that we very carefully ensured that consumers are the beneficiaries. We did that in Tasmania in spades, and the citizens of Tasmania are very, very grateful. They certainly will not appreciate your going around carping at the margins, making yourself even more irrelevant and simply not facing up to an infinitely superior approach.

         that so little consideration was given to the plight of carers, because in a very practical sense they are providing a national effort which could hardly be duplicated by institutional care in this country.

        The role of the carer is one of the most undervalued in Australia, and it was certainly undervalued by the previous government. Carers go about their work in a dedicated and benevolent fashion without fanfare, without reward—and they are not really asking for that.

          The Federal Budget has recognised the vital contribution that carers make to their community, according to the Executive Director of the Carers Association of Australia, Ms Anne Marie Mioche.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Government will establish a National Respite for Carers Program which will operate over the next 4 years and will also see the establishment of Carer Resource Centres across Australia. `In the context of this budget, $36.7 million above the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 expenditure is quite a lot of money' Ms Mioche said, adding, `the fact that the Government will be establishing Carer Resource Centres sends a direct message to all carers that this Government cares about them'.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          `Carers also welcome the Government's Budget initiative to recognise the work of carers by renaming the Carer Pension the Carer Payment' says Ms Mioche. `and we also welcome the increased number of respite days from 42 to 52 days a year

           which will give carer pensioners the equivalent of one Sunday off a week', Ms Mioche said. Another welcome Budget measure is the extension of the number of hours carer pensioners may spend in work or study from 10 to 20 hours a week.

          `We are pleased with the additional funding of $31 million which will be provided to support children with high levels of needs, particularly those with a disability who would not normally be able to be placed in Federally funded child care services', says Ms Mioche. `Younger carers need to be able to continue to work or study so that they can contribute to their family's income, and their own sense of well being'.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Ms Mioche says the Association also looks forward to contributing to the review of Commonwealth carer income support arrangements announced in the Budget. `Carers tend to be poor and marginalised by their dedication', she says, `an examination of the adequacy of existing provisions as well as the scope to improve targeting and rationalisation of payment structures is long overdue'.

This is fundamentally a misconception and misunderstanding of the nature of the process.

         —Thank you, Madam President. If the ex-ministers on the other side would listen, they might learn something. We consulted with the industry. Those consultations are continuing in a very productive way. One of the concerns we had—it was a concern the previous government also had—was the degree of growth of the diesel fuel rebate, which, as Senator Schacht would know, they tried to address. However, the difference between them and us is that we consulted; whereas they tried to sandbag the industry. There is a difference. Those consultations in fact are continuing in a genuine attempt by both the government and the industry to actually address the exponential growth of the diesel fuel rebate.

In our election commitments we said that existing public tenants would not be disadvantaged by these reforms.

        Senator Chris Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. I refer you to the recent decision by President Clinton to approve Food and Drug Administration laws, declaring that nicotine and tobacco is a drug subject to federal legislation. Why has the federal government not followed the US lead and lifted the schedule 7 exemption on nicotine and tobacco? Is it the case that the government has no intention of acting on this matter, as was claimed by government sources quoted in the Melbourne

        I am pleased to say that Australia remains at the forefront of tobacco control and indeed many of the initiatives announced in the Clinton package have already been implemented in Australia. The major effect of President Clinton's announcement is to list nicotine as a drug of addiction, thus enabling action to be taken to restrict advertising of tobacco products. For example, billboards displaying tobacco advertising will be banned within 1000 feet of schools. The package also limits tobacco advertising in magazines. In Australia, all forms of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        The AMA and other health advocacy groups have called on all Australian Governments to follow President Clinton's example and to move to have nicotine in tobacco scheduled as a poison. The AMA has also been part of a coalition of health groups that has made a joint submission on this issue to the WA Poisons Advisory Committee, asking that it remove the exemption for tobacco products from Schedule 7 of the SUSDP. It seems the Opposition is now joining that call—but they seem to have misunderstood the effect of the recent US decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In Australia, as the Opposition is well aware, tobacco has been treated as a drug of dependence in the context of the National Drug Strategy (and its predecessor, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse) since its inception in 1985. We do not therefore need to remove the exemption from Schedule 7 to enable us to address the harms caused by tobacco consumption in this country. Indeed, we have been able to achieve a tobacco control regime which is one of the toughest in the world without scheduling tobacco in this way.

       Vietnamese Refugees

       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The petition of the undersigned shows:
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Credible evidence of Vietnamese persecution, incredible denial by UNHCR: There is evidence that the Vietnamese authorities are persecuting Vietnamese asylum seekers repatriated from South East Asia and Hong Kong camps. Also, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) claim that its returnee monitoring officers have not uncovered even a single case of persecution is not credible, and amounts to a cover&amp;hyphen;up.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       A report was released in July 1996 by the Vietnamese Australian community which compiles some of the available evidence that has been emerging. Such evidence comprises public information from Vietnamese security authorities, UNHCR's documents, testimonies of victims, and reports from news gathering organisations. The following are just 2 examples:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
       The report provides an article by the security unit of a northern province in its publication that it had compiled dossiers to monitor the activities of 79 suspects, and that it had arrested 3 returnees for membership of a reactionary organisation, the New Democratic Party. UNHCR, in its letter to the Australian government and the Vietnamese Australian community, dismissed this evidence on 4 grounds. First, because the chief of the security unit denied all of this. Second, because the chief said while no 3 political imprisonments had been made, 2 common criminals had been imprisoned, and UNHCR interviewed one of these 2 people who admitted his common crime. Third, because that government publication was just engaging in tabloid exaggeration. And fourth, because that party was just a front to help its members obtain refugee status.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
       The first and second of UNHCR's arguments do not even deserve a reply. They are noteworthy only as indications that UNHCR is ready, willing and able to accept whatever it is given by Vietnamese authorities. The third, if believed, would lead to all official mouthpieces of the Vietnamese authorities being dismissed as tabloids whenever it suits UNHCR's purposes. The fourth shows that UNHCR can easily be caught in action: another Vietnamese government publications listed that party among those reactionary organisations to be eliminated.
       <break page="3595" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
       </break>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
       When pressed to investigate, UNHCR got a returnee to admit to its monitoring officers that he had been jailed not for political activities but for common crimes. The Vietnamese authorities later released him, saying that he `had been wrongly arrested'.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Australia has the right to see if its funding to UNHCR to help refugees has been used effectively. However, there is mounting evidence that the reverse is true. There has been evidence that UNHCR has failed to accord refugee status to many deserving people (this is the subject of at least 5 reports released in Australia, plus others elsewhere by several non&amp;hyphen;governmental organisations). Apparently to cover up that failure, it has participated in their forced and bloody repatriation (the subject of another report, released in February 1996), and now has covered up, even argued against, what it knows or ought to know about their persecution once returned.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Your Petitioners respectfully ask that the Senate should: conduct a detailed and independent investigation into UNHCR's failures in protecting Vietnamese refugees.

As you might be aware, they come from varied agencies that have had a role to play in this matter. There are issues of confidentiality and other issues that still need to be assessed.

       I would be able to comply with this direction by the next sitting day, but I am unable to comply with it by today. Had we not had to sit in estimates until six in the morning this week it might have allowed a little more time, but that time clearly was not available. I have spoken to Senator Woodley, whose motion it was in the first instance, about this and I do undertake to meet the order of the Senate by the next sitting day.

        —by leave—I hear what the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) is saying. The Australian Democrats have also been very reasonable in this issue. Following the extension that we granted and then the further extension that we granted last week when the matter was dealt with, we felt that the minister would be able to comply, because we had extended twice the very reasonable offer we had made. Following that arrangement in the chamber I wrote to the minister suggesting that he might be able to release the documents in groups of documents as this would

       Senator Woodley and others might take their minds back to the time when the Labor government was in office. If any minister came into this chamber and provided such an abject excuse as the one that Senator Hill has given, there would have been hours and hours of debate condemning that minister.

       I say to Senator Hill in relation to this issue: you may try to prevent these documents being tabled, but what is clearly occurring is that slowly but surely the truth is coming out. We have already had exposed through the documents tabled earlier by Senator Hill the fact that he completely ignored the advice of two of his portfolio agencies—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Heritage Commission—and he also ignored the advice of the World Heritage unit in the Environment Strategies Directorate of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories.

       Through the estimates committee process, we have had the capacity to establish that a significant number of documents which have already been tabled, in response to the requests of Senate Woodley, refer to other documents that have not been tabled in this place. So the position that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has outlined on this matter stands in stark contrast with the position that he and other members of the opposition took before they were elected to government earlier this year. Every member of this chamber knows it and every reasonable and objective observer of this chamber knows that we have in this pathetic response from Senator Hill a clear case of utter hypocrisy and double standards. That is what this statement amounts to today.

I simply do not know whether the Australian Democrats and the Greens have been expressing that concern, but they may well have been. He is prepared to look at the setting of the levels of the fees. But it is not possible or sensible, even if it were possible, to make those sorts of decisions in haste over a matter of a day or
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         so without giving it proper consideration and coming up with an alternative package, if that is possible.

       If it were dealt with today, one of the difficulties would be that if it were disallowed it would then be another six months. Some people would have paid, then there would be a gap and, if we found a package that was suitable, there would be another rate other than that one and you would end up with a mix of rates within a relatively short space of time.

      <para first-indent="16">
       Alternatively, we could rescind the regulations and come back, and that would have similar consequences of messiness. As a consequence of those matters, I gave an undertaking to Senator Bolkus that we would come back and deal with these matters on the first day. There will be time between now and the next sitting day to resolve whatever is to be resolved and to then deal with it quickly on the first sitting day. So, if it is appropriate, I seek leave to move a motion.

         Motion No. 222 seeks to refer a number of matters to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. This is almost a unique select committee. It has operated for six years; in itself, I think that is a unique characteristic.

          As to the issues, there is a range of matters relating to the budget announcements in respect of superannuation that are being referred by this motion to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I will run through some of those issues and outline why Labor has taken a decision to refer these matters to the committee.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          On the first issue, that is, the 15 per cent surcharge that has been introduced in the budget to apply to superannuation contributions for high income earners as defined, there has been a lot of debate. I do not know whether Senator Allison saw the estimates proceedings last night, but we spent about an hour and a half trying to determine what is a tax and what is a surcharge. For the purpose of the government's accuracy, we have referred to it here as a surcharge, but it is in fact a tax, a new tax.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When we look at page 10 of the budget document for the Treasury portfolio, I find it fascinating that Treasury itself refers to it as an increased tax on superannuation. We find it interesting that Treasury documents refer to it as a tax. Even though we pressed Senator Short somewhat on this issue, when we attempted to ask the tax office people last night for the definition of a tax, amazingly they were not allowed to give us one. We must be the first country in the world where the tax office has been prevented by its minister from being allowed to answer the question of what is a tax and what is a surcharge. There was just no answer.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Also, when we put this question to Treasury, its officers were not prepared to define what is a tax and what is a surcharge. As I said, we must be the first country in the world where the tax office and Treasury cannot decide what is a tax and what is a surcharge.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is an important issue as the government went to the last election with absolute commitments to the effect there would be no increases in taxes and charges, but this is one big tax. Last night we asked Senator Short whether it was the biggest increase in revenue—it is approximately $500 million a year—in the budget. In fact, it is the biggest new tax we have seen for some time, despite

          At this point in the debate on this matter I want to say that Labor supports this measure. But that does not mean that there is not a range of concerns about how it will be implemented. Senator Short has been telling the world that I am responsible not only for this new surcharge—as he called it—being called a tax, but also for a range of concerns that are being raised about the administration of this new measure.

          The Society of Certified Practising Accountants—no doubt I get on the phone to them, Senator Short, and tell them, `Do what Labor wants you to do'—condemned the surcharge for being inequitable, complex, costly, inefficient, creating uncertainty and conflicting with other government policies. They went on to say that the surcharge will cost as much to administer as it is expected to collect in additional revenue.

He suggested that the best way to tackle the problem would be to tax accumulated superannuation contributions when they are paid out at appropriate progressive tax rates.

He said that whoever developed this change has no concept of the practical implications and the problems which it will present. Professor David Knox, a former Liberal adviser on superannuation, has been appointed as a member of the government's new advisory committee that has been set up to examine the problems associated with this new tax, as a consequence of the budget announcement. He said that the tax system for super is so complicated that most people don't understand it, and this tax makes it more complicated.

I note that, yet again, Senator Sherry has professed that Labor supports the policy decision of the government in the budget to impose a surcharge on high income earners so far as their superannuation contributions are concerned. What nonsense for Senator Sherry to say that!

It is simply not true.

         The range of superannuation reforms announced by the government in the budget will result in a fairer superannuation system which is more competitive and, very importantly, a more efficient superannuation system. The reforms will benefit families; they will benefit women; they will benefit low income earners; and they will benefit Australians in or near retirement. Families and women will benefit particularly from the rebate on spouse contributions, which will allow a contributing spouse to receive an 18 per cent rebate for contributions made on behalf of the low income earning spouse.

         Low income earners and women, particularly those working part time or with broken employment patterns, will benefit from the policy to provide employees with the opportunity to negotiate the payment of additional wages and salary in lieu of superannuation guarantee contributions. That measure enables people to make a choice better suited to their financial position and their family and personal circumstances. The reason why so many doubts are being raised by the Labor Party about this one is that it involves giving Australians on lower incomes a choice—a choice which Labor would never be prepared to give them because `choice' is a dirty word in the Labor lexicon. Labor believes that it is Big Brother government that knows best how people ought to be able to use their resources; therefore, Labor governments limit choice, which is precisely what they have done.

         Low income earners and women in particular will also benefit from the introduction of retirement savings accounts.

Individuals will be able to nominate these accounts to receive their superannuation guarantee contributions and to amalgamate existing small superannuation accounts. This was an

I am sure Senator Sherry is hoping he can use the committee to undermine or defeat these measures—not on the grounds of their equity or the choice that they offer members, because that is precisely what they do. These measures produce a fairer, more equitable superannuation system for Australians.

Complexity was added to complexity, layer was added upon layer, and we are at the stage now where most Australians really have the most enormous difficulty—in fact they find it impossible—to understand the superannuation system, what it is about and what it means to them. All of that occurred during Labor's 13 years in office. It had 13 years to provide a stable and an equitable superannuation system. It failed lamentably to do so.

          The surcharge, which is the main basis of the government's superannuation proposals, will involve changes to administrative procedures. Almost all the administration involved in the implementation of the policy will be handled by superannuation funds and the Taxation Office. Contributors and employers will see virtually no impact on them of the administrative procedures required to implement the policy decision.

          Superannuation funds will have only two obligations: firstly, to report information about the member and the amount of contributions made to the member's account during the year; secondly, to deduct an amount from the affected member's account, which amount will be notified to them by the Australian Taxation Office. Senator Sherry gave notice of this motion before we had the very extensive discussions with the taxation and Treasury officials in Senate estimates last night. I hope that, as a result of those discussions in the Senate estimates committee last night, what is involved in an administrative sense was made clearer to him. It is much less of a burden on superannuation funds than he, or they, might have imagined.

          As I said, the new procedures will not affect contributors at all. They will impose some burden on the funds—we have always acknowledged that—but we have implemented them because, firstly, we want to have a fairer system and, secondly, we want to introduce that fairer system and administer that fairer system in a way that does not impose additional obligations and burdens on either employers or contributors.

          If a member rolls over his or her benefit to a new superannuation fund, any existing liability to the superannuation surcharge will be transferred to the new fund. If a member withdraws his or her benefit from the superannuation system, any existing liability to the superannuation surcharge will be transferred to the member. There will be appropriate review mechanisms available to deal with any dispute in relation to the super surcharge liability either by the superannuation fund or by the member.

            —I accept that criticism has been levelled at the proposed administrative arrangements for the surcharge. I have been consulting, I would venture to say, much more widely than Senator Sherry has on this matter and across a much wider cross&amp;hyphen;section of stakeholders. But I do think that several of the important criticisms that have been levelled are misguided because of a lack of understanding at this stage.

           It is claimed that the surcharge will result in increased administrative costs by superannuation funds, which will be borne by all members, not just those who have high incomes. That fails to take account of the fact that the information a superannuation fund will report to the tax office is no different from the information the fund should already maintain as part of its normal operations. It is information it should already have, apart from one significant element, and that is the tax file numbers of members. It is also information that is already required by law to be given to the majority of superannuation fund members each year.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There are also potential benefits in the administrative sense from what we are proposing to superannuation funds in that upgrading of administrative systems and improvements in administrative arrangements now are likely to lead to substantial cost savings in the future. For example, the use of tax file numbers will ultimate simplify superannuation fund administration.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Another claim is that the surcharge goes too far in requiring data to be collected for all superannuation members whereas only a small group eventually pay the surcharge. However, no&amp;hyphen;one has yet demonstrated to the government a better approach to the collection of the surcharge than the one that has been announced. I say that despite the extensive consultations that have taken place, not just by me but more particularly by officers of the ATO, the Treasury and other officials concerned. All of us have been very heavily involved in this.

           The approach we have adopted has several advantages, including that it reduces the
           <break page="3608" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            opportunity for people to avoid the surcharge, and it places a negligible burden of compliance on employers and employees. It has been suggested to the government that employers should play a larger role in the collection of the surcharge. We dealt with that in estimates last night, at least to some extent. I certainly do not agree with this view, nor does the government.

           Whilst employers may know an employee's salary and wage level for the purposes of taxation on a PAYE basis, an employer would not have information on a person's taxable income, nor should they if they are receiving income outside their salaried position. But an employer would not have information on a person's taxable income, including other non&amp;hyphen;PAYE income, personal reductions and rebates. Further, a mechanism such as has been suggested as an alternative—basically, the PAYE mechanism—would place a considerable administrative burden on employees and employers, and that would contrast with the existing arrangements which will minimise the burden on those groups.

           Another area that has been expressed as a concern is how the surcharge will apply in relation to defined benefit funds and unfunded schemes. Some people have argued that this will involve substantial complexity and perhaps herald the demise of such schemes. I think that view is unfounded, but, as I have already mentioned, an actuarial advisory committee with very high level experts, headed by the Commonwealth Government Actuary, is at the moment looking at these matters and will be advising the government on the application of the surcharge to defined benefit and unfunded superannuation schemes—and one or two other elements as well: for example, as I mentioned, the golden handshake issue. On the basis of the committee's work to date, as I understand it, there is every probability that they will

First, we will run the very considerable risk of major confusion, with the superannuation committee running a parallel set of consultations and inquiries to those we are doing in government now. Second, we will go through all of that process, and report; then the bills will come in and you will want to do it all again. That is a very odd way of going about things. It does not bear any relationship to logic, and Senator Sherry's motion today is not logical. It is purely a political operation, because he wants to obfuscate on this issue.

        This bill proposes changes to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 which make the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         research and development tax concession a better value program for all Australians, both by stopping unintended use of the concession, and making the administrative procedures better suited to the needs of industry.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Access to the concession is to be confined to a reasonable period after the research and development activities have been conducted. This means that the tax concession program can return to its rightful focus of encouraging new research, new development, rather than encouraging consultants to plow through years of company accounts looking for a tax sweetener for their clients. The scope of this gravedigging is so extensive that these measures are expected to result in revenue protection totalling $235 million over the next three financial years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other improvements to the registration process, such as advance registration and registration of activities, also encourage companies to direct their creativity towards new technologies and markets.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also validates overseas research and development decisions and internal review decisions taken outside the mandatory time periods prescribed by the Principal Act. This validation is quarantined to the effect of the mandatory time period, and will work to confirm the deductions of companies affected by these decisions. Amendments are also made to ensure that such invalid decisions are not taken again in future, without undermining the mechanisms built into the legislation to ensure that companies receive decisions in a timely fashion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of changes have been introduced to bring the administration of the research and development tax concession into line with the self assessment principles of taxation administration. These include reducing the obligations of the Industry Research and Development Board prior to registering a company, and introducing the ability to set fees by regulation in relation to applications and requests to the Board.
       </para>

        This bill represents a huge boost to the integrity of the research and development tax concession which is long overdue. I refer you to the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill for a more fullsome description of their changes and their necessity to the responsible administration of Commonwealth revenue.

          The deemed income (when applied) is the lower of 2.5% of the property value, the commercial lease value, or the amount of rent that could be reasonably be expected to be paid by the family member operating the farm. When a family member is running the farm, it is usually either the commercial lease value or the rent from the family member that is assessed. The calculation of the reasonable rent amount takes into account half of the family member's and their spouse's income that is over the relevant Additional Family Payment income test limit ($21,000 if the family member has no children). A telephone survey of the Department's hardship assessors has identified the most common reason for a farmer's pension claim being rejected under the hardship provisions is because the level of their available funds is well above the `severe financial hardship' threshold. It was asserted that it would only be in extremely rare cases where a person would be rejected under the hardship provisions due to the level of deemed income applied in respect of the farm assets.

          It appears that the Committee has confused the issue of gifting and inter&amp;hyphen;generational transfers of farms as an issue within the assets hardship provisions. A farmer who is unable to receive a pension under the normal assets test because they have gifted assets may still be entitled to a pension under the hardship provisions if the person is suffering severe financial hardship that is not a direct consequence of gifting assets, or where the person is suffering severe financial hardship and could not have reasonably known that they would need to claim an income support payment at the time of the `gifting'.

          These categories, therefore, exclude access to the hardship provisions for those who gift money to divest their available funds, and those who gift assets that were producing levels of income equivalent to the maximum applicable rate of pension.

          It appears that the separate issues of the administration of the hardship provisions and the treatment of partnerships and sharefarmers under the normal assets test have been confused as being one issue.

          The differing treatment of partnerships and sharefarmers is under the normal assets test when the farmer transfers the property to a family member. If the family member is employed for less than the average wage whilst working for the family business, the value of wages foregone by the family member whilst an "employee" of the pension claimant is deducted from the value of the property for the purpose of calculating the amount of deprivation to be maintained. This recognises the fact that many family "employees" have a commitment to the family business that outweighs individual financial concerns.

         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
          This deduction for foregone wages is generally not allowed for partnerships or sharefarmers, as it is recognised that the person's income is determined by market forces and not determined as a reasonable wage amount that would be paid in an employer/employee relationship. Having stated this, it should be noted that implementing this benefit for partnerships and sharefarmers as a longer term strategy has not been ruled out.

         I have not had much time to look at the government's response to this particular report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee but it is to be commended for responding appropriately in a couple of instances, particularly in its response to recommendations G and H.

But, having taken part and, in some cases, chaired the inquiry—which took eight months, received 250 submissions and made a number of constructive recommendations to improve farm families' access to assistance payments—I am a little puzzled that we will now have another two inquiries and a reference to a special rural task force.

          The major reforms in the Act were the introduction of purchaser&amp;hyphen;provider agreements, whereby medical practitioners and health funds could enter into contracts for the provision of medical services rendered in hospitals and between hospitals and health funds. The Act also contained a variety of provisions which are intended to provide consumers with wider access to information about health insurance issues.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The evidence provided to the Committee demonstrated that the reforms have not been successful in meeting their objectives. People have continued to drop private health insurance cover, value for money with the insurance product offered continues to be questioned and information on health insurance, although improved, still needs considerable attention.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Whilst many hospital agreements have been signed with health funds, very few medical agreements have been finalised. Members of the medical profession continued to argue that they would not sign contracts because they could compromise the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           independence of doctors and adversely affect patient care. It was suggested that contracts would introduce a form of US&amp;hyphen;style managed care and lead to an abrogation of accepted clinical freedoms and the doctor&amp;hyphen;patient relationship.

          Doctors were also concerned at the oligopolistic domination of the market by health funds and the position the medical profession was in by being unable to negotiate in groups.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee understood and appreciated the concerns expressed by the doctors, however, without many contracts having been signed the claims remained unsubstantiated. The Committee has therefore recommended that medical purchaser&amp;hyphen;provider agreements should proceed, subject to the clear recognition in the contracts of the right of the medical profession to treat patients according to their clinical needs.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee considers that doctors should be encouraged to jointly negotiate with funds by using the authorisation provisions in the Trade Practices Act. The Committee believes that it is essential, and in the interest of all parties, to ensure that a level playing field is established in the negotiating environment.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee has also recommended that public scrutiny of purchaser&amp;hyphen;provider agreements by consumers be provided for. In addition the Purchaser&amp;hyphen;Provider Panel should be convened and that the Panel be provided with access to agreements as part of its monitoring role relating to the contractual arrangement process.Unlike the medical practitioners, many hospital agreements have been signed. However, similar arguments about the disproportionate powers of the funds were put by the hospitals about their negotiating of agreements with the funds. Hospitals were particularly concerned that country and smaller hospitals were disadvantaged in the negotiating process.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee similarly understands the concerns expressed by the hospitals over their perceived limitations in negotiating in groups with the funds. However, the authorisation provisions of the Trade Practices Act which may permit group negotiations have not been tested. The Committee has recommended that the private hospitals should also be able to arrange joint negotiations by seeking authorisation under the Trade Practices Act.

          The Private Health Insurance Complaints' Commissioner has been in operation for nearly six months and had received over 600 complaints and general inquiries. The most common complaints received by the Commissioner had related to benefit entitlements, including level of cover, amount of benefit and lack of notification of changes to benefit entitlements; and waiting periods, in particular the pre&amp;hyphen;existing ailment rule. The Commissioner suggested that the majority of complaints indicated that consumers do not understand what their policy covers or what they can and cannot claim from their policy.

A major concern put to the Committee related to duplication in data collection at the Federal and State levels. The Committee has recommended that data collection at these levels be reviewed to ensure that any duplication of effort and resources is prevented. The Committee also recommended that the Private Hospital Data Bureau be established and that its role in the future collection and dissemination of data be included in the review.

        The Higher Education Council and the Australian Research Council will continue as independent Councils, with similar functions, and with their membership unchanged, reporting directly to the Minister. The Councils will also take responsibility for promoting informed public debate and for granting financial assistance for innovative projects. There is also provision for the Councils to cooperate to provide advice to the Minister.

        The National Board, which was established by former Minister Dawkins in late 1988, took some years to settle into its role, and appears to have had difficulties ever since gaining the full commitment of the various players in the education and training sector. While it has contributed to a cross&amp;hyphen;sectoral view of policy matters, it has also been yet another layer of bureaucracy filtering advice from the expert Councils. The government's intention to replace NBEET with more streamlined advisory mechanisms has been on notice for quite some time.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The overall thrust of the evidence received by the Committee argued for the importance of portfolio advisory mechanisms being independent and publicly accountable. The requirement for independence ensured that government departments and agencies did not monopolise the advice available to the Minister. Accountability turned on the need for the activities of advisory groups to be open to public scrutiny, and in particular that their reports should be tabled in Parliament. The Committee has so recommended.

        The Committee is of the view that diverse and independent sources of advice to the Minister and to the Parliament are to be encouraged, and that any future advisory framework should be expedited. The Minister has indicated that the government has already embarked on the relevant consultations with a view to ensuring that appropriate alternative advisory arrangements are quickly established..
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government will take advice from a range of bodies such as the Ministerial Council (MCEETYA), and will commission specific reports from appropriately tailored expert committees and from existing research organisations.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Public accountability will be achieved through the requirement that reports commissioned by the Minister will be tabled in Parliament. Accountability will also reside in the State and Territory Parliaments, especially for the schools sector. The Committee acknowledges that there will be an interim period of adjustment to the proposed new arrangements, but this is no more than the standard impact of structural adjustment. Schools, universities and training colleges will not be impeded in their day to day work during this interim period.

         An essential in this matter relates to the way in which advice is tendered to both the government and the parliament on an independent cross&amp;hyphen;sectoral basis. The abolition of NBEET is an important issue because it goes to the very basic issue of how well Austral ians, this parliament and the minister understand the need to address the crucial linkages between the nation's economic performance, its employment parameters and the implications that arise from those considerations for the role of the education and training sectors. That is essentially the conclusion that was reached by the Wiltshire review into NBEET, which was conducted in 1994.

        The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have together presented a dissenting report on the amendments being proposed to the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill which seek to abolish a longstanding body—NBEET, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. We believe that the proposed changes to the advisory mechanisms, including the abolition of NBEET, are wrong. We believe that the minister has conducted this in a manner which effectively closes down the operations of NBEET and its councils before the parliament has had an opportunity to deal with the relevant legislation. That was wrong. In my judgment, it was not within the law for her to undertake the closure of these bodies in the manner in which she did. The failure of the minister to set out the reasons for her decision was a contemptuous action by her in the way she effectively dismissed the chairs and members of this body's board and councils, which are protected by legislation.

        It is with that in mind that we raise this in the context of DEETYA having done very well out of this decision, because it means they do not have any counterweight. They have no mechanisms available through formal legislative means to provide this parliament with counter&amp;hyphen;advice on an independent and a cross&amp;hyphen;sectoral basis. I think that is the problem with this. Why is cross&amp;hyphen;sectoral independent advice so important? Quite clearly this government fears independent advice. Right across the board they are abolishing independent sources of advice in such a manner as would provide opportunities for the government and ministers to pick on a hand&amp;hyphen;picked

        In education that is a particularly dangerous proposition. The complexities of the issues, the range of interest groups involved and the manner in which these interest groups are often at each other's throats mean it is extremely difficult for any government, but particularly this government given the minister's ignorance about the issues concerned, to be able to move through the differences that exist within this industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Why was NBEET so important in that regard? Because it provided a vehicle by which people from different sectors with different interests had to confront their prejudices. They were forced to come together and confront their prejudices in a manner which, in my opinion, led to a much better weighing and balancing of the various claims of the various interest groups and, in my judgment, facilitated a much more coherent policy approach. That is quite clearly absent, given that the government has proposed no viable means to provide for independent cross&amp;hyphen;sectoral advice under its new arrangements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, the government is free to pick and choose what advice to call upon. I understand governments are entitled to pick and choose to act on advice, but I find it extraordinary that this government is so intent on cutting off from itself independent advice which may in fact save this country considerable difficulty in financial and, more importantly, in social terms. Getting it wrong in education has enormous implications for this country as a whole.

         In the evidence presented to the committee, I note the speed and the alacrity with which DEET officials went about disbanding NBEET. One can understand why. DEET has for some time sought the removal of that independent cross-sectoral advice in such a way to make sure that it and of course the state governments become the key sources of advice on quite complicated matters. Bear in mind that this portfolio has $14 billion or thereabouts of expenditure per annum. Bear in mind the crucial role that this portfolio plays in terms of the development of Austral ian society, given the importance of education, training and employment.

        So, in effect, we rely entirely upon the actions of the state governments, made up of ministers whose idea of the long-term view is the end of their desk and whose idea of the Commonwealth's role in education, for instance, is that it should just sign the blank cheque and leave the rest to the states. We see appalling circumstances right around this country of the consequences of that sort of attitude, where they resent the involvement of the national government and the involvement of a coherent national policy framework.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you leave it to the states, the parochial interests will always dominate over the national interest. The broader view will always be sacrificed to the short-term, narrow view in terms of the political interests of parochial state governments made up by and large of parochial state ministers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        To me this notion that somehow or other we hand over the money to the states and that premiers, if they so choose, can wallpaper their offices with it is a totally inappropriate means by which to run education and training policies. That is basically the situation that will arise under this new framework which this government is embarking upon. We are left with no other option but to conclude that this government will from time to time seek hand&amp;hyphen;picked persons to provide the words of comfort that it seeks to resolve what are very complex issues.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Of particular concern to me is the way in which the school sector is effectively being locked out of the national policy process by the actions of this government to abolish this board. There is no vehicle for the sector to provide advice on an ongoing basis, to provide the institutional memory that is necessary to ensure the participation of teachers as well as parents in the formulation of national policy. That was quite clearly the view parents put to the committee and it is a view that quite clearly this government is not interested in. I think the bureaucracy does a very good job in many regards, but it should not be the sole source of advice on quite complex issues.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to the amendments being proposed by the government, the main concerns raised by witnesses in the higher education sector and the Australian Research Council were the premature nature of the government's moves to introduce such measures and to provide for a legislative framework which had not allowed for appropriate or detailed consultation with the industry in such a manner which reflected a high degree of bad faith on behalf of the government with regards to the present and what I think ought to be regarded as proper consultative processes. When you add to that the demise of the School Council and the Language and Literacy Council, you see that there is a considerable loss of effectiveness, comprehensiveness and real quality in advice that has been provided by NBEET over the last few years. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Commonwealth officials have agreed in principle to a number of amendments to the WPP where the circumstances meet the requirements of clauses 12 and 12.1. The areas involved are in the Huon and Mersey districts. The Commonwealth is currently considering a request to review the status of a further set of areas, in the Bass, Circular Head, Derwent, Huon and Mersey districts, under this part of the IFA.
