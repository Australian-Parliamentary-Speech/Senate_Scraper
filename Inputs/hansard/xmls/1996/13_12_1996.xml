        Madam President, when the Flags Bill was introduced in 1953 it received enthusiastic bi&amp;hyphen;partisan support.

        The bill does not seek to override the right of Parliament to legislate. Any new flag which might be chosen would become law by the action of Parliament.

        Subsection 3(3) of the bill requires Parliament to prescribe the manner in which a proposal for any alternative design or designs for a new Australian National Flag should be submitted to the electors, the manner in which the vote is to be taken, and the arrangements that might need to be put in place if an alternative design is ever selected as a new National Flag.

        The key intent of this legislation is to reflect the principle that the Australian National Flag belongs to the Australian people; and that the Australian people have the right to be consulted in any proposal to change the Flag. Of course, at any vote retaining the existing National Flag would be one of the options.

        Despite all the government rhetoric that this is a rorted system and is being abused, they have yet to provide evidence of examples where someone has got through the net and run a rorted syndication arrangement. We even had theoretical examples, rather than an actual case, earlier in the debate a few weeks ago. The government has not yet proven that to us or to the Australian people—or, above all else, to that very important segment of the Australian business community that is committed to R&amp;D and is properly using syndication to make Australia more innovative and to produce value added products.

         We therefore strongly urge the Senate to support Senator Cook's amendments to keep syndication as a way of providing the funds to develop R&amp;D in Australia in the private sector.

My own belief is that the government behaved badly, quite frankly, in pursuing this question of syndication rorts in the manner they did. Either there was a case to prove or there was not. In our mind, both in the parliamentary and public forums, they have not proven it and we had real misgivings about it.

        However, the government did correctly pursue the issue of whether syndication is the most cost effective and appropriate mechanism. As you know from our minority report, we have some misgivings about that case. But we have decided on balance to support the government's view, and that is based on two conditions which we believe they have met. The first is a medium&amp;hyphen;term commitment to START over a number of years and the second is the introduction of an amendment to prevent unfair retrospective conditions on the syndication.

        In relation to the matters Senator Harradine raised, the transitional provisions proposed by Senator Cook would allow up to 120 syndicates lodged prior to the government's announcement to be considered at a cost, I am advised, of over $1 billion to the revenue. On this basis, the funding for the START program will not proceed. A number of these syndicates mentioned above have already applied under the START program. We have looked in a sensitive manner at some of the concerns which were raised before the committee. I think the government has moved to address those concerns. Again, I urge the chamber to support the government's position.

One hundred and twenty may well have been lodged, but no-one is suggesting that all 120 would be eligible. We understand they have already been winnowed down to 46. Is that true? So let us get the basis right. If there are still 120 in, you know as well as I do that the 120 have to go through an appropriate process and not all of them would be successful.

        These amendments ensure that all the applications that were in the pipeline before 23 July can be dealt with and are not retrospectively knocked out. This is not to say they will all be granted. We fully support the requirement that they have to go through a very tough, transparent process to see whether they are eligible to meet the rules. But we believe people who applied—lodged their applications—up until 23 July should have the right to have the matter heard under the existing rules.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am surprised, because the Liberal government has always campaigned on the issue in its policy. One of the few principles it seems to argue is that it is totally opposed to retrospectivity. There is a strong element of retrospectivity when people lodge their application before 23 July and then get knocked over by the rules being changed. To use good old Aussie rules vernacular or metaphor, this is shifting the goalposts from one end of the ground round to the wing, or to the half forward flank, while the match is still in play. We do not believe that is fair, especially in the area of encouraging R&amp;D in Australia. This amendment is about removing that aspect of retrospectivity.

        Tim Fischer made it pretty clear what he thought about any element of retrospectivity.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the examples—I think this may have already been drawn to the attention of Senator Harradine—that will be knocked out if we do not get this amendment carried is an R&amp;D project to apply to Gold Mines of Australia at the Mount Lyell mine in Tasmania. That is an R&amp;D project of $14.9 million over a three-year period, leading to developing leaching techniques for extracting copper and copper sulfide ores. If that were successful, that would be a major boost to employment and economic development on the west coast of Tasmania—an area that we all know has got economic problems as far as employment opportunities for its people are concerned. These are the sorts of proposals this government is knocking over.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have not heard any evidence that this particular application is a rort. One would have thought that something that encourages the economic development of the west coast of Tasmania would be a reasonably sound proposition. The technology may not develop; they may not be successful. It is not the point of the R&amp;D program to try to predict beforehand in absolute terms whether it will be successful. It is to encourage people to get into the R&amp;D so that there is a chance this new technology will help the economic development of Australia.

        It is still not clear how many of the applicants will get through with the successful carriage of government amendment No. 15. The government is making a number of accusations that we want up to 120 applicants to go through. We would like the minister to give us an indication—for the public record—as to what the amendment does. The real reason we have proposed our amendments is that we do not think the Senate ought to support a proposal that knocks people out who apply before 23 July under one set of rules—that would retrospectively knock them out.

        The Liberal Party have always argued very strongly that they are against the issue of

         retrospectivity. In this case, we are not talking about the bottom of the harbour scheme—which got the former Liberal Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in a fair bit of strife with some Liberal senators many years ago. We are talking about an R&amp;D program. The government has not shown any evidence that this is a bottom of the harbour scheme at all. Therefore, the retrospectivity element should not be proceeded with.

The application has not been considered by the IR&amp;D Board and the applicant has no advance approvals. The application was not included in the promoter's A list but does appear on the TRA list, the disaffected syndicate applicants.

        I do not know whether this bill is aptly described as the gravedigger's bill, but that is the phrase that has got into the lexicon around this place. We believe that the government amendments have not gone far enough. We note that the government has picked up the recommendation of government senators on the committee report which allowed for applications to be allowed from those with a history of applying—I understand that is two or more applications—and those companies with a tax loss which could not apply at the moment for the 150 per cent. The government has taken those on from the committee; and we believe that is a step forward.

        We announced on 6 December a measure as part of our innovation statement to chop out what is called gravedigging. We believe that was an appropriate decision to stop this

         process. However, we believe that those claims that have been lodged with the department since then should be dealt with. We do not think you should arbitrarily knock them out. Maybe the minister could enlighten us on how many of those claims there are at the moment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There has also been some confusion about whether a claim lodged has also been registered at the same time. I am not certain about the situation just because a claim has not been registered. But if it has been lodged and if it has been receipted that it has been received in the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, to us that means it has been received and it ought to be dealt with under the guidelines laid down on 6 December.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe that our amendment means that those who, in good faith, have lodged their application after 6 December, when we announced the new guidelines, should have their day with the department, knowing full well that there are strict guidelines and that a number of them probably will not succeed. We believe that to just knock them all out holus&amp;hyphen;bolus, other than the two categories the government has accepted from its own senators, is still unfair.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe that all applications that have been lodged should get their day with the department to see whether they are eligible or not. To just, by legislation, knock them out after they have already complied with rules laid down again has an element of retrospectivity which we do not believe, in this case, is fair.

         As I have pointed out in other recent statements, this notion has not been accepted by the Senate and is contrary to the recommendations of both Senate and House committees which have reported on the interpretation and application of section 53 of the constitution. A statement made by the Speaker in the House of Representatives on 2 December this year indicates that the House of Representatives now agrees with the view expressed by the Senate. The proposed requests will therefore be treated as amendments, and the same will be done with any further requests of this type which are circulated by the government.

I assure Senator Harradine, you, Mr Chairman, and others who are interested in this so-called section 53 matter that the government is working very hard to try to solve this impasse so we do not have to keep having these statements every time this fight over requests and amendments is dealt with. I am spending a lot of time on this. Hopefully, when we come back in 1997 it will be resolved.

        The aim of these amendments is to get around the retrospectivity of the government's proposal with regard to compensation settlements. We are concerned that the new arrangements would mean that a compensation settlement made to people between the ages of 16 and 18 after 1 July 1995 would be taken into account after the passage of this bill in calculating the youth training allowance. It would mean a reduction in that allowance or potentially the removal of that allowance because of the past compensation payment.

         This is going to catch people out. It is going to mean that people who have budgeted on the youth training allowance, taking into account a compensation payment that has been made in the last couple of years, are suddenly going to find their budget does not matter. The government is going to reduce the training allowance according to a new formula and it is going to put people in extreme circumstances.

         We had a debate here last night about retrospectivity. There was a strong feeling in this chamber that retrospectivity was not fair when it applied to people who had interests in mining. I do not think it is fair when it applies to young people who are living close to the breadline and who are dependent upon a budget that they have made out according to existing rules. We should not be allowing retrospectivity in this matter. Therefore, we have moved to do away with the government's proposal that the legislation be retrospective to 1 July 1995.

        The fact of the matter is that the government is proposing to introduce a youth allowance from January 1998.

This schedule will abolish the minimum payment of $65.75 a fortnight for young people who receive the youth training allowance, the payment for young people or sickness allowance. The government says that this is in line with attempts to establish a common payments structure and there is currently no minimum payment available through Austudy. I point out that as a result of this change 1,800 young people will receive a reduced rate of payment while 3,900 young people will lose their payment entirely.

        The Democrats agree with the need to push for a common youth payment. As a matter of fact, I can go back to 1984 when I was part of a group of consultants to all of the major churches in Australia and we produced a document called

        What I say to the minister is that although we agree with that push for a common youth payment, we do not believe this should be undertaken simply by reducing the various payments to their lowest common denominator. I point out that despite the good news about unemployment yesterday—and it was good news to see a drop in the rate—the unemployment rate for young people still stands at 29 per cent. I know the government is not happy with that, but at the same time I want to say to the government that we really do not think that this reduction should happen while consultation is still being undertaken for this common youth payment. For that reason, the Democrats will oppose schedule 3.

        It is not just a common youth payment that people are concerned about; there is wide concern about the disincentives to young people that are currently perceived to be in the system in terms of whether they go into education or become unemployed. I think all of us in this chamber would be wanting to see encouragement of young people into education rather than any financial disincentive for that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The situation with the common youth allowance proposal is that any change from that would not be implemented for some time and it would be unduly restrictive to suggest that no change should be made in any of these areas pending resolution of the wider reform directions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The issue of whether payment to under 18&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds should be parentally income tested is not in question in the consultations. The change is consistent with the directions indicated in the youth allowance proposals, that is, to align payment conditions for students and the unemployed and to avoid disincentive to entering full&amp;hyphen;time studies.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as whether it would lead to hardship for families is concerned—which, I believe, is behind the concerns expressed in the chamber this morning—it will affect only those families with income and assets above the parental income assets limits and only imposes the same limits as for Austudy. After all, if we are taking a decision to move to a common youth payment, it is surely appropriate that the same means test be applied to the 16&amp;hyphen; and 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds for both Austudy and youth training allowance.

        Under the current arrangements and the proposed labour market assistance reforms, young people are eligible for priority assistance regardless of their income support status and specific programs or measures to improve school to work transition will also address that issue. So the concerns which senators may have on that score, I think, should be put to rest as well.

         Senator Woodley talked about the number of clients who would be affected by the proposal and I think it is important to recognise what the financial situation is for families. Currently, the minimum rate of $65.75 a fortnight is reached when parental assets exceed $393,750 and when parental income equals $30,435 per annum. Under this initiative, a nil rate of payment will be reached when parental income equals $37,273 per annum or parental assets exceed $393,750. As I have said already, the people who are disqualified from payment due to the initiative will still retain their entitlement to labour market support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This measure is, as Senator Woodley points out, consistent with the common youth allowance and it is just not realistic to provide a minimum payment to all young people. The cost is very great. I am not aware of any key concerns in the consultations over the youth allowance with this particular measure and I would suggest to the Senate that their youth allowance should be no excuse for inaction now.

         —I do not think there is any need for that language if we are trying to get this done in a civilised fashion. You would well realise yourself, if you spend a great deal of time in your electorate office, that that is a concern of many people. But, in addition—perhaps you are not interested in the remainder of the answer—those concerns were borne out in the consultations and those consultations ranged widely not only with parents but also with organisations working with young people. So it was part of the anecdotal evidence, if you like, given to the consultative process, but nevertheless valuable because after all the government is committed to involving the community in establishing this common youth allowance. And that was very clearly the concern of many organisations that consulted in this process.

The emphasis has very much been on trying to achieve simplicity in a very complex system, on treating people in like situations in the same way.

        I will just take you through the cost of this amendment. The 1996&amp;hyphen;97 savings are estimated to be $3.7 million.

They currently do not get that entitlement under Austudy and they would not get it under this proposal for the youth training allowance. I do not believe it is unreasonable. It is certainly not designed to be a massive producer of savings. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile measure in terms of treating people in like situations in a like way. To me that is rational and fair.

        This is obviously one of the most complex and, let us be frank, contentious schedules. I think there will be a considerable amount of debate around all parts of the schedule. I would like to make a couple of general points. I do not want to waste the time of the committee, because this is something that I have canvassed in the second reading debate and on many other occasions in the public arena.

        It is important to make it absolutely clear at the outset of the debate on schedule 5 that the opposition does support tough measures with regard to fraud and compliance, although, of course, we do not believe people should be cut off from benefits without good reason. We do not believe people should be cut off from benefits for an inordinate or indefinite period of time. It is for these reasons that we have, in a general sense, some very serious concerns about measures contained within this

        I can say that we genuinely believe that the proposed activity test regime is one that is excessively harsh. It is unreasonable—particularly in the absence of any measures from the government to assist unemployed people returning to the work force. We really believe that many aspects of this proposal are unworkable. We believe they will very unfairly penalise genuine job seekers, honest job seekers. We do not believe, as the government seems to, that it is the intention of nearly everyone on unemployment benefits to defraud or rort the social security system. We believe the vast majority of those people are genuinely looking for work and warrant the support of government in the difficult circumstances they find themselves in.

        Part 1 of schedule 5 of the social security bill tightens up the use of employer contact certificates. We believe that it is unreasonable to require completed employer contact certificates to be provided with an initial claim for unemployment payments. Our amendments ensure that the employer contact certificates can continue to be utilised, but not until a person is actually receiving a payment. I commend the opposition's amendment to part 1 of schedule 5 to the committee.

         —The Greens oppose the employment contact certificates. I draw the committee's attention to the fact that our amendment that is coming next would get rid of this pretty iniquitous system. The employment contact certificates are a means whereby people when they go to employers—this is selected people—have to get that employer to fill in a certificate to say they have been, they have applied, they have made contact but they have not got the job.

        The problem with it is that it not only annoys the people who have to get the certificates filled in but also annoys employers right round the country. It is a particular impost on small businesses. There is no requirement for the employer to fill in the certificate.

The problem is that some employers will find themselves with a queue at the door, with a big lot of certificates to fill out. Other employers might be amenable to this, but some will simply say no. So through no fault of their own, the hardship falls on the people who are trying to find a job.

        There is no research to show that these certificates help people find work. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to show that it is quite the reverse. It becomes an impediment to people finding work. The employers get upset because they have to fill in these certificates. They are sick of being a statistical piece of evidence for the government, and they simply get their back up. It provides an obstacle to the person who is applying for the job: the employer is annoyed at the outset if the person appears with a certificate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is worse is that the certificate brands the person who is coming up for a job. The employers know that these people are, in some way or other, under special surveillance by the government. So they say, `Hello. Here is somebody with a certificate. I have to watch out here. This person has not been too good at finding a job. I will short cut the whole process of giving a fair interview and giving them a fair go and show them the door. If I feel it is a bad day, I am not going to fill in these certificates.' So they would have wasted their morning, blighted their hopes a bit more, demoralised them a bit more and sent them back to try to explain to the employment office how come they haven't got a certificate filled in. It is a really nasty little system and it is very unfair.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Now the government wants to allow this system to be put onto anybody who comes through the door. Until now, there has at least been some check on it whereby people had to be, in the view of the secretary at least, not doing too well in getting a job. The department might have thought they were not being

         assiduous enough in finding a job and said, `Get some certificates filled out so that we know you have been to the employers.' Now that is no longer required.

So the government is handing over $3.5 billion without a requirement for assessment to the rich, to the corporate sector.

As such, we believe it would be inappropriate to impose these requirements on a person who has simply lodged a claim for newstart.

I would see this provision as a proper exercise of that responsibility; that where they are aware of somebody's unsatisfactory work record, they would require this ECC to be obtained if it is reasonable in the circumstances to obtain it.

         —So 25,000 extra people in a year are going to be required to line up probably to the same employers—probably increasing the employers' frustration—at cost to both small business and the government in terms of administration. It does not seem to be a very smart way to go. It is punitive on unemployed people in this country whom the minister might—I do not—see as work shy. We are in a country where there are far fewer job vacancies than there are unemployed people, and I think those unemployed people have really drawn a short straw.

Also, the more difficult one, but it is important, what is the cost to the business community of this scheme?

It will be harder to achieve the second part of your question because I think it will be quite difficult to get any figures that are really reliable from the business community as to the cost. But, in that I said to you the business community had already indicated to the department that it was not unhappy with the activity test measures that were coming forward, I would expect there would be cooperation, where it was possible, from employers in trying to get that information, which we might be able to make available in the estimates.

        I just do not feel I can give you a cast iron guarantee as to the involvement of the business community.

As far as the cost of the matter in the department and the numbers involved are concerned, yes, I am happy to ask the department to do that work and have it made available to the estimates committee.

        The amendment from the Greens is to do away with these employment contact certificate schemes. I will not go into this at length, but I just reiterate that we believe they punish people unnecessarily, they are a great administrative burden both on the government and on small business and they lead to people who have difficulty finding a job being confronted by angry employers who do not want to waste their time filling out certificates. It is then up to the person to go back to the employment office and explain why she or he did not get a certificate filled it. It demoralises people. It is an impediment to people getting jobs, and the money could be much better spent on initiatives directly aimed at creating jobs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point that I made earlier, and I just reiterate, is that, in a way, this is a forced self-assessment scheme on people who do not have jobs, but the government does not insist on the same sort of assessment for people getting millions of dollars in tax rebates—mining corporations, other big corporations involved in the self-assessment to get research and development returns. The unemployed people have to get the assessment, if you like, from a prospective employer they do not know and may never see again and who can just make life difficult for them because it is annoying the employer.

        So we oppose this system. I think Senator Margetts gave an extremely good example of how it is readily abused and can cause great heartache to people unnecessarily. The money should be spent elsewhere.

It does seem to fly in the face of the previous amendments which were passed. The previous amendments tried to make a bad system a little better. That is why we moved those amendments. In fact, we do not agree with the system at all. We have real problems with the use of employer contact certificates.

        The Welfare Rights Centre, in a recent submission to the community affairs committee, said that there is no evidence to show that these certificates actually help people to obtain work and that they may be the kiss of death to some people's chances of getting a job. That is because when someone presents with a employer contact certificate, the employer says, `Here is someone who is already under a cloud. Therefore, are they the kind of person I want to employ?' Although we admit that there are perhaps some beneficial elements to the certificates, on the whole the negatives far outweigh the positives. For that

         —In response to Senator Mackay, I would say that what guidelines are needed and what are not depend somewhat on the form in which legislation ends up. Frequently guidelines are produced when the legislation is completed. I am very happy to make the guidelines available to the other parties in the Senate as soon as they are finalised, after the legislation. It will not be too long because, once the legislation is passed, we will be wanting to implement the measures. The guidelines will have to be ready very shortly but they are not available and not ready yet.

It is a pretty complicated system. I have sifted out a couple of things. Firstly, people who go for a job for which they are not skilled have the onus on them to negotiate with the employer that they will be skilled on the job. In some vague way, we are supposed to accept that the employer is going to get reimbursed for that training.

        Secondly, a person who goes for a job and sees that the job is not safe with work conditions that are not acceptable has to negotiate with the employer about fixing up those work conditions, otherwise she or he is likely to go back and have their benefits cut off. It is up to this person who is going for a job not only to shoulder the burden of approaching an employer—which is a fair job for many people seeking work, and for youngsters in particular—but also to negotiate that they are going to get training and take back a report saying, `It didn't work. The employer did or didn't agree to give me training.' Also, if they spot that the workplace is not safe, they are going to have to negotiate and come back with a report as to whether the employer was agreeable to fixing up the unsafe conditions. The threat on job applicants is that they will lose their benefits if they have not entered those negotiations.

        The other matter that Senator Brown raised is this question of negotiation. It is not negotiation. That is why I was shaking my head at you. It is not expected that a job seeker will be negotiating. This is not developing a workplace agreement or any form of industrial activity. This is simply that we expect the employee to ask a question, `Will I be trained?' and to get an answer, yes or no.

        Similarly, if you are talking about occupational health and safety conditions, an employee has to say, `I believe this might endanger my health and my safety.

Let me put it clearly on the record that they are going for a job interview and if a situation arises where questions of training or of occupational health and safety are asked, such as, `Will you fix it?' or `Will you give me training?' and the answer is no, they then go back to Social Security and report that fact.

That is the point. You have now got a situation whereby all jobs, or the conditions other than the basic minima prescribed in the act, will be negotiated.

        In fact, the government says, `We want you to negotiate with the employer in terms of an AWA, or whatever'. The difficulty with this is that it is all about negotiation. That is the problem. In order to actually attain a position, the government has encouraged job seekers to sit down and negotiate what the conditions would be in that position, other than the seven prescribed minima. Therefore, for example, training is a negotiable matter in terms of the contract that is finally hammered out between the employer and the employee.

        The broader question that I am asking is: what provision has the department made for the accountability—the checks and balances—of areas like occupational health and safety under a deregulated labour market, where there is a clear nexus between the activities of a department and the activities of the labour market. Even in the term `unsuitable work', `work' equals `labour market'.

        This means that the government is going to have a situation where people have gone into an unsafe workplace because they were coerced—that is, they were told they would lose their benefits if they did not take the job. The situation is then at the whim of the employer, and it could take some time before the employees finally recognise that the employer's whim is not coming good for them.

        The problem here is that the onus is being taken off the department and put on the shoulders of the unemployed to negotiate proper work conditions and to ensure that proper work conditions pertain. When employers are involved in this arrangement—whereby they are de facto arbitrating whether a person is taken off benefits or not—the onus should be very clearly put on them by the department and by the minister. If the employers are not providing training, they should not have the opportunity of taking the unemployed person's services.

        If there is a conflict between the employer and the employee as to who is right or not, which is of course something which the department was well used to in the past, it will be a question on which it will be using its judgment. In most cases, unless it is a situation where perhaps you might have somebody who has a very poor work record or unwillingness to work, it could be that the department would find against the person on benefits. Once again, that is appealable through the existing system.

I assume Senator Woodley was really getting at what steps in our consideration of 9 we should take to consider the issue of obligations to families. Does the department have discretion in that particular matter? I would like to feel that this government has regard for family obligations.

So there is an opportunity there for people to not move to an area where there is a specific job in a number of circumstances, but there is that other clause as well.

It was not an area of high employment—in this case I think it was Toowoomba; theoretically it could be any other place. That person was going to that place to get a job. That person was unsuccessful. That person, therefore, was not eligible for the benefits. That person had been on the benefit for some time, unable to get a job in that area, and responded to a call from his parents to come home to help on the farm, which had been devastated by drought, and to rebuild the place. They were in debt up to their ears and he went back to help the family. There might be illness, or whatever.

        In that spirit it might be possible that, when we move to voting on a range of measures which obviously are of interest to senators, we consider holding divisions over until the conclusion of the committee stage of the bill.

        What should be achievable is to have any divisions on this bill or the further budget measures bill at 5.52 p.m., when we are required to conclude our consideration of the committee stage of debate on these two bills. That means that not only do we get more time to debate now but also that we can have a series of one minute divisions. I have used the word `sensible'. Senator Harradine used the words `eminently reasonable'. There is general agreement. It is only a matter of making it happen. I have always worked in the Senate on the principle that these things are best done when we all agree by leave and if leave is granted. Otherwise, we will have a very

         —I agree with you, Mr Chairman, and thank you for the suggestion of how to deal with it. I would like to briefly address the remaining issues of concern to the opposition in schedule 5. That is a sensible way to contain our debate at this stage. The opposition has concern with both part 3 and part 5 of that schedule.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Part 3 of the schedule extends the penalties for breaches of the activity test to six weeks for the first breach and 13 for the second and subsequent breaches. The activity test regime that Labor introduced when it was in government was a tough one. But, as I indicated very clearly in my speech on the second reading and as was the thrust of my second reading amendment, it was a reciprocal one. It was developed under an arrangement of a reciprocal obligation, where the community undertook to pay income support for those actively seeking work and to provide labour
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         market assistance in employment services which unemployed people need to get back into the work force. In turn, unemployed people were obliged to meet the conditions of the activity test. Penalties were further tightened under the Working Nation job compact, where people were given greater access, variety and training and were guaranteed at least some work experience.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The key issue here is that this government has abandoned the concept of a job compact. It has abandoned the concept of reciprocal obligation. It is in those circumstances that we say that this regime is too harsh. That is why we are proposing amendments to limit breach penalties to the equivalent of just over four weeks non&amp;hyphen;payment for a first breach and just over six weeks non&amp;hyphen;payment for a second or any subsequent breach.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the opposition's part, we acknowledge and accept the very strong case that has been put to us by welfare groups and community organisations arguing that all penalties should be imposed in the form of rate reduction rather than in the form of non&amp;hyphen;payment. The amendments that we have before the committee reflect that suggestion. We will be moving amendments which ensure that all breaches—be they activity test breaches or administrative breaches—are served by way of a reduction in the rate of payment rather than the alternative non&amp;hyphen;payment period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition propose that payments be reduced by 16 per cent, which is slightly higher than the current withholding rate of 14 per cent. Under this regime, people's payments would be reduced for 26 weeks for a first breach, which is a very long reminder to any individual, and by 39 weeks for a second or any subsequent breach, an even longer reminder. The beauty of this regime is that the capacity for significant savings remains for the government, but it does not cause the same level of hardship on unemployed people in the community. That is of fundamental importance as far as the Labor Party is concerned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Part 3 also introduces a period of rate reduction instead of non&amp;hyphen;payment periods for administrative breaches. We support this measure in principle, as I have indicated
        <break page="7525" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         before. But we believe that the proposed rate reduction of 25 per cent is too harsh. We have proposed a regime of 16 per cent reduction for 13 weeks rather than a 25 per cent reduction for eight weeks. The same principle applies to those current administrative breaches destined to become activity test breaches under part 4 of schedule 5.

        I remind the chamber that we received very compelling evidence from welfare groups, such as the Welfare Rights Network and ACOSS, that people serving long breach penalty periods were really left with very little option in terms of their survival. The options that were presented to us were pretty simple and very stark: beg, borrow or steal. In that spirit the opposition proposes the amendments that stand in our name. By no means and never will we be willing to be placed in a position of accepting any rorting or fraud in the social security system. The Labor Party can honestly say we have a very strong record in government in that regard.

        Part 5 of schedule 5 extends the non&amp;hyphen;payment period for moving to an area of lower employment prospects from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. We believe that this is an extremely harsh measure on the part of this government. An extremely unfair measure is being proposed. It really does not take account of the whole range of reasons why an unemployed person may seek to move home. We certainly seek to omit that part from the schedule.

        We are dealing with the activity test and penalty periods. This part of the bill makes a number of changes to both the length and the means of imposing penalty periods on unemployed people who breach their activity test or do not meet the administrative requirements of their payment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Looking firstly at activity test breaches: the bill will change the penalty period for such breaches to six weeks for a first breach and to 13 weeks for any subsequent breaches. Currently, the penalty for a first breach is between two and six weeks and subsequent breaches attract a penalty of the previous breach period plus six weeks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The system of penalties proposed in this bill does have the advantage of placing an upper limit of 13 weeks on the length of any single penalty period, whereas at present there is no upper limit. As most people only breach once, however, the proposal has the disadvantage that it will increase the average penalty period unemployed people are faced with from 3.7 weeks to 6.8 weeks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the Welfare Rights Centre pointed out at the community affairs inquiry, a six&amp;hyphen;week penalty equates to a loss of nearly $1,200 income for the unemployed person and a 13&amp;hyphen;week penalty equates to the loss of just over $2,500 for subsequent breaches. Welfare Rights also pointed out that these losses are far greater than the fines imposed for offences
        <break page="7526" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         such as common assault, assault causing bodily harm, stealing from a person, malicious destruction of property and driving under the influence of alcohol.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People who have such a penalty imposed on them will be thrown into total financial chaos. They will not be able to maintain stable accommodation, they will not be able to keep a car in good running order and will not even be able to meet basic living costs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am reminded of the debate we had a couple of days ago in which one of the welfare agencies—probably the most significant one in emergency relief—the Salvation Army, pointed out that they could not see how, even with an additional $24 million, they would be able to meet the cost of $1.8 billion being slashed from the social security budget.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since then of course the voice of the Reverend Tim Costello, the Treasurer's brother, has been added to that voice and he has underlined the fact that welfare agencies will simply be unable to meet the effect of what we will do here today if we agree to the government's proposal. So I think we need to underline that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Ironically and counterproductively, the effect of that financial chaos will be to severely impair their ability—that is, the people who are the objects of these penalty periods—to continue to look for work. Surely that is not the government's intention.
       </para>

        The Democrats simply cannot support allowing the Department of Social Security—the department charged with the responsibility of alleviating poverty, I would have thought—to throw so many people into abject poverty. We will be supporting the Green and ALP amendments which will soften these penalties for activity test breaches.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Turning now to the changes to the administrative breaches, the bill seeks to replace the system of total payment withdrawal for administrative breaches with a system of partial payment withdrawal. In other words, rather than lose their payment entirely for two weeks, the person will have a 25 per cent reduction in their payment for eight weeks. The Democrats support this change and I

        Senator Brown is revisiting a debate that we had the other day.

Our extra funding is independent of anything to do with this legislation. There is not a connection between this legislation and then providing money to the welfare organisations. It is a recognition of the need that they are in now. A reassessment of the formula, which is overdue, has been promised as well.

        If I can talk now about the ALP and the Greens' amendments on the activity test breach penalties, because there are significant policy and technical difficulties with the proposed amendments. As we have advised the opposition, continuing breaching of the activity test by the unemployed is more than a payment issue. It gets to the broad and the essential qualifications on issues. It is as central as whether someone is still really unemployed and whether they are qualified for any payment. Because if they are employed and they are not declaring their earnings, they are clearly in breach and cannot start to be eligible.

Whether it is labour market programs as under the previous government or whether it is the reforms to the labour market programs which are coming in with the new government, case management and commitment to activity testing under the new regime will still continue.

In other words, if people are prepared to take a lower standard of living, 16 per cent lower, they could continue to access unemployment benefits at the expense of their neighbours—indefinitely, one presumes, because they would not be in breach. Some unemployed people—I am not suggesting by any means the majority—may assess this to be reasonable if they do not need to meet any job search requirements. I think the people outside the chamber and the people in the gallery now who are the people paying for the social security system would find abhorrent the prospect of unemployed people being able to reduce their work efforts and still have their income support from the taxpayer.

        I would hope that Senator Faulkner would take me at my word on this and would be prepared to withdraw his amendments. If he is prepared to do that, I am willing to offer an alternative to the committee which may be agreeable to all parties. I foreshadow that I would move an option which would provide for a rate reduction for a first breach of activity test and the second and subsequent breach would still be seen as the most serious breach of all. As Senator Brown said earlier—it might have been Senator Woodley—not as many people would move on to a second and subsequent breach. Certainly, people who are repeat breaches of the law should be given more serious treatment by the law.

        We would propose that, for a first activity breach, there should be a 20 per cent rate reduction over 25 weeks. That equates to a full reduction of five weeks. For the second and subsequent breach there should be eight weeks of non-payment. I urge the committee to listen seriously to that proposal. I recognise that there is concern around the chamber about people being off all benefits entirely, and I recognised that by changing the payment arrangements for administrative breaches to be a rate reduction. I am concerned, however, that the amendments as they have arrived in the committee from the opposition will mean that there are a whole lot of quite serious breaches which will get through to the keeper which most of us would not endorse at all. I urge consideration of that option.

        The Australian Democrats' amendment in this case is simply to, in a very narrow area, allow the breach to apply. In all other cases, the Democrats are opposed to the government action. That simply is in the area where in fact a strike is in breach of the umpire's decision. It is only in that case that a penalty period could apply. If the government is not prepared to accept that amendment, of course we will vote against the schedule, as other opposition parties are doing.

        I can really make the opposition's case very quickly indeed. We are proposing to omit these schedules from the bill. They are open and shut cases of a breach of an election commitment on the part of the government. In relation to the proposal to restore the earnings credit scheme, the coalition said in their pre&amp;hyphen;election policy: `The earnings credit scheme will be retained by a coalition government.' This is nothing more or less than a direct broken coalition promise. It is a betrayal of the Australian people and the electorate.

        The same is the case in relation to the employment and education entry payments.

          quickly. Schedule 10 relates simply to the removal of the earnings credit scheme whereby people who were on social security or pensioners could earn up to $1,050 if single or $2,100 if married from part&amp;hyphen;time work before they started to be penalised. It is a great opportunity for people to get outside of the grind of not having a personal income or fulfilment, to do bits of work that would enable them to have a bit of extra pocket money and to be a little more productive as members of society.

        The government comes along, against its own election promises, as Senator Faulkner has said, and is going to clobber it to help its budgetary problems. Then they move on from that to say, `There is this provision of $100 for people who have been unemployed for 12 months or who have been on disability support pensions and so on.' It is a measly $100 to help them with their transition back into work when they find it.

        There are considerable costs with getting into work, as we all know, if you are going to be able to do it well. There is a barrier after long-term unemployment with getting into work. The $100 is not a big amount, but the minister through this legislation is going to clobber that altogether.

        Then there is the final provision which I do not quite understand, but the minister could enlighten us, I have no doubt.

I indicate on behalf of the opposition, as I think the government is aware, that we support a very large part of this schedule. I think these are changes that make administrative sense. We do have serious concerns about the unintended consequences of the measure, particularly for migrant women. It is for that reason that we will be seeking to omit items 19, 26 and 27 of the schedule from the bill.

        By doing this, alternative payments to the special benefit will still be available to women over age pension age who cannot, because of residency conditions, claim the age pension. I think this will protect women who otherwise would fall through the cracks. That is the approach that the opposition is taking, and the minister might care to comment on that in her response. It does not help the minister much because Senator Brown is still not here.

        Given that the widow allowance and partner allowance are non-activity tested payments made instead of newstart allowance to recognise the labour market disadvantages of these groups, there is no rationale for granting them after age pension age. Indeed, doing so can only be highly discriminatory on the basis of gender and marital status without any reason.

         —I would like to address some issues raised in schedule 10 and 11, and I will do that concurrently and as briefly as possible. As I think perhaps most senators would now realise, one of the issues in relation to the earnings credit scheme has been its low take-up rate by the people. Although there are nearly four million customers potentially who could access the scheme, only about three per
         <break page="7539" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          cent of those actually accessed the earnings credit scheme over a year.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is despite the constant endeavours of the department over quite a long period of notification to people on unemployment benefits of the availability of the scheme and what it could mean to them. I say `constant' because they get quarterly newsletters from the department which spell out their entitlement and encourage them to take up the opportunities that are available to them. It has been extremely complex for the department to administer but, more importantly perhaps, it is very complicated for people who are entitled to actually understand what they may be entitled to—even having been told about it. Then only three per cent actually bother to take it up.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has sought as far as possible to maintain the spirit of our commitment to protect the more vulnerable. Customers who access the earnings credit scheme are by definition receiving income above the income test free areas. Abolishing the scheme therefore does not affect the most vulnerable customers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The aim of the scheme is important too. The aim was: to provide an incentive for customers to supplement their social security benefits by undertaking work wherever it was possible. Our research has shown that there is a limited understanding, as I have said. Moreover, the additional incentive to take up work is no longer considered necessary—and this is, to me, one of the most telling arguments of all. In the middle of last year, the previous government introduced new income test arrangements for allowees which included the removal of the 100 per cent withdrawal rate, the abolition of the joint income test and the introduction of a partner income test—which already provide a significant incentive for allowees to take up work opportunities. People who tell you that there is not an incentive in the system are in fact referring to what it was before July last year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The existing pension income test has a higher free area than allowances and more relaxed arrangements, meaning that customers are better off working, even without access to any earnings credit. So that now applies to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         both pensioners and those on allowances. The earnings credit scheme advantages those who have a one&amp;hyphen;off employment or investment windfall but it provides no ongoing benefit to those with longer&amp;hyphen;term employment. I would urge you to consider that.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition, I would urge you to consider the importance of the measure in financial terms because it is very costly to administer, as I said. The savings in this area would be: $20.6 million in the first year and $75.8 million, $79.5 and $83 million in subsequent years—making a total of $258.9 million. So although it is a small number of people who have accessed it it has cost us a great deal to administer, out of all proportion, I would suggest, to the benefits which the scheme has produced.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In terms of the employment entry payment and the education entry payment, we have been very careful to make sure that sole parents, who have been the main ones to access the education entry payment, have that right preserved. So pensioners are in fact still able to access the education entry payment, but the employment entry payment and the education entry payment for people on allowances are being removed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the things which senators are perhaps not alert to is the fact that recipients will continue to also have access to the advance facility to assist them to meet any up&amp;hyphen;front or employment costs—that is the loans scheme. In total terms, it is more beneficial than the employment and education entry payment. Under the advance scheme, they can get more money than they could under this scheme which is proposed to be abolished.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition, there are provisions for funding through  DEET under Senator Vanstone's proposals for access to employment to help people take up employment. In both departments there are still opportunities for people to access assistance to take up employment. The savings on the employment entry payment over four years will be $59.4 million and $7.2 million on the education entry payment. So we are talking about substantial contributions to the government's budget task, and I would urge senators to take that into account when they consider these motions.

        The first is the artificially low impairment ratings, which are, without doubt, designed to get as many people as possible off the disability support pension. There is a lack of recognition of the greater effects caused by multiple impairments and an absence of a table to assess chronic pain and fatigue based illnesses. Our amendments also recognise the fact that disability impairment tables are intended to measure a person's work related abilities. Therefore, they should not infringe on an individual's right to choose or reject treatment which they find unsuitable. They also reinstate the tables dealing with musculoskeletal and ear, nose and throat problems.

It was simply a recognition that the impairment tables needed `finetuning'—I cannot think of another word.

        As a result, the tables were achieved by careful study by a committee of medical experts in the field of rehabilitation medicine and disabilities. That committee reported to the previous government and the table was neither accepted nor rejected. They just had not got on to doing something about it. When we came into government it was clearly an item that needed to be progressed. It was the normal course of government administration rather than any ideological effort or trying to get disability support people off pensions, as

        There is no doubt that, as a result of these new impairment tables, people will either lose or not qualify for a disability support pension. There are a couple of areas of particular concern. Some impairments which previously attracted a five or 10 rating now attract a nil rating. The instructions about how the tables are to be used also are of concern—in other words, whether or not a particular disability can be counted under two or more tables. Let me be clear on this.

Our amendments will certainly go nowhere near that in risking the disability support pension to those with a disability.

They are much less harsh than the government's proposals and they take into account multiple impairments. That is one of the key features of our amendments. For instance, they allow a rating of 10 per cent or 10 per cent to be added where there are two minor impairments. We feel this is very important in looking at the ability of a person to work as a whole person and not just as someone with a particular disability or set of disabilities.

         —The monitoring committee that I was referring to was in relation to the new impairment tables if they become part of the legislation. In practice, even the best recommended tables—such as these or any others—can be found over time and usage to have a problem with them. Having that monitoring committee is not an unreasonable way to go. But what you are suggesting now, I presume, is not the monitoring committee that I was suggesting but something similar in the sense of an opportunity to have further consultation with interested parties before they come back in separate legislation to the Senate.

         —On amendment 14, the Greens are concerned that the government move limits the payment of child disability allowance in that it cuts the ability to claim on that allowance from 12 months to three months before a claim is made. I did speak with the minister about this when she gave us the opportunity of discussing the whole panoply of amendments a week or two ago.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The problem is that people who find themselves with a disabled child very often do not get around to making the claim for assistance. Under existing circumstances, they can make a claim up to 12 months retrospectively to catch up. They have been very busy looking after a disabled child. They may have been to and from hospital. They may have had home help. They may have been arranging a whole range of supports for themselves and for that child. The whole family may be involved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are very often the exact circumstances which lead to people to think last of how to get some monetary support. With this measure, the government is saying, `Look, if you weren't watching, if you didn't know this support was available when your problems began 12 months ago, too bad. You can only claim back three months.' It is not a good way to go. The Greens do not support it. It is not going to alter the fact that a disabled child has been getting costly aid through their parents or carers. That cost is not going to disappear simply because we make an amendment here in this committee.

        This really is a case of chopping a very important and valid benefit. No-one could dispute this benefit. It is a case of cutting that benefit to help meet the budget imperative of the government. This is not a case of trying to catch people who are doing the wrong thing. This is a case of trying to take away a benefit from people because they simply did not apply for it at the right time. They were

        I think the committee should think very carefully about the move the government has made to say, `You can go back three months and claim on that, but you can't go back 12 months. Sure your child was disabled, sure there were costs there and sure you'll need the money now for the ongoing ability to deal with this situation, but too bad. You didn't know about it. You can't have it.' It is not a very social logic, and we oppose it.

The opposition will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. We believe this is unacceptably harsh because it really does fail to recognise the hardship which can be suffered by the parents of children with disabilities. Those disabilities could take over three months to diagnose. That is one possible concern. Another concern is that it could take more than three months to establish the required pattern of extra care or attention. It is for these reasons that the opposition strongly opposes schedule 14.

If this had been the situation when the allowance was first introduced, you might have been able to describe a limitation on the period in those terms. This payment has now been around for quite a long time.

        It is the only payment in the entire social security area which has arrears of more than three months. In fact, most payments have no right to arrears. In the family area, there are payments with three months arrears and we were moving to put this payment into the same bracket as existing ones. I do not know whether there is any indication from the committee that it would be prepared to consider an in&amp;hyphen;between amount of time. Now that the payment is well&amp;hyphen;established and is known widely through the medical profession, through community nursing and also through many families, with it regularly being brought to their attention, and given the justification and the need for 12 months arrears—in other words, that families do not get to know about it for quite a long time—I would have thought it was not an unreasonable proposition to bring it into line with other payments.

        In relation to amendments Nos 86 to 91 standing in the name of the opposition, we will be opposing this part of the schedule to restore the divisor for calculating the lump sum compensation preclusion period to average weekly earnings. Pensioners and allowees affected by this measure will otherwise be subject to much longer periods without payment, forcing them to use up their compensation at a much lower rate before they are eligible for financial assistance or for continued assistance. Our amendments are written in a way that retains the beneficial provision for partners included in the schedule.

         Opposition amendment No. 92 applies in relation to schedule 20. Labor supports measures which encourage social security recipients to maximise the return on their resources but this measure relies on pensioners and allowees being able to access safe accounts which pay interest at the deemed rate. In the current climate where interest rates have been officially cut but where the minister must again consider whether or not to cut the deeming rates, this concession on the first $2,000 for a single person or $4,000 for a couple is especially critical to pensioners and allowees. Under half of all financial institutions make these available. Not all are available to all pensioners and allowees. Very few currently offer the deemed rate of interest on small deposit accounts of the below threshold rate. The measure relies on financial institu tions moving to provide accounts which pay the deeming rate on these accounts.

There are an estimated 721,000 pensioners, about 600,000 from DSS and the remainder in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and around 60,000 allowees who will be affected.

        The government's intention with schedule 21 is to allow the Department of Social Security to recover overpayments made as a result of administrative error. Those overpayments, where they are received in good faith by the customer, are not recoverable by the department. The risk with the proposal before us, however, is that it will remove any imperative on the department to be timely in processing information provided by the client as it can always go back and reclaim the money.

        Because the income testing rules are so confusing, many people would not know what their correct entitlement should be.

The person has done everything required of them, and the department is solely to blame.

        Given the level of savings that the government hopes to achieve from this measure, the Democrats are keen to see if some compromise could be reached.

        As Senator Faulkner pointed out, clients have to notify the department within two weeks of the overpayment.

I seek an indication from Senator Faulkner that he is opposing most of schedule 21, apart from those items he has signalled as amendments to schedule 21. If that is the case, we would support his amendments. However, I stress that the bottom line for the Democrats is that the imperative must remain for the department to be efficient in dealing with these matters.

        In relation to schedule 22, the advanced payment scheme, the proposed amendments will modify the operation of that scheme for pensioners and the unemployed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is expected that these changes will improve recovery of advances by the department. At the same time the scheme will be liberalised through the removal of the requirement that people access advanced payments only for certain permitted purposes. Removal of this restriction will allow, for example, an unemployed person to use the money to purchase a fridge or to pay a rental bond. The Democrats will be supporting this schedule.

        I just want to go back one step and also say that, as with the Labor Party, we will be aiming to keep the limits on the deeming rate as far as pensioners' accounts are concerned. Taxing pensioners for small amounts of income that they did not get on money they have in the bank is what this is about. If there is $2,000 in the bank and the bank is paying less interest than what the government deems the interest ought to be, the pensioner gets taxed not on the amount of interest they are paid but on the higher interest that is nominated by the government. So we have this extraordinary situation where people on low incomes very often are paying tax on money they did not receive.

The introduction by the previous government of bank deeming and then extended bank deeming has seen a dramatic improvement in the way banks have treated pensioners. We are continuing that. We believe that the previous government's route was a correct one. We supported it then. We are now moving to make sure that right down to the last dollar pensioners have the opportunity to get a decent return on their money.

        A number of financial institutions are already paying the deeming rates right down to the last dollar. We are introducing this measure to encourage those who are still paying only one per cent on those smaller amounts—the ones under $4,000. I welcome the fact that the Democrats understand the measure and have seen that it is a beneficial one for maximising pensioners' income, because above the deeming rate they get to keep it without it having any impact on their pension.

You yourself are saying that there are some institutions who are still paying low interest rates and that the banks in the main have fallen into line because otherwise the pensioners will change where they put their deposits.

I understand it is a very substantial amount, but that is a reflection on the efficiency of the department to a certain extent.

        The government can say, `If banks overpay, they can recover debts.' But that is not quite the same when we are talking about the government and government servants.

        I know that we are in a different ball game here than is the Commissioner of Taxation but, nevertheless, I do take the point that was made by one of the honourable senators—I do not know who it was. Where, for example, the department has been notified by a beneficiary that there has been an overpayment and within the two&amp;hyphen;week period that beneficiary has made the declaration of a change of circumstances and still the payments in respect of the old circumstances continue and the next payment comes along and that person goes back and says that they have advised them of their change of circumstances, surely that is a matter that should be taken into consideration by the department.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Overall, I understand and acknowledge that there is a problem. I do not agree with the government in respect of the 13 weeks. That is absolutely out of the question. There is a two&amp;hyphen;week period for notifying a change of circumstances, and I suppose under those circumstances you are looking at maybe four weeks in addition to that time. Should there be some problems in respect of overpayments, I suppose I can understand the need for the department to protect revenue.

I certainly would not go along with 13 weeks. I want a quite definite assurance from the minister with respect to the interpretation of the word `hardship' and a guarantee that the department's administrative systems attend to this problem fairly rapidly. As I understand it, the figure is something like $300 million. Could the minister advise the committee of that?

         —Senator Harradine, the advice I have is that this item covers an amount of approximately $265 million. It is, as you say, a substantial sum. I recognise your concerns about the length of time in which it is proposed that the department could come back to reclaim debt. If I could get support for a proposal to take it back to six weeks I would be prepared to do that. There are technical problems with the department being able to guarantee that they can take action within the first four weeks, but within the first six weeks is possible. I think it also has the advantage of keeping pressure on officials to make sure that they keep these matters under review all the time.

        One of things that I do think is perhaps appreciated by some senators is that—and I raised it the other day in this place—you have the opportunity to make the whole question of inadequate administration much more transparent. Currently, a lot of these overpayments and debts are not quantified to the extent that they are available to, say, the estimates committees, the Public Accounts Committee or the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. They are not identified specifically. This measure will make it much clearer to all concerned as to how well the department is administering this area of its
        <break page="7553" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         responsibility. For that reason, I think it is a move in the right direction.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as individuals and hardship is concerned, there is a general rule that all overpayments should be repaid according to the recipient's capacity to pay. As far as people who cannot afford to pay are concerned, the department will not take action against a person who cannot afford to pay. If they could not pay by way of lump sum, which for most people is difficult, but they could repay by reasonable instalments without any penalty or interest, then they would be expected to do so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also protection for customers provided in the write&amp;hyphen;off provisions of the act. They have been preserved in the government's amendments. If customers have no capacity to repay their debt, recovery action can be suspended indefinitely by the writing off of the debt under the act. This gives the Commonwealth the ability to resume recovery in the future if the person's financial circumstances improve.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition, in cases where there are other special circumstances that would make recovery unjust or unreasonable there is scope to waive recovery of the debt altogether. One of the issues that might properly be considered in this regard is the period over which the administrative error occurred. The decision maker is thus able to consider the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether recovery is warranted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Do not forget also that customers who are dissatisfied with the decision about the recovery of their debt still retain access to the range of internal and external review and appeal mechanisms and they also have access and recourse to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I would hope that those statements might deal with some of Senator Harradine's concerns as to the ability of people to pay and the hardship situation that they might find themselves in.

        From the opposition's perspective, let me make clear what I think is a view that may be shared by other senators in the chamber. I am saying, as a result of Senator Harradine's suggestion, that the opposition is certainly willing to negotiate. I think that is a view that is reflected around the chamber. I am not saying the opposition agrees with the government's position. It is important that that is placed on the public record as far as the opposition is concerned.

        The Labor opposition has circulated some five amendments to the further budget and other measures bill. The first four amendments I would like to say a few words about. The fifth amendment, which deals with rental assistance, my esteemed colleague Senator Faulkner will deal with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The four amendments relate to the proposed deeming of earnings on superannuation for a person who reaches the age of 55 and the subsequent adjustment down of their various social security benefits such as unemployment and disability pension, depending on the level of their superannuation asset. I spoke extensively on this in the second reading debate. This matter has been examined by the esteemed Select Committee on Superannuation
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         chaired by my esteemed Tasmanian colleague Senator John Watson who, I should say, is not a member of the Labor opposition; he is a Liberal chair of that committee.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The intention of the four amendments is to ensure that a person who has $250,000 in superannuation assets is not affected by deeming their superannuation. So people who have more than $250,000 in superannuation assets would be affected by the government's proposals. The second principle of our four amendments is to ensure that a person who has made an investment after 20 August is affected by the measure. So superannuation accrued after that date and where it reaches $250,000 is deemed—as the government is suggesting.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I just want to make a few comments about why we have picked a figure of $250,000. I know the minister has argued that this is too high a figure and that we should treat asset classes consistently when a person reaches the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         age of 55. Labor believes that superannuation is a different type of asset class. It is long-term investment for a person's retirement when they reach the age of 60 and beyond.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was certainly understood by the Australian people—up until this measure was announced on budget night—that superannuation is a long-term investment. We have actively encouraged investment in superannuation. Certainly the 67,000 people who will be affected by this measure believed that—up until budget night.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason we have chosen that figure of $250,000 is that—if $250,000 is converted into an annuity or pension income stream when a person reaches 60 or whatever age they choose to take that income—if a person went to purchase an annuity or a pension for $250,000 at today's market interest rates, it would earn you $6,500 to $7,000 in an income stream. That would roughly equate to some $16,000 or $17,000, depending on the annuity or the pension you could buy. That is not a lot of money. We believe that that is an appropriate cut-off figure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point about ensuring that superannuation money accrued after 20 August is taken into account is that there is a significant element of retrospectivity in what the government is proposing. People were encouraged into superannuation by both the current government and Labor over a long period of time—I think since about 1951 when the then Menzies government introduced a range of tax incentives for superannuation. That has been understood up until 20 August, budget night this year. We do not see why people should have to unravel their retirement plans. Therefore, we regard the measure as retrospective in its effect. We believe this measure should take effect for superannuation investment accrued after 20 August, budget night.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They are the reasons for the Labor opposition's four amendments. There has been extensive debate on this issue in the media, in the select committee hearings and in the debates on the second reading. The government's measure announced in the budget was certainly not referred to in the coalition's election manifesto when it went to the people in March this year. Therefore, this
        <break page="7561" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The people that will be hit the hardest by this measure—those who have less than $250,000 in superannuation—are people who gave evidence to the committee. I give as examples an electrician, a bank clerk and a railway worker who have retired at the age of 55. The ones who will be hit the hardest are elderly people who reach the age of 55, who are unemployed and who find it very difficult to obtain a job. We have a range of questions that we would like to have asked you, Minister, but I understand the time constraints so I will keep my comments to that at this stage.

        The Minister has argued previously that people will not be required to eat into their superannuation. To sustain this argument you need to draw what I would see as a totally artificial distinction between a person's superannuation capital and the interest that accrues on that.

        In reality, people simply look at the total amount they have in superannuation as their superannuation savings and, if the affected people want to maintain their current lifestyle, they will have no option but to draw down on those funds.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While $150,000 may sound like a lot of money we need to remember that these are the funds that people were hoping would support them through&amp;hyphen;out 20 or 30 years of retirement.

        The other point I would take issue with the Minister on is her recent statements that superannuation assets are no different to other assets and should, therefore, be treated no differently to things like shares or investment properties.

        Finally, to date, I have not seen any detail on just how people are expected to access the interest the Minister says they can live on. Superannuation funds are not going to be making fortnightly interest payments to assist people to top up their income support payment.

        In addition to that, you have the situation where, to access their superannuation in accordance with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry Regulations, these people would have to provide their super fund with a statutory declaration saying they no longer intended to work.

         I can think of nothing more compelling than the investment which many people in Australia put into their small business. It may not be the same small business that they started out their working life in but they roll over their capital into one small business after another. They do this with the view that it will be their nest egg for retirement. I would suggest that that, too, is a long-term investment for retirement income. But, as far as the confirmation goes, it is very important to understand that, where somebody genuinely cannot access their superannuation, I have the power to exempt them from the provisions.

        This schedule cuts the maximum rate of rent assistance by a third for singles living in shared accommodation.

        This schedule cuts rent assistance paid to single people in shared accommodation. About 80,000 people will be affected, and it will cut that rate of rent assistance by a third. It is a clear broken promise on the part of this government.

        From July next year, the maximum amount of Rent Assistance available to single people who share accommodation will be cut by one third from $73.80 a fortnight to $49.20 a fortnight—a reduction of $24.60.
       </para>

        The Government justifies this on the grounds that "single people who share accommodation can achieve cheaper housing costs than single people living alone".

        As result of this change, around 80,000 people lose up to $25 a fortnight. Most of those affected will be unemployed people but a significant number of Age and Disability Support Pensioneers will also be disadvantaged.

        There are a number of points that need to be made in setting out our opposition to this proposal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Firstly, people, particularly young people, are often forced to share accommodation because the level of their unemployment allowance is below the poverty line.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The biggest economy of scale these people reap is cheaper rent and, because they pay less rent, they receive less Rent Assistance. Thus, the current system already takes account of economies of scale.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, while people may achieve economies of scale other than rental costs by sharing accommodation, reducing Rent Assistance to account for these savings would not be appropriate as, in the Department's own words, "rent assistance is not intended to meet non&amp;hyphen;housing costs".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thirdly, if, as a result of this change, unemployed people move to a cheaper area they may end up losing their social security payment of 6 months.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Typically, the cheaper areas to live are those on the outskirts of town or in regional areas and are usually those with lower employment prospects.

         —by leave—I think the same way. The debate on the further budget and other measures bill is almost completed, although I understand that Senator Harradine has not as yet made a contribution. We should deal with that and then move on to other matters, sort out the voting pattern for this legislation and come back and take the vote. It is a pretty simple procedure but we do need some time to organise that vote; otherwise it will become extraordinarily complicated and some of us, I am sure, are going to have difficulty keeping up with the complexity of the votes.

         —There you are; you were listened to. I do commend that amendment to the chamber because it does recognise those who are most vulnerable which, as I have said, is what we have tried to do all along. The government stands by its position on shared renters. Under the current arrangements, two people sharing can have an extra $80 a fortnight more than a couple sharing. Even under the new arrangements, two singles sharing will still have $30 a fortnight more than a couple.

        If the opposition—the former government—were concerned about that, they obviously did not look to increase the proportion of rent assistance for couples. They left that disparity. One wonders why, because surely people in a similar position should be treated in a similarly equitable way. I believe that, by leaving singles sharing with $30 a fortnight more than a couple sharing, the additional costs, such as they are for singles as compared with couples, are recognised.

        I do not believe that this is an unfair measure and I certainly believe that, with the amendment exempting disability support pensioners and those on a carers pension, we have addressed a legitimate concern which Senator West said she referred to in her speech on the second reading. I commend that amendment to the chamber.

Couples have the advantage that they can live and rent a one&amp;hyphen;bedroom unit, apartment or facility without running the risk two singles would if they were renting a one&amp;hyphen;bedroom place. The couple will not have Social Security coming in to check what the sleeping accommodation is. With singles, if two of them happen to be sharing a one&amp;hyphen;bedroom place, Social Security will be in to check that they are in single beds, so they are up for a great deal more invasion of privacy.

        Minister, I have a question. I think there is an unintended consequence of this amendment. I will go back to my grotty tenement place where we have the shared bathroom and shared kitchen. I ask you: is it now not true that, as a result of this amendment that you are going to move, you could have in one room someone on a disability support pension, perhaps with a psychiatric disability or some other sort of disability, sharing the kitchen and bathroom with somebody who is in receipt of an old age pension and who lives in the next room? That person who is in receipt of the old age pension will get a reduction in rent assistance. The person on the disability support pension will not get any reduction in their rent assistance, but the old age pensioner, the widow pensioner or any other of those sorts of beneficiaries, is going to cop a reduction in their rent assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Usually the people living in these situations are single, elderly women. Maybe they are widowed or maybe they have been single and never worked in an occupation that has enabled them to have superannuation and they are totally dependent on the flat basic rate of the old age pension. They will suffer a cut in their rent assistance while the person on the disability support pension who is living in the room next door, sharing the same facilities, will not have their rent assistance cut. Is that not an anomaly? Is that not discrimination against that old age pensioner?

This situation has occurred during the day, unfortunately. As I see it, there has been some government awakening to its responsibility to the people who will be hurt by this amendment, but that leaves a range of people in shared accommodation greatly disadvantaged. Everything I said earlier remains, as far as young people, in particular, but also a whole range of people in our community who are living in shared accommodation are concerned.

        The nasty thing about this measure, as with so many measures we have discussed today, is that it is designed to meet the government's budgetary requirements. It is not to meet a social purpose; it is not to get around fraud or some sort of loophole. It is designed simply to take money out of poor people's pockets, out of the pockets of the vulnerable, to meet a government need to give rebates to corporations which have been able to lobby this government more effectively than people who have been living in pretty hard circumstances in shared accommodation.

The government has a point. Time does not enable me to elaborate greatly but I ask this question: why should someone with a house, plus $180,000, plus $250,000 in superannuation be regarded as eligible for welfare? That is a matter which, in the two minutes left, the minister might be able to explain.

         <break page="7569" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          I recounted to somebody recently about the kind of situation the Senate finds itself in. I used the term `squirrel handshake' and the person concerned said to me, `What on earth is a squirrel handshake?' and I said, `A squirrel handshake is like the situation the Victorian legislature has the Senate in over this bill—namely, that it is referring something to us which we want, but it is referring it to us in a manner which makes it very difficult for us to amend.' He said, `Yes, I understand that, but what does a squirrel handshake mean?' and I said, `It's an old sporting term from my part of the world which refers to someone squeezing your nuts.' That may not be all that parliamentary, but it is very explicit about the situation we have.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question for this Senate is: do we accept or reject the referral? On balance, we think we should, so do the unions and, incidentally, so do Labor and the Democrats. This bill's giving legislative effect to the reference of Victoria's IR powers to the Commonwealth is not quite a mouse, but it is not quite a lion either. Hopefully in time the two governments will advance to a complete system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the time of the announcement, we were told by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), by Minister Reith and by Premier Kennett that this was a historic achievement, unprecedented in 96 years of Commonwealth government, and a massive change of massive benefit to workers and employers alike in Victoria. That is a little hyperbolic, but it is certainly the first time we have been faced under the constitution with a unitary system for a state and the Commonwealth on industrial relations, or at least the progress towards one.

         However, when the Victorian state legislation was tabled, a different reality emerged. True, Victoria has proceeded to refer industrial relations matters to the Commonwealth, but not all of them. We welcome the referrals that have occurred, and we welcome the fact that the Victorians have finally accepted the reality and benefits of the federal system. But those matters that have been referred are qualified. The reference is, unfortunately, subject to overriding Victorian legislation at any time and can be withdrawn by the Vic torian cabinet at any time, in which case we will return to the situation that pertained prior.

        The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will not enjoy the power invested by every state commission of making comprehensive common law awards. Its power over Victorian public servants, particularly the between 10,000 and 11,000 police, is severely curtailed. Indeed, it is difficult to fully see just what altogether Victoria is ceding with respect to its own employees. True, we do know it is ceding unfair dismissal powers but that was only under the threat of the Democrats and the Senate dragging them into the federal jurisdiction with the external affairs power anyway.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It should be pointed out that, courtesy of the fast&amp;hyphen;track mechanism placed in the industrial relations acts by the ALP and the Democrats in 1992, the vast bulk, at least three&amp;hyphen;quarters, of Victorian workers have already exited the Victorian system for the Commonwealth. The last group of Victorian public servants finally achieved their first federal award yesterday. Each constitutional challenge by the Victorians was rejected by the High Court allowing justice for Victorian workers but at the expense of millions of dollars of workers' and taxpayers' funds wasted in futile litigation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill is of benefit to the Commonwealth figure of between 100,000 and 200,000 workers left in the Victorian system and the Victorian figure of up to 400,000. Take your pick, it is certainly not more than one&amp;hyphen;quarter of Victorian workers. It will allow easier access to federal awards, to certified agreements and to Australian workplace agreements. It will provide access to protected industrial action for workers on collective agreements at the conclusion of their agreements, for workers on individual agreements when the agreements are deemed to end in three years, and for all other workers immediately.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It will preserve the minimum underpinning conditions of the Victorian industrial relations system, but with the AIRC taking over the role of setting minimum wages. It will ensure that no new employment agreements can be entered into under the Victorian system. All
        <break page="7570" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         new agreements will have to be vetted by the commission or the Employment Advocate as certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Victorian workers will not any more have to contrive an interstate dispute to access the federal award making powers. However, unions will still need to log employers because the Victorians would not cede common rule powers. They will still need to show that the making of an award is in the public interest and where there is a bona fide employment agreement in place, which has the support of both employers and employees, the commission will not be able to proceed to make an award to override the agreement unless it would not be contrary to the public interest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the committee stage, I will be moving an amendment to exclude the operation of section 111AAA where agreements are not bona fide—that is, where agreements were not genuinely made; for example, where agreements were made under coercion or duress. Given that the Victorian employment agreements were not vetted and given the parlous state of the Victorian labour market over the past four years, evidence at the Senate inquiry into the Workplace Relations Bill was that many employment agreements were able to be forced on employees and with them substandard working conditions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats do not believe, and obviously because they will support our amendment, neither does the government, that such employment agreements—in other words, those which are not bona fide—should be recognised as adequate for the purposes of section 111AAA. We will be moving to ensure that workers subject to such employment agreements have prompt access to awards. I also note that the commission retains its powers under section 111(1D) to make interim awards for such employees quickly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats are also concerned about two other aspects of the bill. Firstly, we are concerned that the transitional arrangements for associations recognised in the Victorian system could become a back door means for associations to avoid the registration requirement of the federal system. We wish to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         ensure that important protections, such as the conveniently belong rule in section 189, apply fully to those organisations and that transitional recognition arrangements end after one or two years. I ask the minister to address this issue in the drafting of regulations and to ensure that the ACTU, employer groups and the major parties concerned are consulted.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats are further concerned that section 493(2) will allow regulations to proscribe state laws of Victoria which can override federal awards. The Victorian state reference legislation already sets down what are in our view far too many situations where they can override federal awards and we would be most concerned about a large number of other laws being proscribed in federal law in addition. I seek an assurance from the minister that this power would be used sparingly to preserve to the greatest degree possible the integrity of the federal award system when dealing with those workers who are not presently within it. With these comments, I wish to indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the government's bill and we will be supporting the government's amendments.

        this referral will allow Commonwealth industrial laws to apply to people and activities which would otherwise be outside the scope of its constitutional powers.

        At the outset, I would like to repeat the concerns I outlined when the motion to exempt this bill from the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion was debated. That concern relates to the undue haste with which this legislation has been
        <break page="7571" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         pushed through this parliament. The reality is that this bill, which represents one of the most important constitutional changes in the industrial relations arena this century, could have been debated in February next year. It is important in this context to note that the proposed intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the Victorian governments in relation to this issue will not be finalised until early next year. Why then are we debating this bill in a limited time frame on the last day of sitting for 1996.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst I am pleased that the bill was referred to the Senate Economics Committee for a quick examination, the fact remains that many of the people who made submissions to the committee were forced to throw together their ideas at extremely short notice and with very little information. I am sure that many of the implications of the bill will not become apparent until next year. By that time, it will be too late.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I support the minority report of Senators Sherry and Cook but I believe that, if the ALP amendments are not passed, the bill will not be supportable. I will not discuss the amendments in detail at this point, but I feel that on balance the protections inherent in these amendments will improve the bill sufficiently to enable me to support it. Without them, this bill has too many grey areas, and I feel it would be inappropriate to support such a bill largely on trust.

This is indeed a unique piece of legislation and, at this late stage of the sittings, I appreciate Senator Murray's humour in referring to it as a `squirrel handshake'. Carrying that analogy a bit further, I feel less constrained than my

       <para first-indent="16">
        As has been pointed out, the bill is a mechanism by which the Commonwealth receives a referral from the state of Victoria. I am perhaps familiar with this type of behaviour from the Premier of Victoria. I was somewhat amused in the hearings of the committee when we became apprised of the fact that Victoria and the Commonwealth were preparing to enter into an intergovernmental agreement to underpin this legislation, but the agreement itself had not yet been finalised and certainly could not be made available to us the very people considering the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I posed a question in those hearings as to how we were to consider what potential amendments might be appropriate, the response was that I was proposing a double hypothetical. I pointed out to the department official at the time that half of that hypothetical was actually the government's, and perhaps that is the major criticism in relation to this bill. It is extremely hypothetical and we have many concerns with respect to it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will be moving several amendments in relation to those concerns but, at this stage, I would like to highlight the main concern. Our central criticism of the reference and of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) as a whole is that, contrary to the rhetoric of the Victorian government in particular and also the federal government, it does not represent a giant leap forward towards a single system of industrial relations. To the contrary, the effect of the reference and of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to graft on to the federal industrial relations system the existing Victorian industrial relations system. In effect, the principal features of the Victorian system are continued under the auspices of the Commonwealth legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I dread to think when it was accepted that there were several complexities with the Workplace Relations Act, but it was claimed by the government that this bill was solving several problems. I dread to think what act we might ultimately end up with if other states
        <break page="7572" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         were also to agree under this sort of environment to refer their powers as well.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The major concerns we have—and I will deal further with them in the amendments as we deal with them—are all of the exclusions. The problems with this bill are not only the way in which Victoria has been accommodated into the federal act and the compromises that have been made to that effect but also the several areas of exclusion and the results consequent to those. I will deal further with those issues as we move on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To conclude, it is our view that the reference as a whole and the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) as a whole are in many ways a disappointing second best outcome. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the reference and the bill may provide advantages to some workers while not disadvantaging any others—although there have been some questions raised to that effect by the Victorian police. For these reasons, our present inclination is to vote in support of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), subject of course to seeking support for the amendments that we will proceed with.

These powers have been referred, as have other powers in the past, to the Commonwealth from Victoria under section 51(xxxvii) of the constitution—the states can give and the states can take away. That does lead, as has been already suggested, to uncertainty.

In other words, are the personnel on that body going to be attended to? Is there any intention, for example, to appoint the people presently on the Employee Relations Commission of Victoria to the federal body? It may be that the federal body will have additional powers and responsibilities which will mean they will need further people on it.

        A lot of the debate about this quite historic legislation over the days and weeks since the agreement was announced by the Victorian and Australian governments has been in relation to how significant this referral is. People who have been—to say it kindly—cynical about the significance of this referral have tried to downplay the size and effect of the referral.

         I do ask in a rhetorical way that people who seek to downplay the significance of a referral of this type should do two things. Firstly, they should look at the debates on the arbitration and conciliation sections of the Commonwealth constitution that took place when the federation of Australia was formed nearly 100 years ago. They should look at the debate that took place among the founding fathers in relation to these powers and observe how careful they were to create a balance of power between the states and the Commonwealth in relation to industrial relations matters.

         Secondly, I challenge people who would seek to downplay the significance of this—what I would regard as—historical agreement and referral to find anywhere else in Australian federal history a referral of such a significant power from one of the significant states of the Australian federation to the Commonwealth parliament. As much as you may seek, for good political reasons on the other side, to downplay the significance of this referral, it will go down in history as a significant event in the development of Australia's constitutional history. I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate and look forward to considering this bill further in committee. I commend the bill to the House.

        Although proposed section 493(2) is not required by the state referral legislation, it is one of the bases on which Victoria agreed to include the state public sector within the referral. The provision is not unprecedented. Section 121 of the Workplace Relations Act does not allow the AIRC to exercise jurisdiction over Commonwealth or territorial public sector employment in a way that is inconsistent with prescribed Commonwealth or territory laws. Similarly, state industrial laws typically make similar provision. Any public sector law prescribed under proposed section 493 will only prevail over an award or order made under the extended jurisdiction. It will also be specified in a regulation which can be disallowed by the Senate. I will respond to Senator Murray's specific point. There should be no fear of any sweeping use of this power,

        It also answers one of Jacinta Collins's questions raised in the second reading debate about the intergovernmental agreement. The Commonwealth and the Victorian government would make it a matter of that sort of agreement. It needs to be a side agreement. If, for example, a future Brumby government in Victoria decided that they wanted to take the power back, there would be in place a government to government agreement which said that in the circumstances that may occur. There would be certain notice provisions and agreements between the governments as to how that might take place. We hope that this will stay in place for a long time, even though we cannot force it because of the work of our founding fathers.

         —I would like to respond to that. I cannot believe that Senator Sherry is entirely serious about this because he has been in government. Senator Cooney will recall one of the very first committee hearings I ever went to. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs did an inquiry for about three hours one night into the new Corporations Law, which was a significant constitutional achievement in terms of getting the states to cooperate in that area—an area for which I now have responsibility, as the circles go round in politics.

        Senator Sherry, Senator Jacinta Collins and Senator Cooney—indeed all honourable senators—should know that there is another case of a law put in place by agreements of the state parliaments and the Commonwealth parliament in relation to their powers over certain matters. That is a legislative structure which envisages an agreement between those governments. In other words, it requires an agreement to make that legislation work. That agreement that does not underpin that legislation but actually helps make that legislation work—it makes the Corporations Law work—was contemplated by that legislative scheme. This intergovernmental agreement is also contemplated by this scheme. It is not a secret agreement. It is a typical administrative structure where governments bring into place a new scheme—

         —I think the parliamentary secretary actually makes the right point because regulations do follow legislation, normally. My understanding is that regulations, under no circumstances, can undermine the legislation itself; they have to follow it. There are occasions the Senate has seen where regulations or agreements have preceded legislation.

        One of the major concerns—and this example highlights it—is that under this bill some future employees that fall under such contracts will only have to meet the Victorian statutory minima. So, in effect, there are people that are left behind from this supposed new unitary system. In an attempt to accommodate Mr Kennett with his Christmas present, we have left these people out. This amendment seeks to rectify that problem by ensuring—and I highlight in particular for some future employees not currently under any type of employment arrangement—that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         those future employees will have to meet the federal minima.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We are very concerned that common law contracts of employment are to continue under the agreement between the government and Victoria; nevertheless, we accept it. But we find it very difficult to accept that these contracts should only be underpinned by these Victorian statutory minima. Those minima are woefully inadequate. They do not protect enough terms and conditions of employment and, where they do, the protection is inadequate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We do not think that this parliament should be party to continuing these inadequate minimum conditions in perpetuity, at least for new contracts in the future. At least for people such as prospective employees, the Victorian minima are totally inadequate—and it highlights a serious flaw with this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Not only that; the simple truth is that if this reference of powers is to create a true, single system of industrial relations in Victoria, surely the same minima should underpin employment contracts, be it a certified agreement, an AWA or a common law contract of employment. That is the principle applied by the Workplace Relations Act and that is what should be applied in this bill. This amendment ensures that in this respect there is consistency. If the no disadvantage test is good enough for employees on AWAs and certified agreements, it should be good enough for employees on other types of employment contracts, in particular, prospective employees.

         —In response to what Senator Jacinta Collins said, the no disadvantage test has been specifically designed to ensure that formal agreements under the Workplace Relations Act do not result in any overall loss of entitlements for employees. However, it would be inappropriate to extend a test which was designed for a particular statutory purpose to all contracts of employment. Apart from any other consideration, it would be
         <break page="7578" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          unrealistic to expect public authorities to assess all contracts against such a test.

        Another important point to make is that no other jurisdiction provides such a requirement for common law contracts. When I say `no other jurisdiction', I specifically refer to the New South Wales legislation where, of course, we have a Labor government. If Senator Collins feels as strongly as she clearly does about the issue, it would be well worth her making the suggestion to the Hon. Jeff Shaw, the Minister for Industrial Relations in that state, recommending that the New South Wales government include such a provision.

         —Yes, this will only take one minute. It relates to the transitional registration periods of two years proposed under the bill relating to recognised associations. It is intended to allow existing recognised associations to be given under the new arrangements similar rights to those which they now have under the Victorian Employee Relations Act 1992. This will be provided for under the regulations. Those associations which choose to be transitionally registered will be able to seek to have a relevant minimum wage adjusted or to enforce a continuing employment agreement or minimum condition applying to their members under these new provisions.

        The regulations will, however, not give such associations the standing of registered organisations for other purposes under the Workplace Relations Act.

This does not apply, of course, to any former recognised organisation which is already a federally registered organisation or a branch of one.

        Let me point out one major area of inconsistency that is being brought in with this legislation. What does not come with this legislation into the Commonwealth arena is the ability to make common rule awards. So there are going to be many more employers that are going to be subject to these types of employment agreements. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you want to use the consistency argument, why are we not treating Victorian employees consistent with those which are in the federal arena through other means? The lack of an ability to make a common rule award is going to leave many of these Victorian employees in the position where they may come under Commonwealth contracts and, of course, they are going to face the much lower Victorian minimum test.

         The Democrats will oppose this amendment. This amendment seeks to include a new and worrying level of complexity into the industrial relations system. To give an example, in an award free area, one employer might offer an employee $40,000 p.a. for a 40 hour week. But they would be prevented from doing that unless they came to the AIRC and got that offer of employment ticked off as fitting the no disadvantage test. In every State of Australia, common law contracts are not affected like this. If there is an award in place, the common law contract cannot override the award, and that will also be the case in Victoria. But, this goes much further than that. The Democrats approach in it's amendment of seeking to ensure that access to the award system is enhanced we naturally think is a better alternative. I might also note that no new employment contracts under the Victorian system will be permissible—if employers want a formal document lodged with an industrial authority, they will need to pursue an AWA.

        SPEAKING POINTS FOR ALP AMENDMENTS TO WORKPLACE RELATIONS BILL (No. 2)

        Oppostition (3) (4)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        This amendment addresses what we see as an inconsistency in this Bill and in its relationship with the Workplace Relations Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The Bill provides that a party on an existing individual employment contract cannot engage in protected industrial action until at least 3 years after the commencement of the Bill. The practical terms this means that for this 3 year period parties do not have the capacity to engage in industrial action to force entry to the Federal industrial relations system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The problem we have with this provision is the insertion of a 3 year period after the commencement of the Bill. Where an employment contract has been on foot for some time prior to commencement of the Bill (anything up to 4 years) this means that protected action may not be available for anything up to 7 years of the life of the contract.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        This is clearly inconsistent with the Workplace Relations Act that provides a 3 year maximum period without the right to protected action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Our initial reaction to this problem was to recommend a 3 year period after commencement of the employment contract, whenever that might be. However, before the Committee Mr Stewart&amp;hyphen;Crompton pointed out that many employment contracts in Victoria do not have a certain start date.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Clearly this must be taken into account. In our view it can be.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        We therefore seek to amend section 523 of this Bill to the following effect.

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Where the start of the employment contract is known to parties should not be entitled to engage

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Where the start date of the employment contract is not known, the start date should be deemed to be 3 years prior to the date of commencement of this Bill, and the parties should not be entitled to engage in protected industrial action during the period of 3 years after this deemed start date.

        The effect of this amendment is to provide quick access to the Federal award system where the subject&amp;hyphen;matter of the dispute is a matter excluded from the Victorian reference of powers to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        We are concerned that the reference of powers by Victoria to the Commonwealth is too restricted, and may exclude some important terms and conditions of employment.

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Examples might include entry standards or qualifications to teach in Victorian Government schools; discipline of Victorian public servants by means of fines or demotion; procedures for making Victorian Government school teachers redundant. It also includes all terms and conditions of Victorian employees at the higher managerial levels in the public sector or in essential services or industries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        In practical terms, the effect of this restricted reference is that the Commission does not acquire jurisdiction to make awards in relation to these matters under the Victorian reference.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        We can't amend the Bill to provide that the Commonwealth does acquire that jurisdiction.

        What we can do is to provide that, where the Commission otherwise has jurisdiction to make awards about these matters, the parties can gain quick access to that jurisdiction.

         —This evening we are debating two health bills. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes to require medical graduates to complete postgraduate education in order to gain access to Medicare benefits. It is also to allow regulations to be made to reduce the Medicare benefit payable where multiple services are rendered and to increase the maximum amount a patient may be required to contribute towards certain medical procedures.

        Certainly on this bill when we get to the committee stage I have a number of questions to raise and issues to pursue with the parliamentary secretary in relation to how the provider numbers issue is going to benefit rural areas. I am still not totally convinced that the moves the government says will happen will be the case.

       <break page="7582" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second bill is the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996, the purpose of which is to increase patient contributions under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, restrict access to subsidised drugs to Australian residents and a restricted range of members of overseas missions, and make minor changes to the indexation of various patient contributions. This slugs those who are in receipt of benefits and health cards and who, until this bill is passed, are paying $2.75 per prescription and, after it is passed, will be paying $3.25. This increase in co&amp;hyphen;payment for the first time is not associated with any associated increase in pension rate. So many pensioners will be worse off financially to the tune of 50c per prescription.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We know from the previous bills that we have been debating on social security that the government is committed to maintaining pensions at 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings but we can see that pensions are at a greater rate than that. This bill is going to cause people on pensions to have a reduction in their disposable incomes. This is an issue that I think is of great concern particularly to elderly people because, as I said earlier, people who live on age pensions and benefits do not have any significant amount of disposable income. They do not have discretionary spending.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The income they get is totally disposed of in the sheer, simple things of living; in covering their accommodation costs, their food and clothing. They do not have discretionary funding and this is of very great concern to those concerned about aged people. In the previous debate I raised the issue of people on old age pensions who could well be suffering a reduction in their rent assistance as well, so they are really being slugged on several different sides. The government is to be condemned for that. The opposition will be moving some amendments and I urge people to support them.

        This is a cognate debate on two bills which, on the face of it, have no relationship—but there is a unifying theme. These bills are in keeping with the general philosophy of this government; that is, to slug those who are the most vulnerable in our community, to reduce services to those who most need it and to charge those who have the least resources. This government has abandoned the Australian philosophy of a fair go. It is making major cuts to health in Australia. This Howard government does not believe that health care should be universal; it believes it should be provided only to those who can afford to pay for it. The principle that is in danger of being undermined in the current debate about health care and by the approach this government is taking in its budget and other measures is the principle of the universal provision of and universal access to health care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This budget and associated bills such as health insurance No. 2 have cut over $2 billion from expenditure on health care, most of which was used to offset the introduction of the private health insurance rebate. This has had very little impact on the quality or the extent of health care in Australia and the health care available to Australian citizens. This is in the face of evidence of premium rises that mean the rebate will have no impact on the cost of health insurance and will not make private health insurance more affordable for families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is what the community receives in exchange for massive cuts in federally funded medical services and reduction in the money given to public hospitals. All that this will do is to ensure that hospitals have no capacity to deliver the quality of service that, to date, they have been able to offer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result of this reduction will mean longer waiting lists in the case of elective surgery and a very serious threat to the quality of care in the case of emergency and other medical services. It may also mean that
        <break page="7583" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         individuals, in fact, have to pay more, because a lot of services which the hospitals to date have been able to provide in&amp;hyphen;house—physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work—may not be able to continue to be provided. Patients may have to seek these services privately outside of a hospital.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition has major difficulties with both these bills for three reasons, and they are quite simple: firstly, they are unfair; secondly, they have the effect of reducing the quality of health services provided; and, thirdly, they impact most heavily on the people who are least well off. The Labor opposition is opposed to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) and is opposed to three measures in the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill which increases co&amp;hyphen;payments on pharmaceuticals. I will deal with the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) first.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition believes that this bill will have unfair and retrospective effect on current medical students and interns. We are concerned that it may aggravate the shortage of doctors in rural areas and severely restrict the options of medical students and interns who are seeking to postpone their postgraduate training or undertake that training part time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition also does not support the increase in the maximum permissible gap for out of hospital medical services from $30.20 to $50. We do not support this change because patients who receive services of unusual length or complexity will face very high out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket costs. We do not believe that this situation is remedied by the Medical Benefits Advisory Commission's discretionary power to award higher fees for services of unusual length and complexity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In dealing with the work force issues, the opposition understands the necessity of managing the medical work force and, in particular, of managing access to Medicare to ensure that the Australian people get the best value they can for the money they provide to Medicare. The opposition also understands the need to ensure that those practising in medicine are of a good standard and that they are provided with appropriate training.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In recent years it was the Labor government who took decisions aimed at limiting the number of overseas trained doctors coming to Australia and who worked with the medical profession to improve the standing of general practice and develop a system of postgraduate training for general practitioners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem is that this legislation does not solve the problems and, at the same time, the legislation is unfair and its retrospective nature is adversely affecting the careers of medical students—those people who are already in the system. In fact, the Parents and Friends Supporting Medical Students said in their submission:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Current medical students and interns will be denied their rightful expectation, under training requirements existing at the commencement of their training, of eligibility for a Medicare provider number at the end of their internship year.

        </para>
        <para>
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          That is, people who started their courses some six or seven years ago who are now completing their internship year are retrospectively affected so that the situation they relied upon when making their decision no longer exists.
         </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This problem is exacerbated by the fact that this bill was not introduced in the parliament until some four days before its date of effect, which is 1 November this year. In fact, we are debating this bill well over a month after it is to come into effect. The government has indicated that if it is unable to secure passage of the bill, or if it does, anyone who has received a Medicare provider number between 1 November and the passing of the bill will have that provider number retrospectively taken from them.

         A major problem of the provision of medical services is still the maldistribution of doctors and the shortages in rural areas in both hospitals and in general practice. This legislation, as I said, will not resolve that problem.

          I am particularly concerned about Dr Wooldridge's proposal which may also have an adverse effect on the provision of medical services in rural areas and on the options available to young doctors, particularly women, who do not wish to proceed immediately from their intern year to full&amp;hyphen;time training. I am also of the view that the agreement reached between the government and the Australian Democrats, though designed at least by the Democrats to overcome this problem, may in fact make it worse, but I will explore this issue further in the committee stage.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The National Rural Health Network said in its submission that `the proposed restrictions on provider numbers will discourage junior doctors and medical students who are considering practising in rural areas', and that is really the crux of it. Several of the submissions and a number of witnesses, particularly women, have expressed their concern about the practical difficulties in getting a deferred or part-time training place and also that training arrangements are inflexible and do not allow for a variety of lifestyle choices and the demands of a family. Concern has been raised about these issues, but I do not wish to canvass them further, because we will have the opportunity in committee to deal with them much more adequately.

          The second part of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) is the maximum permissible gap being increased from $30.20 to $50. The opposition also does not support the intention of this bill to increase Medicare's maximum possible gap. This measure effectively reduces the Medicare rebate for out of hospital services with a value in excess of $202. This measure represents a fundamental breach of the coalition's election promise to maintain Medicare in its entirety. It is a regressive measure through which the government intends to raise $60 million from a group of people whose only distinguishing characteristic is that they require high cost medical treatment. The sorts of people who will be utilising these sorts of services will often be the chronically ill and the elderly.

          I will now briefly deal with the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill.

           This bill is also in keeping with the general philosophy of this government; that is, to slug those who are the most vulnerable. The National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill contains three changes to the pharmaceutical scheme that makes Australians worse off. It increases the cost to pensioners, it increases the cost to families and it changes the indexation rules so that co-payments increase more than they would have without this change to the indexation provisions.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill is decreasing the expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits by the sum of $540 million. Do you know what that means? It goes into the government's coffers and it comes out of the pockets of families and pensioners.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I am particularly concerned about the effect on pensioners. The co-payment has been increased from $2.70 to $3.20. Many people might argue that an increase of 50c is not very much and that it does not really matter. But, for a pensioner on a severely limited income, 50c can mean a great deal. The National Seniors Association said:

         <para>
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           This was reinforced by a number of other witnesses. It is made worse by the fact that the link between the pensioners co-payment and the safety net and its connection to the pensioners allowance that is paid has now been broken. In fact, for the elderly who use a large number of prescriptions, they will be much worse off.

         <para first-indent="16">
          When the Labor Party originally introduced a co-payment for pensioners, they were very careful about the way they did it. They introduced a pharmaceutical allowance for
          <break page="7585" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           pensioners, which was paid at the same time as their social security benefits, so that a pensioner would not be worse off. But this is a principle that this government has not seen fit to continue. The National Seniors Association, in giving evidence to the committee, also said:

           The Commonwealth seniors health card provides scripts at the concessional rate, but they will now be losing the hearing aid service and the dental service. So they are not only having an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals, but they are also losing those two benefits.

         <para>
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           That essentially sums it all up for me. The effect of these bills—combined with effects of the budget generally in health and other areas—means that, if you are not doing very well in Australia at the moment, then you will be worse off as a result of the decisions of this government.

          As a result, we will be opposing Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) in its entirety and in the National Health Budget Measures Amendment Bill we will be opposing three measures which relate to the increase in the co-payment. However, we will be supporting the fourth measure which relates to pharmaceutical benefits not being available for  non-residents and foreign nationals.

        In the good old days of 30 to 40 years ago or more, once a person had finished a medical course and done a year to two as a resident in a public hospital they were regarded as being well enough trained to go and set up a medical practice. The doctors of those days were universal generalists who delivered babies, took out appendixes, tonsils and gall bladders as well as giving anaesthetics and then went back to their surgeries where they consulted all day and in the evenings and overnight did house calls, or at least that was what the doctors did in my home town when I was a little boy in the 1950s.

        GP training programs have been in place for some time in countries which we like to compare ourselves with, such as Canada and the UK. The Commonwealth has been steadily moving to bring Australian GP standards into line with other countries since the early 1990's when the Vocational Register was introduced. It was widely publicised that from 1 January 1995 entry to the Vocational Register would only be by holding the FRACGP, so that there was about 5 years notice of the fact that after January 1995 entry to unrestricted General Practice would require that the RACGP training program should have been successfully completed. That is to say these facts were well known to the medical students who will graduate this year from early years of their courses.

        The reality is that virtually no young doctors go out into unrestricted General Practice after completing their first year internship. Instead, according to a survey done by the Epidemiology Unit of the ANU in 1995, and which I have previously had incorporated in

        In reality then, the proposals put forward by the Health Minister to require all doctors entering General Practice to undertake the RACGP training program really do no more than formalise the situation as it actually is in practice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fact is most young doctors are doing the training anyway. All these proposals do is formalise the requirement of all persons who wish to enter General Practice Medicine to complete the training requirements to gain entry to the Vocational Register.

        The option of a doctor who has dropped out of a heart surgery program to become a GP simply by virtue of his holding a medical qualification has gone—and so it should have. General Practice should not become a waste paper basket for doctors who fail to succeed in other fields of medicine.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Perhaps the most important point to make is that in the modern world medicine should be regarded as a 12 year course—6 years as an unpaid undergraduate and 6 years as a paid graduate trainee before a doctor can set up in private practice in any field of medicine and be authorised to receive payments through the Medicare system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another vital point which needs to be made is that it is only doctors who plan to enter private practice who need provider codes. Salaried doctors of whom there are an increasing number working in many fields of medicine, do not need provider numbers.

Fee for service private practice is far from the only employment prospect for young doctors.

         —I will begin by looking at the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) and then, if time permits, go on to the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill. I do want to begin with the one that looks at the government's decision to restrict eligibility for Medicare provider numbers to doctors because of the considerable interest that this has generated amongst a number of young doctors. Also, it is probably an issue about which there has been more than the unusual amount of misinformation spread.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats support the basic premise of this legislation. We believe that medical graduates wishing to enter general practice should undertake additional training. Beginning with our agreement with the decision of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to do that, we then had to begin looking at the best way to implement it because that is where the problems lie.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         We accept the argument and we indeed accept the evidence that undergraduate medical education does not prepare graduates for unsupervised general practice. We also note that it is not only medical graduates that face some additional training. The law is one area that comes to mind. Lawyers have to under take additional training before they become barristers and solicitors. So it is not unusual that, after finishing a period at university and indeed at TAFE, some additional on-the-job training is required.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am very aware of the concerns expressed by some doctors that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners should not be given exclusive rights over GP training. I am aware of the many criticisms. Indeed, I have spent considerable time discussing this with a range of doctors and people interested in medical training. I am aware of the concerns that general practice training is becoming more and more like specialist training and is beginning to pick up some of the worst trends that we have experienced here in this country with specialist training. I will say more about that in a minute.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe both general practice and specialist training should be opened up. We have dealt with that in some of the discussions with government and in some of the package that we have negotiated. But I do not believe the minister could simply have opted at this point in time to leave the college out of this legislation altogether, although I know that is what some doctors wanted to see. Indeed, it is the issue that has been raised with me again today. It is certainly something that we are aware of and will begin to deal with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to note that this bill actually provides for an alternative. If you look through the bill, you will find the words `the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners or a body specified in the regulations'. So there is already a possibility and a legislative option that that may indeed be where we head. So the potential is there, and we can in the future be looking at putting a range of different bodies in that general practice training role.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would also like to point out at this point in time that the government is about to commence a review of general practice training which will look at alternative training pathways, something that has been on the agenda certainly very publicly since the late 1980s. As part of the Democrats' negotiations with the minister, the new medical training review panel will be given a specific brief to
        <break page="7588" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         look at complaints about training, complaints about access to training, who is actually allowed in where and how many people are allowed in. This review panel will advise the minister on issues related to alternative training pathways. So there is movement on this issue, something I want to stress again for those young doctors who are concerned about what is happening.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I must say that I believe the minister does have a genuine interest in addressing some of these long-term problems. Medical training is not an easy area in which to tread and to begin to make some changes, as many former Labor health ministers have no doubt found. There are some very powerful vested interest groups out there, all involved in defending their own patch, defending their own turf, digging trenches, defending the barricades the minute anyone looks like stepping in their general direction.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think they have to face that change is inevitable. I say to those colleges out there which replied to the questions from the department about what part-time training was on offer with, `None, none, none, none, none, none at the moment,' that things will change. They will have to get used to it. They will also have to get used to the fact that women should not be excluded, as they have been in the past, from a range of training opportunities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        From the time that the provider number restriction was announced, the Democrats have said, `We do not have a problem with the concept.' We have said that we do not believe that access to Medicare provider numbers is an automatic right. It is a privilege. It is a privilege bestowed by the Australian taxpayers. It is a privilege which attracts a significant amount of taxpayers' funds and, as such, I believe that we are entitled to place conditions upon the receipt of those funds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats also accept the benefits to the overall health system of having medical graduates fill vacancies and training places in some of the less popular, less glamorous disciplines rather than using their Medicare provider number option to simply move out undertrained into areas where there is already an oversupply of general practitioners. We
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         support the government's stated desire of addressing in this way some of the maldistribution problems, but we do wish to state here that we still have a long way to go in seriously tackling many of the rural and remote issues when it comes to maldistribution.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So basically the Democrats believe this bill is on the right track and it is for that reason we sat down and began negotiations with the government. We were concerned about what was the impact of the provider number restrictions on medical graduates, on those who have recently graduated, in particular those who are going to graduate over the next three years. We felt the government's data was less than satisfactory and that, until more accurate data becomes available, the minister's assertion that there are more than enough training places to go around could not be relied upon. But, in saying that, I note that some of the extreme suggestions of 300 or 400 places short was not proven before us during the committee hearings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not only the government that is concerned about where and to what disciplines graduates are moving. The RACGP, in a letter to all senators, also claimed that adequate work and training places are available for junior doctors. But, they said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In disciplines and places which are unpopular, these posts are either unoccupied or filled by doctors on temporary visas doing work our own graduates will not do. As long as they have access to a provider number, they can make a living practising triage and referral medicine without further training, in major cities.
       </para>
       <para>
        So while this assertion sounds reasonable, and it seems on evidence before the committee and anecdotal evidence that it certainly is supported, it is once again difficult to verify in the absence of accurate data the availability of work and training places. So, on the basis of the evidence presented to the committee, and after discussions with various colleges, we believe there probably will be some shortages.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is where we set out with our negotiations with the government to try to put in place those 200 extra places a year. We were not successful in negotiating the full 200 places, but we do have a backstop position of
        <break page="7589" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         some 250 over three years, and I will say more about that in a moment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats set out to get the government to put that safety net in place and to have it there for at least three years to ensure every medical graduate has either a training place or a job. We now have that safety net and I really find it a bit astonishing to hear the responses of some of the graduates today and, indeed, to find that we still have a Labor Party which is going to oppose this bill. After all, how many other graduates in other disciplines have guaranteed opportunities?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result of a couple of phone calls and speaking to a few people today, I want to stress that the training these young doctors will go into is well paid. We are not talking about four or more years of unpaid training. The average salary around Australia for an inturn—that is, someone who is in the last year—is $35,000 plus overtime. The average salary for junior RMOs—that is, they are trained and out there in the public hospitals—is $50,000 plus overtime. Depending on the contracts, a lot more than that can often be offered.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many work those incredibly ridiculous hours, and we have had figures suggested to us as high as $75,000 depending on what ridiculous hours the doctors have to work. This is one of the issues that we hope will actually be addressed as part of our package when the government sits down with the state governments to look at what is happening in our public hospitals. I really have great problems with doctors who are saying they do not want a $35,000 a year job.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, I point out that there are thousands of people coming out of universities fully qualified, many with honours degrees and higher, who have no chance this year of getting a job in their chosen profession and will indeed be driving taxis. I think we have some 800,000 people on unemployment benefits. I think that perhaps a few graduates need to think about that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to quickly go through the safety net that the Democrats have won from the government and just briefly mention 10 of the initiatives. Firstly, there is the 250 additional GP training places which will be made
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         available over the next three years in rural and regional areas. These places are the bottom line of the safety net. If a junior doctor cannot obtain a training place or a salaried medical position after 12 months on the register of opportunity, the government will make a new rural GP training place available to that doctor.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some doctors are arguing that they do not want to be conscripted into this. No-one is telling them that is anything like conscription. They are not being forced to go. It is simply one of the options. We are looking, in return for that offer, at the government asking that they stay on and practice in a rural area—something that many teachers have in past had to do, me included, and something that many people in the public sector are required to do. I know the police force in many states requires a time of country service. Indeed, moving to the country is something our defence forces are more than used to—in some instances, I would say unfortunately because some of them seem to move an excessive number of times.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Basically, if we have a doctor in a rural area who cannot find anything else and is happy to do so, then they will have to stay on in a rural area. If they turn that down as well, then they are still free to go out and find themselves a medical job or indeed to move on and perhaps find something in the non&amp;hyphen;medical work force. That is their choice. It is the choice that other graduates and other people have to make every day.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, there will be a formal process to oversee the take up of medical training places. I will move amendments later in this debate to set up a medical training review panel to identify the number, type and location of the training places, identify the number of interns and RMOs available for placement and report to the minister for health on the numbers, if any, of training vacancies—where they are and what they are in—and to look at the applicants and to actually identify those that are genuinely unable to find places. The report of that panel will be tabled in parliament for all of us to see.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Thirdly, there will be a register of opportunity to match new graduates with vacant
        <break page="7590" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         hospital positions. Junior doctors will be able to join a register of opportunity and that will match them up formally letting them know where places are and making offers to them. As I said, if a doctor stays on that register for 12 months, then the offer of a country GP place will be made.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fourthly, there is a sunset clause in the reforms. The legislation will cease to operate on 31 December 2001 unless its operation is formally extended by this parliament. This will compel the government to justify the success of this measure before it is extended. It is a good opportunity for all of us to have a very good look at exactly what has been happening.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fifthly, there is a mid&amp;hyphen;term review of the effects of the provider number restriction to be tabled in parliament. The minister will be required by the legislation to report to the parliament by 30 June 1999 on the impacts of provider number restrictions and the take up of additional places as well as the current state of postgraduate medical training. As part of the review, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare will monitor the impact of the legislation on the delivery of services, the quality of services and, in particular, on the cost of health services to make sure that this legislation does not have the impact suggested to us that in some cases it may force up the cost of some general practice services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sixthly, there will be an extension of time in which GP training can be completed from four years to six years. This is particularly important for those young doctors who want to take time off to perhaps travel or for family responsibilities. GP training previously had been limited to four years. You had to get it over and done with or you were out. I stress here that part&amp;hyphen;time training will have no limit on it. We are talking about full&amp;hyphen;time training. You actually take one or two years out if you so wish.

        Seventhly, there is a commitment to consult with the specialist colleges on promoting fairness and transparency in their selection processes and reporting the results of those consultations to the parliament. This is something I have been working on in my time in

       <para first-indent="16">
        Ninthly, there is a commitment to develop in conjunction with the states by the end of 1997 a package of reforms for RMOs and other salaried medical positions. This is something I do not think those doctors out there protesting have read. I am still getting phone calls from people complaining that doctors are going to be pushed into dead end jobs in the public hospital system. Part of the package is actually at last sitting down and looking at career pathways for salaried medical positions.

        That's three times in five years the Labor Government moved to increase pharmaceutical costs. So I have some sympathy with the Coalition Government when it calls the Opposition's approach to this current increase "opportunistic".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When it was a Labor Government hiking the prescription charge for pensioners up from nothing to $2.70 over five years, that was "a price signal". When it's a Coalition Government wanting a 50 cent increase, that's suddenly "unfair" (to use the Shadow Minister's word).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At least the Democrats have been consistent in our opposition to what is really a failure by both the previous Labor Government and the current Coalition Government look beyond the demand side of the equation when it comes to reining in costs under the PBS.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When governments look around to find budget savings, the PBS co-payments and safety net thresholds are always the first cabs off the rank. No-one wants to get serious about wider reform of the PBS. No-one wants to look to the longer term. No-one wants to talk about what sorts of outcomes in pharmaceutical use are desirable. It is obviously much easier to simply ratchet up the safety net thresholds and the co-payments than it is to tackle some of the more entrenched problems within the PBS.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Democrats have been saying for years that Commonwealth outlays under the PBS can and should be reduced. However, we believe attempts to reduce outlays should focus on the supply side of the scheme, rather than on measures which achieve nothing other than shifting the costs back onto those consumers who can least afford to bear them.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is interesting that, despite these measures, Commonwealth expenditure under the PBS continues to rise. What is more, the trend in PBS utilisation by concessional beneficiaries also continues to move upwards (despite a drop in demand following the introduction of the co-payment in 1990).

        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These trends suggest that `price signals' and co-payments will ultimately fail to deliver the sorts of long-term savings understandably sought by the Government. They also suggest that the real causes of growth in the PBS may lie on the supply side of the scheme and be driven, not by patients, but by doctors and pharmaceutical companies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For some time now, most recently in our dissenting report to the Senate Community Affairs Committee's examination of this legislation, the Democrats have been saying that the Commonwealth Government needs to look at full range of factors influencing grow in PBS outlays.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the Democrats' view, these are areas which the Commonwealth needs to address instead of—year after year, government after government—simply throwing in the "too-hard" basket.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We believe there are much bigger savings to be made by exploring some of these factors. That is the reason the Democrats' dissenting report on this legislation urges the Government to take three actions over the next twelve months—and I would very much like to hear the Minister's responses to these recommendations some time during this debate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our first recommendation is that the Government convene a national PBS summit involving all PBS stakeholders with a view to moving towards a National Medicines (or Pharmaceuticals) Policy and obtaining agreement on measures designed to reduce Commonwealth PBS outlays.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I think such a summit is long overdue. I know the Minister sits down on a fairly regular basis with some of the key players and I know these issues are discussed at Ministerial level with the States. But the obvious benefit of a summit is that it would
        <break page="7592" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         bring all players together and enable a full canvassing of concerns about the PBS.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would also provide an opportunity to look at possible savings not in the isolation of a Budgetary context, but in conjunction with desirable outcomes in the consumption and prescribing of pharmaceuticals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Democrats' second recommendation is that the Government, in conjunction with the Royal Australian College of GPs and the AMA, establish two pilot projects designed to change GP prescribing practices.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have called these suggested projects the Second (or Lifestyle) Script project and the Pharmaceutical Budgetholding project.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Second Script project would encourage GPs to use two prescription pads: their usual pharmaceutical script and a `lifestyle' script. The lifestyle script is designed to encourage patients, where appropriate, to change lifestyle habits which are damaging to their health.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is also designed to encourage GPs to look beyond medication when treating their patients and to consider making specific "lifestyle prescriptions" as an alternative to prescribing pharmaceuticals. Examples of `lifestyle prescriptions' include: reducing caffeine or alcohol intake, getting more exercise (such as walking for a specific amount of time or distance each day), changing dietary habits, stress reduction and relaxation practices, and so on.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Pharmaceutical Budgetholding project would provide GPs with a specific allocation of PBS funds from which they would meet their practices prescription needs over a set period of time. It is designed to encourage GPs to pay less attention to pharmaceutical industry advertising, to take some personal responsibility for the costs of their prescribing practices, to consider less costly medication options and to explore alternatives beyond the prescribing of pharmaceuticals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am not saying either of these projects is the solution to problems with the PBS. But I believe they are the type of project we should be looking at if we are serious about getting GPs to look closely and critically at their own prescribing practices.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Democrats' final suggestion is that the Government act on the recommendation contained in the Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Information Consultancy that the Department of Health and Family Services "establish a primary goal of introducing a basic Clinical Workbench to 50 per cent of Australian Office-based Practices (where the prescriber predominantly works from one location) within two years".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Information Consultancy report is the result of a 1995
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         study carried out by the IBM Consulting Group into "the optimal use of technology in the support of Electronic Prescribing and the provision of electronic medicines information".
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Final Report of that study makes very interesting reading. It makes the observation that Australia presently lags behind the rest of the advanced world in the use of computers to support clinical practice. The study found that "the combination of Computer Assisted Medication Management and Electronic Prescribing has the potential to improve the quality of health care service delivery significantly and to reduce the number of acute hospital bed days consumed due to medication error".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But, aside from those positive health outcomes, it also found that the implementation of such measures could save the Government around $145 million per annum from the national health budget. Through networking and access to additional information, such measures also offer the potential to further reduce PBS outlays by promoting alternative prescribing practices.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In short, we are talking about potentially very big savings here—and it is these sorts of measures which offer the Government the possibility of reining-in PBS outlays over the medium to long term, rather than plugging along with so-called `price signals' in an area in which demand is essentially inelastic and largely unrelated to price.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The measures in this Bill do bite hard. They do hit pensioners and they do hit—yet again—families where one or more member has a chronic illness or a disability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We know all the arguments about the Budget bottom line—but the Democrats stand by our position that, with more than $11 billion worth of Budget measures already passed, deficit reduction is well under control. We do not see why pensioners and people with a disability or illness should have to pay the costs of even faster deficit reduction.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Surely we are entitled to make a decision—as a nation—that we will opt for a slightly slower deficit reduction program rather than making these people pay more for their pharmaceuticals .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are—I believe—even more entitled to make that decision when this Government (like its predecessor) continues to refuse to look to the supply side of the PBS to generate the savings it says it needs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, the Democrats will support the other two measures contained in this Bill: the changes to indexation rules for the PBS co-payments and the restricting of pharmaceutical benefits to Australian citizens, permanent residents and visitors to Australia from countries with which we have reciprocal health care agreements.
        <break page="7593" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new indexation rules mean that instead of indexing the co-payments for inflation by rounding down to the nearest 10 cents, the co-payments will now be rounded `to the nearest multiple of 10 cents'—that is rounded up or down. This is a formula which is in wide usage. It is the same formula which is currently used in the Social Security Act. As such, the co-payment will rise or fall along with the pension, for example and that seems to us to be a consistent and acceptable approach.

        It is a decision of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I will tell the Senate why he has come to this decision. It is not for the good of the doctors in training; it is not for the good of the resident medical officers; it is not for the good of rural practice in this country; it is not for the good of potential patients—and there are 18 million of us; it is to service the need of this government to meet a budget target, its so-called black hole.

The legislative ability of the minister to cut people out of their rightful place of a job in their profession at the end of the day is abhorrent.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         become one of the most powerful and self-interested organisations in the country. No doubt it is in both the college's interest and the interests of its established members to restrict the numbers of other people going into its ranks.

        You do not have to be Einstein to know that it is going to be to the benefit—both financially and career wise—of those doctors who have already made it, to squeeze out those who have not. That is what is happening with this legislation. Those doctors who have made it will be okay; those who have not made it will be left to the vagaries of a new system, where they have to compete with each other and accept a whole new bundle of conditions which did not exist when they entered medical school, or get no job at all at the end of the day.

        We can do better than that. We ought to be working through incentives to ensure that medical expertise is available in rural areas around this country. We ought to be ensuring—at a baseline though—that everybody who goes into our medical schools, who gives up their lives to get through the long training that is required, who takes a lot of money out of the public purse in doing so, is placed in a job in the profession where they are happy, they are productive and they are contributing to society in the way they intended to when they entered medical school. This legislation is the first removal of the plank in that ideal.

         —This legislation is quite unfair. It is retrospective in a couple of respects. The first is that it denies a reasonable expectation for those people who have begun a course, who are now halfway through a course or who have finished a course. They began that course with the reasonable expectation that, at the end of carrying out certain studies, they would be entitled to treat patients and those patients would be entitled to recover fees under the Medicare provisions.

        Another illustration is the discussion we have had about people going to rural areas. Following on from what Senator Lees was putting, the proposition would seem to be that more doctors should go to the rural areas and that this is an incentive for them to do that. Indeed, it cannot be denied that there is a pressure on them to do that.

        Let me just address some of the issues raised by Senator Neal. Let me point out a few things about the Labor Party and its approach to the pharmaceutical benefits system. Senator Neal is complaining that we are `slashing' and forcing those who cannot afford it to pay enormous amounts of salaries. Under Labor, from 1983 to 1996, the general payments in pharmaceutical benefits co&amp;hyphen;payments increased by 420 per cent. The concessional payments in the same period increased by 74 per cent. In 1986, you had a one&amp;hyphen;off increase of $5. In 1990, you had a one&amp;hyphen;off increase of $4. This is all separate from the indexation linkages. The average yearly increase in patient charges under you was 17.75 per cent. How can you actually stand there with a straight face and pretend that you really care about this?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me just run quickly through what this will do. The small amendments in terms of the increase in co&amp;hyphen;payments mean for general beneficiaries, who have an average of 1.6 prescriptions a year, that the average extra cost per person per year will be $4.24. You are sitting there with your crocodile tears and bleeding hearts trying to pretend that this is really going to break the bank of those poor people. For goodness sake, wake up to real life. Look at the people who you are claiming are really going to be up against it because of this measure. The average use per concession card holder is 17 scripts a year. The average cost therefore will be $8.76 extra per year.

         We want a pharmaceutical benefits scheme that works. Under the Labor Party, I think the figures are that over the last four years the cost of the PBS has doubled. You may think that is maintainable but the fact is it is not. If you want to do that, the only way of actually maintaining it is to cut drugs off the PBS or, worse perhaps, not allow new drugs to go onto the PBS. What you finished up with with your system is a PBS which basically does not offer any worthwhile pharmaceuticals and which removes from people who need them the medications on which they depend.

         If you want to have a maintainable system, you have to be sensible and realistic. The extra costs for individuals are minimal, as I pointed out, and the benefits to the system are very real indeed. There is not an infinite health budget. It is finite. There is a limit to what we can spend on health in terms of pharmaceuticals and medical benefits—and indeed other issues. In this regard, this is a way of making the system viable. If we did not do this, if we did not undertake these measures, I think the expectations are that the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which is already $2.6 billion per year, would increase rapidly again under the plans which you had.

          think Senator Lees actually pointed out some of the salient facts here. There were some attempts by Senator Brown to try to justify his support for the opposition to this bill on the grounds of things like: `It is the graduate's rightful place.' I am not quite sure what that means. I would have thought the most important thing is what happens to the Australian community and indeed the community as patients of those doctors. He claimed that it was not for the good of the residents themselves, not for the good of rural dwellers, not for the good of 18 million patients but it was simply for the good of the debt, the black hole.

         The leader of the Deans of the Australian Medical Schools, Professor John Young, says the same thing. There is no question that this is a matter of merit. It is also a matter of blocking an unlimited supply.

         So there is a budgetary component. But the bottom line is that we will finish up with a better quality of doctor—and not an undifferentiated graduate but somebody with appropriate training who will actually supply a better quality of care to our patients. Indeed, there are encouragements and inducements for people to practise in rural areas. That is something that the Democrats have been very keen on pushing—and I congratulate them on that. It is also something which is very sensible, and we can address the details of what is going on in that area.

         But, essentially, this is about merit, about extra training, about quality of medicine. It also does address some of the budget issues, which is so crucial. If we want to maintain Medicare we have to make sure there is an appropriate budgetary constraint which allows it to be viable, because an uncontrolled Medicare blow&amp;hyphen;out would essentially undermine the principles of Medicare. That is something which I think nobody in this chamber seriously wants.

          —With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, there is an enormous number of matters before the committee that the committee will be required to make decisions on. It is not the intention of the opposition to have an extraordinarily drawn out process with a massive number of divisions. In order to avoid that occurring, if the opposition does not call a division for a matter where there is not adequate support, the only way we can deal with that is by indicating why that is the case. Obviously there are a number of crucial votes, particularly in relation to the Independent and minor party senators in the chamber.

         I will try to assist the committee by seeing whether, on behalf of the opposition, I can obviate the need for calling divisions if there is clarity about the way that Independent and minor party senators are voting. I think that would be of assistance. It will save time. I will do my best in that regard. It may not be possible but if it is clear, in relation perhaps even to your vote, Mr Chairman, which is obviously significant in this matter, we will do our best to move it along quickly.

         —It does create some difficulty in terms of how it has been arranged. The medical review panel is quite separate from the rest of it. That is the only distinction that I would like to draw. The main difficulty with lumping them together is that we have no opposition to the medical training review panel—I want to ask some questions about exactly how it would operate—but we do have some opposition to the other section of your amendments. That is why it would be convenient for the opposition if those sections could remain separate.

Amendment 5 provides for a mid&amp;hyphen;term review of the legislation in the form of a requirement upon the minister to report to parliament by the end of 1999 and the operation of the provider number restriction. As part of that review, the minister has agreed that the Institute of Health and Welfare will monitor the impact of the legislation on the delivery and the cost of health services, and the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee will monitor its impact on supply and distribution of medical practitioners.

I do not understand how the first amendment operates. The one I have states, `Clause 2, page 2 (line 1), after "Items 15", insert ", 15A".' That does not seem to work at all. I hope I have the right Democrat amendments. As I read it, all that the medical training review panel does is to set up a panel to compile information, to publish the information and to maintain a register of employment opportunities. I cannot quite see how a panel which simply provides information can do any more than that. Could you clarify item 1 and exactly what the medical training review panel does. It does not matter what the tabling speech might say, if you take a straight interpretation of the medical training review panel, it does not train at all; there is no training there at all.

A large amount of evidence and a lot of representations made to me and, I presume, other members of the committee, indicated that both the method of selection and the way the courses were conducted was less than transparent and, in fact, did not cater for people who may have a different than standard type of lifestyle or who wished to take account of family responsibilities or other issues apart from their training when making their decisions.

The amendments will establish the register of medical opportunity, which will be a great avenue for graduates to sell their skills across the whole country. Not only that, it also gives colleges, hospitals and indeed other employers who might wish to attract medical practitioners an opportunity to advertise a vacancy. It will provide a better match of graduates to positions. It will get people to where the jobs are. As I said a few minutes ago, the data generated from that panel, which will be reporting to the minister in parliament, will obviously enable us to get a better picture of the medical work force in Australia.

        This panel is not actually going to be responsible for training. In this country, the federal government does not have the power to suddenly take over the responsibility for all training. Some of us may wish that the minister could do that and get the universities involved in training but, unfortunately, it is the specialist colleges who run the show. It is the states who have a large say in it. There is a range of different powers, and most of them are not held by the federal minister.

        What I was referring to in the second reading debate—in terms of improving the situation in rural areas—related to some of the other issues which the Democrats have raised. That looked at the increased number of training places over three years, the emphasis upon the fact that they will be rurally based and the fact that the appointments will be made available in rural and isolated units in the first place. That is what I was relating to, rather than the actual panel itself. I am sure Senator Lees would agree that that is a major advantage. Bearing in mind the lateness of the

         —I declare not a financial interest but an emotional interest at this point of time. If I can use my daughter as an example, she now will be denied the ability to have her patients claim Medicare benefits, and so will people between now and the year 2002. Then straight after that, we go back to the situation that now exists. So what you are doing, with great respect, is choosing a group of people—not forever, but over a period, it seems to me, of about six years—penalising them, and then the system just disappears after that. If you consider that to be fair, there is nothing I can do about it because the numbers are against us. But I just say that that is not my idea of fairness.

We are only knocking out one of the options that current graduates have, that is, to go out immediately that they graduate or after a year or two in a hospital and set themselves up on the corner as a general practitioner without any GP training. She can do a range of other things. Part of the reason that we are setting up the review process and have the register of opportunity is to make sure that your daughter, along with all the other recent graduates, is fully aware of what all the options are.

If we look at the PBS—we will be dealing with some of the issues on the PBS in a few moments—over the last four years, the cost of the PBS has doubled.

        If you look at the increasing costs of the MBS, they are going up perhaps not quite as quickly. But, certainly, some areas within that are, again, completely out of control.

In areas like radiology and pathology, you can look at the graphs and you know that they are almost exponential in the broad sense of the word—not literally the exponential curves.

        You said that your respective ministers of health `grappled' with the supply side. I think that is probably an appropriate word. You did just grapple; you never came to terms with it and you never did anything about it. When you make the reference that money is wasted on training doctors—and I do not think anybody is exactly sure how much it costs—you wave the figure of $130,000 around. If that money is invested on doctors, that is fine. But if you think that is a waste in some way, are you going to compound that by saying that they can then go out into the community and consume on their supply induced expenditure something close to $200,000 per year per doctor in general practice?

We are saying that there will be an ability to practise medicine. It may be in a hospital or in a range of other options, and there will be training places for virtually every single doctor who wants it. But it may be that they cannot choose the most lucrative or most attractive option. The better ones will be able to, and there will be an element of competition there. But, as a result of this bill and helped by the amendments from the Democrats, there will be a number of places available which will be equivalent to the number of doctors looking for those places.

        To say there are only 400 places is wrong. There are approximately 1,200 graduates each year plus a couple of hundred overseas trained doctors. If you look at the number of places, it almost exactly equates to that. If you allow for a few minor variations in people going to admin and a whole range of things like that, there will be enough places for the doctors. They may not be the places of their first choice, but that's life, that happens. We do not all get our first choice. Some of us finish up in the Senate rather than the Reps or vice versa.

You would be over the top, foaming at the mouth and carrying on.

        There are a range of measures in this bill. The 250 additional rural places are only at the bottom of the safety net. I would just like to go through a couple of the other proposals. One of them has nothing to do with us. It was already in the package and it was a good reason to, indeed, support what the minister was doing in order to get those clinical assistantships, because they are a way of short&amp;hyphen;circuiting yourself into the college of general practice if you will agree—we are talking about newly registered doctors—to go out into a rural hospital.

        There are other avenues such as Aboriginal medical services. They are supervised, pre&amp;hyphen;training positions which would count towards the requirement of the RACGP training program. Provided that these doctors meet the RACGP's minimum standards, doctors working as clinical assistants would be guaranteed entry to the training program after a minimum of one and a maximum of four years if a place had not been obtained sooner. In other words, it is helping those people who are either deciding to wait a year or very keen to

        We also have an undertaking with the minister to go back again to the RACGP to keep negotiating. They already have, as of 1 July 1995, a requirement that all their trainees undertake a period of training either in the country or another area of need. We are arguing that we can tighten that up and increase the percentage of places within the 400 quota. I think Senator Neal was at the hearing when we found that they have 900 places but they can fill only 400, of which 60 per cent can be in the city, which means we can basically have no-one out training in the country. We are looking at that equation and that problem with the RACGP to increase the percentage of places for training in rural areas.

        Also, the deans of the medical faculties around the country are already required to provide a small amount of time in the country.

          So we are not looking at continually adding that up. A lot of that work will concertina.

Virtually all the young doctors who have been spending time with me back in Adelaide and visiting my office here are saying that it is two or three years now that doctors spend doing hospital work and other things before deciding on which training program they even want to apply for.

We are not talking about unpaid training, as some people may think we are. We are talking about well paid training with a whole range of options. Part of the package we have negotiated with government is that we look at reforms for the RMOs and salaried medical practitioners. Part of the trouble of getting people into hospitals has been that they hit a brick wall. After those three or four years of making up their minds, they really have to go back to square 1. We need a better range of training opportunities and pathways through the public hospital system, and different pathways to be a GP rather than just the RACGP training program.

If it were, you could follow that argument. But proposed section 19CC makes it quite clear that that is not the case.

        This is about ensuring that the patients they do treat do not get Medicare, because it is budget driven. If you do not have a Medicare number, the only way you can be punished for treating a patient is if you do not tell the

         patient that you do not have a Medicare number. That is the only thing, if you look at proposed section 19CC; it is a compulsion on the doctor for treating a patient. It is an obligatory section. There is a penalty unit if he or she does not do that. If that is not conscription within the meaning of 23A, then how else would you describe it?

         —Let me deal with a whole range of issues. Firstly, let me just look at the general point raised by Senator Crowley. She asked me what I would do if it were the other way round and we were in opposition and she was introducing this measure. I would be up there in the rafters with the bogongs, swinging around, beating my chest and saying, `Thank God Senator Crowley has at last done something worth while.' It is not often over the last eight years I have been able to say that, Rosemary, I must say.

        She also raised the question of whether we would be prepared to take on the legal profession. If the legal profession had these sorts of rorts, yes, we would have to take them on. Let me use this example: a rort in the legal profession which would be equivalent to what has been happening here—I do not think there has been rorting going on in the medical profession—would be to say to somebody coming out of law school that not only can they set up a shingle as a criminal litigation lawyer and go straight to the bar and earn a fortune from trial procedures but also the government will pay them to do it. That is essentially the equivalent. There is no suggestion that is going to happen in the legal profession much. If that sort of thing were

        There is a discrepancy between what Senator West was saying and what Senator Neal was saying. On the one hand, Senator Neal was saying that she supported adequate training; on the other hand, Senator West was almost saying, `How dare you send undertrained people out into the bush.' Yet Senator Neal is saying you can because they are actually trained okay. There is a bit of a chasm between those two views: either you are going to have trained doctors or you are not going to have trained doctors.

        As I think Senator Lees pointed out, we are not talking about unpaid training—we are not talking about students on Austudy—we are talking by and large about doctors who, after their intern year, are earning $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000 a year. Most of our society would be very happy to be earning that while they are training. It is not as though we are actually putting them on the breadline. It is not as though they are going to be stricken with poverty. They are earning quite a good income.

        If you look at Senator Eggleston's incorporated speech, I think you will find that the average time between qualifying and actually going out into the big wide world as a medical practitioner is some 3&amp;half; years. I stand to be corrected on that but in general terms that is right. One of the points Senator Eggleston was making was that, in some regards, it is what already happens in the real world.

         We are saying a number of things. Firstly, you should not be able to go out and practice by yourself unsupervised and without the appropriate training. Indeed you should not also be an extra burden—which is getting towards $200,000 a year—upon the taxpayer. We are talking about not so much the question of whether you can move into the area of practice; we are talking about what sort of practice you can do. Can you go out and set up a shingle, be a GP and be a burden on the taxpayer with supply-driven demands, which are very high indeed, or should you go through the training. We are saying that you should go through the training. It is better for quality and it is better for economics.

         Turning to what Senator Cooney was saying, it is quite difficult to stop a qualified medical practitioner from practising. We as a Commonwealth have no powers to do that. We are saying that they should be under some sort of supervision or some sort of training. We are ensuring that there will be a range of programs which will mean that virtually everybody who wants to undergo further training will be able to get that. I am not aware of any powers that we have which could stop a doctor from practising. Sure, we are making it difficult for them to practice by themselves, and that is entirely appropriate. We are pressuring them, if you like, into undergoing appropriate training and experience gathering.

        These amendments are essentially in opposition to the increases in pharmaceutical co&amp;hyphen;payments. Issues have been canvassed in some length in the second reading. At this stage of the night I do not seek to go over them again.

         —We will be supporting the removal of schedule 1, which is the increase in the PBS, but we will not be supporting your move on schedule 2, which is the rounding factor. If I could just say here, as I did in my incorporated speech at the second reading stage, we believe that the government has a range of other alternatives that they can pursue to rein in the expenditure increases in the PBS. There were two issues which I raised in committee, one relating to a summit and looking at a range of other measures and, in particular, one looking at the two pilot projects. I am wondering whether the minister has an answer on either of those issues. Perhaps, looking at the lateness of the hour, you would like to incorporate your answers because, regardless of where we are going tonight, we cannot support an increase in pharmaceutical charges that hit, yet again, those who are least able to wear those imposts.

          response to Senator Lees's queries, there is a whole range of answers which I am happy to give but, as you point out, the lateness of the hour is somewhat against us. There is a whole range of issues which you have raised here and in other areas. Let me just quickly say that the pharmaceutical education program is focussing very much on this. The role of doctors is being addressed by the HRC, by education programs, by developing consensus guidelines. The role of pharmacists is the subject of many reviews, including the role of the consultant pharmacy, which I think the Democrats would support.

        At present there is an independent inquiry into the commercial advertising issue. It is being conducted by KPMG. The OTC—the over the counter—growth in volume, again is the subject of an inquiry. We agree with you about the lack of consumer awareness. We are emphasising the importance of that, both through the PET program and through improving product information and documentation. Geriatric prescribing has been the subject of a pilot study—which I think will be expanded—which addresses a number of issues. I am happy to go through the details with you, perhaps at another time. Perhaps you would like to take my word that the pilot study is very exciting and, I think, will lead to a better quality use of medicines. We agree that there is an imbalance which emphasises remedial therapies, which is one of the reasons why Minister Wooldridge has made such a big emphasis upon the importance of preventative health medicine. We could not agree more with that issue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In terms of the amendments raised and moved by Senator Neal, we address most of the points, I think, in the second reading speech. One of the points I would like to make is that this is a very important matter in terms of the actual amount which is saved to the PBS, which is then available for better quality medicines. I think the total amount over four years is something like $450 million but the average amount for an ordinary non&amp;hyphen;concessional prescriber will be something like $4 a year. For a concessional card holder it will be something like $15 a year—that is for the elderly concessional holders—and for the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         average concessional card holder, about $8 a year. So we are not putting a big imposition on individuals. We are maintaining the quality of the PBS. We will make sure that newer drugs become more available and that the whole system is supported. We believe very strongly in it.

         —The answer to that is that we are maintaining the safety nets in terms of the number of prescriptions each year. We are protecting the individuals. There will be one prescription per week to reach the safety net, as indeed is the case now. In the general area, general beneficiaries last year reached the safety net with 34 scripts. In future, they will need only 30 scripts. So in that regard we are improving the situation. We are still maintaining the safety net protection for those who are chronically sick who need constant prescribing. The maximum that will be paid by the concessional group I think is $26 a year.

         —The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 gives legislative effect to the 1996 government budget decision to discontinue the payment of the untargeted operational subsidy to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997. This bill also gives effect to the 1996 budget decision to apply a reduced rate of entitlement to the
         <break page="7669" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          child-care cash rebate for families on higher incomes while retaining the current rate for families on lower incomes. This change will take effect from 1 April 1997.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also introduces amendments aimed at clarifying eligibility issues and compliance requirements consistent with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. The removal of operational subsidy is about equity for parents. Operational subsidy is currently paid on a non-means tested basis to community centres which provide around only 30 per cent of all centre based care catering for 70,000 families. Operational subsidy has never been paid to private centres even though they provide 70 per cent of centre based care and cater for more than 220,000 families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The removal of the untargeted operational subsidy from community child-care centres removes a significant inequity in government assistance that currently exists for families using private rather than community based long day care. Inequities exist between the 70,000 families in community based centres receiving operational subsidy, the 220,000 families in private centres not receiving operational subsidy, the 27,000 low income families receiving maximum child-care assistance benefiting from operational subsidy in community centres, the 96,000 families receiving child-care assistance who are in private centres which do not benefit from operational subsidy, the 14,000 babies in community centres receiving operational subsidy and the 26,000 babies in private centres which do not receive operational subsidy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An examination of comparative figures for other areas shows that twice as many children with special needs are in private centres, over twice as many private centres are in rural and remote areas and that the private sector provides double the number of places for children of sole parents compared with the community sector. I know that all those figures will be of surprise to many people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Importantly, all special or high cost services provided by community child-care centres are also provided by the private sector. Perhaps the greatest inequity relates to the 18,000 high
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         income families—those families earning above the child-care assistance cut&amp;hyphen;offs—in community centres that benefit from operational subsidy compared to the 96,000 low income families receiving maximum child-care assistance who are in private centres and who do not benefit from operational subsidy. It is inequitable that none of these parents receive the same level of subsidy as parents using community based long day care centres.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since the budget, families have been told by the opposition that, because of the removal of operational subsidy, community based centres will close and/or fees will increase dramatically. I would strongly encourage parents to challenge such claims. The government has set aside $8.3 million over two years to help centres purchase management and financial advice to assist them to increase efficiencies, to reduce costs and to operate without operational subsidy. This $8.3 million is additional to the $11.5 million available over three years to assist centres to upgrade and to amalgamate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government will also provide $12.5 million over four years to ensure that families in severely disadvantaged areas maintain access to child care. Such assistance will minimise service closures and the need for fee increases.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Claims have also been made that quality of care will fall as a result of this measure. But nothing could be further from the truth. Quality care is best ensured not through operational subsidy but by the quality improvement and accreditation system and state licensing requirements which both private and community based long day care centres are subject to. Eight&amp;hyphen;five per cent of all private services that have completed the quality improvement and accreditation system have achieved the standard necessary to achieve accreditation without the benefit of operational subsidy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is committed to maintaining the accreditation system for child&amp;hyphen;care centres and to extending it to family day care and outside school hours care. Senators Faulkner and Lundy have indicated that services offered by centres contribute to quality and that operational subsidy has
        <break page="7670" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         enabled community child&amp;hyphen;care centres to offer additional services such as dance classes and music lessons.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I accept that quality encompasses services as well as the developmental activities and interactions offered by a child&amp;hyphen;care centre. However, as Senator Lundy pointed out, services such as dance classes and music lessons are `part of the choice that parents make when they send their child to a specific centre.' Such choices should not be funded by the taxpayer. The parents of the 220,000 children in private long day care centres, whether they are low or high income earners, pay for such services themselves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's decision to cease paying an operational subsidy to community based long day care centres will eliminate the inequities of the current system, treating families who use community based long day care no differently from the majority of families who use private long day care. Savings from this measure have been directed towards areas of need. Over the next four years, $10.9 million will be provided to fund new places to ensure families in rural and remote areas have access to flexible child care, and $31 million has been set aside to support the inclusion of children with high levels of additional needs into child&amp;hyphen;care services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Five hundred and twenty&amp;hyphen;six million dollars in operational subsidies will be provided over the next four years to support family day care, outside school hours care, occasional care, multifunctional children's services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services—services which are crucial to meeting the diverse needs of Australian families.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Before I go on to discuss the second measure implemented by this bill, the change to the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate, I would like to address some of the misconceptions that have been raised in the course of this debate about the position in Tasmania. Tasmania, as has been pointed out, has more community based long day care centres than it has private centres. Senators opposite have described Tasmania as being rural and remote; that it is disadvantaged. Senator Mackay went on to claim that the government's decision would
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         mean that half of the existing community based centres will close over the next two years as every centre is reliant on the operational grants subsidy to survive.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I indicated at the start of my speech, the removal of operational subsidy is about equity for parents. Why should the 555 high income families using community based long day care in Tasmania receive the benefit of a subsidy that the 427 low income families in private centres in Tasmania cannot access? As is the case in every state and territory, community based child-care centres in Tasmania do not necessarily care for low income families. I am aware of one child-care centre in southern Tasmania where 56 per cent of the children attending the centre have parents whose incomes are above the child-care assistance cut&amp;hyphen;offs. The national average is only 26 per cent. In the rural and remote regions of Tasmania family day care provides more child&amp;hyphen;care places than does community based long day care—517 places compared to 378 places. As I said stated earlier, operational subsidy has been retained for family day care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While there are more community based centres in Tasmania than there are private centres, there is no significant difference in fees between the two sectors. On average the community based sector charges only $4 a week less than private centres. The average weekly fee charged by community based centres in Tasmania is $155.50 for 50 hours of care, while private centres charge on average $159.50 per week. Despite receiving on average $25 per week per child, Tasmanian parents are not necessarily benefiting from operational subsidy. And I note that the previous government and this government over the last two years have put $232,000 into management restructuring grants and to deal with problems of community child-care centres, looking at pre-existing management problems and problems relating to committee governance. Yet surely that is a recognition of the fact that there has been considerable need for the restructuring finance which this government is offering to child-care centres to become viable and more efficient.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government has kept its election commitment to retain child care assistance
        <break page="7671" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and the child-care cash rebate. The government has not applied a means test to the child-care cash rebate as stated by Senator Faulkner. The rebate remains available to all families using care for work related reasons. However the government considers that it is only fair and equitable that high income earners make a greater contribution to their child-care costs. Families with incomes below the new family tax initiative cut&amp;hyphen;offs of $70,000 for one child families, rising by $3,000 for each additional dependent child, will continue to receive a 30 per cent rebate, while families with incomes above those cut&amp;hyphen;offs will receive a 20 per cent rebate. This measure only reduces benefits for families in the top 20 per cent of incomes in Australia. So the opposition to this measure is puzzling. It is odd that the interests of higher income earners are being so keenly promoted.

        Before I conclude, there were points that were made in the debate by Senator Crowley which I wanted to address. In answer to a question by Senator Crowley on an amendment to the child-care rebate act which concerns section 36C, this amendment will prevent payment of the rebate for care provided by a registered carer to children of that carer's spousal partner or business partner in a child-care business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the case of a spousal partner's children, it will prevent payment of rebate for care that would usually be provided free. This is consistent with existing provisions that prevent a carer claiming rebate for caring for their own dependent children. In the case of a business partner, it ensures that a parent cannot pay their own business for child care and then claim the rebate on that payment. I trust that that gives the answer Senator Crowley was looking for.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The measures contained in this bill eliminate Labor's inequities and establish a strategic direction for child care which is sustainable in the long term and protects the benefits of low and middle income earners while ensuring that high income earners who can afford to make a greater contribution to child-care costs do so. I commend the bill to the Senate.

         —The opposition opposes schedule 1, page 3, lines 2 to 9. This amendment goes to the very important issue of operational subsidies. I think I need to place on record that Australia's child-care system was one of the best in the world. I have said this before in this chamber. I have indicated that I do not believe it was an absolutely perfect system, but it certainly was a child-care system that did this country proud.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as the Labor Party is concerned, our record speaks for itself. Australia's child-care system, in fact, was built on the Labor Party's commitment and belief that child care should be treated with the same seriousness as is aged care and education. It was that commitment that led Labor to build a $1 billion child-care program.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The particular schedule that the opposition is opposing here seeks to eliminate the operational subsidy that is currently paid to community based long day care. The opposition is committed to opposing this particular schedule for a number of very good reasons. Firstly, we take very seriously our responsibilities as an opposition to keep this very deceitful government to its promises. This is a government that made clear before the election that they intended to keep the operational subsidy for community based long day care. This is yet another promise to be defined as a `non-core promise', one that the coalition believes it is appropriate for it to break.

        This is a government that made clear before the election that they intended to keep the operational subsidy for community based long day care—of course, yet another promise to be defined as a non&amp;hyphen;core promise, one that the coalition believes it is appropriate for it to break. The effect of removing the operational subsidy will be that centres will have two choices: they will put up their fees by anything up to $20 and $25 a week per child or they will have to reduce their services—and
        <break page="7672" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para first-indent="16">
        One service that all the community based centres around Australia are considering removing is the more extensive, highly qualified staff that they have in their centres. The direct impact of that of course will be a reduction in the quality of care that children in community based centres have in this country. Parents will be required to pay more for food or provide lunches for their children in child&amp;hyphen;care centres. That will mean that parents will be indirectly paying more for their children's care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Other sorts of services that centres are considering removing are nappy services and other services that in any other place would be considered essential. Any suggestion that these are moves that in some way might improve efficiency can only be described as very short&amp;hyphen;sighted indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They certainly do not equate with a definition of efficiency that I would embrace or that the Labor Party would support. The view that the government seems to have of efficiency equates with poorer quality, more children per staff member in child&amp;hyphen;care centres, less qualified staff and fewer services. As I say, it is a very interesting definition of efficiency indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a very serious change that is proposed by the government. It really is going to abolish the notion of community based long day care in this country. This is something that the government, the coalition parties, before the election led the community based child&amp;hyphen;care sector to believe would not happen. It is treacherous in the extreme. It is the sort of deceitful action that we have come to expect from this government that specialises in betrayal. I commend amendment 1 standing in my name to the committee.

        Child care, as the coalition apparently readily agreed before the election, is a legitimate work related expense. Both parents cannot work without decently provided child care. That is a fact of life. The government does not like to hear these things, but that is the truth. Senator Newman, who is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women—you know how effective she is in those tasks and how many questions she has answered during this session in parliament—was exposed in her own portfolio in the committee stage of debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill. She so humiliated people. Even Senator Newman, this weak and incompetent minister, conceded that child care is a legitimate work related expense.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That is another example of a government broken promise, another example of betrayal by the coalition, another example of, apparently, a non-core promise. What they are saying now is, `We don't think it is a legitimate work related expense. We think the whole amount spent on child care should be reduced.' The rebate recognised that child care was a legitimate work related expense, but it was not introduced in a way that gave much more benefit to those at the top of the income scale and, of course, zero to those who did not earn any taxable income. This is another retrograde step from this government. It is another broken promise from this government—another message to working women that their place is in the home, not in the work force. That is the truth of the matter.

         I know why Senator Hill is interested in prolonging this debate. The truth of the matter is that before the coalition government was elected earlier this year, Australia had one of the best child-care systems in the world. That is the truth of the matter. It was a child-care system built as a result of Labor's commitment over 13 years to child care. Since the election you have done everything you can to ensure that our child-care system unravels. That is what this mob are about.

        Coupled with the other changes that you have introduced, child-care fees will rise on 1 January by at least $20. It may be a bit less, but most likely it will be a lot more. That is what this bill will do, and it means that lots of families will not be able to continue with child care.

        It is very important to note that the child-care cash rebate is particularly targeted at families where one or both parents are working, studying, training or looking for work. But the loss of the operational subsidy, the increase of costs because of the changes that we were not able to disallow in this place despite our best efforts the other day—and they include the freezing of child-care assistance, the doing away of the $30 child disallowance for a second and third child and so on—are going to contribute to dramatic increases in the cost of child care, and that will impact not only on the working families.

        Senator McGauran, get around to visiting a child&amp;hyphen;care centre. You told me once before you had never been near one. There is nothing like shooting your mouth off when you don't know what you are talking about—but what's new? You are not really aware that many people using child care are not both parents working. They are families who use child care in an occasional care way as respite. You do not know what respite is, Senator Abetz. You do not know the language of child care either.

         What it means is that many families use child care to leave their kiddies while they keep appointments, do voluntary work or participate in the community in all sorts of ways. This is not only an attack on working families. This is an attack on every family who has ever used child care. The fees are going to rise for occasional care users just as much as they are going to rise for working families.

Some 70,000 people work in child care—or did until you became government. Under your program, lots of workers in lots of jobs in lots of centres have gone. Many of them are women and many of them, retreating from the work force, are all part of your secret agenda to encourage women out of the workplace and back into the home.

         —The minister might like to seek further information on this. One of the major concerns in the recent past concerning this very issue was a ruling by the tax department about the status of fringe benefits tax exemption for child care. It was proposed quite clearly under the act that any child-care costs enjoyed by an employer providing child care
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          on site were legitimately fringe benefits taxable.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was another understanding though that, for people who could not get child care provided on site, any amount of money, usually around $1,000 to $1,500 a year, spent by employers to reserve a place in a child-care centre would also be fringe benefits tax exemptible. But a number of employers, in enterprise agreements with their workers, came to an arrangement of salary sacrificing in effect, which was a way in which the fringe benefits tax began to apply. This was a very critical point for a number of child-care centres, particularly those in the CBD.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When the tax office finally ruled on its draft ruling and changed its decision to alter fringe benefits tax for child care, a number of child-care centres went straight out of business. There were certainly job losses associated with it. Those were the people—in fact the top end of town—who were eligible for the child-care cash rebate. So I urge your further investigation into this matter.

I am concerned that people who are asset rich but income poor might be accessing this child-care rebate. I know how concerned the government is about people with a large number of assets accessing government payments.

          —Mr Chairman, on a point of order: that is not relevant to item 18, which you are seeking to replace. What you should be debating is the calculation of the new rebate. This is the committee stage of the bill. This is when you seek out and explore the detail of the clause that is before the committee. That question is totally irrelevant to that. Mr Chairman, I respectfully put to you that the question ought to be ruled out of order.

          —Mr Chairman, on the point of order: it is quite relevant for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to ask a question about what clearly was a policy change which affects this section of the legislation. If this is ruled out, the committee stage is not worth two bob, because no-one will be able to ask any questions other than in relation to those narrow, restricted, technical definitions. Ever since I have been in the Senate, the committee stage has been involved in wide ranging discussion on the policy implications of particular clauses. Mr Chairman, the question from Senator Faulkner is on the policy implication of the government's changing their policy from what they announced in the election to what they have introduced in the parliament through this clause.

        Here we have a situation where the government is proposing to insert a new penalty provision where penalties already exist for providing false and misleading information. The view of the opposition is that this particular provision is completely superfluous and absolutely unnecessary. It is hardly surprising that we have a provision in a bill under the stewardship of such an incompetent minister as Mrs Moylan in the House of Representatives who has been forensically exposed by Jenny Macklin, the shadow minister, in this particular area. In fact, I think this has even been the subject of debate in the House of Representatives, while we on this side of the chamber, and some other senators—most of us with the exception of Senator Newman—have been concentrating on the social security legislation before the chamber.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I ask the minister at the table why the minister believes that this provision is necessary, given the fact that section 60 of the substantive act, which already has a considerable section in relation to penalty provisions, is required.

         —I think the answer to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is something like this. Currently the act imposes penalties for people knowingly making false or misleading statements in connection with registration or claims under the act. Whether a statement is false or misleading depends on the circumstances in which it is made and is open to interpretation in a court of law. The proposed penalty provisions are different. They relate to situations which are not open to interpretation, such as whether or not a cancellation notice of family payment or family income has been issued to a person, or to circumstances that would make a carer's registration no longer valid. If the situation exists, the person must notify the commission of it in writing. If they do not, they are subject to the penalty.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The interesting thing is that legal advice on the opposition amendment to remove the penalty provision from proposed section 58 is that this would render the provisions unenforceable. I find it very hard to understand why the opposition is persisting with their amendment, Mr Chairman. They have tried this tack in the other house and have already been apprised of the fact, if they did not know when they started out on this engagement whether their amendment was to be successful, that they would replace the $2,000 penalty with a term of imprisonment. If that is what the opposition considers to be a more desirable outcome, then one could only assume that they will be urging us all to support their amendment very thoroughly. The government thinks that a $2,000 penalty would be quite sufficient and a term of imprisonment is not appropriate.

        Mr Deputy President, I am sure that at the end of a long session and at nearly 2.30 a.m., you would not mind me recognising that this has been an exceptionally good year for the new government. It is a government that was elected with a big mandate. It has had the opportunity and has already demonstrated its commitment to implement its program for the benefit of all Australians.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When one reflects on what has been achieved in this session, we have seen major reforms. The changes to industrial relations in this country via the workplace relations legislation, which will allow employers and employees to work together for their mutual benefit in an unprecedented way in this country, can only be of benefit to all Australians. The decision to sell one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra, which will lead to a more competitive and efficient telecommunications industry, will give us the opportunity to repay large sums of
        <break page="7682" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        We have seen the introduction of the family tax initiative, which has been spoken about a bit tonight. It has the opportunity to benefit some two million Australian families, particularly those in the lower to middle income levels. The implementation of the national firearms program was a wonderful reform in this country that will ensure that we do not head down the path of those countries in which carrying weapons is part of their culture. It is taking us for the first time in a new direction in relation to firearms. We have seen a great demonstration of leadership from the new Prime Minister, Mr Howard, on that particular reform.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The introduction of very significant reforms to higher education, schools and vocational education will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of education in this country and enhance its quality and opportunity for all Australians. If I might be allowed to say it, reforms have been introduced to secure the funding base to set up for the first time in the history of this country a natural heritage trust that will allow the reinvestment of $1.1 billion in our natural heritage. It is a wonderful opportunity. It is a moment of history that will be remembered by future generations. It is a very exciting agenda and it has been a great thrill to achieve so much in just a short period.

They all deserve credit for the achievements that we have been able to put on the register in just a short period.

Half past two in the morning is a good time, I think, to add extra thanks to them for service beyond the normal call of duty. All that is left for me is, on behalf of the government, to wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

        This year has been a very eventful one in Australian politics. It has not been a great year for the Labor Party—and we have acknowledged that—since what was a very thumping defeat back in March. We suffered an awful loss at the election and all of us in the caucus of the parliamentary Labor Party saw the departure of very many of our good friends and comrades. But, for all that, I think that it is a great thing that the Labor Party has remained so strong and so united since that adversity in March. Slowly but surely, with the support of our party members and our supporters, we are rebuilding the party and we look forward to the challenges ahead.

        I would have to acknowledge that we have taken some knocks on legislation in the Senate. I admit that the passage of the Telstra bill was a blow. It was a blow not only to the Labor Party and our membership, but to the whole Australian community. But we are proud of our efforts in relation to our parliamentary struggle on that bill. We fought long and we fought hard to secure a very important amendment to the Telstra bill. The truth is that we did not have the numbers and we did not have the pork, but we fought it out, as we have on all the legislation that has come before the chamber, every inch of the way.

The cooperation and support that I have had from them as leader is something that I have very much appreciated. The opposition in the chamber has put in a great team effort since the election, and I think that is a credit to each and every one of my colleagues, who have really put their shoulder to the grindstone.

         There would be many highlights and anecdotes, if he was prepared to share them with us. I understand that in the 1970s, there was an occasion in the old Parliament House when the electricity failed and the chamber was plunged into darkness. To assist senators to leave the chamber, matches were struck and cigarette lighters were lit. I do not know what we would do today, now that nobody smokes. But in those days, it was possible to provide a little light by this means.

          At the time, Senator Gordon Davidson was addressing the chamber. Plunged into darkness, but with the assistance of cigarette lighters, it was possible for Senator Davidson to observe that Hansard was still at its post, so to speak. In other words, Malcolm was at the Hansard table. So Senator Davidson said, `Well, Hansard is still here, so I shall continue my remarks.' I understand Malcolm's response at the time was not reported in

        This is a time for some valedictory remarks. We have had a number of senators leaving us during the past few months but we have also had a large troupe of new people join us. In an entirely non&amp;hyphen;partisan way and having entered into debate with them during the workplace relations bill, I think that all of them—and there are too many to name—have slotted into the Senate very well. I guess it is very much jumping in at the deep end with a sitting the length of this one.

         For those who like statistics, the Senate has had a very busy year. We actually sat on 71 days of this year—probably 71 and a bit now—which was only seven days less than 1995, and that is quite a record for an election year. The Senate, when this speech was written, had passed 83 bills. It might have gone up to 90&amp;hyphen;odd by tonight. That was quite considerably less than 1995 when we passed over 183 bills. There were reasons for that. It was an historic year. We had two of the longest debates in Senate history. The workplace relations bill was the second longest debate in Australian parliamentary history and the Telstra bill took quite a long time as well.

         From the point of view of being the Manager of Government Business, in government legislation time in 1996 we averaged about 10 hours and 42 minutes per week, which was about an hour or so less than the averages for the previous two years, but we achieved about half the amount of bills being passed through the chamber. People should not be too concerned about that because I do not think there is a great correlation between the amount of legislation we pass and the wellbeing of the good citizens of Australia.

        This Senate has been preoccupied with economic issues—as indeed has the parliament—over the last few months. This has taken a great deal of concentration, but it is hardly uplifting stuff. Tuesday of this week was a beautiful day as I walked towards the front entrance. I generally get in before the press get out there but I didn't on Tuesday morning—I was walking around and enjoying the place. I said to the journalist, `It's a wonderful day and I was there for that historic moment at 1.30 this morning in the House of Representatives.' The House of Representatives passed a bill which I think is absolutely fundamental to the preservation of society, indeed civilisation.

         —I rise to address an issue in a recent publication by Treasury to the Wallis inquiry into the financial system. That submission recommends that, in deregulating the superannuation industry, the responsibility for supervising the management of superannuation savings should actually fall on the investor. In essence, they are saying `caveat emptor'. The effect of their proposal, they argue, is that investors, who under liberalisation will shop around for the fund or funds which best suit them, will shy away from poorly managed funds and support those that act with integrity and produce the best outcome. Consequently, those which do not measure up to the investors' expectation of prudential supervision will actually fall by the wayside.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are two significant flaws in this particular argument. Firstly, superannuation funds are not collective investments which come under the supervision of the ASC. Collective investments are managed on a `best endeavour' basis. If the manager does not perform then investors vote with their feet, as Mr George Pooley, Commissioner of the ISC, said recently. But investors in superannuation funds would not have the protection of the ASC.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, investors in superannuation funds must invest; they do not have the choice of
        <break page="7688" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         not investing at all. The principle of caveat emptor assumes that the buyer—in this case the buyer of a superannuation package—need not buy at all. But people are required by law to purchase superannuation. Superannuation funds will survive because the compulsory nature of superannuation guarantees their survival.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Thirdly, Australians are increasingly treating superannuation as their savings for the years following retirement and for their senior years. In assuming that it is a buffer against poverty in the future, they are treating it like a bank savings account. When such reliance is placed on superannuation savings, investors should be entitled to a properly supervised institution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fourthly, the ISC's recent reviews of superannuation funds have brought to light that some funds which are subject to supervision have some serious shortcomings in their prudential management. Commissioner Pooley explained to a conference in Sydney in September this year that the ISC, when undertaking its reviews, found that only 45 per cent of all funds either complied with the SIS legislation or had only minor technical breaches. He reported that the main problems were with trustees understanding neither their responsibilities nor the requirements of SIS, and that there were inadequate financial controls.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Trustees can be sued if they act wilfully or recklessly to the detriment of the members of the fund. Mr Pooley said a handful of investors would legitimately be able to sue their trustees in such circumstances. Examples were where, for instance, the trustee board had delegated virtually all of its powers to an unrepresentative executive committee. In another case, an employee who had a key role in a fund's financial affairs defrauded the company, its clients and the fund for many years. If this happens in supervised funds, how much grater is the opportunity for mismanagement of unsupervised funds?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is often too late for investors to move their funds elsewhere by the time they become aware of such malpractices. People in their senior years of life should not be subjected to unnecessary worry about whether
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         they can trust the managers of their savings. Many are at the mercy of the trustees of their funds. Their livelihoods should not be prejudiced in this way.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fifthly, the likelihood that trustees would provide adequate disclosure in an unsupervised regime is extremely questionable. Mr Pooley, in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        of Wednesday, 11 December, is quoted as saying that half the funds the ISC looked at are making inadequate disclosures. The ISC's response to the Wallis inquiry discussion paper gives details of trustees who have failed to give members correct information about their fund. It also explains how trustees have failed to ensure that their fund was properly administered and how they have failed to ensure the prudent investment of their assets. He cites such breaches. As my time is brief, I wonder whether I could have the leave of the Senate to incorporate the remainder of my speech in

        Nevertheless, if  these funds were under no prudential supervision the opportunity for defrauding investors would be even greater. Mr Pooley himself  says that the structure does offer protection if you make it work. Treasury seems to fear that the trustee system places the government under some moral obligation to bail out fund members who lose their money. If this is the case, the government will have a greater interest in ensuring the trustee system does work so that the government does not have to bail them out.

        Liberalisation/deregulation and supervision need not be mutually exclusive. In fact, as Mr Pooley says, the more you deregulate the better the prudential supervision needs to be. "Prudential supervision is aimed at stability; it encourages financial institutions to remain solvent and investment schemes to be run well. Liberality and consistency in the rules improve efficiency by fostering competition and innovation in the marketplace."

        I therefore believe, Madam President, that at the same time as Australians are given more choice in the way they invest their superannuation funds adequate prudential supervision of those funds must be instituted. Failure to institute suitable prudential supervision will jeopardise the savings of thousands of Australians, and cause unnecessary distress. In the long term those worse affected will fall back on the taxpayer for their livelihood.

Because DEETYA Area boundaries cross State boundaries a number of these sponsors would be operating in both Queensland and New South Wales and would be providing placements for people living in both States.

       DFAT and AusAID have commenced joint training programs for staff on human rights issues to foster greater knowledge about the role of human rights in foreign policy and development cooperation. Human rights training for DFAT and AusAID officers was introduced in a pilot form in 1994 in recognition that human rights knowledge and expertise cannot be confined to officers working directly on human rights matters but are an important skill for all officers including those on overseas postings. Efforts in 1995 were concentrated on using the experience developed in the pilot course to design a flexible course for officials of other Government Departments . The aim of the revised course is to provide officers with a sound understanding and awareness of human rights issues and government policy in this area.

       In the August 1996 Budget the Government announced funding for an anti&amp;hyphen;racism education campaign, to be managed through the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. A sum of $5 million has been made available in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The possibility of further funding will be considered in the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget context, following a review of the campaign's progress. The Government recognises that racism continues to be an underlying concern in Australia, and supports education as a viable long&amp;hyphen;term strategy to reduce racism. The Government considers racism to be unacceptable and un&amp;hyphen;Australian and will work to ensure that Australians are not subject to racism and are able to participate as full members of the Australian community. The campaign will be two&amp;hyphen;pronged, incorporating a public awareness element and community education projects. The campaign will focus on schools, workplaces, sporting organisations and will involve the whole Australian community.

        The Australian Defence Force incorporates training in human rights law and practice into the normal legal training given to its personnel. The approach to education and training is set in the context of a society committed to the rule of law. This training comprises (a) normal garrison training courses which include general human rights issues, and (b) specific pre&amp;hyphen;deployment training. Prior to any deployment  to either exercises or actual operations, there is specific pre&amp;hyphen;deployment education and training which supplements and builds on the normal garrison training. Training varies in duration and content . Areas covered include  relevant international law (including International Humanitarian Law as it applies both in armed conflict and at other times), the law and customs in countries of deployment, rights of all persons, including civilians, to due process (especially with respect to detention) and military discipline. The training deals with human rights concepts as opposed to the detailed content of human rights law. In summary, there is general garrison training supplemented, for deploying personnel, with more detailed training which allows a greater focus on the specific problems and issues likely to face those personnel on the specific deployment.

The Government recognises that racism continues to be an underlying concern in Australia, and supports education as a viable long&amp;hyphen;term strategy to reduce racism. The Government considers racism to be unacceptable and un&amp;hyphen;Australian and will work to ensure that Australians are not subject to racism and are able to participate as full members of the Australian community. The campaign will be two&amp;hyphen;pronged, incorporating a public awareness element and community education projects. The campaign will focus on schools, workplaces, sporting organisations and will involve the whole Australian community.

        The Australian Defence Force incorporates training in human rights law and practice into the normal legal training given to its personnel. The approach to education and training is set in the context of a society committed to the rule of law. This training comprises (a) normal garrison training courses which include general human rights issues, and (b) specific pre&amp;hyphen;deployment training. Prior to any deployment  to either exercises or actual operations, there is specific pre&amp;hyphen;deployment education and training which supplements and builds on the normal garrison training. Training varies in duration and content . Areas covered include  relevant international law (including International Humanitarian Law as it applies both in armed conflict and at other times), the law and customs in countries of deployment, rights of all persons, including civilians, to due process (especially with respect to detention) and military discipline. The training deals with human rights concepts as opposed to the detailed content of human rights law. In summary, there is general garrison training supplemented, for deploying personnel, with more detailed training which allows a greater focus on the specific problems and issues likely to face those personnel on the specific deployment.
