This was the basis of your plan to apply the enrolment benchmark adjustment.

         —Senator, I honestly believe that this matter has been canvassed again and again. We can continue to raise it. As you well understand, the EBA is designed to reflect a shift in students. You can, of course, focus on existing numbers of one portion—in your case, you choose to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          focus on the existing numbers in government schools—and disregard all population coming in. You can say, `If it follows the student, it should stay the same.' One wise man would say that—nonetheless, I have yet to find a wise man who does.

        Another wise man would say, `What is important about this is where the people are choosing to send their children.' Therefore, one does not look at today's student numbers for next year, the year after or the year after that; one looks at where the students in those years are going. On that basis, one obviously looks at where the new students coming in go to or, for that matter, where students in the existing population shift to. The EBA is designed to reflect that. Consequently, if there is a change in the proportion, that is, if students move as a whole, the EBA would be triggered. That is what it is designed to reflect.

        Senator, you understand how this works, Senator Allison understands how this works. We can keep repeating this, but it is exactly as I have related it to you. You, Senator Allison, the Australian Democrats and Labor would have it that if numbers stay the same in three, four, five, six or seven years time the money would be the same. This is an indicator, a reflection of a shift in the proportion of students, if not taking all the money from the states that they save by students shifting into the non-government sector. It is, in fact, splitting that saving with them. We think that is perfectly fair.

         I participated in a debate in this chamber earlier this year when there was a genuine misunderstanding as to the consequence of a particular matter. As a consequence of a genuine debate, where people were genuinely exchanging different views and arguing to a particular point, a bill was changed for the better. That was not because there was a difference of policy; it was because both sides of the chamber recognised what needed to be protected and were simply canvassing views about the best way to protect that. It related to one of the Attorney-General's bills. That is completely different. Here we have a difference of policy. You have different views from us and you are not going to agree. I accept that.

         —Minister, I put it to you that this is not just a question of a difference of policy. It is quite clear that there is a substantial difference in policy. I acknowledge that. I would be horrified to think otherwise, given the nature of the differences of our political philosophies. But this is not the issue of substance in question here. I am trying to get at what is the mechanism by which this government seeks to achieve its policy.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I say that this policy is wrong, and I make it very clear that I do not run away from that statement. But I also say that this policy will have unintended consequences, one would have to presume, given your statements. The effect of these changes is to shift costs from the Commonwealth to the states and to take money away from the states in a manner which this parliament has not designated in a conscious form. It is one thing for you to come into the parliament and say, `I wish to take $1.5 billion out of the financial assistance grants.' You made that statement very clear in terms of the government, and the parliament makes a decision about that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But it is another thing to come in here and say, `We're seeking to achieve these savings in a manner which the states will then be able to administer in a certain way.' The point of these questions is to show to you, and hopefully the other senators in this chamber, that the consequences of your policies will be to take additional moneys away from the states.
        <break page="6328" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         So, rather than there being savings to the states, there will be additional costs to the states.

        What does that mean? In Victoria we have already seen very substantial cuts in spending for government schooling, to the tune of some 10 per cent. We have seen some 300 schools close. We have seen a further 113 schools identified for closure this year. We have a minister who actually feels that it is appropriate to go on the public record and suggest that we can do with less schooling for our children in that state, that those children can do more for their education by staying away from school, by staying at home, which was what he suggested just this week, and that we can therefore do with fewer teachers, fewer schools and fewer resources in education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am worried that a proposition such as this will play right into that sort of minister's hands. When he is faced with the prospect of further cuts of between $20 million and $30 million for every two per cent shift in the enrolment benchmark adjustment as a result of these policies, I am concerned that a minister like that—Minister Gude, who essentially is an educational philistine—will be able to say, `The Commonwealth parliament has told us to do this in this manner.' Of course, Minister, it is all very well, when the children of the next generation have this cruel experiment inflicted upon them, to say, `We didn't mean it that way.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is why it is important for these measures to be thoroughly examined and for the senators to understand what the implications of this action are. I just do not accept the proposition that you are putting—that there are in fact savings. You claim that the states have access to these savings and that when students move from government to non-government schools the so-called saving is some $3,400. It is not some additional beneficial payment provided by the Commonwealth, as you continually imply.

        I have put the government's view to you—that the important thing for you to recognise, in our view, in consideration of what you want to do in this matter, is that we have set up this EBA, which is a mechanism designed to reflect shifts in students. We think that is appropriate; you do not. I have also asked you to consider that on our calculations—rough as they might be, but I do not think they are going to be far off—the EBA, that you seek to spend so much time on discussing, roughly works out at just over three per cent of SPPs. If you include the total funding for schools—that is, SPPs and FAGs—you will find that it is less than one per cent. That is what we are talking about in relation to the disagreement.

         That is what you are, in a sense, seeking to ignore.

We are not running around telling people to shift their kids into private schools. It is a function of parental choice.

The changes are small—as I have indicated, on the calculations we have, around three per cent of SPPs and only one per cent if we look at the total funding. We do not think people can say this is a significant change which is a disaster. It is not a disaster at all. It is a very sensible recognition.

We think it is wrong that people who so desperately want to make a different choice for their children in education send them to a school that does not have Commonwealth funding because the new schools policy will not allow it. We think that is wrong. We think we have to be responsive to what parents want—not dictatorial about but responsive to what they want. We think it is wrong there are schools like that. That is why we want to get rid of the new schools policy.

        We think governments, not just federal but state as well, should be responsive to choices parents want to make. Of course there are some basics in education where state and federal governments have to draw the line, but the choices parents want to make about where they send their kids to school and what it is they think is important that their kids get in primary and second schooling are not things we should be, in a monetary sense, trying to limit with a policy like the previous government's new schools policy.

        When we came into government we looked at the situation and found people are making this choice, that they are wanting to shift their children to private schools, non-government schools. Senator Neal, Senator Carr and Senator Allison might be able to tell me—I would like to hear these words from Senator Allison's mouth—why it is that parents are making these choices, why the federal government should simply ignore this trend and why

        These are the arguments I would like to hear. I understand there is a difference of opinion in a policy sense and that senators opposite will be critical of what the government wants to do. But what I would like to hear are reasons why we should ignore parental choice and why this has happened. Senators opposite seem to have a view that this government is somehow opposed to government schools. That is not right at all. It is not us making the choices about where children go. It is the parents.

        I would be very happy to hear some views about that from members opposite—that is, if in fact we have the time. The bottom line is that we are nearing the end of the session, we have a number of bills before us and it is simply a case of deciding whether we do or do not agree with this. Perhaps I am being irresponsible in inviting those opposite to give me those comments. Perhaps we could discuss it over a couple of Christmas drinks. I am just trying to indicate the position I am coming from—that I do not understand why you have this view. But I accept that you do, that you are not going to change your mind and that you are going to vote against this.

Compared with spending in 1996, these figures on page 14—the calculations are not done for us, unfortunately, but I am happy to expand on them, because I have done the adding up myself—show that there is a budget increase of $96 million for government schools and $530 million for private schools in additional funds over the next four years.

I have also looked at the same figure for non-government schools. Compared with spending in 1996, the specific purpose payments show a budget increase of $96 million for government schools and $530 million for private schools over the next four years. This adds up to an increase for both sectors of $626 million.

As I understand it, what you are seeking to do via amendment No. 1 is to stop the Commonwealth having the capacity to take money back vis-a-vis government schools, in which case I suspect that you should have had division 1 written in the place where you now have division 2 written. If that is the case, you might want to change it. I saw Senator Carr nodding his head. I think that is what he is intending to do with amendment No. 1.

         —I think what we have been speaking about this morning is completely relevant. We are talking about removing the EBA. So discussion about whether or not the $2.3 billion is extra or it is some other figure is relevant because it is crucial to the government's argument. The government says the EBA is insignificant; that it is only one per cent or three per cent and so, because there is so much other funding going into education, we need not worry about it. I want to come back to that $96 million to state schools. I also did a calculation which showed that it was an increase of 1.7 per cent over four years. That is something like 0.4 per cent each year in that period. I would like to suggest that 0.4 per cent is not an increase because I would imagine it does not even begin to cover inflation over that period. On the other hand, $530 million to private schools is 6.27 per cent.

        The minister said on 7 November that `funding per government school pupil will rise, taking these assumptions into account, to 17.9 per cent compared with non&amp;hyphen;government per&amp;hyphen;capita increases of 14.9 per cent'. So here we have another set of differences in terms of
        <break page="6339" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the figures that the department produces and the figures plucked from the air by the government during this debate. I mention that again: $96 million to state schools is an increase of 1.7 per cent over four years, hardly enough to keep up with inflation. Five hundred and thirty million dollars goes to private schools—that is 6.27 per cent. However you, Minister, said that funding to government school pupils would rise, taking these assumptions into account, to 17.9 per cent, compared with non&amp;hyphen;government, per&amp;hyphen;capita increases of 14.9 per cent.

        Now, you have actually made some calculations on the basis of the FAGs to the states and you have said that, all right, we are going to increase government school expenditure only by 1.7 per cent but we will assume that the states will increase their funding by 20.18 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For some reason, given that these are untied grants, given that $1.5 billion has been taken away from the FAGs over this period, you have assumed that the states will increase their spending on schools by 20.18 per cent. I directed a question on notice, question No. 39, to the department during the hearings about the guarantees in terms of states agreeing to fund education. The answer was that the decision at the 1996 Premiers Conference was that the states and territories would contribute to deficit reduction. DEETYA has no indication that states and territories have reduced their financial effort in schools as a consequence of this decision at the Premiers Conference.

        You might argue, `Well, they didn't say they wouldn't. Therefore, that means they did, and they did to the tune of 20 per cent.' I think this stretches our credibility a long way. Even if you take into account those percentage increases, it still does not add up to the figures that you have produced. You have said that essentially government school pupils will have increases to their per capita funding at a greater rate than the private sector.

         That simply does not wash, and I return to the table on page 14. The percentage increase of the FAGs to both government and non-government schools is the same—20.18 per cent. But the percentage increase to govern ment schools is very different. It is 1.7 per cent to government schools and 6.27 per cent to non-government schools. It is another indication that the government is using figures to promote its policy, but it is misleading. I think it has caused a great deal of confusion.

        You also said on 27 November that additional Commonwealth funding of $2.3 billion, which will be available for government schools, comes from two sources: firstly, the specific purpose payments to government schools and, secondly, the Commonwealth sourced financial assistance grants. I assume that you still stand by that comment, but I refer you once again to this table prepared by DEETYA which quite clearly shows otherwise. Either the government is trying to confuse people with the figures or there is simply not the understanding of the effects of that EBA.

        It seems to me that you do not know whether there is an increase in funds or not and, if you do, then people are being misled. I invite you to respond to that. Perhaps you will need to do some calculations. The problem with the tables that we have been presented with is that there are no additions across the line. We are simply presented with year by year figures. What has consistently happened is that those calculations are not being done. We cannot see comparisons from one year to the next. We do not see comparisons with the year 2000 and the year 1996. We do not see the adding up, except where it suits the government's purposes. So I ask you to address that.

There is no difference between the government and the department on these figures, and certainly not one that has become clear to me as a consequence of anything you have said. On that basis, I draw you to page 9 of the departmental submission to the committee's hearing and ask you yet again to accept that, for this place to work efficiently, we have second reading debates. That is the opportunity for people to put their views on general propositions about what ought to be the case. Then, when we have moved from that and we have passed our opportunities, we shift to the committee stage, which is the stage at which we, generally speaking, like to address the amendments to be made to the bill.

Senator Carr has had the decency to recognise that that is the purpose of a committee hearing. I ask you to contemplate the merit or otherwise of continuing with a rehash of the second reading debate where nothing further has been added.

We do not seek in any way under this amendment to detract from the administration of the grants for government schools other than, effectively, the removal of the EBA.

Yet, largely due to the actions of state governments, Australia's ranking amongst OECD countries in terms of spending on school education remained very low.

You have reduced financial assistance grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years and changed the calculation of the way in which road funding and other measures have been added to the FAGs.

The simple fact of the matter is: your government, during the election, refused to open the books to the Australian people. We were perfectly willing to have the books opened and policies on both sides assessed and reassessed on the basis of the books. Your government simply refused to open the books—an absolutely flat refusal. On coming to government, we found this enormous fiscal irresponsibility. There is nothing to be gained and there are no friends to be won in putting a budget back into black. There is no pleasure in saying to people, `You're going to get less money. We're going to have to tighten this up. We can't continue with this program.' Cleaning up a mess that a previous government made is not a politician's dream. Oh, no!

        That is the situation that this government is in. Let us make no bones about it. The previous government made an unholy mess of running this country. That is why, after a very significant time in office, you lost government so comprehensively. The new government is prepared to fix that mess, to make those hard decisions. We are not going to walk away from the tough decisions that became too hard for an ageing government to make. Too many people in the previous government had never experienced opposition. They just waltzed into a party that was in government and had the mentality of spend, spend, spend other people's money, taxpayers' money, low&amp;hyphen;income&amp;hyphen;earning taxpayers' money, without regard for the consequences. The consequences of that are fairly clear, with such

        You referred to the bottom line of a budget disparagingly, as if, somehow, it is dirty work to put a government's budget back into black. I do not regard that as dirty work, Senator. I regard it as a job that has to be done, because previous governments were simply unprepared to do it. I can see the benefits of a nation that does have some fiscal responsibility. When everyone else has to keep their budgets in order, I do not see why a cabinet here should simply play with other people's money as though they are in a sandpit, without any regard for the responsibility that they bear, being the government, and the consequences of simply spend, spend, spend.

        You may have the view, Senator, that when you are in government it is other people's money and you can do what you like with it, but we do not. We regard putting the budget back into black as not an easy task and not a pleasant task. It is never fun to go to people and say, `We're going to have to tighten up,' but that is the task we were elected to do. Weakly walking away from that task, as Old Jellyback and others did, means you walk away from the most disadvantaged people in the community. It means you walk away from the people who do not have a job, who are not sitting in here taking up extensive amounts of time and money rehashing debates over and over again, self&amp;hyphen;indulgently. It means walking away from the lowest skilled people who are most at risk when you are in a recession. That is what it means. They are the sorts of people you walk away from: the small business people with large overdrafts and people with extensive mortgages trying to buy their own homes. You just leave the fiscal mess, let the interest rates rise, and walk away from those people.

        Let me make it abundantly clear: yes, we said that funding of schooling is vitally important. I have repeated time and time again in here how we have made the calculations, that, on the specific purpose payments and financial assistance grants to the states, funding for government schools is going up. We can argue about this EBA, which is less than one per cent, we calculate, of total funding for schools—SPPs and FAGs together—and about three per cent of just SPPs. We can argue about that policy issue, but let us not pretend that somehow education is being ripped apart, when the bottom line is that total moneys are going up and the contribution from this portion of this portfolio to the savings task has been minimal, in recognition of the very important place that primary and secondary education takes in the mind of this government.

        Let me also come back, just briefly, Senator Alison, to this in particular. I know you understand what a first reading is. It is just a bill being introduced. I presume you understand what a second reading is. We spent three hours and 56 minutes in a second reading on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996. That is not a bad thing because education is important. On the committee stage, at 10.15 a.m. we had spent about two hours and 54 minutes and we still have not had a vote on one of the clauses in the committee. We can go on indulging ourselves if we like, but it is abundantly clear to me, from the second reading debate and from the committee stages that we had in previous weeks, and from when this bill was referred to a committee, that you do understand how this works and you simply disagree.

        Amendment No. 2 goes to the issue of the government's rationale for funding of non-government schools—that is, it seeks to explain that government schools are somehow or other an alternative. This is a view that the Labor Party does not support. We believe that, on the issue of choice, private schooling is an addition, not an alternative, in terms of providing reasonable access to quality government schooling.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has been a fundamental principle of public schooling in this country that public schooling is primarily the responsibility of the public sector through governments. Since the education acts of last century, the various public instruction acts, all governments have acknowledged their responsibilities to provide comprehensive education available on a universal basis. Of course, many have said that it should be free, secular and universal. There may well be some argument as to what is the meaning of `free' in its modern context, but that principle has been firmly grounded in public administration in the Commonwealth throughout this century.

        We are seeking to put in perspective the rhetoric about choice and we would like to emphasise to the chamber the role of the Commonwealth in underpinning a national quality public education system—and providing financial assistance also to the non-government sector, but not at the expense of the public sector. It is our belief that choice
        <break page="6348" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         exists only if there is a quality, universally accessible government school system. What we maintain is that the choice of some should not be at the expense of the choice of many.

        What we argue and what Professor McKinnon highlighted is that there is a limit to the resources available. There are finite limits on resources available and we cannot logically argue that choice can be so broad as to fund every possible option of every group no matter how small or how isolated in terms of a private education system. In terms of our social responsibility, we have to primarily consider responsibilities to provide a high quality, universally accessible public education system.

        Professor McKinnon argued, I think very competently, in the review he undertook, which was finally published in April 1996—a review, of course, which the government has sought to shelve, tried to bury in the bottom drawer, sought to avoid public discussion on:

        Choice is easier to use as a rhetorical term than it is to operationalise, at least for the funding of schools. Generalised support for the concept of everyone having maximum choice does not translate into a system which can realistically fund all conceivable options. Nor is choice an unambiguous good.

        The minority report, in considering these issues, argued that there is a significant weakness in the policy upon which the states grants bill is predicated, because it is meant to provide for the financial assistance to primary and secondary schools, but it does so with the notions of parental choice as its overarching purpose rather than as a general purpose directed towards educational outcomes.

         It has been repeated by several witnesses before the committee that choice in itself has no impact on educational outcomes in terms of Australian schools. It is likely, however, that the deliberate favouring of private provision over public provision in our schools could quickly lead to a deterioration in the quality and the universality of public education, and hence our amendments seek to reinstate the basic principle that the central point held in common by all Commonwealth governments of all political persuasions over the last two decades is that its primary re sponsibility is to support the provision of a comprehensive universal education system so that Australians, no matter where they live, have access to high quality educational services.

        That cannot be done through the privatisation of education, because it is founded upon a whole series of different principles. It is not comprehensive. It does not seek to be comprehensive. Individual schools are established on the basis of the values that they see reflected in a particular group. For the disabled it cannot possibly be contended that there is comprehensive provision in private education. Time and again it has been put to Senate estimates committees, particularly for the disabled, the disadvantaged and a whole range of others, that choice is not really an option, because the private sector does not provide it. We will speak more about that when we come to the issues relating to broadbanding.

        The amendments seek to recognise Australia's international treaty signatory obligations. They seek to identify that the primary role of government is to ensure that the quality of services is maintained at a high level for all Australians and that Australians, particularly if they come from backgrounds where they cannot afford private education and the provision of private fees and tuition, are not singled out for reduced services or isolated by the withdrawal of public support.

         —The Australian Democrats support these amendments. We think these amendments place at least some restrictions on where schools can open, what their minimum number of enrolments should be, how viable they should be and what curriculum requirements should be put in place. They also set up a process under which the minister is obliged to take advice from state based non-government school planning committees. Those committees, in the Democrats' view, are appropriately structured under the opposition amendments and they are consistent with the notion that all parties should be involved in planning Australian schooling.

         with the involvement of all parties. It is important to draw on some of the submissions to the inquiry in support of that. One is from the National Catholic Education Commission. It sought to persuade the government to set up some general principles for planning schools. For instance, it says that, since the Commonwealth government has a shared responsibility for the funding of education, it has a right and a responsibility in regard to new schools.

        It offered as a suggestion for a minimum in terms of the process of consultation that proponents of new schools gain access to demographic and planning data at the state and territory level; consultative meetings between two or more education providers or from time to time between all peak provider bodies; the exchange of relevant information between peak school education authorities to avoid the overprovision of facilities by any one of the three providers; knowledge of other broad plans to help individual school systems; and provider planning. So it is not just the public sector which is arguing that sensible planning processes ought to be in place.

        I think it would be appropriate at this stage to ask the government what it is going to do to ensure that there will be some sort of uniformity across the states when it comes to minimum registration requirements. Does the government accept that it is in the national interest to have uniformity in an area of such national significance as education? We heard at the inquiry the range of different registration requirements the states have. Many states said they thought they would need to develop their own planning requirements.

        What I would like to ask the minister is along those lines.

What sort of standards and requirements might there be at the end of such a process? I know that the government has said over and over again that it thinks that education is a state responsibility. But, as the Catholic Education Commission points out, it is Commonwealth funding. I would have

         —One of the delights of a federal system is that if the Commonwealth does something, it is responsible and it has to answer to the electorate for it on each occasion. Similarly, when a state government chooses to implement a policy, it is answerable for that policy to the people of that state. We do not think it is appropriate that the Commonwealth maintain the Commonwealth new schools policy.

        We think it is just plain wrong that there can be a policy which seeks to discourage parental choice in schooling. It is acknowledged in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that Senator Carr was referring to and has referred to before by highlighting that everyone has a right to education. He has not gone on and pointed out that point 3 of article 26 says that parents have a prior right to
        <break page="6350" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.

        We believe that the previous government's new schools policy—that is, the existing new schools policy—inhibits that choice very substantially. We think it is wrong that there are schools that do not have Commonwealth funding. Parents have been desperate to have an alternative choice and the Commonwealth is not funding them. We think that is wrong. We think parents should have the choice. They are entitled to some Commonwealth funding when they make that choice to move away. You might not think that. You might think they are only entitled to such choices as you are prepared to give them. We would like to give them greater choice than the new schools policy allowed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Despite the fact that the new schools policy was set up to try to inhibit the growth of new non-government schools, they, nonetheless, grew. That is in the face of a very difficult policy climate. Non-government schools, nonetheless, kept springing up. That should tell you something, Senator. It should tell you that parents want to make that choice. That is why we believe it is appropriate to get rid of the new schools policy at a Commonwealth level because at a Commonwealth level we say that we are not interested in doing that. We do not want to inhibit parental choice. If a state wants to take it up and they want to argue the case with the parents in their state and they want to inhibit the parents' choice, let them do so. Let them answer for it at the next state election.

        It seems to me that they are reasonable expectations to have. What you are concluding is that all non&amp;hyphen;government schools will not be irresponsible. By saying to me that I am saying non&amp;hyphen;government schools will be irresponsible, you are suggesting that the assumption you and the federal government make is that they will be responsible. I think, on the whole, that that is not an unreasonable suggestion. However, I would have thought that, since it is taxpayers' money, the federal government ought to have the ability to know that the states are responsible. Under this legislation it will not be able to do that. So it is a question of accountability. I do not think you can say that the states are accountable. It is Commonwealth funding, and the Commonwealth ought to have a say in whether or not it is getting value for that money.

You say it is the states' matter, but thus far the Commonwealth government has taken a role in planning at the national level. Through its programs and through its other mechanisms it said that there is a responsibility at that level. I think it is disappointing to see that the Commonwealth government is prepared to step aside from that.

         What is also disappointing is that this is not about outcomes. It is not about things like retention rates. We do not know how they will be affected by this legislation.

I dare say we could have a debate about why that is.

         This legislation does not seek to address education outcomes. It seeks to open up the private sector without any controls.

         Certainly, the Catholic system will be one of those affected. The Catholic system has grown at a consistent and small rate over the years. It is a properly planned system.

         What we are talking about here in an unplanned expansion—and that is what the government is doing—is very small schools starting up. I referred to this in a speech I made on Wednesday. The point is that the Commonwealth no longer has any control. We cannot say that we do not need a school here or that we do. We cannot say that, if a new school opens up in a small country town, the effect of it will be to take students from government schools and the effect of that will be for the state government to close down those schools because they are no longer viable.

        The reliance upon the states to provide that is flawed intellectually because they have demonstrated for many years that they do not have the political will to establish guidelines and criteria on very simple matters like teacher registration, for instance. That is a simple proposition. Not all states require the qualifications of teachers to be recognised. They have all sorts of ways around it. They do not have a national approach to questions of financial viability. Very few states—in fact, one from my recollection—have any criteria based on the concept of financial viability.

        As to the concept of minimum enrolments, which you would expect to have some relationship to the issue of financial viability, the states as a rule do not have criteria.

There is a minimum requirement of 10 in a private primary school and 400 in a public school. That sort of inconsistency and hypocrisy is just breathtaking.

Most applications, in fact the overwhelming number, particularly in the Catholic education system, were in fact run and successful.

         —In relation to the issue of the performance of the states, I think there are two issues that we need to look at. If we look at the requirements of the states for registration, your state of South Australia, Minister, has no official requirement. It relies upon the new schools policy. It may review that; it may not. New South Wales has no requirement. Queensland is in the same position as your state. Western Australia has no requirement. Tasmania has a requirement for a minimum of two for families, and I guess that means a minimum of two students. The ACT has no
         <break page="6354" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          requirement, and the Northern Territory has a slightly more complex provision.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If we look at the list of unfunded or part-funded schools that your department, in answer to a question 19 in estimates, communicated to us, in your state of South Australia there are no schools that are totally unfunded. There are two schools that are category six limitation funded. So, in effect, the new schools policy has restricted funding but not stopped funding of any school. There are no schools operating—according to the answer that DEETYA gave us to question No. 19—that are totally unfunded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at that same document, it appears to me that the overwhelming majority of schools that are unfunded are in the states of New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. I think they are the states—according to the information that I have as to the requirements for registration—that have no minimum number requirement. So we have a correlation that, where there is no minimum requirement for the number of pupils, there is a higher number of unfunded schools. This bill removes any restriction on funding. So those schools will be funded because there is no requirement.

        I think the persistent stance of this government is, `We don't have money. We can't splash money around everywhere.' There are limitations. We have this alleged black hole. At the same time, there is going to be no financial stringency applied in relation to these schools, whereas there is now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to the schools that are established in the non-government sector, I think the evidence is that, prior to the new schools policy where there was no limitation on funding, a number of schools opened were not viable and closed. I think the evidence in relation to that was the evidence from the Independent Education Union, Minister, which talked about a concern for the destabilising effect that these non-viable schools had on some of the smaller communities. They mentioned communities in rural and regional New South Wales, in particular.

         would be interesting to get the minister's view as to whether the situation which existed prior to 1985 is the situation that this bill seeks to obtain. If the experience prior to 1985 was not satisfactory to the Commonwealth or to at least some participants in the sector, why should we be rushing to pass a measure now, given that there is clearly no common view amongst the states about the need to pursue this measure at this time?

It would seem that there would be a more rational and reasonable approach to this issue to pursue agreement on these matters.

        I understand, Minister, that you are saying, `Well, it's all a matter for the states,' but there are very great financial implications for the states.

The minister might like to make some comments on those issues and on some of the previous comments that have been made.

        Let me turn to the issues you raise about the Tasmanian schools, Minister: you may not be aware but there have been significant reductions in the number of government schools in Tasmania on the grounds of financial restriction and the efficiency of the system on the basis announced by the government that some of the smaller schools were unable to supply a satisfactory educational experience because of their limited size. Points have been made by the representatives of various parts of the non&amp;hyphen;government schools sector that they want to have curriculum standards set by the state and they want to be viable.

        I suggest to you that two matters are under consideration here. The first matter is that there are schools which are currently established that are not fully funded, and there is the issue of whether any of those should be looked at again; and I suggest that looking at the new schools policy again was already being contemplated. There is a report. I think that our amendments have regard to some of those issues. So some of those schools that you have mentioned would, in fact, under our proposal receive additional funding.

        In relation to the issue of establishing more schools, because that is what your policy will permit under the arrangements that now exist within the states, we will see in my state an erosion of the dollars which go to the government school sector. That is the sector that educates the vast majority of the pupils in Tasmania. So in an unrestrained environment, and given the current political climate in Tasmania—I think there is a degree of inertia with the Tasmanian government at the moment—we could not be confident that this matter would be addressed expeditiously. I am concerned that we may see an erosion, by the government not doing what it should, of the funding basis of the state schools by simply transferring money across to the non&amp;hyphen;government schools.

I make this prediction, Minister: if things occur in such a way as to cause further restriction of the funding of the government school sector, there will be a significant backlash. The philosophy behind this bill—allowing parents to send children to schools that they want—will have to be attended to and undermined by a state government in the interests of maintaining their sector.

That is why I think our amendments do attend to some of the problems that you mention but do not allow an open slather approach to the establishment of new schools. They are amendments which are worthy of very strong consideration.

        The political weakness of the position you are putting assumes that state governments will have the political will to undertake the necessary planning provision against some of these highly organised and very vocal religious groups in the main who will pursue a political agenda. I really question whether there will be the political courage at a state level to defend planned educational provision. State planning committees were in place under the old legislation, which you are seeking to overturn today.

        They provided advice to the Commonwealth on whether proposals for new schools satisfied the criteria relating to planned educational provision. You are losing that opportunity. This bill takes that opportunity away and reduces the capacity of the Commonwealth to effectively administer the expenditure of some $2 billion a year. Despite the requirements of the new schools policy, and contrary to your claims that there was an undue restriction on applications, the majority of applications for new schools were able to demonstrate consistency with the principles of planned educational provision.

        Before we wrap up this debate, I want to mention one aspect of planning which has not been dealt with so far in the debate, and that is the provision for children with disabilities. It is a planning issue. It is one that the government ought to have paid more attention to in this legislation. In fact, the government shows in schedule 8 that funds for special education have remained the same over the 1997-2000 quadrennium in government and non-government schools. It is interesting, given that we are going to see a shift into private schools, that there has not been a consequential shift of funding for disability services.

If the government is serious about choice, it ought to provide that choice for parents of disabled children too. In fact, the department was going to come back to me with some figures on the levels of students with disabilities in private schools, but I have not seen that so far.

        This amendment specifies the criteria for use by planning committees for the assessment of new schools proposals, which were drawn extensively from the recommendation in the McKinnon review. It goes specifically to the issues of catchment areas and other measures designed to ensure that other schools and other people's choices are not undermined by the exercising of choice by some. Of course, it ensures that there are at least minimum requirements relating to the establishment of new schools and that there is not an undermining of the educational provision currently existing within any particular locality.

        These issues have been extensively canvassed. As I understand it, there were amendments to the Labor Party's amendments which were to be moved by Senator Allison. This amendment 11 seeks to establish minimum enrolment criteria for non-government schools and to ensure that there is an effective distribution and an effective use of scarce public resources in terms of the subsidies provided to private education.

        This amendment moved by the Australian Democrats is in recognition of the fact that neither the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) nor the department has been able to provide this chamber with a clear picture of the impact of these changes. Even the government majority on the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Committee acknowledged that they were not in a position to assess the conflicting claims between the states and the department. I said in my speech during the second reading debate, and I will say it again: no&amp;hyphen;one knows what the outcome of these changes will be. Nobody has the data on which to base any meaningful assessment of the impact of these changes on public schools. Not one single person in the entire country could stand up here and say that they know where this will end.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the risk the majority of this chamber have taken in passing this legislation. They have taken that risk, and the Democrats believe the very least this chamber should do is put in place an open and accountable monitoring process to enable a parliamentary review of the operation of the legislation every 12 months. Where else will people go if they have concerns about the impact of this bill? The short answer is: there is nowhere else to go. There are no planning committees, no review procedures and no other means of looking at what is happening as this legislation starts to bite.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This sort of monitoring role for a Senate committee is not new. This chamber has previously accepted this role when there has been concern about the implications of pieces of legislation. Perhaps the most notable in recent years was the reference to the Senate community affairs committee to monitor the operation of the previous government's private health insurance reforms because of concerns expressed by the medical profession at the time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we can take doctors' concerns seriously enough to set up a Senate monitoring process, surely we can take just as seriously the concerns of parents, teachers and state governments. If the senators who voted for this legislation are so confident that it will not damage the public school system, or even the non&amp;hyphen;government system for that matter, they should not be afraid to support the Democrats' amendment and to subject this legislation to ongoing scrutiny.

        I would like to make some final remarks in proposing this amendment. Firstly, we need to realise that the real effect of the enrolment
        <break page="6365" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         benchmark adjustment will not be felt until 1998. Secondly, the bulk of the cut, which will be to state schools, will not be felt until the year 2000. So I recommend to senators that this bill be referred to the Employment, Education and Training References Committee for inquiry and report on the last sitting day of each of 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.

         —I will briefly indicate why we do not believe this amendment is at all necessary. Senator Allison knows full well that numerous accountability mechanisms are available through this chamber. If at any time this chamber wants to make a formal reference to that committee that it looks at this legislation in one year or the next, well and good. It can do that. Senators can individually, without the support of the rest of the Senate, seek, through the estimates process, all the appropriate information.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If this amendment were passed, we would need another resolution of this chamber in a year's time if, for example, we had figured out this legislation is all okay. The mechanisms are already there for individual senators—through estimates committees, through questions on notice, et cetera—and it is open to this chamber on an annual basis to make that reference to the committee. That may well be appropriate on an annual basis, but the senator is asking us to commit now to a formal reference to a committee for three or four years ahead. We think that is inappropriate. This chamber will choose each year, as is appropriate, what it wants to do.

        In the last two to three months, there has been an ever growing chorus from Australian business people, from manufacturers in particular, including the shipbuilding and shipping industries, about the need for a decent industry policy in this country. The call to have a vision about where manufacturing should go, and in particular where our shipping industry should go, has been made many times.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Though this bill does not deal with the issue of the ships bounty, it is in many ways related to the lack of philosophy this new government has towards our shipping industry in Australia. We have strenuously opposed the abolition of the ships bounty for our shipbuilding industry, a shipbuilding industry that now, in the fast ferry and fast ship area, is a world leader—employing thousands of people and each year selling to the world ships to the value of several hundred millions of dollars. It is an industry that is growing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With this new government we are seeing that bounty come to an end. We will be one of the few countries in the OECD, if not the only one, that will provide no assistance to the shipbuilding industry. Yet we will be selling our ships into markets that are corrupted by the provision of tariffs, subsidies and non-tariff measures to encourage the development of shipbuilding industries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When we were in government, we made it clear that we were not opposed to removing subsidies, bounties and non-tariff measures but only on the basis that every other country that was building ships did the same. We made it clear that, in particular, we would look towards the United States of America to repeal the so-called Jones act, which prohibits ships manufactured in Australia being sold into the American market. It prohibits our fast ferries, which are the world's best, most efficient and most technological advanced, being sold into that market.

         We have strenuously opposed the government's decision to abolish the bounty legisla tion for this industry.

        The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill is another example of a move away from any idea that we should have an involvement as a government in encouraging an indigenous shipping industry in Australia. The overall philosophy of the existing provisions goes right back to the 1980s. I have been advised that they were developed even by a previous coalition government. Mr Hunt, when he was the minister for transport, started the process that led to the introduction of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act in 1987. The purpose of that legislation was to encourage Australian owned shipping companies to purchase up-to-date ships to operate as registered Australian ships both in the domestic market and in the international market. But this government wants to repeal all of this. It is not encouraging an Australian owned shipping industry. I think in this we see the heavy hand in particular of the new Treasurer, Mr Costello.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There would be some advisers in the Treasury, I am sure, who would see legislation such as the Ships (Capital Grants) Act as an unnecessary interference in the free market. The people who say that have no conception of what is in the national interest in Australia. They believe that if you leave it to the free market other things will occur—sometimes by osmosis or by some sort of transcendental activity—so that somehow, out of nothing, an Australian shipping industry will develop.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We do not take that view in opposition. We never took that view in government. We believe this legislation is wrongly conceived and is against the national interest. We believe, in general, that these measures will seriously undermine the viability of the Australian industry. The loss of a viable, national industry can and should be opposed for a number of reasons, including the decimation of the industry, which will have a negative effect on the net services component of the current account.

         The Bureau of Transport Economics estimated for 1986-87 that, if there had been no merchant fleet, the current account deficit would have been increased by $440 million—about 14 per cent of the services deficit and about four per cent of the current account deficit. Of course, we have had the Treasurer lecturing Australians over the recent months that the No. 1 issue he wants to deal with is the current account deficit. He wants to turn it around, but you have introduced legislation that will exacerbate the current account deficit in the services area.

         The decimation of the national merchant fleet would affect our defence capacity. Several ship owners have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the navy to provide assistance in case of a national emergency. Some might even have facilities on their ships to specifically assist the navy. The lack of trained seafarers may also make emergency crewing of the navy more difficult in a national emergency.

         Sea transport, of course, is environmentally more desirable than some modes of land transport. In terms of energy consumption, bulk shipping uses only 0.2 megajoules per tonne/kilometre as compared to 0.4 for government rail and 1.4 for articulated trucks. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, bulk sea transport generates 13 grams of CO2 per tonne/kilometre, as compared to 29 grams for government rail and an even higher rate of grams for the trucking business.

         This government in recent times has shown no interest in the greenhouse gas emissions issue. It even had the embarrassment of being properly lectured by the American President, when he was here last week, about the need for international rules for greenhouse gas emissions that are legislatively binding on countries. Our new government has steered right clear of that and, as a result, was severely embarrassed by the President's remarks in his successful visit to Australia last week.

         Most countries, be they OECD countries or otherwise, provide fiscal assistance to their national fleets. I think that is the point that I made in my remarks on the bounty. Most OECD countries provide fiscal assistance to the national fleets. They understand the national interest at stake in having their own national fleet. They also understand the importance of not being in a closed market but being in the marketplace, competing to build up the skill levels of staff and management as well as seafarers and so on. All of this is seen in most countries in the OECD as a national interest issue. Unfortunately, this new coalition government does not have the same view.

         Australian ship owners and workers have made significant gains in terms of productivity and competitiveness in the last decade. Since 1989, over $2 billion has been committed to investment in ships, with the result that the Australian fleet is half the age of the world fleet. Manning levels on Australian international ships have fallen from an average of 31.6 in 1986 to 18.4 in 1995, which the minister, in his second reading speech, conceded are now consistent with international standards.

It is not right to now attack this industry that has made such progress halfway through a restructuring process merely to satisfy the government's hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia. Clearly, the underlying reason these two bills have been brought in is the opposition's ideological obsession against the maritime workers of this country.

In this case, our international shipping industry is going to go backwards because of an ideological position—or an ideological aversion—this government has towards the seafarers of this country, particularly the workers who have made major sacrifices to improving this industry over the last decade in a very cooperative way.

         —The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996 seeks to commence the dismantling of the cooperative approach to maritime reform, which has seen disputation fall significantly and productivity rise significantly in the Australian maritime industry over the past decade. It seeks to target two measures, both of which were to the benefit of the industry, introduced by the previous government. The first is the seven per cent capital investment allowance for new ships, which was first introduced in 1987 and has since been extended twice. The second is the rebate for employers of seafarers in respect of PAYE tax remittances for their employees. This measure was part of the last set of maritime reform legislation introduced in 1994 and mirrors international practice by many other developed countries. The government estimates that the repeal of the capital grants will save $12 million while the repeal of the tax rebate will save $40 million over four years, or $10 million per year. Incidentally, there is a conflict between the government's budget papers and the EM on that matter.

        The bill was tabled in May and sent to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for report. The committee

         heard evidence from three major companies—BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar Cooperative—who were midway through major shipbuilding exercises and were caught up by the premature termination of the capital grants. After public exposure and intense lobbying, the government has apparently revised its position. I understand that it will be moving amendments to allow those three ships to retain access to grants provided that they are delivered before 1 July next year. I do not have those amendments before me.

        The Australian Democrats will be supporting those proposed government amendments on capital grants. If those amendments do not materialise, we will oppose the early cessation of the capital grants scheme. We believe that the capital grants scheme has played a significant role in updating and modernising the Australian shipping fleet. More modern vessels have encouraged the reduction of shipping crew ratios, which have fallen from 36 to 18 per vessel over the last decade.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We now have internationally competitive crewing ratios, and that is a credit to the unions, shipowners and seafarers. Australian crewing levels are now lower than the world average crew size of 23.8 and the OECD average of 22. Obviously, more may need to be done. I note that the MUA has been resisting attempts by some shipowners to take crewing ratios lower, even when it is safe to do so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is appropriate that we look at whether industrial assistance programs are still needed. As you know from my minority report tabled yesterday, the Australian Democrats will oppose the early abolition of the shipbuilders bounty. With regard to this issue, between 1988 and 1994, 36 additional and replacement vessels were added into the Australian fleet, representing a turnover of 45 per cent of the fleet and reducing the age of the Australian fleet to well below the world average.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Clearly, the ships capital grants scheme is one program that has achieved its purpose. It has done a good job for the Australian fleet. It can now be terminated, in our view. With the amendment that the government has
        <break page="6371" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         agreed to which protects those in transition through the scheme, we will support its abolition.

        The repeal of the International Shipping (Australian&amp;hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 and, with it, the rebate of PAYE taxes paid by Australian resident seafarers on ships that operate 50 per cent or more of their time in international trade is another matter. The 1995 act was an important and essential policy change, which we supported at the time. We thought it was appropriate then, and we think it is appropriate now. The government claims that that rebate was some sort of handout from a captive Labor government to the MUA to keep them quiet over the ANL sale. That is what is implied in the second reading speech. That is not how we saw it then, and it is not how we see it now. It is our view that the PAYE measure is a revenue exercise and has nothing to do with that spurious argument.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This measure was one of several recommended by the Shipping Industry Reform Authority in August 1994. The report noted that 12 out of the 25 OECD countries make concessions for the tax treatment of national seafarers on international routes. Many shipowners from other countries are able to avoid the payment of tax altogether by permitting the offshore movement of vessels and crew employment. The report concluded:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the significance of this cost, it is considered essential that Australian seafarers in the international trades be treated similarly.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, without this measure, Australian ships will not be competitive against the ships of other OECD countries let alone flags of convenience ships. This point was clearly made in submissions from the Australian Shipowners Association to the Senate committee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, that does not mean that Australia obtains no tax revenue from Australian ships and seafarers. As Australian residents, seafarers are obviously spending in this country, as the shipowners are running their administration and are paying company tax and all the other taxes in this country. If the shipping industry were to disappear completely because it was uncompetitive, Treasury would lose
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         this much larger pool of revenue. I draw to your attention that, once again, this government has failed to do a cost&amp;hyphen;benefit analysis and any kind of modelling analysis or sensitivity analysis over getting rid of this.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is obviously the assessment made by the other 12 OECD countries that now provide full or partial rebates on seafarers' PAYE taxes. Once again, the principle is obvious. Australia must not act in isolation of its competitors. Short-term deficit reduction measures have to be weighed against greater medium&amp;hyphen; and long-term harm to a vital industry. I say to you again that you have not done a cost&amp;hyphen;benefit analysis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note in passing that the authority also pointed to the importance of vigilant port control inspections of ships from flags of convenience states to ensure that competition is on a fair basis on routes to and from Australia. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has considerably increased its inspection activity since 1991. It is now inspecting over 2,700 ships per year, with 10 per cent being referred for irregularities and further safety repairs.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The 1994 maritime reform package, which included the PAYE initiative, also required the shipowners and the maritime unions to negotiate savings that would deliver efficiency improvements roughly equivalent in value to the PAYE measure, which was about $19 million per annum. The result, the maritime industry restructuring agreement, has seen a quantum shift from industry awards to enterprise agreements, the cessation of industry training of ratings—a measure itself worth $190 million a year—increased flexibility and cooperation in the engagement system, and a new system of dealing with ratings who were the subject of disciplinary action. Contrary to the ideological ravings—and they are ravings sometimes—of some of those in the government and elsewhere, these have been significant achievements, a point recognised by both unions and employers. But, clearly, more needs to be done. International trade does not stand still and nor should maritime reform and change in the maritime industry.

        The 1994 SIRA report had a wide range of other measures which it recommended to both unions and employers. Progress in some of these has been far too slow. In the committee stage, I will be proposing an amendment to continue this process by the establishment, under the International Shipping (Australian&amp;hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act, of a process to continue the reform work. I have circulated that amendment before you, and you should note that I have withdrawn the previous amendment. That working party will be required to report back to parliament on its progress. If progress is not satisfactory, then we as the Australian Democrats will review our position on the PAYE rebate.

        The Democrats are satisfied that the parties are abiding by the commitment that they gave in 1994 when the rebate was introduced. While progress is being made on maritime reform, parliament should be prepared to underwrite that progress by ensuring that our tax system is internationally competitive in seafaring routes. This PAYE grant is about competitiveness, and that is where the focus should be.

        The situation with seafarers is one of the worst and most shameful examples of the action of international competition and the race for the bottom. Seafarers have virtually no protection since they operate in international waters. While there are many national awards specifying wages and conditions, there are few requirements for any ship, regardless of the country of registration, to provide minimum wages or conditions to all seafarers, regardless of nationality. Under such a situation, the economic imperative to reduce costs and increase profit margins will virtually force shipping companies to employ the cheapest possible crews.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If any nation has award standards for its seafarers on international ships, either national flag or foreign flag vessels, then the response of shipping companies is almost certain: to hire crews from nations without such conditions. There are extreme impacts of hiring crews from nations which do not offer even nominal protection for such workers—workers who operate in international waters—when no nation takes an interest in their treatment and when their foreign status as employees of a foreign vessel and/or the status of their agreement on wages and conditions is seen as a commercial matter outside the ambit of national law or concern.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The major impacts are that such workers have effectively no rights at all and no legal framework whatever to protect their interests. They are entirely at the mercy of shipowners. Virtually no nation will let such a crew disembark on any but the most temporary basis. No claim for asylum or relief of mistreatment is generally recognised.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result at this point, which is fairly well documented, is that horrific abuses are perpetrated against vulnerable seafarers. There are many examples of crews not being paid. They may be mistreated, denied food or denied adequate food. They may be beaten, raped or otherwise physically abused. They are, sometimes, killed.

         keepers of official records. All power and all appeal is in the hands of the perpetrators of abuse. At the very least, an outcome is understaffing, with the consequent loss of safety for not only the ship but also other ships and the environment.

        One of the few things that prevent Australian flag ships from the pressure to behave in the same manner or absorb the competitive penalties from behaving more responsibly is the act which this bill seeks to repeal—the International Shipping (Australian&amp;hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act. These grants for seafarers recognise that providing crew conditions and staffing levels adequate for safety and ship maintenance, and the pressure of paying seafarers their wages, costs money. Until there are international standards for seafarers, and they are enforced generally on a multinational basis—the ILO standards exist but are rarely enforced—national action is the only alternative. National action needs to go beyond imposing costs on Australian industry and provide some measure to reduce the competitive penalty of acting responsibly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In our deregulated world, the only means to do this is by some measure of support for those who do act responsibly and in accordance with Australian standards. An alternative that should be looked at is to put a fee or charge on all incoming ships for inspection as to conditions and treatment of crew, payment of wages and whether the staff levels are, in fact, sufficient to run the ship safely. This would be parallel to physical inspection of ships for safety.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is unconscionable to simply ignore what are effectively human rights abuses or an inability for ships which enter our ports to operate safely. If conditions were adequate by Australian standards, a large portion of the fee could be refunded. Where they were not, action might be taken, but at least the major part of the fee would be retained to offset an ongoing support for Australian crew.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The safety issue, aside from the physical maintenance of ships, is significant. Commercial ships on automatic pilots can easily run over small ships, aside from their inability to actually see physical signs of danger, or water breaking on rocks or reefs. Where crew levels

These, of course, can be seen or heard from the deck if there are a few crew members on deck watch.

        Shipping grants is one of the other issues here. They are for new or extensively modified ships to assist with equipment, allowing a safe reduction of crew. Much of this is automated equipment, allowing a worker to safely work alone, or nearly alone. In the existing legislation, the shipping grants were intended to be phased out in 1997. This cuts it out a year earlier, but consequences for industry of having the time lines changed are economically significant. Plans and contracts for construction of major ships is a lengthy process. Changing funding frameworks with little warning creates problems. The minority report of the legislative committee highlights this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government amendments also recognise this, but do not address the real problem, which is that plans and arrangements were made several years ago on the basis that the grants would run throughout the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 financial year, rather than stopping approximately six months ago. This depends on the quality of the equipment, but also provides little safety margin for equipment failure, if

        Where automation is in the form of alarms on depth sounders or radar, the assumption is not only that the machine is on and working, but that it is capable of picking up images. Wooden ships with non&amp;hyphen;aluminium spars are notoriously bad radar targets. A crew member on watch may alert the helm and narrowly avert an accident. An alarm that does not see the ship will not.

        I have been given instructions by one of my staffers, Dhanu, that in his personal experience freighters and tankers frequently go on autopilot and do not detect something that could be a 95&amp;hyphen;foot, three&amp;hyphen;masted, aluminium sparred ship of substantial size—he was talking about something of 120 tonnes. During three years sailing, he said he just avoided collision at least five times, under clear weather conditions and in spite of hailing by voice, bells, signal lights and radio on emergency frequencies. In one instance, they narrowly averted collision with a large tanker which passed by at speed within 10 feet of them. This was in the Straits of Malacca, a heavily travelled, narrow, busy seaway where it would be expected that extra attention should be given due to the large number of risks and frequency of accidents.

        The government amendments recognise the basic truth that, where an agreement has already been made to construct a ship, it is simply unfair to alter the economic conditions under which such an agreement was made. Any agreement covered by the government amendments would have been made in the expectation that the shipping grants would continue until the end of June 1997. The Senate has virtually always voted to remedy a situation where executive government seeks to impose costs on industries, where there has been an extensive forward commercial arrangement, through legislative change of the conditions under which such arrangements were made.

        We have looked at the Democrats second reading amendments, but they may be a way of allowing the indefensible. Without the Democrats' support, this bill may have died, although, of course, I am in no way speaking for the other Independent senators. I am not sure what will be achieved by the seeking of a statutory working party, because these committees almost universally push for economic deregulation and the nature of the committees is, of course, very important. The terms of reference of the working party do still reflect a rationalist approach and are intended to pursue the competitive agenda. This would work against the situation of seafarers and is likely to work against both human and environmental safety. The terms of reference may allow the bill to get support.

I often think that if any industry benefits from utilising flag of convenience or lower standards of shipping, perhaps the outcome should be that those particular industries or companies end up bearing part of the cost if their choice to reduce the standard of shipping results in a dreadful maritime disaster. A liability regime is a much more sensible way to go.

I also concur with the Australian Labor Party's comments on this earlier in the day. As a Tasmanian, I have a particular interest in the bounty because it affects Incat, which is a large modern industrial operation by Tasmanian standards, if not by world standards. It employs over 1,000 people and has a very vigorous training program for skilling people into the work force at a time when this government is removing many training programs which would otherwise skill people.

It is not like the big old industries dependent on secret subsidised hydro-electric contracts, on subsidised demolition of forests or on the digging up of mines—all of which seem to have their headquarters on the mainland and disburse their profits immediately out of the state.

        What has been talked about here is the government penny&amp;hyphen;pinching to the point of reneging by one year on a bounty scheme which is very important to Bob Clifford's operation and to the welfare of this industry. Tasmania has, along with Western Australia, taken a world lead in the production of high&amp;hyphen;speed catamaran shipping, which is a very vigorous industry in this day of much altered shipping profile around the world. We know that the allegiance of shipbuilders has its limitations, that they are looking at places like China to expand in the future or to transfer operations if the going gets too tough in Australia. We know that when it comes to the payment of labour and so on we simply cannot compete with places like China.

        It is a bit of a rough end of the stick for this government to suddenly cut the bounty, a year before it was due to be phased out, on this shipbuilding operation in Tasmania. It will mean a 15 per cent increase in price on the average ship coming out of that shipbuilding facility in Tasmania. At the moment, one catamaran—80 metres or more in length—comes out of the slips every eight or 10 weeks. The price of those goes up by 15 per cent, or $5 million. It makes it much more difficult to sell them on the world market where there is competition, from European shipbuilders in particular. So it does make a real difference, particularly when the companies built the past government's commitment on this into their future sales program.

I have not heard him contributing very much to the defence of Tasmania's environmental well being, the major natural asset of the island these days in generating jobs and business. I do not think he is particularly forward in defending Green ideals.

That is why I find it very difficult—I cannot refer to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson—to understand why Tasmanian representatives opposite are not standing and defending the Tasmanian interest against this piece of legislation. If they were, this legislation would not get through. The second component of this is—

There are issues that have some similarities. However, the bounties that are delivered to people such as Bob Clifford of mInCat in Tasmania and Austal Ships and Oceanfast in Western Australia relate to a different piece of legislation and are not actually relevant to this piece of legislation. That is for the information of the Senate. There is a standing order on relevance.

         The subsidy that goes to seafarers in Australian waters is being cut by this piece of legislation. It is a subsidy that is roughly equivalent to reimbursing the employers with the amount that their employees are taxed, as far as taxation is concerned. It is a pretty vital subsidy because it ensures that we have maximum opportunity to employ Australian sea farers and to keep Australian interest in shipping around our coasts and elsewhere.

        A fortnight ago the workplace relations bill went through this place. That legislation cut the ability of maritime unions to come to the defence of people who float into Australian ports on ships of shame that are in appalling conditions and owned under flags of convenience elsewhere. We know that those conditions range from subsistence levels on board ships and people not being paid for months or even years on end to the extraordinary physical abuse of seafarers to the point where some who have stuck up for their rights have disappeared overboard overnight—an appalling situation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's legislation, supported by the Australian Democrats as it was, on that occasion cut the muscle of unions in Australia to go to the defence of these unfortunate seafarers coming into our waters. This piece of legislation cuts the muscle of employers of seafarers in Australia to be able to maximise their opportunity to keep Australians in those jobs under standards that we would accept as being reasonable in this day and age.

        There is no doubt that the employment levels on shipping around Australia have dropped to internationally acceptable levels. There is no doubt that the standards of work conditions of Australian seafarers are better than those of a great number of ships floating into our ports. There is no doubt that in the absence of international arrangements we are doing the right thing by subsidising and fostering seafarers' welfare through the existing legislation.

        I oppose a change to that legislation which is simply going to flow on to an increase of the number of ships of shame coming into our ports, the advantage that they have and the subsistence conditions that they allow people to work under. At the same time, that change will cut out the potential to employ Australians to work the ships on our coastline under proper conditions.

        Finally, I would like to reiterate what Senator Schacht said this morning in this place. In relation to the environment and the economy, you would think that the government would back shipping around Australia.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Whichever way you look at it, it is a cheaper form of transport for cargo. But, environmentally, in terms of contributions to greenhouse gases, as Senator Schacht said, it is a far superior way of transporting cargo than rail, which in turn is a far superior method than road transport.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What is this government doing? It is subsidising road transport to the teeth, it is removing government assistance to rail and it is abolishing government assistance to sea transport. For a government that beats its chest about having a concern for the environment, it is going exactly the wrong way. For those reasons, I oppose the legislation and I will be supporting the Greens amendments.

I want to pick up one point that Senator Schacht made in relation to an issue which I think would be of interest to many Australians. He said that it would undermine Australia's defence preparedness. It is a point that his colleague Senator Bob Collins made in the Senate committee. The Royal Australian Navy clearly does discuss these matters with the merchant marine, but the reality of the Australian shipping fleet these days is that it is made up mostly of bulk carriers and the sorts of ships that the RAN would require in a defence emergency or conflict are basically cargo handling ships.

         —The RAN's advice is that those ships are not suitable for their requirements. The RAN have recently acquired two second-hand support ships from the United States Navy. This recognises their need to be self-sufficient, the changing nature of the Australian fleet and the fact that much of that fleet is not suitable for defence emergency uses. In the government's view, the suggestion that the withdrawal of these grant schemes will adversely affect Australia's defence capability is a furphy.

         failure. In spite of the hundreds of millions of dollars that have gone into this scheme over the past few years on the promise that that would encourage greater productivity and reform within Australian shipping—which is vital to this nation—it has failed simply because the MUA in particular has always held out promises in relation to the deals given to it by the previous government. The Labor government handed over the money and, of course, the promises of reforms and productivity gains that were made as part of those deals were illusory; they were withdrawn once the cheque had arrived in the mail. The coalition government believes a different approach should be taken because the previous government's approach failed. The Democrat amendment to remove proposed sections 1 and 2 of the bill would basically ensure that the status quo remained.

        I do not know whether this has been indicated to Senator Margetts and Senator Brown, but the coalition is quite happy with and prepared to agree to the second reading amendment. We believe that at part (a) the amendment is broadly compatible with the actions already undertaken by the government. The coalition, in its shipping policy, is committed to increasing international action towards greater levels of compliance with international safety and shipping standards.

        Part (b) is also broadly compatible with the government's commitment to environmental protection. The proposal to pursue compensation for pollution and the proposed actions to be taken to address human rights violations are compatible with the general principle that the polluter or violator pays. So we are happy to support that. Part (c) proposes an annual report that, as far as we are concerned, would not impose an unreasonable demand upon the government; we are also happy to support that.

          —The government amendment to this bill was originally provided in the form of a request for amendment. This reflected one of the theories put forward by the government drafters that an amendment which modifies a reduction in expenditure requires a request.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not, however, the practice followed by the Senate in the past. A request has been required only if the amendment would add to expenditure by comparison with the status quo. Where a bill would reduce expenditure and an amendment would limit the reduction, but not increase expenditure under the status quo, such an amount has been treated as not requiring a request. The rationale for this is that the relevant constitutional provision, the third paragraph of section 53, refers to an amendment which would increase a proposed charge or burden on the people and clearly does not relate to an amendment which merely limits a proposed reduction of existing expenditure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Senate has not accepted the contrary theory of the government drafters. The application and interpretation of the constitutional provision was recently reported on by the Procedure Committee. Under the recommendations of the committee, this amendment would not be a request. It should be noted that the amendment would also not be a request under the recommendations of the House of Representatives committee which considered the application of section 53. The proposed request for amendment has therefore been treated as an amendment.

They were happy to say that they still oppose it and they wished to see the Senate take action on this. I think that is what many of us would like to see happen today. I certainly hope the majority of the Senate oppose this schedule, which, as many of us have talked about, will make it more and more difficult to maintain decent standards of crewing levels, training and so on around Australian waters. I think it ought to be supported.

         —It should be on the record that the government will be opposing this amendment. The effect of the amendment is to destroy the government's policy on this. In relation to employment, the situation in other parts of the world is clearly that the potential mentioned by Senator Margetts does not need to be realised. In fact, the position in New Zealand is that total employment in coastal shipping has actually gone up as a result of similar sorts of reforms.

        I really wanted to make the point that there are three schedules in the bill. The two that this amendment will delete will basically destroy the entire bill and it is tantamount to voting against the whole bill.

        In a country in which we are lucky enough to be a continent of our own, we would have thought that it would have been a high priority of the new government to maintain seafarer employment—a growing maritime industry in Australia—in Australian shipowners' names. I believe that that is why the industry is so strongly opposed to this measure that the new government has introduced and that is why we will be strongly supporting Senator Murray's amendment to leave those arrangements in place.

        This amendment restores the entitlement to a grant under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to those Australian shipowners who already had ships on order when the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill was introduced into parliament on 1 May 1996. This entitlement is subject to the ships concerned meeting the eligibility criteria of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act and being commissioned and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997.

         I remind the Senate of the existing sunset provision in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act which would have terminated access to the scheme on 30 June next year anyway. In proposing this amendment, the government recognises the concerns raised in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee over the effect of the legislation on the three ships under construction and scheduled to be commissioned before 30 June 1997.

         —Obviously, the opposition will be supporting this amendment. This amendment is a government backdown. The government realised when they first introduced this legislation back in May of this year that they had made a classic error; they were discriminating against three ships that were already on order—one by BHP, one by Shell and one by Mackay Sugar.

        This amendment is now being put by the government to allow these three ships to claim support. It is quite reasonable to speculate that this is happening not only because of the opposition and the outcry in the industry about what would have been very unfair treatment but also because of some elements of the National Party, particularly Senator Boswell. I suspect this is a victory for him. To get this through, he probably jumped up and down and danced on the throat of his own minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp).

        The fact that three ships already on order and under construction would have lost eligibility for the ships grant shows you the lunacy and the idiocy of the initial proposal. Our only difficulty and our only disappointment is that, when the government was having its fingers stomped on by Senator Boswell—metaphorically that is—to restore eligibility for the grant to the Mackay Sugar ship, it did not realise that, with this bill, it had put before us a very misguided measure that would punish both the company side and the seafarers' side of the Australian maritime shipping industry. We will support the amendment, but the amendment shows that this whole measure was ill conceived right from the beginning.

         —Thank you. What became very clear early on in this inquiry was that the government, fuelled by excessive zeal from Treasury, had in fact overreached itself. It had imposed a penalty on BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar—the three Australian companies that have been mentioned. If such a thing existed as a contract between the private sector and the government, the government explicitly broke that contract. It did so by dishonouring undertakings that had been previously given for the construction of these three vessels.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When the three companies—BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar—let the contracts to their foreign yards in the Netherlands and in the Republic of Korea for these vessels, they let them on the understanding that the ships capital grants scheme would apply. The basis on which they could afford those contracts in the first place was that that provision would stand. What the government proposed by its original bill was to dishonour those contracts and visit on those three companies a significant financial penalty. It did so in the name of budget savings.

        On this occasion we have seen internal considerations within the coalition. My colleague Senator Schacht has referred to the role of the National Party in this. Certainly, press reports would strongly support what Senator Schacht has said. I am not entirely sure whether Senator Boswell was the leader of the charge, but certainly press reports would support the role of the National Party in this.

I would hope that the government, in being sensible on this matter, would exhibit the same degree of commonsense on the other bills as well.

        In one sense this principle is meting out a financial penalty on Australian industry, but in a very real sense it is taking jobs off Australians. The interesting thing here is, of course, that the government is going to pay a subsidy for the construction of ships to be built in foreign shipyards. In the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the government is removing a payment for ships constructed in Australian shipyards. While I strongly support the amendment that is being put to the government; nonetheless, a bill that is in the list will penalise Australian shipbuilders while this amendment will advantage foreign shipbuilders. I just think there is something rotten in the state of industry policy when that type of situation applies.

        I am pleased that on this occasion the Senate committee's role in uncovering what was a serious penalty to be imposed on Australian industry worked and that the committee played an important part in changing the government's mind. I hope that remains true and I hope the principle the government is adopting in this amendment, which we support, it will adopt when those other pieces of legislation come before this Senate. If it does not, we will certainly remind the government of it. Certainly, I expect that industry will too because, as I have said, jobs are at risk. Those jobs are in Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia in the shipbuilding industry. In this case, these jobs are in the Netherlands and in South Korea. I support the amendment.

        What happened was that Ron, as usual when he could not get his own way inside the government, came to us and we gave him the assistance he needed. I am not sure whether the National Party really ought to shift across. Where it sits at the moment, it really is in grave danger of either totally betraying the people it represents or having the whole time to get people on the other side to do its work for it.

However, we were glad to do it because we saw the sense in this and we saw the absolute nonsense of what was being proposed by the government, to betray once again the value adding to a rural industry, which is represented by particularly the ship which Mackay Sugar had put in place, a very high-tech piece of equipment that will be involved in value adding to the product on the high seas. I am not sure what that does for Australian workers, but I guess as long as they are Australian seamen that certainly is to be commended.

        We support this particular amendment. The tragedy for me is, however, that there are so many other good measures undertaken by the former government which assist in value adding to primary products, assist in providing rural development and assist in providing regional jobs. Unfortunately, Senator Boswell has not been able to jump hard enough to get some of those changed. I mention things like the ethanol bounty, which has gone out the door, and taxation assistance for farmer cooperatives. Can you think of a worse proposition than taking away from the farming cooperatives the tax incentive which enables them to be competitive in a cut&amp;hyphen;throat

        I think I am saying to Senator Boswell: you had better get your jumping boots on because you have still got some more work to do in helping rural industry, particularly the value adding part of rural industry, and if you cannot achieve it then you had better come and see us again. I guess, in the end, you had better come and cross over because that might be the only way you can rescue yourselves and the farming sector as well.

         —I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition. This is a very flimsy bill. There are three pages in total, and that is symbolic of this government's commitment to vocational education and training. It is practically non&amp;hyphen;existent. We should not be surprised by this, nor should we be fooled by it because the impact of this bill is quite dramatic. Those three pages reflect the impact of two budget decisions which will fall heavily on the TAFE sector: the elimination of the five per cent real growth provided by the previous Labor government and the imposition of a five per cent efficiency dividend on TAFE funding.

        This bill amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992, which provides the bulk of funding for vocational education, to increase funding by $13.4 million in the first year, 1996, but to reduce it by $58.6 million in 1997. The change for 1996 simply reflects the impact of price changes. However, the adjustment for 1997 reflects the net impact of the budget decisions to which I have referred.

        Examination of this legislation gives us a clearer picture of what the government really has in mind for vocational education and training. Stripped of the rhetoric, we notice that the two budget measures reflected in this bill cut vocational education funding by $91 million and $66 million respectively over the four years of the forward estimates. This,
        <break page="6385" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         together with other savings measures such as the cuts to the Australian National Training Authority, well and truly exceeds the additional funding available through the so&amp;hyphen;called modern Australian apprenticeship and training system. In addition to that, massive cuts are being made to labour market programs which will have a major impact on the TAFE colleges, not to mention the impact on the chances of unemployed people acquiring the necessary skills to obtain a job.

        Before the election, we heard from the coalition endless assurances about the future of TAFE. We were told that under the coalition's policy, as detailed by statements made in its schools and TAFE policy document, a Howard government would:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . continue to support a strong and effective TAFE sector, that is, the publicly funded network of TAFE institutions and the thousands of students and teachers involved in the system.

        The same document notes this commitment:

        . . . ensure that the network of TAFE institutions, especially in rural areas and regional centres, will not be undermined.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, it states that a coalition government would do this:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . in conjunction with the States and Territories develop a National Plan for TAFE.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does not take long to work out the difference an election makes. What news did the budget bring for TAFE? The news was almost uniformly bad. TAFE is being expected to absorb an even bigger efficiency dividend than other recipients of Commonwealth own purpose outlays and specific purpose payments. The burden on TAFE is five per cent from the first year, while the general impost is three per cent in the first year and an additional one per cent applied cumulatively for each succeeding year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result of this funding cut will be felt both in recurrent and capital activities. It is likely that funds made available to ANTA for national projects will be halved, while interstate cooperation projects will cease altogether. National projects include research and evaluation, training, market development, some equity measures and curriculum development.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The rationale for all these changes to interstate cooperative projects and various other things is that they ought to be funded under bilateral agreements between the states. Regardless of whether it can be argued that there is no justification for special funding for projects which cross state borders, it is nevertheless possible, even probable, that alternative funding will not be found for some projects and that some worthwhile activities will cease.

         The wide area learning project, for example, which is a joint New South Wales-Queensland venture, involves the delivery of services to isolated and disadvantaged communities with little or no previous access to further education and training. The Wali Palyantjaku Building Houses project in South Australia provides training in the building industry for Aboriginal communities living in remote areas. It is another example of a project the funding for which will stop altogether. There will also be cuts in capital funding, with a significant fall from $227.644 million in 1996 to $200 million in 1997. This is the government's so&amp;hyphen;called commitment to TAFE at work at the grassroots level.

         This government would have us believe that it has embarked on a revolutionary form of vocational education and that not one useful initiative happened before 2 March 1996. It is very interesting to note that the minister has yet again provided the usual divergence. He put out a press release today repackaging all the budget measures in such a way as to make it appear that there is something new. It was a very transparent device to take public attention away from the discussion in the Senate here today. The same pattern has emerged time and again.

         The reality is that education was a high priority under Labor during the entire 13 years of Labor government. Major policy development in vocational education and training has taken place, particularly since 1990, when the Commonwealth moved towards assuming a greater role in ensuring the coordinated development of our national vocational education and training schemes. Labor's policy development and national leadership were underpinned by the provision
         <break page="6386" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of sufficient funds to meet the stated goals. Labor put its money where its mouth was. Labor committed $1.65 billion in growth funds to the VET sector between 1992 and 1997. That was designed to generate an additional 792,000 places in vocational education and training. During its period in office, the Labor government provided a 56 per cent real increase in funding for TAFE and other forms of vocational education and training.

        <para first-indent="16">
         At the time of the change of government, a range of activities was already under way. There was a broad national framework and agreement on how the Australian vocational training system should be progressed. A major body of work was being undertaken under the auspices of ANTA to develop courses and curricula to make them consistent with Australian vocational training scheme principles. It was about developing a competency base and a more flexible set of arrangements so that courses could be more flexibly delivered in contexts other than the traditional college environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Contrary to what the current government would have us believe, the needs of schools in the provision of vocational education received a significant amount of attention. The Labor government committed $38 million to the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, which was designed to support initiatives to provide vocational education and work experience for school students. The jobs pathway guarantee was designed to assist young people's transition from school to work. On the basis of these programs and others, the number of schools with year 12 retention rates grew to well over 70 per cent. Most of these students were not necessarily destined for university. These schools have an important role to play in the delivery of vocational education. We support the proposal to earmark $20 million per year in ANTA funds for use by schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are also supportive of moves to try to rationalise the whole system of course recognition and the relationship of course with competency standards developed by the national training bodies, or so-called ITABS. It is envisaged that the ITABS will have a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          greater role not only in the development of standards but also in other areas of curriculum development.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A major potential problem with the government's approach, however, lies in its faith in the user&amp;hyphen;choice concept. This is the market based approach rearing its ugly head yet again. It is based on the notion that training will be far more relevant if it is more closely attuned to industry needs. When taken too far, however, with industry too much in charge of the direction, we could end up with training that is specific to particular firms. Our vocational education and training system must retain the capacity to provide broad generic competencies that have application across a range of jobs and pathways. It should ensure that workers have skills that are transferable between jobs and not specific to any one job or, more especially, any one firm.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We will be watching the development of the policy framework to ensure that suitable safeguards prevent a situation where public funds provided for vocational education and training end up being just another kind of industry subsidy. That is an important issue, particularly as firms wind back their commitment to training their employees.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also like to address the way in which the massive cuts to labour market programs have been interacting with other vocational education and training. A report in the

         I might indicate that the opposition is truly very disturbed about the manner in which this government is pressing about with its educational policies. As with so many educational areas, the coalition seems intent upon winding back the Commonwealth's national leadership role.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As far as we are concerned, education had a much higher priority during the 13 years of Labor government than this government is prepared to acknowledge. This government has quite deliberately sought, through its budget policies, to reduce its financial commitment to the education and training sector within overall government initiatives. What we are seeing here is an attempt being made by this government to undermine the major policy development that was undertaken by Labor, particularly since 1990 when the Commonwealth moved towards assuming a much greater role in ensuring the coordinated development of our national vocational education and training scheme.

         National leadership was what underpinned that policy development. It was underpinned further by a commitment of $1.65 billion in growth funds to the VET sector between 1992 and 1997. It was designed to generate an

         —The Australian Democrats echo many of the concerns that have been put forward today by the opposition and by Senator Carr. Indeed, it is rather a black week for education and training in this place. Earlier today we saw regressive changes to schools policy and funding passed by the Senate in the guise of more choice for parents, but what we are seeing in actuality is a continuation by this government of a shift of public funds to the private sector. I hope that is something we will not see in this place next week when we deliberate changes to the higher education sector which, again, represent cuts to education funding in this nation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill before us today amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act and it changes the legislated funding levels for ANTA in 1996, 1997 and 1998. I note that the increase in ANTA funding for 1996 is around $13.4 million. Of course, the Australian Democrats support that increase. It is apparently a supplement to the already legislated funding level and, I believe, reflects the increase in average weekly earnings and general inflationary pressures.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, if we go on, we see that massive cuts will be taking place in ANTA's funding in 1997 and 1998. This government has decided to cut funding for ANTA in 1997 by close to $57.5 million. I note that this cut will pretty well be retained into the following year, 1998. Those cuts give us great reason to question this government's commitment to vocational education and training in this
        <break page="6388" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         country—to question its commitment to that sector, along with the other sectors such as primary and secondary education and higher education, which have already faced substantial funding cuts.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In fact, we find it very difficult to understand why this government would seek to make such cuts in 1997, virtually retaining this cut into 1998, when something like 8.7 per cent of Australians are still without a job. Cutting funding for vocational education and training at a time when we are confronted with high employment levels, with especially high levels of youth unemployment, in this country does not make sense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I understand it, the $57.5 million that will be cut from ANTA in 1997 consists basically of a five per cent efficiency dividend. That jargon is something we are hearing increasingly from this government—the notion of an efficiency dividend. It is being applied to TAFE and, of course, there is also the elimination of the five per cent growth in ANTA funding which was introduced by the previous government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I should add that the Democrats played an important role in ensuring that the ANTA legislation was passed by the previous government in 1992. We promised then to hold them accountable when it came to ensuring that there were sufficient funds allocated for vocational education and training in this country. We intend to do the same with this government as well. I am only sorry, as I say, to see that they are cutting those funds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What exactly does this government mean by an efficiency dividend? Is it really a genuine incentive and a viable tool for encouraging unruly departments to increase their productivity by perhaps increasing their efficiency levels, or is it just another nice piece of jargon to justify cutting public expenditure? In this case, I am not quite sure. That leads me to a further question. Is it reasonable to expect that five per cent worth of inefficiencies in the area of vocational education and training are actually there to be found and to be cut when, as I said, so many Australians are out of work?
