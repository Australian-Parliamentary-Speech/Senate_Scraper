        With respect to the remainder of schedule 5 awards, the transitional provisions are the provisions which demonstrate the greatest breach of promise by Mr Howard. Mr Howard said that no worker would be worse off under this industrial relations policy. Even more explicitly, on 6 October, he told the Freight Congress:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . no worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her award conditions taken away.
        <break page="5374" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        This is precisely what these transitional provisions do. In 18 months time, all award conditions outside the 20 allowable matters or any exceptional matters will be abolished by these provisions. Employees will have to bargain during that period just to preserve their existing entitlements. Where this is not achieved, employees will lose entitlements and will be unambiguously worse off.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are very surprised that the Democrats have agreed to these provisions. Senator Murray, in his Senate report on page 333, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's `sudden death' solution of deleting a wide range of award conditions in 18 months would breach the clear commitment of the Prime Minister in the lead up to the election when he clearly stated that . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Murray then quoted Mr Howard in the Freight Congress speech. Now we see the Democrats actively supporting the government in breaching this commitment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So we oppose the transitional provisions outright. The sudden death approach to award simplification is wrong—the commission should be allowed to continue its job of simplifying awards. Given the change in the Democrats' position about this matter, we are not hopeful of succeeding in repealing the transitional provisions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have circulated two amendments to the transitional provisions which I would call on the Democrats to support. The first, on sheet 226, ensures that existing paid rates awards are not subject to the sudden death award simplification process. Given Senator Murray's comments about the harshness of that solution and the Democrats' alleged commitment to workers who rely on paid rates awards—like nurses and teachers—I would be surprised is the Democrats do not support this amendment. If Senator Murray says that the provisions he has agreed to will do this anyway, he is incorrect. As drafted, the only paid rates awards exempted from the transitional provisions are those made in future under section 170MX(3).
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second amendment, on sheet 227, provides that consent awards are not subject to the sudden death solution. The deal provides that this is the case during the period
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the award was stated to be in effect. But consent awards continue in effect beyond that time, and should be free from award simplification for their effective life, not just their normal life.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, I call on the Democrats to join with us in protecting the interests of all those employees, particularly those in the retail sector, who work under consent awards and who do not deserve to be worse off as a result of this legislation.

The opposition has put forward this amendment in an attempt to rectify what we see as a serious flaw in the government-Democrat agreement and the amendments that have arisen from it.

        Senator Sherry referred to the problem for vast numbers of retail industry employees covered by consent awards who, if amendment No. 30 goes ahead, will still be penalised because they entered into the enterprise bargaining process early by general industry standards and they undertook the choice—often the employer's choice—to ratify an

       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to these consent awards there are two problems. With the proposed legislative regime, consent awards will not continue. In the future there will be no such thing as a consent award. One of the problems faced by workers currently covered by consent awards is included in amendment No. 30 as it stands. Only one of the problems highlighted during our inquiry has been rectified and another one has not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first of the problems was, under the original bill, those awards could be simplified by the sudden death provisions within 18 months despite the term of the agreement. In some cases the term of the agreement is around four years. Amendment No. 30 has dealt with that problem and introduced a provision which says, essentially, that for those workers their agreement cannot be reduced until the term of the agreement expires.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a fundamental problem which is going to be faced by retail workers—many of whom are not in a great bargaining position and are young women who face large corporations such as Coles Myers. At the expiry time, they are going to be at a significant disadvantage because, unlike certified agreements, the employer can allow the agreement to be minimised as would any award.

        Senator Murray would recall that there are many provisions included in these consent awards which may not come under allowable matters even though they have been improved to some extent with the agreement between the Democrats and the government. They include things such as health and safety provisions, rostered day off provisions and provisions for part-time workers in the retail industry which provide protection—they will no longer be allowable matters under awards.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to remind Senator Murray of one of those—and there was clear evidence of this put before the committee—that is, the case of part-time workers in the retail industry being worked for 37 hours per week so that their employer could avoid the obligation of providing a rostered day off. Protections against those sorts of things will not survive

        I would like to acknowledge that, arising out of the committee inquiry process, Senator Murray for the Democrats supported the general principle that agreements should not be terminated at their expiry time and should continue. The majority of the committee found that `it was far more orderly and convenient for agreements once made to continue until amended by later agreement or by order of the commission'. This will not be the case with respect to current consent awards. They will be able to be reduced down to 20 allowable matters.

        I commend the Democrats for their success with the government in rectifying the situation in relation to certified agreements, but I call on the Democrats to support the opposition in relation to consent awards, which are essentially the same as certified agreements. I challenge some people to go back and look at some of the transcripts for the arguments put in cases before the commission that awards should be processed as consent awards. In many cases it was the employer's choice that they be consent awards rather than certified agreements.

        I would like to highlight the magnitude that this seemingly small problem will have for some of Australia's largest industries and largest employers—and these were included in the SDA's submission in appendix I—that are currently under consent awards, which will be able to be minimised even under amendment No. 30 at their nominal expiry date. I refer to companies like BBC Hardware, Bi&amp;hyphen;Lo, Coles supermarkets, Dulux, McDonalds, Franklins, Harris Scarse Ltd, KFC, K-Mart, Myer Grace Bros., Pizza Haven, Pizza Hut, Safeway, Harry Heaths, Hungry Jacks, Target, Woolworths and World 4 Kids.

        Now, in relation to some of the other amendments, I have heard some interesting excuses as to why we could not have equal remuneration, rather than equal pay, and why we could not deal with the particular problems in respect to outworkers in regard to right of entry and how the additional matter in the 20 allowable matters will mean very little if the union cannot not get right of entry to the distributors in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. I am interested to hear what the excuse is for clearly dealing only with part of the problem.

        Consent rewards, which reflect enterprise bargaining agreements, will be able to be reduced to 20 allowable matter type awards at the expiry date of the agreement.

        The new transitional arrangements differ from the old in several respects. It allows for consent awards made under enterprise bargaining principles to continue to their expiry. It allows for exceptional matters order. It amended items 43, 44 and 45 to provide more protection of paid rates employees. It adds two new criteria to the award simplification process. It adds a new item 45A in relation to the State awards. It adds a new item dealing with junior rates, 47(2). It allows the completion of Victorian 111(1A) applications. And, it amends item 43 to make it clear that employers must seek to reach agreement on the treatment of non-allowable matters before seeking to amend their awards.

        What I want to talk about is in more general terms the award simplification process. The Democrats strongly support the maintenance of the award system. It is a system which, when running well, suits both employees and employers, particularly small employers, in providing a ready reference as to the state of the labour market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But awards are immensely cumbersome documents. It is difficult to ask a small business employer to ensure that everything they do complies with a badly written 70 page commentary as many awards are. Badly written because each word has been haggled over and negated over decades. For almost a decade now, the AIRC has been trying to simplify and modernise awards. But, the AIRC has found it is much easier to put a clause in than to take a clause out, even a clause which has long outlived its usefulness.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Democrats believe that to maintain support for the award system, it is essential that the award system be user friendly. The situation we have at present where there is probably hardly a small business employer in the country not in technical breach of at least some overprescriptive award clause, even if they are trying to do the right thing, is ludicrous. It is crucial, basic politics. Based on independent legal advice, we have been persuaded that the list of allowable matters as amended picks up all of the important industrial conditions. This,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         then should form the basis for an accelerated and more effective award simplification process.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, there must be protections within that process. The object of this process is not to eliminate conditions, but to produce workable, effective documents that protect employees conditions but without placing excessive restrictions on employers. Five years into enterprise bargaining, as part of the evolution of the industrial relations system, now I believe is the appropriate time to review the award provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I said, we have sought to ensure that employees are protected. We have done this in several ways. First, item 43 makes it clear that the Commission cannot proceed to arbitrate on non-allowable matters until the applicant has made reasonable attempts to get agreement on both the award matter and the treatment or future regulation of the matter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, we have introduced the exceptional matters orders system to ensure that conditions that protect employees from harsh or unjust conditions can be retained.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Third, we have protections for paid rates workers, not just in the terms of their rates in items 43 and 45, but also in expanded access to arbitration under 170MX.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In short, we are persuaded that this transitional schedule offer the prospect of awards being reshaped around what independent experts tell us are the real core of the employment relationship in allowable matters, while ensuring that any other matters cannot be taken away unless the employee agrees or the Commission determined it would not be harsh or unjust. That, in our view, is a fair outcome.

It just does not make sense to me for such discrimination to be allowed to be included in the final piece of legislation. So I would like to have the government explain to the committee why it would not agree to an amendment which would then exclude that discrimination which is going to be felt by quite a large number of those amongst the most vulnerable of employees.

        I thought that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had said that he wanted to see a situation in which no employee would be worse&amp;hyphen;off as a result of this legislation.

        As Senator Collins has pointed out, the decision to go along the consent&amp;hyphen;award track—rather than the certified&amp;hyphen;agreement track—has often been determined by the wish of the employer concerned. Now we find that the government is not agreeing to an amendment that would cover that situation. I would like to hear why it is determined not to accept a reasonable proposition which would eliminate that sort of discrimination—just because an employee is now under a consent award, he or she would be discriminated against compared with the employees who are under a certified agreement.

         —In response to that, I think at least for the record I need to highlight and challenge what is obviously the department's advice that consent orders are not entirely analogous to certified agreements, because in some cases they are. I would challenge the officers of the department to actually review some of the transcripts of hearings of matters which determined whether it was possible to proceed with an enterprise bargaining agreement under an application as a consent award. That sort of review would highlight that in some cases there is very little difference, apart from the fact of the past award coverage and the employer's preference. In some cases it may even just go down to the fact of the employer's preference.

        In a sense, the approach that the commission took is that where the parties came together to the commission with an enterprise agreement and generally indicated that it was their preference that it be a consent award rather than a certified agreement, that is basically what happened. These are the people that are now going to be penalised. I heard the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) say last week that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was about agreement making. Why are we penalising those people who, several years ago, were busy agreement making? It is simply being done under what I would say is

         poor departmental advice that they are not entirely analogous. I am sorry: that excuse is not good enough.

        Apart from that, the further explanation which Senator Campbell gave—that there can be a negotiation process over the period of time—ignores the logic that the Democrats argued about why certified agreements should not be able to be terminated at their expiry date. The same logic, I am afraid, applies to consent awards. I am interested, however, in Senator Campbell's comments about unfairness: that if there is unfairness, the parties can rely on the exceptional matters. I must say that this is the first occasion on which I have heard any description of any particular circumstance which might fit into an exceptional matter. I am pleased to hear that much at least, but I still must say that it is not good enough.

        The Democrats have not responded to several requests in regard to this matter. I would have to say it will essentially be on their heads that up to 200,000 retail workers will be seriously disadvantaged in their negotiating position when they face their boss and their boss says, `Why should I? Why should I bother? If I just do nothing I can have all of these conditions removed.'

         —I want to put a question to the Democrats' representative. I would like to ask the Democrats what is wrong with in some way deeming consent awards for the purposes of their continued operation to be certified agreements? Doesn't that encourage what I believe their amendments seek to encourage—that is, collective agreements?

        For example, one union has been involved in discussions towards consent outcomes. A number of employers have suggested that that should be in the form of an award rather than a certified agreement. It seems to me strange that, by not agreeing to this amendment, the Australian Democrats may be proceeding against their preferred position.

         —I am just wondering whether part of the rationale for today's agreement to table arguments is that the embarrassing and sticky questions that are coming along as a result of the unravelling of this bill will not be able to be argued. In all of their statements ahead of time, the Democrats have said that they will be listening to the arguments in this debate and will respond and leave themselves the ability to make decisions based on the arguments. That clearly is not the case. By not actually hearing those arguments and co&amp;hyphen;arguments in the chamber, it has been proved that they have no intention at all of changing any decisions as a result of what happens in the unravelling of this bill in the committee stage.

         —So far every call we have made to the Australian Democrats to support us in improving this bill and in improving the lot of employees affected has regrettably fallen on deaf ears. This time I am again calling on the Democrats to support us in providing a measure of protection for independent contractors. These are small business people, vital to the economy of Australia, who need a range of protections.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senators will be aware that the bill repeals provisions in the existing act which give some protection to independent contractors. Independent contractors are becoming more and more common, especially in the building industry and the transport industry, but we are seeing the spread of the independent contract sector into other areas that have not been regarded as traditional.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As employers require their workers to incorporate and offer their services not as employees but as independent contractors they are invariably in a very weak bargaining position and need additional protections. We are opposed to the repeal of these existing provisions which permit the court to review contracts with independent contractors and to make orders relieving them of unfair contracts. These at very least provide an incentive to employers contracting with these people to do so on a fair basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are opposed to the repeal of the existing provisions which permit independent contractors to bring proceedings for the imposition of a penalty or for the recovery of wages under the act. Employees are able to bring these proceedings under the act and independent contractors who are, in substance, employees should have the same rights.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the need for protection of independent contractors does not end there. It has been brought to our attention, and I am sure to the attention of the government and Democrats, that independent contractors who bargain
        <break page="5381" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         collectively, including by union representation, are at risk of being prosecuted under the collusive bargaining provisions of the Trade Practices Act.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Many independent contractors are forced to incorporate. They should have the right to bargain collectively without being caught up by these collusive conduct provisions. The opposition is therefore seeking to insert a new provision into the Trade Practices Act which ensures that contracts which are wholly or principally for the performance of work—that is, the contracts of independent contractors—are not subject to the collusive bargaining provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Thus, independent contractors who bargain collectively will not be open to penalty under the Trade Practices Act.

        The existing provisions are important. They are important to prevent exploitation of individuals in circumstances where their status as an independent contractor is used by the employer to avoid obligations which would otherwise arise under an award.

         —The Democrats will support the Labor Party's amendment 57 on independent contractors. The Democrats supported the inclusion of provisions in the IR Act in 1992 to protect independent contractors against unfair contracts. This is a growing sector of the work force as increasingly employers convert employees, often in our view against their will, into so-called contractors in an effort to reduce costs.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One way of reducing costs by employers by moving employees to contractors is to avoid payment of PAYE tax. If a contractor is regarded as a business person, they fall under PPS or provisional tax, not PAYE, and that saves the employers but costs the taxpayers. I am surprised that this government and Treasurer Costello with his commitment not to stand by and see the tax system riddled and rorted has not cracked down on tax avoidance by employers forcing employees to become contractors. In seeking to abolish these provisions, the government is effectively sanctioning employers to continue to undertake these conversions by not only allowing tax avoidance to grow but by insulating employers from action by contractors for unfair contracts other than by under the very strict and difficult regime of the common law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am also surprised that the coalition is opposed to the retention of these provisions given they are largely modelled on the jurisdiction against unfair contracts introduced by the  Greiner conservative government in New South Wales in 1991 and by the very conservative Bjelke&amp;hyphen;Petersen government in 1988. The existence of provisions in industrial law to provide some protection to independent contractors is not therefore unusual.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The provisions in the IR Act in our view have not been as helpful as we had hoped. Since 1992 there have only been a handful of cases, maybe 20, under these provisions. That is hardly great comfort to the hundreds of

        In my supplementary report on the Senate inquiry I propose an alternative approach of moving the prohibition against unfair contracts to the Trade Practices Act, providing for industry codes of practice, a small claims procedure and the implementation of unconscionable conduct provisions. These sorts of provisions have worked very effectively for other small businesses such as the motor trades. Again I was disappointed that the coalition is not prepared to match its rhetoric and treat independent contractors as small businesses needing appropriate protection—that is, if they refuse to regard them as employees under the Industrial Relations Act.

        The Democrats believe that our proposal offered more protection than that provided by the cumbersome, high cost and legally difficult provisions in this act. We intend continuing to pursue those changes in the Trade Practices Act. In the interim we will vote to retain the current provisions, ensuring that independent contractors at least are afforded some legal protection from unfair contracts. For those reasons, we will be supporting the Labor Party.

        The so-called enterprise that establishes them, basically under duress by employers, is really starting to change the nature of industry.

        One example of this is what is happening in the housing sector of the construction industry. I would like to ask the government what advice specifically they took from the Housing Industry Association on the repeal of the unfair contracts provision. I would like to refer to a letter from Clarendon Homes that demands all subcontractors become proprietary limited companies. Clarendon Homes say that subcontractors should set up their own companies to `avoid union interference in the subcontract system'. In a 1991 letter, Clarendon offered to help workers set up their companies. Clarendon said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have approached a firm which specialises in the setting up of companies and secured a discounted rate of about $700 per company. You can choose your own name for your company for an extra $50. To help with the cost of setting up, Clarendon will deduct from your contract payment the $700 in three equal instalments.

       </para>
       <para>
        What sort of contract can building subcontractors be expected to sign? It just so happens that I have an example here. For $18 per hour the subcontractor gets no rostered days off, no travel allowance, no payment for public holidays, no annual leave, no sick leave, no wet weather allowance, no picnic days, no superannuation and the subcontractor must supply his or her own tools and equipment, including light power tools, to carry out and complete the said works.

More responsibility is being placed on them although they are still employees. This is acknowledged by Clarendon in the example I have just provided. Clarendon acknowledges the fact that they retain the liability for workers compensation. Their contract states, `We agree to pay your workers compensation policy.'

         —I want to say a few things about this. I am glad to see Senator Murray is  supporting the opposition and the Greens (WA) on this. I think when he does support us we ought to give him some thanks for that, because he has been getting a fair deal of stick, if I can use that expression, Senator Murray, and they are often difficult decisions to make.

        Listening to what Senator Lundy and Senator Conroy said, this is one of the big issues in this legislation. It is a problem that has been growing for years. There are cases such as the Odco case. That was a very prominent case and one you will remember. May I say just as a passing reference that it was the first case my son, Sean, ever instructed in. It was wrong, because he was on the losing side. I always thought the bench was a bit astray there.

        I understand the government's position on this. This legislation moves further along the line of industrial legislation in this country being supported more by provisions in the constitution other than that which refers to the settlement of interstate disputes. For example, it relies more on the corporations power. If you were to give independent contractors—they are vulnerable, for the reasons that have been given already—protection under this act, would that not be more consistent with the underlying constitutional bases this act will now have than has previously been the case? In other words, would not giving protection to independent contractors be more consistent with the way this act is going?

        Why is the government not taking this opportunity that is now presented to it by shifting to new bases for the legislation to look after independent contractors, who in very many cases are in identical positions to that of employees—except for very fine lines drawn, usually as a matter of evidence, trying to distinguish between employees and independent contractors.

          bill—I took advice on this, it seems like a few months ago—Senator Cook raised a question about the heads of power the bill relied on. I do not want to encourage Senator Cook to come back and have a debate on this, but he did agree with me privately that, indeed, the corporations power had been relied upon under the so-called  Brereton IR reform bill of 1993. So there is not a new head of power. That was a misconception. Senator Cooney, I do not think—I have not taken advice on this—that we would go around doing the things you want us to do just to flesh out use of that particular head of power.

        Secondly, if workers are employees, as you have described them, they would indeed be covered by the workplace relations act. A worker does not cease to be an employee merely because he or she has entered a so-called sham incorporation arrangement. On the point that Senator Conroy makes relating to this so-called hidden agenda about the revenue and undermining the PAYE tax system: it would be a fascinating conspiracy in politics if we were seeking to undermine the revenue. It is entirely counter to the entire budget strategy.

         I hope that Senator Lundy and Senator Conroy share the same concerns about the tax base, the revenue and the budget when the budget bills come on for debate tomorrow and the next few days.

        For the record, it should be noted that there has been only one government and one Treasurer in the history of Australia that has worked very, very hard to introduce a consumption tax. If you read John Edwards's exceptional biography of the former Prime Minister and Treasurer, you would believe that the former Treasurer was very committed to a consumption tax. Indeed, from my knowledge of history, he was the only Treasurer who worked very hard to introduce one. The now Treasurer (Mr Costello) has made quite clear his views about a GST.

        The only other point I want to respond to, since I have been provoked into making a

         response, is Senator Lundy's putting the case about people being forced to become incorporated. It is a shame that Senator Lundy was not here—I am sure Senator Cooney will remind her, as he was a diligent member of the select committee on the land fund bill—when we had a long debate at that stage about what we in opposition thought was a very wrong move in forcing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to be incorporated if they wanted to receive assistance from the land fund.

        This was not Clarendon Homes forcing people to be incorporated if they wanted assistance and support; this was the Australian government—the Australian Labor Party at that time—forcing probably the most disadvantaged people in the country to become incorporated if they wanted to receive assistance under that legislation. It was an act of the previous government that forced the most disadvantaged people in Australia to become incorporated if they wanted to receive assistance under that act.

        I have already incorporated my comments on these opposition amendments. Whilst we welcome the support the Australian Democrats have given us in respect of the previous amendments, I think it is the first time we have had the support of the Australian Democrats—I suspect it will be the only time—on independent contractors. It is very welcome. But the position that we have just been able to achieve, whilst it is welcome and it is good that that has occurred, is a holding operation in respect of the spread of independent contractors.

These amendments to the Trade Practices Act are very important. I understand the Democrats are not going to support them. That is a grave disappointment to us.

        Senator Murray made the point in his earlier contribution that we did not have this particular provision in our 1993 amendments. That is correct, Senator Murray, but over the last few years it has become apparent, firstly, that the so&amp;hyphen;called independent contractors are spreading and, therefore, the protection they need needs to be clearer and, secondly, the Trade Practices Act has not yet been used in this area. It seems to us, looking into the future, that it will be. So we appeal to you, Senator Murray, to change your position and support us on these amendments.

          Nos 62 and 63. The Democrats do have some sympathy with these amendments but we believe they will not achieve the objective that the ALP has for them. The objective is to ensure that valid collective bargaining by independent contractors against a single employer or employer association is not subject to the price fixing and other competition policy rules of the Trade Practices Act. We support that, but the reliance on the words `contract of service' becomes very inappropriate. On the one hand, there is no question that owner&amp;hyphen;drivers all wearing the TNT badge and all working solely for TNT should be able to bargain collectively with TNT, but somewhere along the spectrum it becomes inappropriate because, on the other hand, when roof tilers, for example, collude to set a single high inflated price for roof tiling across Sydney, it is not right. More seriously, when professionals such as doctors and lawyers on contracts of service seek to slide into these provisions to avoid the operational competition policy, it becomes wholly inappropriate. In short, I do not believe that these provisions will work or are appropriate.

        Our preferred approach is the development of industry codes of practices which might include guidelines on price. Even under the current Trade Practices Act this can be done and given an authorisation under section 88. In our discussions with the ACCC it has been made clear that the ACCC has no interest in pursuing owner&amp;hyphen;drivers or other workers working closely akin to employees, but where genuine collective bargaining slips into punitive price fixing, the ACCC is interested. I would suggest to unions and their representatives here that they pursue the authorisation of industry codes as the better approach than the amendment being sought by the ALP with its much wider implications.

I would like to draw the attention of Senator Murray and the government to this: the reality is that groups like roof tilers in states such as Western Australia are getting the very raw end of the stick and certainly are not benefiting from highly inflated collusive activities. In fact, if the collusion is there, it is not because people are bad but because, in a very competitive industry, if the law allows you to take certain actions to decrease your ongoing costs, that is what will happen. It is not because people are bad; it is because transport and building have become very competitive. The reality is that no business will be able to stand up and give their workers a fair go if it is possible under the law for them to reduce their wages and conditions. Some may, but they will find that other people who are less scrupulous will undercut them by doing the very things which the law allows.

I refer to your government's miserable proposal for an $8 a week pay rise for a minority of Australian workers. Do you recall Mr Reith saying on 25 June last year that if low paid workers receive $14 per week increase for each of the next three years, as proposed by the previous Labor government, they would still be worse off in real terms? How can your government then maintain that over the next three years a worker receiving an $8 a week increase will not be worse off in real terms?

        As we know, inflation is currently at historic low levels. What we need to achieve is a level of wage increases that will not jeopardise that low inflation environment, and that is what this proposal does. Low paid workers can have confidence that the government will not ignore their needs and circumstances. Indeed, it was, of course, open to us to range far and wide in terms of the submission we
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         made. I think you will find that we are much more generous in our approach than some others who have made submissions. We have not put in the usual ambit claim that the ACTU put in to all these sorts of applications.

        What we have done is strike a balance that does ensure that the lowest paid do have the safety net, do have the ability to get an increase irrespective of their capacity to bargain but at the same time not put at risk any of the gains that flow from low inflation. Quite clearly, to the extent that inflation starts to get out of control and causes interest rates to rise, once again you are putting job creation and current employment at risk. Our submission will propose that workers whose award rates of pay are below average weekly ordinary time earnings—approximately $670 per week—should have access to the $8 a week increase.

There will simply be a new role for the award system as an effective safety net for the low paid, and I can assure you that low paid workers will continue to achieve improvements in wages by making agreements with their employers. The ACTU's centralised approach to this particular claimant, and presumably others in the future, is not the way to go. The way the government has approached this is to strike a figure that does indeed ensure that those workers will be fully protected.

The Howard coalition government is pleased that we are able to deliver low inflation, moderate wages growth and two official drops in interest rates in such a short period of time in government.

        Members of the Labor Party want to dismiss it. I remind them of the Westpac&amp;hyphen;Melbourne Institute index published on 14 November, which said that consumer sentiment leapt 8.3 points to almost 110 points in November, hitting a five-month high, with Sydney leading the way at an index rating of over 116 points. Westpac's General Manager, Economics, Bill Evans, said the response was `remarkably strong'. That is Australians responding to good economic management. It is interesting to see that 58 per cent believed that it was a good time to buy major household items, which represents the highest degree of confidence in over two years. That is good news.

        There were two major areas of interest for both Indians and Australians and they covered coking coal and thermal coal. It was particularly pleasing for me to be there in regard to coking coal because it was just 20 years ago that I in fact signed the first contract with the Steel Authority of India for the sale of coking coal.

        Of greater importance to the Australian coking coal industry are the Indian projections that over the next five to six years they intend to increase their coking coal imports by 100 per cent, from nine million tonnes a year to 18 million tonnes a year. This is good news for the Australian coking coal industry. In respect of steaming or thermal coal, the Indian authorities made it very clear that to meet their energy demands they will need to increase their capacity by about 10,000 to

        The Indian government owned and operated Coal India supplies just over 400 million tonnes. It is worth mentioning that because it is often thought that Australia is the largest coal producer in the world. It is not, but it is certainly the largest coal exporter. While the Indian coals are low in sulfur, they are very high in ash. The opportunities it opens up for Australia are direct supply of Australian thermal coal, blending of our lower Australian coals with high ash indigenous coals, cooperation between Australia and India in the supply of technology, for example in washeries where they have no experience, and infrastructure planning. A major impediment is the size of their ports, the capacity of their ports and the participation and development of India's own coal resources. This represents major opportunities for Australian companies and of course major challenges for both India and Australia.

In fact, we are having some difficulty—Senator Bourne might have better sources, of course—in getting the details of that Malaysian court's determination.

        One of the barriers to participation is homelessness. Homeless young people are often without any family support, and the government is committed to addressing their needs and has increased assistance to them through programs such as JPET.

        There are a number of other initiatives that this government is taking to assist young people, not the least of which is tackling youth unemployment by reducing the budget deficit and creating a climate for sustained economic growth, thereby keeping pressure off interest rates, reforming industrial relations law, reducing paperwork on small business, introducing a modernised Australian apprentice and traineeship scheme, introducing the green corps and, very importantly, ensuring that young people entering the work force have the literacy and other communications skills essential for getting and keeping a job. All of those things, combined with the reintroduction of the JPET scheme, auger very well for opportunities created by this government for young Australians.

        The human rights policy is pursued on the basis that the promotion and protection of human rights serves Australia's broader national economic and security interest and that human rights are both universal and indivisible, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments.

So it is not simply a government monopoly rolling out money using taxpayers' dollars; it is doing it as part of a commercial consortium. Clearly you have to have regard for the implications of any heavy&amp;hyphen;handed intervention that might adversely affect either Optus Vision or Foxtel in that regard.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So the answer is not simply to give Telstra directions which would fundamentally cripple its capacity to compete. We do want to see people have a competitive choice. We do want to see lower prices for all of these services. We do want people to get fast access to the Internet. We do want the clever country to occur here. The best way to do that is to have competition.

        To the extent that there are commercial outcomes that can be negotiated between the players, we encourage that. Indeed, not only since the election but also even in our election commitment we said that we would

         explore all possible ways of minimising duplication. I have on a number of occasions since that time had discussions with the carriers. I have written to them.

That is the extent of our capacity to intervene in something that is well down the track, unless you take the view that somehow you do not give a damn for what has already been invested—that you are not interested in the benefits that flow from that competition. We are not in that category.

It has been reported that Telstra has proposed that both it and Optus co-construct in Adelaide by sharing Telstra's underground ducting. Sharing resources and infrastructure would ensure not only that cables are laid underground but also that the cost of duplication, which would be passed on to consumers, would be averted. I note the minister's response in relation to competitive choice and commercial arrangements. Will the minister facilitate agreement by carriers to share resources in order to protect the interests of local communities and, I might say, the choice of consumers in the matter?

        What they have done with the tiering of HECS is to place agriculture in the second tier. One of the prime things the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), in the finance summit earlier in this session of government, did was to point out the high priority for improving education to the agricultural sector in this community. What have they done? They have stuck agriculture in the second tier, making it more expensive for people in rural areas to gain agricultural expertise. That was done, of course, by a Liberal minister. Their National Party minister made the point that education is vitally important to agricultural areas.

I have to say that Senator Boswell is being absolutely consistent. I sat in the hearings with Senator Boswell who asked numerous questions of those giving evidence to the inquiry, expressing the concern of rural and regional Australia.

         The situation is that we are now beginning to see what governments in the states can and will do with competition policy. We are now beginning to see the huge amount of power that we have given to the Australian Competi tion and Consumer Commission. It is like a monster for which there is no real control at this stage. We are beginning to see questions of very narrow definition of public interest which go round in a circle and say, `The public interest is competition; therefore, the public interest is competition.' We end up with a situation where other human values in society do not get a guernsey.

        Unfortunately, at the end of that committee process, short though it was for competition policy, the response from the committee was that the committee recommends that the bill be passed without amendment. That is a real pity because we are now beginning to see in state elections all throughout the country that, where there are conservative governments, you get the ALP in those states criticising the implementation of competition policy because they can see how much damage it can have and how different it can be between perceptions of public interest, the reality—outcomes for people, for services, employment—and the impact on rural and regional Australia.

        It is time for us to revisit this. The fact that we are having this debate is at least a useful step, but we all have to admit that it was pushed through last year. In this chamber in July last year some of us thought that we should not have been pushing it through. Others thought it should not have been in that form, but the reality is it is a time bomb which will be ticking up until 1998 and, unless there are specific exemptions for federal, state and local government, that time bomb will go off in 1998. All of those areas of public service provisions—outsourcing, privatisation and so on—will occur by that date unless we as a Senate go back and look at the monster we have created, to see what the problems are before it is too late. My plea is now that we have more of these debates. Instead of attacking Senator Boswell for the way he did not vote, at least applaud him for having the guts to stand up and speak for what a lot of people are saying in the community.

If ever I saw proof of it, it was the doorstop interview done by the Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, on the diesel fuel rebate scheme. He rushed out to the side door of the ministerial wing entrance—to the great chagrin, I am told, of many regional members of the Liberal Party—and claimed the entire credit for the National Party. He said that it was a huge victory for the National Party to save the diesel fuel rebate scheme after five months of destabilising public debate when it was under real threat. So the great victory of the National Party was to protect against the Liberal Party a program which the Labor Party had kept in place in its whole 13 years of government. What a huge victory, Senator Boswell!

        But have a look at what has happened since. In response to an interjection from Senator Panizza, which was responded to by Senator Schacht, about what we did to the ABC when we were in government, I say to him that we expanded the services of the ABC. Do not be such an ignoramus! To my great chagrin, as Senator Schacht said quite correctly, programs which we funded in government to expand the services of the

         ABC in places like the Northern Territory have since been axed by this government. Go and talk to the people in the small communities in the Northern Territory who were really looking forward to getting Triple J, which we had announced and funded, but who will now not get it because the expansion program has been axed. That is one thing the National Party should not have let the Liberals get away with.

        I will tell you, Senator Boswell, the other thing the National Party should not have let them get away with—axing the BARA program, which I referred to in question time today in a question to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), who has nothing to do with this portfolio despite what he thinks.

        The business advice for rural areas program was a highly successful program that this government put into place. In an assessment that was made of the last financial year alone, it created an estimated 1,400 jobs in country Australia and set up a huge number of small businesses. I saw the work the BARA office did in the town of Katherine in the Northern Territory. It delivered great value for money. But what did this government do? It abolished it in the budget. It closed it down. A service that rural Australia once got and that measurably provided benefits is now being removed from rural Australia.

        Last Friday, the minister for aboriginal affairs, in what he himself described as a major speech outlining new directions for Aboriginal affairs in Australia, recommended the BARA scheme, the business advice in rural areas scheme, to Aboriginal Australians to help them start up small businesses so they would not be unemployed. And this is a minister of a government which axed it in the budget and closed it down. Then, when the minister went on

It was a decision the ATSIC board made to close it down.' This is straight off the top of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        For three days this nonsense has been perpetuated. The BARA scheme in fact is administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It was not a decision of the ATSIC board—how could it have been?—to close it down. It was a decision of that portfolio and its minister to close it down. To suggest, as the minister did last night, that ATSIC would divert funding into the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to keep a program going that they have lost is utter nonsense!

        You closed the BARA scheme down. You closed down the expansion of the ABC into rural Australia, and you closed down the entire department of regional development. And what did your minister say? He made the most astonishing statement out of Canberra that I, coming from regional Australia, have seen in 20 years in this business. He said there is `no rationale or constitutional basis for the Commonwealth's involvement in regional development in Australia'. That is in his press statement. Where does that statement leave the National Party?

I wish Senator Collins had listened to what I said. They left an area bigger than the size of New South Wales without basic radio services.

         The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Wool International Act 1993 to provide for changes to the fixed schedule for disposal of stockpile wool by Wool International.

         Reasons for Urgency

         The proposed amendments provide for implementation of changes to the fixed disposal schedule for stockpile wool from 1 January 1997 as recommended by the August Wool Roundtable, chaired by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and with all sectors of the wool industry joining a consensus in favour of the proposal.

         Effect if the Bill is not passed this sitting
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The decision on the changes to the fixed schedule has been taken after extensive consultation with the wool industry both domestically and internationally. If the changes are not implemented by 1 January 1997, the industry, and woolgrowers in particular, will potentially face a more depressed market due to greater quantities of stockpile wool having to be sold by Wool International in compliance with the current legislative requirements. Because of both the industry consultation process and the Roundtable consensus being public, a failure to implement the changes on time is likely to prompt strong negative reactions, particularly from growers, but also from the majority of Australia's overseas customers.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Why the amendments were not foreseen
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Amendments to the fixed schedule were initially expected to be implemented from 1 July 1997. This was the date by which Wool International had been intended to be privatised. Wool International is not now expected to be privatised but rather is to continue to manage the disposal of the stockpile.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The August Wool Roundtable recommended to the Government that the fixed disposal schedule be changed at the earliest possible date. As part of a negotiated package with a minority of processors who wanted a later implementation, a phased introduction of the changes was agreed by consensus to apply from 1 January 1997.

        By the time the Howard Government assumed office, the Native Title Act had been in operation for more than two years. In that period it became clear that there were many more problems confronting the Act than those presented by

        case. First, numerous native title claims were either ambit in nature, competing with other claims to the same `country', or were clearly unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, virtually all claims were registered by the Tribunal following the decision by O'Loughlin J. in August 1995; this provided that virtually all claims gained the `right to negotiate' but gave rise to complaint by Indigenous and other interests alike. Second, the `future act' process was unmanageable, in particular for those States with the most

Third, the process of mediation to resolve native title claims was not working; no determinations of native title had been made under the Act.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Outline of Proposed Amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996
        </emphasis>
        , and the tabling of the further Exposure Draft amendments on 17 October. Both the amendment bill and the Exposure Draft were referred for inquiry and report to the committee that I chair, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to inquire into these matters the Committee conducted fourteen days of public hearings across Australia and received numerous submissions. While many submissions criticised the Government's approach to amending the legislation, there was widespread agreement about the problems caused by various provisions of the Act. The Committee has carefully considered all of this material and it is taken into account in the report that I table today.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment bill, like the Keating Government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1995, contains proposals to overcome problems emanating from

        is proposed which would sift out those claims which are unsustainable or which would be confronted by significant obstacles were they to progress to mediation or were they to become part of `future act' negotiations. There is general acceptance of the need for a registration test from Indigenous interests and industry alike. Importantly, although unregistered claims would not qualify for the `right to negotiate' concerning development proposals, they would remain filed in the Federal Court and mediation could proceed so that the claims could be settled.

While the Tribunal appears to have been operating as well as might be expected under the Act, the legislation is in need of amendment in the interests of all parties to native title claims. In reforming the Act to provide that native title is the focus of mediation and that mediation be pursued where there is prospect of success but not otherwise, the proposed amendments to the native title mediation process are overdue.

         `future act' regime
        </emphasis>
        . Not only did the Committee hear evidence that this regime was a disincentive to development, but Indigenous people confirmed that it could be contrary to their interests as a result. The proposed amendments will allow the legitimate interests of native title holders to be protected yet minimise unnecessary delays in the negotiating process. The Committee heard evidence that it was highly desirable for the future act process to contain triggers that progressed the matter. This is achieved under the amendment proposals whereby:

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's amendment proposals contained in the Exposure Draft of 8 October cover an additional two matters—
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        . The Committee believes that ILUAs require acknowledgment and registration for the benefit of all parties; the amendment proposals are accordingly endorsed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similarly, there has been a clear need for representative bodies to be subject to a statutory regime to ensure that the needs of native title holders are met. The Committee has found that, in general, the proposed regime is desirable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In summary, then, the Committee report accepts the proposed amendments in regard to
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        This does not mean, however, that the Committee has endorsed the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 and the Exposure Draft amendments in their entirety. The Committee does not believe it desirable to consider the proposed amendment (Item 112) that would permit a pastoral lease renewal where the new lease granted more extensive interests including a perpetual term until the High Court's imminent decision in the Wik matter is handed down. The decision may well obviate the need for this amendment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Further, the Committee considers that, where a native title applicant has been denied assistance by a representative body, ATSIC should not be involved in conducting a review of the representative body's original decision (so that the Minister may determine the matter). It needs to be ensured that the confidence of native title claimants is maintained in the appeal process. For this reason the proposed amendment at Item 114ZE is recommended to be itself amended.

        Moreover, three other amendments are recommended as a result of the Committee's deliberations. They are:

        This report that I table today is the sixth prepared by the Committee; to this point the Committee has been able to arrive at consensus positions and unanimous reports. Although the Chair's draft of this report was prepared with that same objective, it has drawn a minority report from non&amp;hyphen;Government members. That is a matter for genuine regret to me as Chair.

        The committee cooperated well at public hearings and attendance was conscientious in the main.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Racial Discrimination Act 1975
        </emphasis>
        (RDA). This is a somewhat convenient approach for non&amp;hyphen;Government members to take. They did not take it in 1993 when the Native Title Act was being developed and passed through the Parliament. May I remind the Senate that, pursuant to ss.14 and 19 of the Native Title Act, native title was actually extinguished on a limited number of leases. This legislative action was contrary to the RDA but is valid as a later and specific act. What has provoked the present concern for the `primacy' of the RDA when that did not prevail only three years ago?
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Further, however, it is the majority view that the amendments currently proposed would not offend the RDA. In evidence to the Committee the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department confirmed that the `right to negotiate' under the Native Title Act is a `special measure' pursuant to s.8 of the RDA. As such it is a right not enjoyed by other Australians and may be affected by legislation without overriding the RDA. And, as I have already explained, the proposed amendment permitting pastoral lease renewals on more favourable grounds, which the Social Justice Commissioner has suggested would override the RDA, is the subject of a recommendation by the Committee that it not be considered by the Parliament until the High Court has delivered judgement in the Wik matter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Moreover, the minority report's approach to the RDA is, in principle, bad law. To purport to make all provisions amending the Native Title Act subject to the RDA is to create a further wide range of legal uncertainties. Finally, the minority report has overlooked the fact that the Native Title Act already makes an early reference to the RDA in s.7:

        In summary, the approach of the minority report to give `primacy' to the RDA is, in addition to being grossly hypocritical, addressing a problem which has not been shown to exist, is bad law, and is unnecessary. It is a sentiment that is superficially attractive, but will not bear any kind of analysis. The Prime Minister's assurance that the Government would respect the principles of the RDA

         Second
        </emphasis>
        , the minority report is critical of the proposed registration test for native title applications. It should be borne in mind that the registration test is not the doorway to mediation for claims; under the proposed amendments claims would be filed in the Federal Court and could proceed to mediation whether registered or not. Rather, registration is the threshold test for access to the `right to negotiate' regime for `future acts'.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Not all applications should have access to the `right to negotiate'. Indigenous leaders have confirmed that some native title claims are ambit claims and vexatious. For such claims to be excluded from the `right to negotiate' regime a reasonable test is required. The Government has proposed such a test in seven parts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The minority report makes the mistake of arguing that the withdrawal or restriction of the `right to negotiate' may breach the RDA. This assertion is unsustainable on several grounds:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        it has not been shown that the `right to negotiate' is a right subject to the RDA;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        the `right to negotiate' is a `special measure' which may be modified without offending the RDA; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        the `right to negotiate' cannot in any case be shown properly to apply to all claims (although that has virtually been the case as a practical fact since the decision of O'Loughlin J. in August 1995).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the threshold regime for access to the `right to negotiate' is a matter requiring judgement as to what is fair and workable, the minority report avoids serious consideration of the extent of difficulties for project development where unsubstantiated claims are involved. The majority does not seek to avoid the fact that the test is demanding; were it not so, the present circumstance where unjustifiable claims seriously hinder the `future act' process would remain. It should be remembered in this context that project developments provide real and genuine economic benefits to the local Indigenous communities. To delay projects or frustrate them from commencing is to deny Indigenous people the opportunity to share in the wealth created by such projects.

         Third
        </emphasis>
        , and in regard to mediation, the minority report is critical of the fact that the proposed s.86A concentrates mediation on native title. In the view of the minority, mediation should seek to reconcile the interests of the parties rather than concentrate on their perceived rights.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is a most questionable proposal. The National Native Title Tribunal was established in part to facilitate mediation pursuant to Part 3 of the Act;
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and the Act has as its first object the recognition and protection of native title. Where mediation ranges too far beyond the question of native title the process exceeds its proper purpose. Further, applications waiting for mediation are disadvantaged by time consuming mediation of other claims not directed towards native title. This is a most undesirable outcome from the perspective of applicants who are exercising their rights under the Act to participate in mediation

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Again, these are all matters where judgement must be exercised: the fairness of the process for native title applicants must be balanced against the rights of other Australians to the development of enterprises; the national good must also be kept in perspective. Provided that the interests of native title claimants are preserved in this process, a flexible regime that facilitates development is to be endorsed. The Government appears to have formulated amendment proposals complying with this objective that will address the current significant difficulties. The provision for indigenous land use agreements to be registered will assist this process considerably.

          The delays in setting recent quotas resulted from differences in opinion as to whether SBT stocks are recovering. Australia and New Zealand have opposed increasing the quotas, preferring the precautionary approach to managing stocks as required by the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Japan, however, has excess capacity in its fishing fleet which could be utilised to catch additional SBT quotas. The Committee supports with the continuation of the cautious approach as the consequence of getting the quotas wrong will be evident for several decades.

          Last year the Commission determined that the total allowable global catch of SBT was 11 750 tonnes. Since the introduction of national quotas Australia, New Zealand and Japan have been required to reduce their annual catch. However, when the Japanese quota was decreased, the catches of other nations then increased through reflagging or by way of Japanese/Korean company interactions. It had been was estimated that the catch by Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan which are not party to the Convention, was of the order of 3 200 tonnes in total this year.

          The subsidiary agreements provide Japanese fishing vessels with access to Australian ports as well as fishing rights within the Australian Fishing Zone. This is linked to the Commission in that it is Australia's policy that the subsidiary agreements cannot be finalised until the SBT quotas are set.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee recommends the separation of port access and the subsidiary agreements as this arrangement is not commercially satisfactory from a business perspective. A significant number of industries in Australia are dependent on Japanese companies and Japanese marketing. Although the Committee appreciates that an open port access policy is unacceptable, it believes that the Commonwealth government should investigate other mechanisms for linking port access with Australia's fisheries resource management objectives. The Committee has suggested linking this with Japan's participation in the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, CCSBT.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Under this Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna other countries cannot have access to Australian ports to facilitate their fishing activities. While this could be used to encourage countries such as Korea and Indonesia to join the Convention, the wider implications of this in terms of potential additional fishing pressures adjacent to and within the AFZ will need to be addressed by the government.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          It is imperative that Australia does not assist the capacity of other nations to fish in a manner which is detrimental to the long term sustainability of some species. Japan has already cooperated in implementing a number of environmental measures requested by the Australian government and it would not be in the Australian fishing industry's long term interest to assist countries that have not given the same undertakings.

          There are substantial mutual benefits to Australia and Japan in the subsidiary agreements. The subsidiary agreements provide the framework within which difficult issues in relation to fisheries can be contained and managed without impacting adversely on the broader bilateral relationship.

          However, the Committee is not convinced that the subsidiary agreements need to be renewed on an annual basis. There are a number of benefits outlined in this report that would support a biennial or even a five year agreement. To prevent the urgency provisions for tabling treaties from being invoked each year, the Committee recommends that the agreements run for at least two years. The Committee also believes that the current process may need to be revised to ensure that the delays experienced in signing last year's agreement do not become an annual event.

          Strong Everyone submitting evidence to the inquiry supported the concept of the subsidiary agreement, with, a number of submissions and witnesses requesting amendments or a gradual phasing out of Japanese access with progressive to facilitate Australianisation.

          In particular, the Committee now supports the extension of the exclusion zone around Tasmania to 50 nautical miles.

          The Committee is also concerned that a number of prime pelagic species are not included in subsidiary agreements.

The Committee commends the research already in progress and supports a cautious approach in managing these stocks.

          The second Agreement to be considered in this report is the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, IOTC. The formation of this Commission continues the trend to form international management regimes for highly migratory tuna species in light of their vulnerability to fishing on the high seas. The IOTC will act as a regional fisheries management organisation for major international tuna fisheries for yellowfin, skipjack, bigeye, albacore and SBT. Membership is available to Indian Ocean rim countries and countries that fish in the Indian Ocean.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          While Australia will request that the IOTC recognise the competence of the CCSBT there will be continuing pressure for the IOTC to play a role in the management of activities which will impact on SBT and other tuna stocks.

          The Committee also notes Western Australia's particular interest in the activities of the IOTC.

        In June of this year, the Committee was asked by the Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Treasurer to examine the Draft Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill. This Bill, which has not yet been introduced into Parliament, represents the second stage of the ongoing Corporations Law Simplification Program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In general terms, the Bill seeks to simplify and improve those provisions of the Corporations Law which deal with the formation of companies, company meetings, share capital, financial statements, annual returns, the deregistration of defunct companies and company names.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee notes with approval that the Bill has already been refined through a process of extensive consultation between the Simplification Task Force and those affected by the Bill. The Committee's comments on the Bill are made as part of that process of refinement through consultation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Submissions and oral evidence during the inquiry showed that, almost without exception, there was strong support for the Bill. The many matters of detail and drafting issues that were raised during the inquiry have been made available to the Task Force. The Committee urges that these matters be considered prior to the Bill's introduction into Parliament later this year.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of more fundamental issues were also raised with the Committee, and our Report discusses these in more depth. In discussing them, our Report applies some basic principles. One of these is that companies now operate in an international marketplace. Recognising this means that we need to move to international best practice in disclosure

        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that the Corporations Law should require that information disclosed by Australian listed companies in overseas jurisdictions be promptly and prominently announced via the Australian Stock Exchange to Australian investors;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that the proposal in the Bill for including in company annual reports a general management discussion in narrative form should be retained;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that a number of additional specific matters should be included in the annual reports of listed companies—these include Board policies for determining the remuneration (including incentives) of the Board and senior executives and the relationship of these policies to the performance of the company; details of the remuneration, age and other directorships of the directors; and general details of litigation instituted against, or concluded by, the company; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that the Corporations Law should require the auditors of listed companies (or their representatives) to be available to take questions at the annual general meeting at which the auditor's report is tabled. In return, the Bill should make clear that answers by auditors to questions at an AGM attract qualified privilege in the same way as other activities by auditors.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Conducting business in an international marketplace also means recognising the particular problems faced by investors, both local and international. The Committee was told that some investors have difficulty in ensuring that their proxy votes are lodged within the time available. Others have difficulty in ensuring that their voting intentions are adequately expressed. Still others have difficulty in ensuring that their proxy votes are actually voted when appropriate. Therefore the Committee recommends:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that, as a general rule, the minimum notice period for a members' meeting of a listed company should be 28 days;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that a standardised proxy form should be developed to enable all shareholders to express the full range of their voting intentions; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that the chairman at an AGM should be required to call for a poll if so instructed by a required number of the proxies held by him or her, or if the vote on a show of hands does not reflect the votes of the proxies held by him or her.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course, corporations don't only operate in an international marketplace, they operate in an increasingly electronic one. To some extent, the Draft Bill recognises this. However, the Committee felt that it could go further—for example, enabling companies to send notices and other information to members electronically and enabling members to
        <break page="5422" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         send proxies to companies electronically. While there should be no obligation to use electronic forms of communication, the Committee believes that the Bill should nevertheless facilitate their use. It should also clarify some of the effects of technological failure. Therefore the Committee recommends:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that the Bill should more extensively recognise electronic forms of communication between companies and their members, and regulatory authorities; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        that the Corporations Law should make clear that, where it is proposed to hold a meeting using technological assistance, the participants at the meeting should be aware of the intended use of that technology, of the effect on the meeting of any failure of that technology and (for directors' meetings) of the effect on the meeting of any withdrawal of consent to the continued use of that technology.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill provides for members' meetings to be called in a number of circumstances. It provides that a director may call such a meeting, but declares this to be a replaceable rule—this means that it may be displaced by a company's constitution. There is a demonstrable need for directors, particularly of listed companies, to be able to act independently in the interests of the company and all its shareholders. Therefore the Committee recommends that a director's right to call a members' meeting ought to be a mandatory rule for listed companies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Members' meetings may be called in other circumstances. For example, a proportion of the members may require the directors to call a meeting. If the directors fail to call such a meeting and the members convene it themselves, the directors as a whole must reimburse the company for the costs of the meeting. The Committee believes that, as a matter of fairness, only those directors in default should be liable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also gives the members a right to convene a meeting themselves without first approaching the directors. Some concerns were expressed that this right might be used frivolously, or to pass resolutions that were not within the powers of members. To avoid this happening, the Committee recommends that the Bill should make clear that the power of members to convene a meeting should not be exercised frivolously and should be exercised only where the purpose of the meeting is a valid purpose for such a meeting.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill does not address the issue of meetings of members where a company has different classes of shareholders. The Committee recommends that the Bill give consideration to enabling the members of a class of shareholders to call a meeting of that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         class to consider matters able to be dealt with at such a meeting.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, I would like to refer to two specific matters of concern that arose during the inquiry—one to do with the proposed abolition of the par value of shares and the other to do with the application of the small/large test for proprietary companies—something that arose out of the First Simplification Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Committee generally supports the move to abolish par value, such a move brings with it transitional consequences and taxation consequences. Abolishing par value means that the Stock Exchange will have to revise its listing rules and many companies may have to reconsider their constitutions and classes of shares. Many of the taxation consequences—particularly for future bonus issues of shares, or on the conversion of convertible preference shares—are not yet clear. What is clear is that considerable care is needed in this area. Therefore, the Committee recommends that the adequacy of the transitional period for, and the possible taxation consequences of, the abolition of par value and the share premium account should be carefully considered by the Government. The Committee notes an opportunity to further examine this issue when the Bill is finally introduced into Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee also notes the impending promulgation of an ASC Draft Class Order governing the granting of audit relief to some large proprietary companies. Some of the additional criteria which the ASC proposes to include in this Class Order may have the effect of disadvantaging certain large proprietary companies, particularly franchised motor dealers. The Committee intends discussing the matter with the ASC in the near future. Subject to these discussions, it may further review the effect and operation of the small/large test in early 1997.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the interim, the Committee recommends that the ASC reconsider the criteria to be included in its Draft Class Order to remove any unnecessary audit burden from franchised motor dealers or businesses in similar circumstances.

        The purpose of the bill is to prevent the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (the act) from further impeding the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. The bill achieves this by providing that the provisions of the act do not authorise the minister to make a declaration over the area which will be used to build the bridge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will not affect the operations of the act in relation to any applications for protection made by members of the local indigenous community in respect of sites of significance elsewhere on Hindmarsh Island, or by the indigenous people elsewhere in Australia. The bill is designed to remove the hiatus caused by the circumstances following the making of the previous and current applications by Ngarrindjeri women for protection of sites on Hindmarsh Island.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senators will be aware of the protracted nature of this matter which arose from a number of applications for protection made in December 1993, April and May 1994, culminating in the former minister in the Labor government making an emergency declaration under section 9 of the act in July 1994. While in force for 30 days which is the period allowable under s 9 of the act, the minister used his authority to extend the emergency declaration by a further 30 days enabling the preparation of a report to the minister by Professor Cheryl Saunders.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The consideration of the report and its attachments by the former minister and his decision to make a declaration for protection for a period of 25 years, as senators will know, became the subject of legal action in the Federal Court in July 1994. The Court's decision is well known to all senators. The former minister's appeal against the Court's order to quash his decision of 9 July failed—the Full Court of the High Court rightly found on 7 December 1995 that he had failed to follow the due process of the act for which he was responsible by not personally considering a representation attached to the Saunders report and known generally as the "secret women's business". The declaration to prevent the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge was consequently ruled to be ineffective and had no force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the meantime, a South Australian Royal Commission found that the so called "secret women's business" was a total fabrication. This finding was supported by the view of some of the Ngarrindjeri women (the so&amp;hyphen;called "dissident women") who maintained that there was no secret women's business associated with Hindmarsh Island.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is unfortunate that the government of the day did not then decide to cut its losses and allow the bridge to be built.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The former government appointed then Minister Crowley to deal with a further application by the Ngarrindjeri women received in December 1995, on the basis that Senator Crowley would be in a position to consider any " secret women's business" tendered in the reporting process. Senator Crowley ruled that the December 1995 application was a valid application under the act. Once a valid application is received, under current law, a report must be prepared. Justice Mathews was commissioned by Senator Crowley to prepare a section 10 report which was completed at a cost of over $1m.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As senators will know, Justice Mathews' appointment has since been deemed invalid by the High Court. Although Justice Mathews' report—which was tabled in the Senate on 17 September 1996, found that "there is insufficient material from which the minister could be satisfied that the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge would desecrate this area according to these traditions", it cannot be used for the purposes of deciding the application for protection. Ultimately the former government's decision to appoint Justice Mathews to prepare a report has not resulted in any advance to the matters which were raised in the original application of December 1993. Three years and several million dollars later, neither the proponents of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge nor the original applicants have come away with a final decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This government has not lightly made the decision to prepare special legislation to enable the Hindmarsh Island Bridge to be built. It has sought
        <break page="5424" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         advice and considered the options open to it. The advice of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department is that yet another report must be prepared on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge application, or the current law must be changed.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The minister has considered appointing another reporter (under the provisions of the act). While this appears to be the process least likely to cause concern, the recent history of the administration of the act, highlighted by litigation in respect of applications for protection in Broome and Perth, reveals that, even if all the "i's" were dotted, and "t's" crossed, there would be no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome, and potentially further substantive costs to the taxpayer. Moreover, it is unlikely that a newly appointed reporter would receive any information that was not available to Justice Mathews in the preparation of her report. The government therefore believes that the act as it stands has proved to be unworkable in this instance, and there is no guarantee that a further reporting process would finally settle the matter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The decision to prepare separate special legislation to overcome the current situation is seen by the government as being the most practical course to resolve the issue once and for all.

        It may be argued that the government has decided that cost outweighs concern for Aboriginal heritage.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is not the case. The costs associated with the heritage protection process in this case have been extremely high, higher than for all other applications which have been determined through the processes of section 10 reports. Given the uncertainty of the outcome of another report, and the potential further drain on funds which could be applied to more beneficial programs, the government has judged that enough is enough.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Before concluding, I remind senators of the former Labor government's decision to review the act. That decision is one which this government has endorsed. Ms Elizabeth Evatt AC, who was appointed to review the operations of the act has now provided the minister with a report which was tabled in Parliament on 26 September 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the general recommendations in the report which suggest that an overhaul of the legislation is overdue, the government has placed a high priority on addressing the findings of the report. It is pertinent to comment that, in her report, Ms Evatt has suggested that "The recommendations would help to overcome many of the current frustrations and could contribute in a positive way to the goals of Aboriginal reconciliation."

        This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to give effect to the main Budget measures relating to Medicare benefits. Most of the bill relates to the eligibility requirements for medical practitioners whose services are covered by Medicare. Other clauses in Schedule 2 of the bill modify the level of benefit payable for some services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The changes to provider eligibility build on the vocational registration requirements in Section 3F of the act which were introduced by the former Government in 1989. Vocational registration, introduced the concept of general practice as a separate discipline which required specific post graduate training for unsupervised practice and provided higher fees for patients of vocationally registered general practitioners.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under this bill, new doctors will be required to have or be in the process of obtaining a recognised post graduate medical qualification before their patients are able to attract Medicare benefits at all.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This measure is vitally important for several reasons. First, it will increase the quality of health care available to the Australian community by making sure that, in future, all general practitioners have been properly trained. It recognises the current reality that a basic medical degree is no longer adequate for a doctor to practice unsupervised in the community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, it will help correct some of the distribution problems with the medical workforce, where
        <break page="5425" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         we have the absurd situation of having to import more that 500 overseas trained doctors on temporary visas each year to work in our public hospital system, even though we have something like 4000 more doctors than our population would require.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, it will reduce one of the major growth pressures on Medicare, making it more sustainable in the longer term. There is widespread agreement that the increasing number of medical practitioners is one of the main growth pressures on the health costs in Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new requirements will apply to new doctors who register with State and Territory medical boards on or after 1 November 1996. This includes those new medical practitioners who are currently undertaking their internship year.  The new requirements also apply to a group of doctors who although medically registered in Australia are neither Australian citizens nor residents.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other than these two groups, no existing medical practitioners will be affected by these changes. Even those registered medical practitioners who do not currently have a Medicare provider number will still be able to obtain full access to Medicare at any time.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the new measures, all overseas trained doctors who wish to work in Australia, with access to Medicare will also have to meet the new requirements. However, because the distortions of the medical workforce mean that our health system has a reliance on temporary visa doctors, the new postgraduate requirements will not be mandatory for doctors coming into Australia on a temporary residence basis until 1 November 1997.  This will give public hospitals and others who rely on temporary resident doctors a chance to make other arrangements. Nevertheless it is my intention to look very carefully at the circumstances in which temporary residence doctors are allowed to come into Australia in the longer term. I will be making sure that overseas doctors are not taking jobs which could be filled by Australian citizens or permanent residents.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Furthermore, the Medicare access provided to new trainees will, in future be limited to their actual training posts. This move will make sure that doctors in training are not moonlighting in jobs for which they are not trained and not taking jobs from fully trained general practitioners by working at a lower rate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australian medical schools produce undifferentiated medical graduates—graduates who have completed basic training but who have not yet acquired the specific knowledge or skills necessary to work effectively in an unsupervised capacity in any specific area of medical practice. Most medical practitioners currently go on to complete some form of postgraduate training in a chosen specialty.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, up until now a minority of graduates fresh from medical school, and with only one year's practical experience as an intern have been able to set up their own private practice, treating patients for conditions which may rarely be seen in a hospital context. Graduates proceeding in this way bypass the vocational training expected for general practice. This kind of career path can have adverse results in terms of both the cost and the quality of services provided.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under vocational registration, introduced by the previous Government, fees for these doctors are significantly lower than those for recognised general practitioners, but this has not stopped these doctors from entering this type of practice. In fact, there are concerns that some of these doctors might even be increasing their throughput to make up for the lower fees. This Government is doing the responsible thing by making sure that these doctors stay in the supervised hospital system until they are properly trained to work unsupervised in the community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In fact, these doctors are needed in our hospitals, where there are constant shortages. We hear stories of doctors in hospitals working 160 hour fortnights and doing 24 hour shifts. Clearly there are issues of quality that need to be addressed here. When you ask the states and territories why they don't employ more doctors they say they are unable to attract doctors into the hospitals because graduates can make more money through Medicare. In turn, States recruit doctors from overseas who, equally, may lack appropriate training and certainly do not have the particular experience required to work in some of our rural hospitals and outback communities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Whilst we acknowledge the valuable work that these doctors are doing in our hospitals and rural communities it has to be recognised that bringing in doctors from overseas when there are plenty of Australian graduates who, with training, could find meaningful work in these areas, doesn't make sense.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill will not only ensure that in future new doctors are undertaking vocational training before being allowed full access to Medicare, but at the same time will deal with one of the main distortions in the medical workforce.

        Other amendments to the act will allow for the implementation of the multiple services rules for diagnostic imaging services and general medical services, a change to the greatest permissible gap to $50 and a change to the arrangements for services of unusual length or complexity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The addition of multiple services rules provide a power to make regulations to implement the rules. Such rules recognise that, when a diagnostic imaging service is rendered with another service to
        <break page="5426" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         a patient, there is an over-remuneration in fees for part of the costs of rendering the services. Existing sections of the act and regulations provide for multiple operations, anaesthetics and pathology rules. These rules have been in operation for many years.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While it is not intended to introduce specific multiple services rules for general medical services at this time, the concept is being introduced to ensure uniformity across all service types.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The change to the greatest permissible gap, that is, the maximum gap between the Medicare Schedule fee listed for any out of hospital service and the Medicare benefit payable for that service, is being increased to $50. While the act gives the gap as $26.80, the amount is indexed annually and without this amendment would have been $30.20.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The final amendments remove the ability for changes to be sought to increase fees for services of unusual length or complexity. This is being done for two reasons:  Firstly, Medicare Schedule fees—and consequently Medicare benefits paid—should be based on the  swings and roundabouts' principle, with the fee regarded as being reasonable on average for the service having regard to usual and reasonable variations in the performance time on different occasions and to reasonable ranges of complexity and technical difficulty encountered. Secondly, such a change will prevent the creation of items attracting a higher fee without Ministerial approval or parliamentary scrutiny.

         —I am going to make three or four minutes of general comment, and then, as I have indicated on previous schedules, in order to facilitate the program, I am going to incorporate some seven or eight pages of specific comments. Schedule 7, termination of employment, proves once and for all that the government's pre-election hysteria about unfair dismissal laws was nothing but a giant beat-up. The hypocrisy of the government, which this schedule shows, is staggering.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The most fundamental point about the government's amendments to our unfair dismissal laws is that the substance of the law—the substantive provisions which will be applied in determining whether a dismissal was unfair—is basically unchanged. Remember the hysteria about the so-called requirement for the employer to give the employee a warning before dismissal? Well, it is still there, Senator Campbell. Why?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Section 170CG will require the commission to consider whether there was a valid reason for the termination related to the conduct of the employee, whether the employee was notified of that reason and whether the employee was given an opportunity to respond to that reason. Not only that; the commission is required to consider whether the employee was warned—yes, the word `warned' is used—about any unsatisfactory performance
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         before the termination. I have no doubt there will be many lawyers advising employers that they must still give an employee a warning before dismissal if they are not to fall foul of these laws.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But do not get us wrong: we support these provisions. But the point is that it was this need for a warning that was the centrepiece for the then Liberal opposition's campaign of hysteria about the unfair dismissal laws. Yet it is still there, just as the substance of the unfair dismissal laws has basically been unchanged. And the government knows this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting that the hysteria about unfair dismissal laws is no longer around, yet our laws continue in effect. Where are all the callers to talkback radio about absurd results under the unfair dismissal laws? Where are the employer groups' rantings—I use that word cautiously, but there was a lot of ranting on this issue—that terminations are being continually challenged under our unfair dismissal laws? Where are they? There are none, because in January 1996 we got the unfair dismissal laws basically right.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No wonder the government are not really changing the substance of the law. They know there is no need to. No wonder the government refused to take up the Democrats' offer in May or June this year to immediately deal with the government's amendments to the unfair dismissal laws. What is the rush when you are not really doing anything, Senator Murray? I notice that you even smiled on this point.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No wonder the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in the other place refused to guarantee that under his unfair dismissal laws more jobs would be created in small business in the next three years than the half a million created during the last three years of the Labor government. How could he when he knows this law is not really that different?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The truth is now out, and nowhere has the truth been plainer than in the recent annual report of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. In that report, the chief justice noted:
       </para>
       <break page="5428" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the controversy about the unlawful termination provisions was fuelled by a degree of deliberate misrepresentation.
        </para>
        <para>
         On concerns about an increasing filing rate of unlawful termination claims, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . it became apparent during 1995-96 that the filing rate would not continue to increase . . . Even taking into account termination applications made to State tribunals, it is apparent that only a tiny proportion of dismissals result in litigation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Just under two per cent, in fact. As to the alleged effects of unfair dismissal laws on small business, the chief justice noted:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Respondents also are a cross-section of Australian employers, except that small business seems to be under&amp;hyphen;represented.
        </para>
        <para>
         As I have said, given this truth, it is no wonder the substance of the government's new laws is basically no different. There are going to be a lot of disappointed people out there who thought the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was going to abolish the unfair dismissal laws.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So why won't we vote for these laws? Because, in two important ways not related to the substance of the laws, they are grossly unfair to employees. And we will be moving amendments to address this unfairness.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Firstly, the new unfair dismissal laws will apply only in the traditional federal jurisdiction. We know this was always a great concern for the Democrats—particularly to Senator Allison, and I hope she is listening up there somewhere—because they knew many employees would be thrown back to state unfair dismissal systems. In the case of Victoria, that would mean those employees would be considerably worse off.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We would be tempted to have a Senator Allison amendment, but we have made a point in the last weeks in respect of Senators Stott Despoja and Murray—and, in your case, Senator Murray, we have done that on seven or eight occasions. Having regard to the time and our manner of handling this matter, we will not be quite so harsh with the Australian Democrats this week. But we did win one vote this morning, Senator Murray.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem of the federal jurisdiction has now been cured by the Kennett government's decision to give its industrial relations powers,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          including over unfair dismissal, to the federal government. How ironic it is. This simply achieves the universal coverage that we have long been calling for and that our amendments seek to achieve. We ought to call these the Jeff Kennett amendments, but we could never name amendments of ours after Jeff Kennett.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But why confine the solution only to Victorians? Have the Democrats, particularly Senators Kernot and Woodley, considered that the Borbidge government may yet gut Queensland's unfair dismissal laws? What happens then to those employees, with no access to the federal system, and a lousy state system? We should address the problem now so that it cannot arise in the future in any jurisdiction.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the government and the Democrats have retained the requirement for the commission to consider the viability of the employer's business before making a compensation order. We are utterly opposed to this decision. It discriminates between employees. It discriminates between employers. In fact, successful employers are penalised. If your business is a dud, you effectively get an exemption from unfair dismissal laws. But, if your business is a success, you get the unfair dismissal laws applying in full.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That the Democrats would support this fundamental unfairness is a real surprise—although, given what has been happening in the last two weeks, perhaps it is not a real surprise. We can only surmise that the Democrats no longer believe they have a constituency amongst small business, confirming something we have always known.

          These amendments insert a new provision which requires an employer to give written notification or confirmation of termination to an employee. Verbal notice of termination is often unsatisfactory. It can create disputes about when the termination occurred (and therefore about when an application for unfair dismissal must be brought) and about the terms of the termination. It is not too onerous to simply ask an employer to give an employee some written notice of his or her dismissal.

          On balance the Opposition believes these amendments are an improvement on the original Bill. We do have some concerns with the provisions. For example, the requirement for the Commission to give an assessment of the merits may prejudice the outcome in some circumstances. The automatic discontinuance in the absence of an election by the applicant may also be harsh in some instances. Nevertheless, the Opposition accepts the overall thrust of the provisions. The greater emphasis on a conciliated outcome is welcome, as is the choice for certain applicants to pursue arbitration rather than court proceedings. Given this, the Opposition will vote in support of these amendments.

         —Fundamentally, the Greens are opposed to the changes in this bill which amend the `termination of employment' provision in the existing Industrial Relations Act. We will oppose the entire schedule 7. Hence, I signal that we intend to move our amendment 28. I see that that amendment is right at the end. I would have liked it to have been moved to the beginning, because we have a number of alternative amendments which can be dealt with only after we see what the outcome of the opposition to the schedule is. But, fundamentally, we are opposed to the changes to the act.

        There seems to have been a lot of rhetoric flying around about the unfair dismissal measure. Why we oppose this element of the bill is largely due to the fact that the most recent changes to these provisions did not take effect until 15 January 1996. They have not yet had a chance to be properly evaluated. The position of the Chief Justice of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Justice Murray Wilcox, is interesting to note. He refuted claims made during the election campaign that the unfair dismissal provisions were so onerous that people in small business were reluctant to hire people. On 27 February 1996, on ABC radio's

        There have been moves against allowing this model to work well, and it can work well. It is unfortunate that the ALP have some amendments to the bill, and it is also unfortunate that the opposition to a certain extent have gone along with some of the rhetoric rather than the nature of the situation. It is our belief that it has not been given a chance to work properly. It is our belief that, in some instances, there may be people who are endeavouring to make it look as if it is not working properly.

        In reality, we will not suddenly get thousands of people hiring people on this basis alone. If they hire on the basis that they think they will be able to dismiss people unfairly, perhaps we will need to revisit this situation. There are certain details regarding whether or not the financial situation of a company should determine whether they need to obey the law. It has certainly never been the case with people who end up being charged with social security fraud if in some instances they have absolutely no choice except to try to survive.

         It has certainly not been the case in many other laws of which I know that the financial circumstances of the person involved determines whether or not they act lawfully. If a company is in trouble, there are ways that the company can act if they need to shed staff. They can talk with their staff. However, that should not mean that a company gets an exemption to treat their staff badly. I do not think it should be read that way. Unfortunate ly, I think that is what will be read as a result of what we are going through today.

         —I rise to make some remarks regarding the proposals in this workplace relations bill as they relate to unfair dismissal. We have all heard the saying, `There are lies, damned lies and statistics.' One of the great lies that has been perpetrated in recent years is the one put about that the unfair dismissal laws, as enacted by the previous Labor government and amended more recently, were a barrier to employment growth. This catchcry was taken up and promulgated mainly by big business, not the small business community. Small business was out there generally getting on with the job. It was taken up by large companies, by employer and business associations, by the Liberal and National parties, by conservative commentators and by talkback radio hosts.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It was blurted out day after day that these unfair dismissal laws were preventing employers from employing additional people. It was put that this was particularly the case in the small business sector. My recollection of what transpired during the Senate inquiry was that very little evidence was put before that committee by small business people that went to this issue. We have heard this cry for so long now that it has almost become a self&amp;hyphen;fulfilling prophecy.

        Unfortunately, people believed the perception rather than the facts. They listened to the rhetoric, to the hyperbole, that, if only you got rid of the unfair dismissal laws, if only you made it easier to sack people, you would somehow generate more employment. As a matter of logic, it does not stand up. I often listened to the talkback radio hosts, who seem to be experts at everything but particularly about the supposed ills of the industrial relations system. They proposed that what was needed in this country to enable more employment growth was to make it easier for employers to sack people. That defies any rational logic in my view.

In 1994&amp;hyphen;95, 87 per cent of the 7,749 unfair dismissal claims lodged that financial year were either settled or discontinued before determination by the court and another 4 per cent were settled or discontinued before the determination process had started. Of those determined by the court, 56 per cent were decided in the employee's favour and 44 per cent in favour of the employer. And in the 219 cases where compensation was awarded, 74 per cent involved amounts less than $10,000, about 22 per cent involved amounts between $10,000 and $20,000, and less than 4 per cent involved amounts of $20,000 or more.

In order to undermine the rights of employees, whether they be trade unionists or not, in this country they had to attack the unfair dismissal laws. That is consistent with the whole philosophy that runs through this bill which is about depriving people of their rights, whether they be award rights, rights in regard to hiring and firing employees or whatever.

        Whilst there were a few cases that were highlighted in the press where maybe some employees had been reinstated or the employer may have been hard done by because of the processes involved in the legislation, these were then blown up to suggest that the legislation in total was some overbearing onerous burden upon employers. It was argued that if only we could get rid of it then we would see

        Let us have a look at some of the employment figures. I will seek leave to incorporate this document shortly. What do the figures actually tell us? The employment figures for the period March 1994, when the unfair dismissal laws came into effect, to March 1995 actually show a very interesting picture. The source of these figures is the Bureau of Industry Economics.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The figures show that in the small business sector—defined as private enterprises with less than 20 employees, except manufacturing, in which a small business is defined as one with less than 100 employees, and agriculture, in which a small business is defined as one with an estimated value of agricultural operations between $20,000 and $399,000—employment increased from an estimated 3,548,900 in March 1994 to 3,725,100 at the end of the March quarter 1995. That is a net growth of 176,200 employees in the small business sector in the 12 months that the unfair dismissal laws were in operation. That contrasts remarkably with the big business sector, which did not show anywhere near the
        <break page="5435" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         same growth—and indeed with the public sector, where we saw a decline.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the 10-year period between June 1985 and March 1995 small business grew in this country by 1.1 million—an extra 1.1 million employees in small business. In the larger business sector employment grew by approximately 410,000. In the public sector employment declined by 168,600. Everyone knows that the obligations with respect to dismissal in the public sector have generally been a lot tighter than they are in the private sector.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Those figures put the lie to this claim that underpins these proposals that somehow the unfair dismissal laws were an impediment to employment. Employment in the small business sector grew faster than in any other sector in the Australian economy. I seek leave to incorporate this document, which was provided by the Parliamentary Library. It is sourced by the Bureau of Industry Economics and sets out employment growth in small business, big business and the public sector in the period that I have referred to.

         This provision is designed to allow the States to refer all of their responsibilities on unfair dismissal to the Commonwealth. This we think would create a massive burden on the AIRC. At present, the AIRC does not hear claims for states with an adequate alternative remedy. Even still, the number of claims to the Commission have risen massively in recent years. Under this proposal, the number of claims to the Commission could rise even more. The Democrats believe that the State must provide an adequate remedy, and will be moving an amendment to that effect. That is a more appropriate approach than that being pursued by the Opposition with these amendments.

Under the bilI as it stood, claims for unlawful dismissal had to commence in the Court where the claim was a matter listed in 170CK. The amended bill will allow all applications to commence in the Commission, with the applicant then deciding at the end of conciliation whether to arbitrate it in the Commission under 170CE or the Court under 170CK.

         I really don't think that these amendments are necessary. The bill as it stands follows very closely the wording of the ILO Convention in relation to its exemptions. We have been advised that it has the same effect, but reads a little better. As to deleting clauses (2) to (4) these clarify aspects of class (e) which might be later excluded by regulation. Obviously if those regulations go too far, we will move to disallow them. So, I think that the Opposition simply has not read the clause closely before drafting this amendment.

         These amendments cover the technical arrangements of where an employee elects at the end of conciliation whether they will take a case for unfair dismissal in the Commission for arbitration, or for unlawful dismissal in the Court. This distinction is necessary because unlawful dismissal claims must proceed along the judicial rather than the administrative stream. The provisions ensure that employees get to make the choice after conciliation, rather than at the very beginning of the process, and we think that is more appropriate.

         These amendments seek to place into proper perspective the matters to which the Commission must have regard before granting remedy. We think that the original bill placed too heavy an emphasis on the viability of the employer. While this might be a relevant circumstance in the very limited cases where the making of an order would actually touch on the viability—the continued viability of an employer, this is unlikely to be relevant to most cases. The longer list of matters to which the Commission would have regard we believe provides more appropriate guidance to the Commission on the various matters to which it should have regard.

Here we are talking about very small businesses, and I would doubt if it could be argued in very many cases at all. A business wishing to argue

         This is a small amendment to ensure that the starting point for the bill is the same as the indexed compensation figure in the current Act. I might add the Democrats opposed the imposition of the original $30,000 cap by the ALP in 1994. We still think that a cap of $32,000 is way too low, but this is a status quo amendment, so I am prepared to support it.

         These are all amendments to the ability of the Commission to order costs. Amendment 46, 47, 48 and 50 cover the inclusion of unlawful dismissals within the Commission, allowing an order for costs against an organisation which has brought a vexatious claim or a claim without reasonable cause. I would like to point out that these terms are very narrow in their scope, and deliberately so. It would be our expectation in supporting these amendments that the power to award costs would be used sparingly, and only in exceptional cases which are clearly vexatious in its true sense, or truly without reasonable cause. Indeed, if it becomes the causes that costs are awarded by the Commission on anything other than a rare and exceptional case, the Democrats will be seeking to remove the costs jurisdiction or further narrow it.

         Amendment 49 significantly tightens up the conditions under which an employee can be subject to costs for failing to discontinue a matter. New section 170CJ(3) will require the employee to have elected to continue the matter to arbitration under 170CFA, but then discontinuing it at an unreasonably late time. At that stage, the employee would have received the assessment of the Commission required at the end of conciliation as required by new section 170CF(2). So, before being liable for a costs order, they will have in hands an assessment of the merits, will have elected to continue, and then changed their mind. That is not unreasonable.

         The Democrats again feel that this section is dubious constitutionally. The High Court in its recent judgement on these provisions gave the ILO Conventions a very literal interpretation, so literal that any order made under 170CH that a dismissal was harsh or unjust could still breach the Convention. This is very untidy law, and we are opposed to it. The award review process over the next 18 months will obviously review clauses that are obsolete and which fail to meet the objects of the Act, which include assisting in meeting our international obligations.

         —It is at least gratifying to see that after 90 years of industrial arbitration at a national level there is bipartisan support for the right to reinstatement through the federal jurisdiction. For many, many years this right was not available. There was no legislative prescription which enabled employees employed under federal awards to seek reinstatement, although such a right may have existed in some states. So at least now we can say that there is bipartisan support for this right, although the amendments that Labor moves in relation to this schedule of the legislation are amendments which obviously I support as improving the legislative basis for the reinstatement power.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was historically the case that the only way the federal commission could act in relation to reinstatement was where there was the consent of both the employer and obviously the employee's representative to accepting a recommendation of the commission. This amendment now enshrines in the legislation the fact that there is bipartisan support for this important right to be retained by employees Australia&amp;hyphen;wide to the extent that this legislation will, in tandem with state legislation, maintain reinstatement rights.

        So to an extent this provision has put in jeopardy those people who seek to represent their fellow workers because they have been elected for example as a union delegate or representative.

         —I want to ask a question of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment. My question probably arises generally from the amendments that have just been moved. Given the change to the environment which is effected by this and other amendments and the long-term constitutional question that has been asked about members of the federal commission exercising powers of reinstatement, in the past there has been some question mark about whether that power is a judicial function rather than an arbitral function. In a number of cases in the past, such actions have been struck down by the High Court.

        Firstly, does the government have a view as to the effect of the newly amended legislation relating to those previous decisions? Secondly, if at some stage, given the bipartisan nature of this matter now, the High Court strikes these provisions down, is the government committed to taking steps to reinstate the power in some form?

        There is no need to worry any more because the federal Democrat&amp;hyphen;government industrial relations agreement will now be the same as what is in Victoria. The fact that it does have the tick of approval from the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, indicates just what an agreement it is. I think it is necessary to note that the concerns of workers have been carried through to the extent that we now have federal legislation that looks so appalling that the Premier of Victoria has given it his stamp of approval.

I do not think you can say when we are getting kissed by Kennett and punched by Court that we are in love with both. I do not think either are in love with us.

        Irrespective of whether or not Mr Kierath does or does not like changes to the federal system or changes that might impact on the state system, there are people in Western Australia who are currently in the federal system who will have their lives changed immensely. There are people who had a choice before who have less of a choice now. The number of people who may be on awards, paid or otherwise, or in different sorts of agreements and who will have to go into different agreements will be quite a lot.

        Different states had different numbers of people moving over. We know that, in Victoria, there was more ability to move over to a federal system. We also know that, in Western Australia in recent times, many people have moved to the federal system. There are many aspects of this bill which will affect a large number of workers in Western Australia and, perhaps even more so, in Victoria. It is not surprising that the loudest and clearest idea of the impacts of this bill are being felt in Victoria and people are very disappointed. I believe the Victorian Trades and Labour Council is feeling very betrayed at the moment, because of this bill and this agreement.

          This amendment deletes the exemption for small businesses created in the termination provisions of the bill. I mentioned this briefly earlier. These allow for regulations to exclude certain categories of employees, such as employees in relation to whom the operation of the provisions causes or would cause substantial problems because of the size or nature of the undertakings in which they are employed.

          We feel that termination provisions are not onerous. I mentioned before that Justice Wilcox states that `it simply means that, if there is an allegation against an employee of poor performance or dishonesty or some other misconduct, the employee must be given the opportunity to make a defence'. It does not require written notice; it does not require a system of warnings; it does not require a mini&amp;hyphen;trial. What it does mean is that, if the employer wants to sack the employee, the employee must be told, `We think you have done so and so. What do you say about that?' The employer must be prepared to listen to the explanation because sometimes there is an innocent explanation for something that looks bad. I think that is fair—it is not unfair—to be given the opportunity to explain yourself, even when something makes you look totally guilty. You all know of situations where appearances can be deceptive and people should be given the basic right to explain themselves. Consequently, we feel that there should be no reason why the size of the business should create an excuse for being exempted from these very reasonable provisions.

         ground workers made submissions to the committee that highlighted the need for written notice to be given to employees to enable proper advice to be sought in the event of termination. This is a very reasonable request. I imagine that it is also the case, considering the nature of work these days, that people know what their position is and, if they are to take action, they probably need something in a legal sense to be able to say, `This is what has happened to me and this is my concern.' It does not say that it has to be typed; it does not say that it has to be on letterhead; it does say that it should be written. I do not think that is unreasonable.

        This amendment deletes provisions in the bill with regard to remedies on arbitration which require the commission to have regard to the effect of the order on the viability of the employer's undertaking, establishment or service. In similar vein to our amendment 30, we feel that the viability of an employer's business should not be used as an excuse for not making payment to an employee in lieu of reinstatement. Where else in legislation do we incorporate similar provisions? It is worth quoting in this context from a submission to the committee by Professor Andrew Stewart from the school of law at Flinders University. He states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a matter of principle, it is difficult to see why this concession should be made to an employer's financial circumstances, when that same concession is not made in so many other laws. If a firm inflicts loss through breach of contract or negligence, its obligation to pay damages is not reduced according to whether the firm can afford to pay, whatever the consequences that may ensue. So why should it be any different for an unfair dismissal claim? The message that this provision appears to send is that unfair dismissal claims are not in the end that serious. But they are. The arbitrary depravation of the opportunity to earn a living is one of the worst calamities that can befall a person. If an unfairly dismissed worker cannot quickly find another source of income, the obligation of the employer to compensate for any loss should not be set aside or

         reduced merely because the employer's own livelihood may be at risk. In the end, a wrong is a wrong and should be redressed.

        Given the government's announcement that it would institute a filing fee of $50 for termination actions, we seek to amend section 359 of the act, which gives the power to the minister to make this regulation, to specifically state that the power conferred by the subsection does not include power to make regulations with respect to any fees in relation to division 3 of part VIA.

        It is interesting to note that many groups have condemned the proposal to impose a filing fee for termination matters. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, for example, stated in its submission to the Senate committee that it considers that filing fees are `undesirable in termination matters'. The Association for Non-English Speaking Women of Australia also commented on this issue and stated in their submission that `the $50 filing fee is prohibitive for many low income women and will often make the difference between them pursuing their dismissal or not'.

        We all know that, should their claims go forward to court, the costs for people to receive redress for what could be the breaking of a legal contract could be enormous. The ball is really in the court of the employer in so many different ways in this bill. This is just one of them. We have no indication that it will stop at $50. Perhaps at a time when there might be a number of people requiring redress, they will just ratchet it up another notch.

         filing to achieve some redress. I do not think it is a matter of trivia; I think it is important that people do have access to that, especially if those people have a very low income, are already severely disadvantaged or do not have $50 lying around to lodge a filing fee.

         SCHEDULE 8
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I am very pleased to move these amendments.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         These amendments reflect the longstanding commitment of the Australian Democrats to protecting and furthering the interests of women in the workplace.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         These amendments re-insert into the bill those sections of Part VIA which give the Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction over equal remuneration for work of equal value. They follow on from the Democrats' strong support for the insertion of these provisions in the original Act in 1994.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Democrats continue to hold the view that this is a particularly important and significant part of the Act. We believe that, while there may be only one test case underway at the moment under these provisions, it is crucial they be retained. That test case seeks to deal with the area of over award payments (currently flowing about three to one in favour of men) and that case alone is justification for retaining and shoring-up the Commission's jurisdiction in this area.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Democrats believe it is entirely appropriate to keep this jurisdiction to the Commission. We believe the Commission should have a role in ensuring our international obligations are capable of being enforced in relation to affording equal remuneration for work of equal value. I am very pleased that we have been able to persuade the Coalition, which is usually strident in its opposition to the use of the external affairs power, to agree to the re-instatement of this jurisdiction.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This provision allows the Commission to make an order to ensure that employees will be afforded equal remuneration for work of equal value.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The phrase `equal remuneration for work of equal value' will have the same meaning as in ILO Convention 100 and includes award rates, rates specified in agreements, over award pay and non-monetary benefits.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The importance of these provisions lies in their potential rather than in their current real practical effect. Their value will only be realised if unions follow the lead set by the ACTU and use this jurisdiction to run test cases.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In my view, it is a great credit to the current leadership of the ACTU that it was prepared to take this issue on and use these provisions to run the current test case on over award payments. That action by the ACTU represents a positive and welcome attempt to drive change in an area in which progress has been conspicuously lacking for more than 20 years—and (with these provisions now restored to the Act) it sends a strong signal to the union movement that it can—and should take
         <break page="5454" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          up the issue of equal remuneration for work of equal value.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We are proposing one minor technical change to the provisions. This is a `double jeopardy' provision to ensure that applicants do not use the AIRC approach while pursuing another adequate alternative remedy. Where that remedy fails for want of jurisdiction or is discontinued, then the AIRC route will be open.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The re-instatement of this important jurisdiction is part of the large number of changes negotiated by the Democrats which will significantly benefit women.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As pointed out earlier in this debate, other gains for women are: the Commission will be required in exercising its award-making powers for the first time to pay particular regard to equal pay for work of equal value, and to the need to eliminate discrimination against employees;
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Section 89A will also make it clear that the Commission can and should proceed to insert anti-discrimination clauses in awards. In addition, the accelerated award simplification process will be required to review award clauses which are discriminatory—a process which has been proceeding at something less than a snail's pace.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Because of the Democrats' negotiations, the Australian Workplace Agreements provisions will also be amended to require the Employment Advocate to have particular regard to the needs of women and workers with family responsibilities in exercising their powers. AWAs will also be required to include a model anti-discrimination clause.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Certified Agreements provisions are also amended to require the Commission to have special regard to the needs of women when Agreement conditions are being explained to employees.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Finally, section 1 70LU(5) precludes the inclusion in an award of a clause which the Commission believes would be discriminatory on the grounds of gender.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What we have done in securing these changes is ensure that the issues of equal remuneration, of a fairer deal for women workers, and of a fairer deal for workers with family responsibilities, are put `up-front' and `in lights' in the Act.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         And that means that these changes form a package which represents a major improvement not only on the original bill as tabled by the Government, but on the existing Act as well.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Now the Opposition has criticised the Democrats for our position on equal pay. They thought they had discovered an issue to run on. It has been a rather desperate attempt to re&amp;hyphen;establish credibility on a range of issues by re&amp;hyphen;writing history. Unfortunately for our Labor critics it is proving a bit
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          difficult for them to paint themselves as the champion of working Australians with a 13 year record behind them of doing the exact opposite in government.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Look at the record. Labor cut real wages. Labor left 800,000 Australian workers unemployed. Labor made it tougher for the unemployed and for sick workers to access social security benefits.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Through its ideological obsession with `level playing fields', Labor destroyed employment in the Australian manufacturing industry.

         Yes . . . government.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         And as time passes, we will be able to assess this coalition government's performance on the same matter. They cannot hide behind Labor's past record forever!
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I say to the Labor Party: they would be entitled to criticise the Democrats if they were doing so on the basis of a different and more credible policy record in government.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         And it is rather hypocritical of Labor to expect others to now support Labor amendments which they were not prepared to move or support when they were in government. These are purely political amendments. If they were not appropriate then, why are they now? The answer: being in opposition!
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         So I can understand why opposition senators sought to say we were betraying the women of Australia for saying the Commission must have regard to equal remuneration for work of equal value.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         And why opposition senators have spent so much time and repetition on one word of Section 88B, which sets out the things the commission must have regard to in exercising its award making jurisdiction.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Labor is clutching at straws in this debate and it knows it!
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Section 88B is not inconsistent with our support for re&amp;hyphen;insertion of Part VIA. Equal pay, as understood by the Commission in its successive equal pay cases and equal pay principles, covers payment for work. That is what awards are about. If a condition falls outside the definition of `pay', it is picked up in the general discrimination provisions. Or it is picked up under Part VIA.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It should be pointed out that the Commission takes a wide view of the 1972 Equal Pay Test Case decision, as recently as last November in the Weipa case, reaffirming that the Principles continue to apply, and that equal pay should be based on a fair assessment in the circumstances of the particular cases brought before the Commission.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The fact of the matter is that when this bill is passed, it will be the first time that an Australian parliament has directed the Commission to have
         <break page="5455" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          particular regard to this issue, and to the complementary instruction to have particular regard to the need to eliminate discrimination.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That is a significant achievement.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What these amendments do is put up-front the requirement for the Commission to take these issues seriously and to take action on them—in its award making powers, in award simplification, in agreements and through Part VIA in over-award payments.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         With these weapons at their disposal, the Commission can now start to attack the systemic discrimination which, 27 years after the first equal pay case and 10 years after the Sex Discrimination Act, still sees women earning on average 30 per cent less than men.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Labor Party might like to explain why in the last ten years the relativity of women's full time wages to men's full time wages not risen, and is stuck at 78.3%. In fact, in the last two to three years, it has fallen, a point clearly made in the DIR report on Enterprise Bargaining released last month. No progress in ten years, if anything women were going backwards under Labor's industrial relations model. That is ten years of a Labor Government failing to make even the slightest inroads into equal pay.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (I seek to incorporate a document which is an extract from ABS statistics in relation to male and female full time earnings).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Interestingly enough, that inequality in both pay and access to work&amp;hyphen;related benefits did not stop the Labor Government from raising the pension age for women a couple of years' back—to the distress and detriment of a great many Australian women workers in their 40s and 50s. And that decision was taken even though under the Labor government's superannuation polices, three quarters of the $7 billion of tax concessions flowed to men, even though men make up just 45 per cent of Australia's post age 60 population.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I remind you that the Democrats voted against the move on women's pensions, and have constantly criticised Labor's failure to deliver a superannuation regime fairer to women—so don't come in here and try to pretend that 13 years of a Labor Government did anything wonderful for women workers in this country.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         So Labor should not come in here and condemn us for negotiating amendments which will provide an important tool in commencing the hard work of closing that stubborn gender pay gap—a gap they so conspicuously failed to close in more than a decade in government.

         —We welcome the fact that the government and the Democrats have agreed to reinstate into the act the provisions concerning equal remuneration for work of equal value. We welcome it because, on a practical level, the provisions give the commissioner general power to ensure equal remuneration in over&amp;hyphen;award matters—a power the commission or any other body does not otherwise have. We also welcome it because it enables Australia to give proper effect to international obligations which we have entered into, particularly the anti-discrimination conventions and equal remuneration recommendations.

        I am curious that the Democrats have not been able to convince the government of the force of these same arguments as applied to the minimum wage provisions. On a practical level, the minimum wage provisions give the commission a general power to ensure that all Australian workers—not just federal award workers—receive adequate minimum wages.

        Repeal of this power would, of course, be contrary to the Democrats' pre&amp;hyphen;election commitment that they would oppose any attempt to reduce the powers or jurisdiction of the commission. Perhaps the Democrats regard these minimum wage provisions as non&amp;hyphen;core powers and jurisdiction of the commission! The minimum wage provisions are also important in giving effect to Australia's international obligations under the minimum wages convention. Perhaps the Democrats and the government have embarked on a process of determining which of our international obligations are core ones that must be preserved, and which are non&amp;hyphen;core obligations that can be jettisoned at will.

         I would urge the Democrats to reconsider their ambiguous position on these matters, lest it be thought that the otherwise pure Democrats may be acting on the basis that there are move votes in equal remuneration than there are in minimum wages.

        Perhaps most fundamentally, the opposition opposes the creation of yet another stream of workplace agreement, non&amp;hyphen;union certified agreements. The opposition will be moving therefore to delete division 2 of schedule 9. We believe there is simply no justification for the creation of a non&amp;hyphen;union stream of certified agreements, particularly as these just make a complicated bill and a complicated industrial relations system even more complicated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is simpler and more efficient to create just one stream for non&amp;hyphen;union agreements. Although we object to them, the government has done this by creating AWAs. AWAs are able to be made on a multi&amp;hyphen;employee basis and will be tested by reference to the same `no disadvantage test' as certified agreements. If the government really has faith in its new AWAs, why not rely on these as the preferred non&amp;hyphen;union agreements?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are three other areas to which I want to draw attention—in the main because the opposition will be moving amendments to deal with the problems we see. The first is an amendment which has been recommended to us by the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia. They are concerned that the new arrangements for certified agreements will allow the interests of their members at a workplace—and invariably their members are well and truly in the minority—to be swamped by the interests of the other majority workforce. This is most likely to occur because of the requirement that there be majority approval for a certified agreement at a particular workforce. In these circumstances, the votes of the inevitable
        <break page="5458" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         employees minority of APESMA members are likely to be swamped.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To address this concern, we will be moving an amendment which permits employers to enter into a certified agreement with a distinct category of employees in their workforce where the employer chooses to do so. We can see no valid argument against giving employers their freedom to choose.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, we will be moving another `Murray amendment'—we are not letting you get off too lightly, Senator Murray—in relation to youth wages, although I am just as happy to call it a `Stott Despoja amendment' if you want her to take responsibility.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill, as agreed by the Democrats, will permit junior rates to continue in certified agreements until at least the year 2000, with the commission having the power to extend them beyond that on a case by case basis. I remind the government and the Democrats that junior rates are discriminatory. They permit discrimination between two workers simply on the basis of age, even though they are doing the same work and have the same experience. We are opposed to junior rates and we thought the Democrats were, too.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, we are not going to win on our preferred position, so we will accept the fall&amp;hyphen;back provision recommended by Senator Murray in his report. He recommended at page 353—I offer it as commended reading to the nation that is listening—that:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        . . . age&amp;hyphen;based discrimination in relation to wages ceases as from 1 July 1997 as set out in the current Act. However, the parties may be able to approach the Commission on an award or agreement basis to seek an extension of up to two years at a time provided that they can demonstrate special circumstances and that they intend and are making progress in replacing age&amp;hyphen;based wages with wages based on skill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Well, Senator Murray, that is the precise effect of the amendment we will be moving and we will look forward to you voting with us for a change.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third amendment that we will be moving is in relation to the termination of certified agreements. The original proposal in the bill to permit unilateral termination after the expiry date was very unfair as it would
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         have given the employer disproportionate bargaining power. It would have enabled an employer to threaten the workforce with significant reductions in existing entitlements—for example, going back to the basic award entitlements—if they did not agree to proposals for a new agreement by the time of expiry of the old one. It would have effectively required employees to take industrial action just to retain their existing conditions.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We accept that these concerns have been ameliorated to some extent by the new requirement for review by the commission before termination can be approved. Because this provision is an improvement, the opposition will vote in support of it. But the opposition's preferred position is that the termination of a certified agreement should only be permitted if a valid majority of persons employed at the time, whose employment is subject to the agreement, had genuinely agreed to the termination. We believe that whilst an agreement is in effect it should only be terminated with the agreement of the parties. An employer should not at any time have the capacity to effectively remove existing conditions of employment from employees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition also believes that the commission should be required to determine that it is in the public interest for a certified agreement to be terminated. The requirement proposed by the government&amp;hyphen;Democrats amendment that the commission is required to determine that that termination is not contrary to the public interest is not good enough. It is an example of a subtle change in the onus of proof that the government has apparently been able to sell to the Democrats. But it would be wise for the Democrats to appreciate that termination of a certified agreement under this new regime will usually have very dire consequences because employees will fall back to mere safety net conditions of employment. The strictest public interest requirement should be insisted upon before employees are faced with this appalling outcome. The amendment we will move will ensure this is the case.

         The Bill as amended by Govt/Dems (86) provides that an agreement cannot be certified unless it passes the `no disadvantage test' in Schedule 13. If the agreement does not pass the `no disadvantage test' it can nevertheless by certified if this is not contrary to the public interest. An example of the latter is if the agreement is part of a strategy to deal with a short&amp;hyphen;term crisis in the business.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Opposition believes that these new provisions suffer from some important inadequacies. First, the new test requires an assessment of `no disadvantage' by reference to overall terms and conditions rather specific terms and conditions. This opens up the possibility of employees `trading off' important terms and conditions like sick leave in return for perhaps one&amp;hyphen;off pay increases. Second, the new test permits exemptions from the `no disadvantage' requirement in the case of trainees, apprentices and employees on the supported wage system. Third, there is no reason why the public interest should necessarily be equated to strategies to deal with short&amp;hyphen;term crises in business.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For these reasons the Opposition believes the `no disadvantage test' as it is presently in the Act is the fairest and most comprehensive test of `no disadvantage'. The effect of this amendment is therefore to restore this existing test.

         The Bill provides an injunction power for breach of provisions in this Part. We delete this power. The Opposition believes that injunction powers under this Part are most likely to be used against unions (eg breaching the prohibition on industrial action during the life of a certified agreement). In industrial relations injunctions are very blunt instruments. In particular, interim injunctions effectively terminate industrial action without at any time permitting the parties to argue the merits of the dispute. Breach of an injunction is also very serious, exposing unions to unlimited financial penalties for contempt of court.

         The Opposition moves this alternative amendment because the `next best thing' to removal of injunctions is to modify the injunction power so as to considerably reduce its destructive potential against unions. This can be done in two ways—ensuring

          that an employer cannot "rush off to court behind the union's back" to get an interim injunction; providing very strict requirements before an interim injunction will ordered. This ensures at least that the merits of the dispute will be heard by the Court before an injunction will be ordered.

         The Bill repeals the existing section providing that employees are not to be dismissed etc. for engaging in industrial action. We delete this repeal because although there are provisions in the Bill dealing with dismissal etc. for engaging in industrial action (Schedule 16 freedom of Association), these are not as strong as the existing provisions, nor do they apply as widely as the existing provisions (eg they only apply to employers that are corporations). In a recent High Court decision (Vic. v Cth.) the Court expressly found these existing provisions valid on the basis that they gave effect to Australia's international obligations concerning the right to strike. For these reasons they should be retained.

         —In relation to Labor amendment No. 107, I think the question has to be asked: what have the government and the Democrats got to hide in relation to these agreements? Presumably having established minimum conditions tests, what is the problem with those legislative aspects being tested against a particular agreement? The environment that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, as it is proposed to be amended, will establish is an environment where potentially there will be no critical determination of a particular agreement against those tests, given that the only parties potentially to proceedings will be supporting the approval of an agreement, and potentially will not want that agreement tested rigorously against the minimum conditions tests which are laid down, I think, in other parts of the bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats have said that they only wish, for example, employee organisations to have a right to appear in those matters when a member has authorised them in writing to appear. Presumably that is a member who is party to or affected by the agreement in accordance with the provisions of the legislation. I think it is 170LK(4). That begs a couple of questions. Firstly, in a seasonal industry, the potential remains—I think we have seen these sorts of circumstances in the past—where an agreement can be made with a work force at a particular time without having regard to the fact that the agreement will bind other people who are not employed at that time, but are normally employed on a seasonal basis. For example, in the fruit picking industry certain employers would be able to establish a certified agreement with a small number of employees which would bind a large number of casuals who were later employed under the terms of that agreement although they had no say in the matter. There would be no person or authority able to represent the interests of those employees; they would have no say in the matter and they would be bound.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So there is clearly one type of case where employees can be bound and where they have
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         no say. They clearly have no right to representation because they are not employed at the time the agreement is made. As I understand 170LK(4), they would have no right to ask that a union represent them in the bargaining process, because at that particular time they are not employed even though, from year to year, they might regularly return to the employment, for example, of a particular grower.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is just one example. You can also talk about certain fish processing industries where employment is seasonal and casual and where the same circumstances can arise. Again, those employees would have no right whatsoever in relation to the matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That brings me to the second point. Traditionally—and I think this has been recognised by the High Court, and I referred to this in the second reading debate—employee organisations have been taken to represent the class of employees that their rules cover. That is, it covers present and future employees. Those organisations have a role in the coverage of people who are not currently employed in a particular occupation but who might be employed in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Certified agreements, when made, do not simply bind those people who are a party to their making. On the one hand, an employer may sell a business or transmit the business in some way, and another employer would pick up the benefits or obligations of that certified agreement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the other hand, employees are a changing group. The employees who agreed to the certified agreement at the point it was made may depart and a new group of employees may arrive. Those employees would have had no say in the document, and their only choice as to the terms of condition is whether or not they accept the job and whether or not the government believes it is a good employment environment. I think the reality is that there is still a fairly high level of unemployment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those people who are seeking employment, particularly in some of the regional areas of Australia where employment is difficult to obtain, have no ability to intervene. The only bodies that have been established and which
        <break page="5469" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         appear to represent the rights of future employees are registered employee organisations. Yet the provisions in relation to certified agreements would exclude those organisations from appearing.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have heard the arguments about uninvited parties appearing in proceedings in relation to certified agreements in the past. Frankly, those arguments do not stand up when you consider that the certified agreement will cover a group of people—employer and employee potentially—who would have had no say in relation to the process of making the document and would have had no say as to the testing of the document against the minimum criteria established in the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government and the Democrats are not satisfied that those minimum criteria will stand the test in each case. If they were satisfied that they would stand up to the test, why would there be concern about scrutiny—about their actually being tested? Someone who wants to represent a point of view as to what those conditions might mean cannot have a say.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are many instances at law where organisations appear as so-called friends of the court to put a view on a particular matter. Why is this different, given that we are talking about documents which have the potential to bind people, other than the parties to their making, to them?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems to me that the Democrats ought to give serious consideration to this matter. They may not think it is serious but, on the other hand, what is there to hide by the testing of certified agreements by registered employee organisations? I would be interested to hear the views of Senator Campbell and Senator Murray on this matter.

         The government, through its legislation as it is being amended as we go along, wants to create a different system to what we have. Basically, employees will have the choice as to whether or not they seek the involvement of a union. We believe they should have that choice. You believe that unions or employee representatives should be able to go there without being invited by employees. We believe amendment 107, which we are debating at the moment, provides rights for intervention by unions that are far too open-ended and vague. We would prefer the employees to have the choice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As for your argument that we are scared of allowing these agreements to be tested, that is simply not the case. If there is any doubt as to whether they meet the criteria, nothing stands in the way of any of the employees seeking representation. Furthermore, the Industrial Relations Commission itself will test the agreements against the award standards for all employees, present and future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So it is not a matter of our being worried about having them tested because we want to ensure that individuals in Australia have a choice as to whether they are represented by unions or some other organisation. It is a matter of giving them that choice and ensuring that that choice is freely exercised. I do not expect that we will resolve our difference on that issue here or for many years to come.

         —I do not know whether, in the 13 years of Labor government, the number of union members who were senators declined. But I do know that, under 13 years of Labor government, the number of union members in Australia declined enormously. That is part of a world trend, and I accept that. It was probably not the fault of the Labor senators or the then Labor government. It is a fact that two&amp;hyphen;thirds of employees are not union members.

        Given these protections, we believe there is no argument for unions intervening where the employees do not want them to, as much as the union senators might like that.

It is for all people in Australia, and it makes for a better work force and better productivity if that ability is maintained. Unionists and unions should not be isolated as being at times, in some industries, pariahs, which I think is a very dangerous thing to have happening in Australia in 1996.

         —Government-Democrat amendments 80 and 81 seem to be going along the same lines as we were. We thought the time should be extended, and we suggested it should be 10 rather than five days. The amendment goes for 14, so we will go for 14. I have to withdraw our amendment 41, because we were both going in the same direction. I move:

         Amendment 42 is designed to ensure that clear and understandable information, which is such an important aspect of bargaining, is readily available to all employees, that is if it is bargaining. Therefore, one would have to say that people understand what it is they are signing.

         The amendment incorporates the need for the employer to take reasonable steps to ensure that every employee has access to the proposed agreement and that is expressed in plain English as easy to understand in structure and content. There should also be the option for information about the proposed agreement in relevant community languages.

         Finally, there is an option for employees to participate in discussion groups in relation to the proposed agreements. All of these aspects are important to the understanding of a proposed certified agreement which will dictate the pay and conditions for the workers who finally agree to it. Surely these simple requirements are not unreasonable. Many of the ideas for these amendments came from a submission to the Senate committee examining this bill from Santina Bertone, who is the Executive Director of the Workplace Studies Centre at Victoria University of Technology.

        The Democrats are opposed to this amendment. We believe that the Federal certified agreements stream should be open to as many workplaces as possible. Indeed, the use of the corporation power is no different than the use by the former Labor Government of the corporations power to underpin its Enterprise Flexibility Agreements, so I can't see why they have changed their minds about its use in these provisions, which basically replace the EFAs to a large extent.

        There is nothing stopping the Commission under the proposed 135(2A) satisfying itself of the approval of availed majority however it likes. That could be on the advice of a union. But, there have been too many instances of unions signing agreements without first seeking the approval of the employees to simply assume that the union will always ensure that a valid majority of work—members and non-members—have voted for the agreement. I think this amendment is inappropriate.

        By leave I seek to move these amendments together. These amendments seek to provide important protections for employees prior to the making of an agreement by extending from 5 to 14 days the period between employees receiving an agreement and voting to approve it, and by requiring the employer to take reasonable steps to ensure that the terms of the agreement are explained to the employees proposed to be covered. These provisions, combined with the ability of employees to nominate and have recognition a union to represent them in non-union agreements, will help to ensure that employees genuinely consent to the agreement. Subsequent amendments 87 provide additional protection to ensure that the explanation takes into account the person's particular circumstances and that an employee is not subject to coercion, while clauses 170LT(6) and (6A) will make it clear that these requirements must be met before the agreement can be certified.

In later amendments, we will move amendments to make it clear that employees will have the right to be clearly represented by their union, and also to ensure workers are not unfairly excluded from agreements. The fact that certified agreement override AWAs, and the fact that the Commission has a positive duty to facilitate the making of a certified agreement under 170L if a bargaining period is nominated, but no positive duty to facilitate the making of AWAs are all further bricks in the wall enforcing the right to bargain collectively.

        I am very pleased to support this amendment, easily the most important in the certified agreements changes. This amendment ensures that certified agreements must pass the no-disadvantage test outlined in Schedule 13. That requires that the agreement, on balance, does not result in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment under the relevant award or other law of the Commonwealth, State or Territory that is relevant. This is a much broader but also more flexible no disadvantage test than the narrow and rigid 8 minium conditions provided in the original bill. The section also allows that the Commission may allow an agreement to be approved which does not meet the no disadvantage test where the approval would be not contrary to the public interest. This reflects the public interest test already found in 170MC(2) of the current Act. I might add the provision of subclause 170LT(3) provides the Commission with a much broader public interest scope than does 170MC(2) does now, in that the Commission can refuse an agreement that meets the no disadvantage test on public interest grounds, something it can't do now.

        The additional ground for arbitration is found in 170MW(6A). These provisions establish three conditions for access to the paid rates arbitration. Paragraph (a) established the category of employees generally covered by the provision as the kind of employees who, prior to the commencement of the section, were the kind of employees whose wages and conditions would be covered by a paid rates award, or would have been if an employment agreement had not prevailed over the award. The term "kind of employees" is particularly significant. This refers to the general category of employees rather than to the specific employees themselves. For example, government employees are in all states but Victoria, covered by paid rates awards. And, up until the abolition of their paid rates award in 1992, Victorian workers were also governed by paid rates awards. So clearly, government employees generally, including Victorian workers currently award free, are the "kind of employees" covered by paid rates awards. Similarly, future statutory authorities or Government departments set up within the Government sector would also fall within the category of the "kind of employees" covered by paid rates

        Paragraph (b) adds the further requirement that where that kind of employees were customarily covered by a state or Federal award, they were determined by paid rates award. Again, this clearly picks up the situation of Victorian workers as they were covered by a paid rates award when they had award coverage. But, it would not pick up the situation where the former paid rates award was converted to a minimum rates award as has happened for example, in the building industry.

        Paragraph (c) requires the Commission to consider if there is no reasonable prospect of the parties reaching an agreement during the bargaining period.

This provision will be retained and expanded under proposed section 358A as amended by amendment 141. Given the reports cost about $500,000 a year to produce, we think it is reasonable that they move to biennial reporting now that base of data has been established. As such, we can see little need for a report in 1996, as the year will be under two different reform acts.

        Proposed section 170LRA deals with the right to bargain collectively and ensures that Australia's international obligations to encourage and promote collective bargaining is translated into a substantive provision. This is achieved first by ensuring that employees have the right to collectively bargain and to have their organisations represent them in the bargaining process. Secondly, employees are assured that they cannot be required to bargain individually if they prefer to bargain collectively through their organisation. Finally, an organisation of employees is deemed to represent their members unless a contrary intention appears.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Section 170LRB places a positive obligation upon an employer to notify a union with coverage if they wish to negotiate an Australian workplace agreement or certified agreement. Without this provision, the range of bargaining options available to the potential parties are not fully explored. Section 170LRC ensures that an employer cannot discriminate against an employee who prefers to bargain collectively. Without this provision, collective bargaining is a process entirely at the discretion of the employer. It would become, in many circumstances, a case of `take the individual contract on my terms, or no job'. Already state governments like Victoria and various employers like CRA have adopted such an approach.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Special full benches of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission have spelt out that the legislation is based on the need for collective bargaining with the elevation of individual agreement making and a substantial rewriting of the act. This needs to be expressly stated right now or it could be lost in totality. In short, you have the right to support. If you choose not to have support, that is your right as well. It is extremely difficult for many people in many workplaces in Australia to ensure that right to gain support. So we think it should be there as part of Australia's obligation and, obviously, it is the right of employees to choose not to utilise that support.

        We now come to what was Greens (WA) amendment No. 44. It has been replaced by amendments 12 and 13 on revised sheet 217. However, I will not be seeking to deal with them together; I will be moving them separately. Amendment 12 on revised sheet 217 is a repeat of a previous amendment which attempted to include the issue of transgender identity in the various anti-discrimination clauses in the bill.

        It is outrageous that as we head towards the year 2000, lesbians, gay men and people with a transgender identity are still discriminated against in the workplace.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the key aspects of this discrimination relates to employment conditions, such as compassionate and bereavement leave, parental leave, carer's leave and superannuation and workers compensation benefits. This amendment addresses two of these crucial areas as a means of raising the need for addressing these issues in industrial relations law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality is that discrimination is happening now and will continue to happen until we address these issues of discrimination. Lesbians, gays and transgenders are not asking for special rights; they are asking for equal rights. I would like honourable senators to put themselves in the position of a gay or lesbian worker whose long&amp;hyphen;term partner becomes serious ill and requires home care. Can you imagine the anger and frustration when leave to care for that partner is denied because there is no recognition of the relationship, when a fellow worker who may have been married for only a matter of weeks or months is unquestionably granted such leave. I am not saying that they should not be granted leave; I am saying that this is not a special exemption for a minority group but a question of basic human rights.

        I had a request for an interview on this particular section on Western Australian radio. At the end of some questions and answers the interviewer, Liam Bartlett, said, `Don't you think this is a bit odd for a Green senator to

         be moving this, you know?' I said, `Excuse me? Could you explain what you mean?' He said, `For a Green senator to be involved with gay and lesbian issues and transgender identity.' I said, `Isn't it interesting that you haven't asked me why the Greens are involved with industrial relations?' He assumed that Greens senators only deal with the environment, but he did not assume that it was odd that we should be involved in basic human rights or basic participatory democracy issues.

        I then explained that the four pillars of green politics are environmental sustainability, human rights, participatory democracy and peace and disarmament. There was no question as to why we are involved in industrial relations. Perhaps they understood that over the years we have been involved in those issues, but the funny thing is he said that it is odd that we should be involved in fighting for basic human rights for people in the workplace. I thought the question was odd but at least I detected an embarrassed silence—that is what I would like to think—as a result of that response.

        If you were a person who had gone through the process of changing your gender identity and you had children, why should you be picked out from amongst all the workers in your workplace as the one person who is not allowed carers leave, whether it is for children or for a partner? Why should you be picked out as a person who does not have a right when other people do? I commend this amendment to the Senate.

         Clause 170LWB ensures that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has a broad capacity to accept undertakings to rectify disadvantage in circumstances where such action is warranted. As the amendment states, examples of such disadvantaged groups include women, persons whose first language is not English, young workers, part&amp;hyphen;time or casual employees and persons with disabilities. This is an important backstop provision and highlights the importance that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can play in industrial relations issues.

        This amendment deletes subclause (1) of clause 170LZ and replaces it with a new clause that ensures that collective agreements made under this schedule prevail over and are preferred in the legislative scheme to any other form of agreement making, most notably individual contracts, regardless of whether those agreements are made in a state or federal system or before or after the certification of a collective agreement. This is consistent with our previous amendments with respect to the right to collective bargaining.

These specific amendments provide various provisions in relation to existing EFAs that are commensurate with those to be introduced by this Bill in relation to certified agreements.

Any criticisms that we have already made about the various provisions as they apply to certified agreement will of course apply equally in the case of these amendments.

         </emphasis>
         a detailed document explaining the opposition's response to the various government&amp;hyphen;Democrat and Green amendments and detailing our own amendments on schedule 11.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In these brief comments, I would like to focus primarily on the substance of the government&amp;hyphen;Democrat deal in relation to AWAs. At the outset, I should say that the opposition recognises that the amendments to be introduced as part of this deal do represent an improvement on the bill as it was originally drafted. In particular, the introduction of the pre&amp;hyphen;agreement review is welcomed. So too is the application of a no disadvantage test.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For this reason, we will vote in support of those amendments that give effect to the deal. But it should not be thought for one moment that the opposition believes these amendments go far enough. Far from it, we believe the bill, as amended, will still have some significant flaws. I just want to highlight some of the more important ones. First and foremost, we are disappointed that the bill will still allow AWAs to be entered into before employment commences. Blind Freddy can see that this creates the potential for AWAs to be offered to prospective employees as a condition of employment. In fact, not only could blind Freddy see this; so could Senator Murray. In his Senate report at page 342, he had this to say:
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Democrats endorse the views of the Majority report that the ability to enter into individual AWAs with new and prospective employees is a matter of concern.
        </para>
        <para>
         Of course it is, Senator Murray. And, as you know, it is a concern because prospective employees in a weak bargaining period will have no choice but to accept the AWA. How can they possibly be expected to stoically insist on commencing employment on an agreement or under the award? It is this more than anything that will open the floodgates to a wave of individual contracts in the work force; this more than anything will see the downfall of collective bargaining.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again, I remind Senator Murray that, in one of his recommendations in his Senate report on page 339, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is recommended that the bill seek to expressly encourage collective over individual bargaining, but allow for individual bargaining of AWAs where the conditions of the AWA as a whole are superior to the award, and that the employee genuinely and freely agrees to the AWA.
        </para>
        <para>
         Anyone who believes that an employee who accepts an AWA as a condition of employment `genuinely and freely agrees' to it is showing his naivety. No&amp;hyphen;one could ever accuse Mr Reith of this. He knows all too well the effects of this provision. Little wonder that he must have pressed very hard for its retention. It is a pity that the Democrats have wilted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition is also very disappointed that the review of AWAs will largely be carried out by the Employment Advocate and not by the commission. Worse still, the process will be a bureaucratic one conducted in secret without knowledge or intervention by unions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This was, of course, one of the issues on which the Democrats have some form. Their pre&amp;hyphen;election form was certainly impressive. They said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Commission must maintain a central role in vetting all enterprise agreements. Its powers to review enterprise agreements should if anything, be increased, to ensure the balance between work and family does not further decline.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The small business Employment Advocate would complement, but not replace, the AIRC and all
         <break page="5494" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          agreements would still need to be ratified by the AIRC.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We support unions having the right to be heard on matters before the AIRC which have the potential to impact on their members, including test cases and the registration of enterprise agreements with significant flow&amp;hyphen;on potential.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Democrats' Senate report form was also impressive. At page 340, Senator Murray said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Democrats endorse the recommendation of the Majority Report that AWAs must be vetted by the AIRC before approval.

         Now it seems that the Democrats have been nobbled. The minister has been slipping downers into the numerous cups of coffee that he must have proffered to the Democrats during their negotiations—

         This amendment provides that an AWA or ancillary document has no effect before it has been filed (with the Commission), reviewed and approved by the Commission. The amended Bill is deficient in the case of new employees by providing that an AWA has no effect before a filing receipt is issued. This means that an AWA can become effective before it is approved by the Employment Advocate, in which case the new employee must bring civil court proceedings in order to recover any subsequently discovered shortfalls in entitlements. This is a entirely unfair position for new employees. It can only be addressed by ensuring that an AWA cannot become effective at least until the approval process is complete.

         In a section headed "Collective AWAs" it is provided that 2 or more agreements negotiated collectively can be included in the one document if the one employer is a party. This amendment amends the heading to label these agreements "Common document AWAs" and deletes reference to agreements being negotiated collectively. These changes more accurately reflect the true nature of these AWAs. It stresses that they are not collective instruments and are not the outcome of collective bargaining. AWAs are intrinsically individual contracts, and this should not be camouflaged by reference to collective terminology.

         The amendment also provides that the Commission must also be satisfied that the employee has genuinely made the AWA. Further, the Commission must not approve the AWA if the employer has breached, or caused a breach, of the right to bargain collectively or of the prohibition on discrimination against collective bargaining (see Opp (201)). The Commission also must not approve the AWA if it discriminates on any ground, and in particular, if after 22 June 1997 it discriminates by providing for junior rates of pay.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Opposition is moving this amendment because it believes there is an overwhelming case for independent review of AWAs by the Commission before they come into force. This is the only effective way to ensure that employees, particularly the more vulnerable, have genuinely made the agreement (free from any coercion) and have been provided with the requisite terms and conditions of employment. The Commission is best&amp;hyphen;suited to this task. It has the knowledge and experience to properly assess the AWA. Further, because the Commission (as we have seen) plays the reviewing role in the case of certified agreements and applies the same `no disadvantage test', it makes sense to give the same body the task reviewing role in the case of AWAs.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As to the requirement that the AWA be genuinely made, it is important that the Commission consider and determine this to ensure the AWA is not the product of, for eg, threats, failures to inform etc. In relation to the required non&amp;hyphen;approval for breach of the various prohibitions the Opposition believes this is the most effective means of giving effect to these prohibitions (ie ensuring that an agreement which was entered into in breach of the prohibitions will never be effective). As to junior wage rates, these should not be introduced into AWAs for the same reasons—already sated—that they should be removed from certified agreements.

The Opposition moves this amendment because the arguments in support of review of AWAs in the first instance apply equally to variations to AWAs.

         This amendment requires that a termination of an AWA must be approved by the Commission; further, that the Commission can only approve the termination if it is satisfied that the employee genuinely approves the termination and it would be in the public interest for the AWA to be terminated. The Commission should be entitled to exercise a public interest discretion in deciding whether to approve termination of an AWA. Termination may cause drastic consequences for the employee (if there is no new agreement and the employee will return to basic award entitlements) and so the Commission should be entitled to hear why these consequences are being agreed to, and if it thinks necessary, prevent these consequences from occurring. The proposal to permit unilaterally termination after the expiry date is very unfair as it gives the employer disproportionate bargaining power. It will enable an employer to threaten the employee with significant reductions to existing entitlements (ie back to the basic award entitlements) if he or she doesn't agree to proposals for a new agreement by the time of expiry of the old agreement.

This amendment provides that this is the case only to the extent of any inconsistency between the AWA and award or agreement. This is necessary because if this exclusion provision was unfettered it would mean that a Federal award or State award or agreement (dealing with say 50 employment conditions) would be wholly excluded by an AWA (even though the AWA may only deal with say 5 employment conditions). Our amendment means that insofar as the AWA deals with an employment condition (and because of the "no disadvantage" test it will generally provide a superior condition) that will apply, but otherwise the existing award or agreement will apply.

        This amendment provides that an AWA or ancillary document has no effect before it has been filed (with the Commission), reviewed and approved by the Commission. The amended Bill is deficient in the case of new employees by providing that an AWA has no effect before a filing receipt is issued. This means that an AWA can become effective before it is approved by the Employment Advocate, in which case the new employee must bring civil court proceedings in order to recover any subsequently discovered shortfalls in entitlements. This is a entirely unfair position for new employees. It can only be addressed by ensuring that an AWA cannot become effective at least until the approval process is complete.

        In a section headed "Collective AWAs" it is provided that 2 or more agreements negotiated collectively can be included in the one document if the one employer is a party. This amendment amends the heading to label these agreements "Common document AWAs" and deletes reference to agreements being negotiated collectively. These changes more accurately reflect the true nature of these AWAs. It stresses that they are not collective instruments and are not the outcome of collective bargaining. AWAs are intrinsically individual contracts, and this should not be camouflaged by reference to collective terminology.

        The Bill provides that an AWA may be made before the commencement of employment. This amendment deletes this.

This will permit pressure to be applied to vulnerable employees seeking work to accept lower wages and conditions.

        This amendment also inserts a new provision which requires the employer or employee to file the AWA with the Commission and to make an application for approval by the Commission within 21 days of the AWA being made.

The Commission also must not approve the

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Opposition is moving this amendment because it believes there is an overwhelming case for independent review of AWAs by the Commission before they come into force. This is the only effective way to ensure that employees, particularly the more vulnerable, have genuinely made the agreement (free from any coercion) and have been provided with the requisite terms and conditions of employment. The Commission is best&amp;hyphen;suited to this task. It has the knowledge and experience to properly assess the AWA. Further, because the Commission (as we have seen) plays the reviewing role in the case of certified agreements and applies the same `no disadvantage test', it makes sense to give the same body the task reviewing role in the case of AWAs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As to the requirement that the AWA be genuinely made, it is important that the Commission consider and determine this to ensure the AWA is not the product of, for eg, threats, failures to inform etc. In relation to the required non&amp;hyphen;approval for breach of the various prohibitions the Opposition believes this is the most effective means of giving effect to these prohibitions (ie ensuring that an agreement which was entered into in breach of the prohibitions will never be effective). As to junior wage rates, these should not be introduced into AWAs for the same reasons—already sated—that they should be removed from certified agreements.

        This amendment permits an employer or employee to appoint a person (eg. a union) to be his or her agent in relation to any proceedings concerning AWAs. The Opposition believes it is important for an employee to have the option of representation in legal proceedings (as a party principal) by an agent. Unions have traditionally had the capacity to represent employees in this capacity in legal proceedings. It also means that the one agent can bring one proceeding on behalf of a number of employees who are all alleging the same breaches (ie no need for each employee to bring a separate proceeding).

        This amendment inserts a new provision which requires an employer to ensure that the employee has reasonable access to information about persons able to act as a bargaining agent.

Otherwise, an employer mat set out to negotiate with the employee even though the employee is not even aware that he or she can be represented in the negotiations.

Termination may cause drastic consequences for the employee (if there is no new agreement and the employee will return to basic award entitlements) and so the Commission should be entitled to hear why these consequences are being agreed to, and if it thinks necessary, prevent these consequences from occurring. The proposal to permit unilaterally termination after the expiry date is very unfair as it gives the employer disproportionate bargaining power. It will enable an employer to threaten the employee with significant reductions to existing entitlements (ie back to the basic award entitlements) if he or she doesn't agree to proposals for a new agreement by the time of expiry of the old agreement.

This amendment provides that this is the case only to the extent of any inconsistency between the AWA and award or agreement. This is necessary because if this exclusion provision was unfettered it would mean that a Federal award or State award or agreement (dealing with say 50 employment conditions) would be wholly excluded by an AWA (even though the AWA may only deal with say 5 employment conditions).

        It is interesting to note in this regard that only last Friday the New South Wales Supreme Court upheld the decision by the New South Wales equal opportunity commission that NIB Health Funds Ltd had discriminated against two gay men who had applied for family membership for themselves and for the child of one of the men. This is an important decision and comes at a critical time for law reform in relation to gay and lesbian issues. I trust that senators will acknowledge this further confirmation of common law rights in this area and support a very reasonable amendment to avoid discrimination against gays, lesbians and transgenders in relation to parental and carers leave.

        Amendment 18 on revised sheet 217 replaces amendment 50 on sheet 183, and amendment 19 on revised sheet 217 replaces amendment 51. These amend clause 170VJ, the period of operation of Australian workplace agreements, to incorporate a cooling off period of 14 days at the commencement of a contract. It should be acknowledged that the signing of these contracts is one of the most important transactions that can be undertaken in a person's life. There should be the opportunity for some form of cooling off period before this contract, the AWA, takes effect. It does not mean that people cannot start work, but it is before the contract takes effect. I think for less

        This amendment adds a proviso to the clause dealing with bargaining agents to say that `any cost to the employees associated with the bargaining process must be specified at the time the appointment was made'. Whilst subclause (4) of this section covers the issue of coercion, the reality is that, in the context of a contract negotiation, an employee may be encouraged to use a particular bargaining agent and that may incur costs for the employee. If that is the case, the Greens feel it is appropriate that those costs be specified at the time the appointment is made.

        This amendment follows from our amendments in relation to collective bargaining. This amendment states clearly that `an organisation of employees registered under this act'—in most cases a union—`is deemed to be a bargaining agent, unless the contrary intention appears'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is an important amendment as it effectively creates a right for employees to be represented by a union unless the employer and employee agree to the contrary. Many workers may not be aware that they have the right to be represented by a union in negotiations for Australian workplace agreements.
        <break page="5513" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         This amendment changes the onus to the employer to argue that a union is not the most appropriate body to represent the employee's interests. For many of the categories of workers who lack proper bargaining power in the workplace, this amendment may provide a protection against exploitation.

        This amendment strengthens the role of the Employment Advocate with respect to the filing of Australian workplace agreements. The current provisions have two shortcomings. Firstly, the filing of Australian workplace agreements with the Employment Advocate is apparently not a compulsory requirement as clause 170VN merely states that `an AWA or ancillary document may be filed with the Employment Advocate'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, the filing requirements that must be met before the Employment Advocate issues a receipt are largely reliant on an employer's statement that certain conditions have been met. There appears to be no requirement for the Employment Advocate to

        These amendments incorporate a requirement in section 170VO that, where a document is to be witnessed, it must be witnessed by someone who is independent—`by a person or persons who have no direct or personal interest in the Australian workplace agreement'. This suggestion came from a number of women and migrant worker groups which felt that it was important to avoid any potential for these important contracts to be witnessed by people who are connected with the employer. So they are just saying that, like any contract, an independent witness is a good idea. We ask for support for that.

         —It is curious that there is agreement in the original bill and the government&amp;hyphen;Democrat amendment in regard to section 170VF to categorise a non&amp;hyphen;employee as an employee for the purpose of making an agreement about employment. Essentially, that is the position that is being put. There is no way that that position could be justified under what is generally termed the industrial relations power of the constitution, because there is no way that, prior to actual engagement, there is an employee&amp;hyphen;employer relationship. Therefore, there is no way that the High Court would have allowed an agreement made under the constitutional power—which I will term industrial relations—for that to succeed. Obviously, the qualification of the provision for the making of AWAs in section 170VC is designed to get at this contrived arrangement through every other constitutional means possible than the industrial relations power. I
         <break page="5515" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          suppose that subject to, at some stage, some legislation being passed in the Victorian parliament, there will be an amendment to section 170VC or some other legislation to permit the general application of this provision to employees in Victoria, given the statement by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, with regard to handing over that state's industrial relations power to the Commonwealth.

        It is extremely interesting that this arrangement is being arrived at by constitutional means that are not the traditional constitutional basis of the industrial relations legislation of the Commonwealth. I would have to concede that it is not the first time that that has occurred. But in this case I think the only way it is possible for this to be a legitimate prescription is by means of other constitutional provisions than what I will term the industrial relations provision—the power of the Commonwealth in relation to conciliation and arbitration to prevent and settle industrial disputes. Of course, on many occasions the High Court has held that you cannot have an industrial dispute unless there is an employer&amp;hyphen;employee relationship. It is just impossible to imagine the circumstances in which the High Court would find that prior to actual engagement such circumstances existed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are trying to get through this bill rather expeditiously in the committee stage at the moment, so there is not much point in my going to the particular High Court tests which I think would justify the statement that I have made. What we have is a provision which I would suggest is contrived to justify what we would say is not justifiable: that is, to say that prior to an employee being in any bargaining position at all, the employee can enter into an agreement—no doubt proffered by the employer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The employee has no bargaining power if they want the job, unless they are in a very special skills situation, so we are talking about the majority of employees in this country. Young people and casuals are all being placed in the situation of having no bargaining power at all when they change jobs. I believe that this particular provision in the legislation is a particularly unfortunate
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and even immoral provision in relation to the so&amp;hyphen;called questions of choice that this government is pursuing with this legislation. Choice in this case will be the choice of the employer only.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats' position is that such agreements can be made prior to entering into the employment relationship, provided the matter is dealt with by the industrial commission rather than just by the Employment Advocate. I suppose there is a rationale which suggests that at least there is a further testing of the arrangement to ensure that what arises out of the agreement is something which satisfies the minimum conditions test. What that does not satisfy is the question of a freely reached agreement—a genuine agreement. A genuine agreement is reached between bargaining equals.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This legislation now establishes provisions for an agreement to be made between unequal parties in unfair circumstances and circumstances which will be prejudicial to many employees, young and old, whose particular skills do not give them enhanced bargaining power. The opposition amendments would delete that peculiar provision which, although it has been changed by the government&amp;hyphen;Democrat amendment 134, retains the position of pre-employment agreement by employees. The Labor Party amendment removes this but requires that the AWA be filed with the commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In terms of the way that agreements are dealt with, I indicated in the second reading stage the difficulty with allowing a test of agreements simply by a member of the Public Service employed under the Public Service Act 1922. There is the question of training, the level at which the employee is engaged within service and, therefore, their level of skill and responsibility. We are looking at a fairly significant test, a test that relates to one of the most fundamental contracts which any person makes and which almost every person in this country, if they make no other agreement, makes to enter into an employment relationship.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is why I think this is fundamentally flawed legislation. The amendment now
        <break page="5516" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         before the committee ought to have the support of thinking members of this chamber. Although I do not expect that the Democrats will waver from the agreement, I think they will regret the fact that they have entered into an agreement which establishes such prejudicial conditions for employees, for potential employees, for the disadvantaged and for the powerless within the working community.

I believe that the AWAs will introduce a massive shift of industrial matters from the federal tribunals to the state ones and, in particular, I would have thought, to the magistrates court. Is that intended by the government and the Democrats? If it is, has any communication been made with the states to make available their courts with this increased work? Have any arrangements been made to increase the legal aid that will be needed to finance that?

         The original proposal in the bill was that the report should be prepared every three years. We can only assume from this ridiculously long reporting period that the government is worried that the reports will be an embarrassment to it. This is proof that it has good reason to be worried.

         More fundamentally, this proposal makes a mockery of the government's much vaunted claim that the parliament would regain its sovereignty over the executive—the government would have to answer to the parliament and would be more open to it. That has gone the way of the ministerial guidelines of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). They are not worth the paper they are printed on.

         This cynicism by the government does not come as a surprise, but support of it by the Australian Democrats did. What has been achieved as a result of this deal is that, instead of a three&amp;hyphen;year reporting period, we will have a two&amp;hyphen;year reporting period. More importantly, this will mean that there will be only one report before the next election.

         The Bill requires a report about developments in certified agreements and AWAs every 3 years. This amendment requires such a report every year. Presently the requirement is every year. Three years is simply too long a reporting period for the report to be any use. The existing annual reports are widely referred to and utilised, and are an invaluable source of information about the effects of bargaining.

        Under section 358A, as amended, the department will be required to report biennially on developments in relation to enterprise bargaining and the making of certified agreements and AWAs. The reports must particularly look at the effect of bargaining on women, part-time employees, persons from a non-English speaking background and young people. This section continues the reporting which the Democrats insisted be included in the Labor act in 1993, which they resisted, but on a biennial rather than annual basis.

        Two reports have already been issued in respect of 1994 and 1995, and the next, Senator Sherry, will be due in respect of 1996 and 1997—in other words, two reports before the next election—building on the base provided by the two current reports. We believe that the reporting process ensures that a close eye is kept on the industrial reform process and its effect on disadvantaged workers. With the basic data now established and given the cost of creating these reports, we have been persuaded that it is appropriate to now move to biennial reporting. However, we did reject the government's original proposal of triennial reporting as simply involving too long a period between reports.

        I would like to make a few remarks on this schedule. There is only one principal issue I wish to address. I and my colleagues have previously addressed the rest or it will be covered in the document I will incorporate. The issue I want to address is one that is vitally important for the future of the country—arrangements for trainees and apprentices. Everyone should understand that, regrettably, trainees and apprentices have been sold out by these provisions. This is confirmed by the amendments which the Democrats have agreed to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to see that the government and Democrats amendments have made special provision for trainees and apprentices. Trainees and apprentices will be delighted to know that they are to be treated differently; they will not be so delighted when they learn that they are being treated worse. For everyone else, the new no disadvantage test will effectively ensure their take-home pay cannot be reduced under a workplace agreement. Not so for trainees and apprentices. Their guarantee is that their award wage rate cannot be reduced under a workplace agreement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What does this mean in practical terms? Trainees and apprentices in the future may, under a workplace agreement, be paid only for the hours spent in productive employment. Any time spent in training, whether on the job or not, can be regarded as unproductive. Trainees and apprentices will not be paid for this time. In other words, trainees and apprentices can have their take&amp;hyphen;home pay cut under these provisions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a clear and unambiguous breach by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of the rock solid guarantee that no worker would be
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         worse off under this industrial relations policy. If you are a trainee or an apprentice, there is no doubt that you can be worse off. This regrettably does not surprise me, given that the government has been in the business of redefining its election promises as core and non-core commitments. I can only assume that the government's election commitment that the take&amp;hyphen;home pay of trainees and apprentices would not be cut is now regarded as a non-core promise. It is regrettable and a great pity that Mr Howard did not tell this to kids on traineeships and apprenticeships before the election.

        What staggers me is the Democrats say they will support this breach of promise. I am reminded—I do not like to be—of Senator Stott Despoja's plaintive speech in the second reading debate on the subject. She said:

Senator Stott Despoja cannot have it both ways. She cannot come into the chamber criticising the inadequacies of government proposals only to vote for them. She certainly cannot wander around the country claiming she represents the interests

         —I thought there might have been a response to Senator Sherry's comments because this is a very important matter. These issues were fought for in the late 1950s and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          early 1960s, that is to say that training for apprentices, particularly by 1967 in any event, was recognised and paid for. A considerable amount of work was done at that stage. I can only speak from personal experience from 1959 onwards. I can certainly recall the discussions that took place over payment of apprentices for their time off either during the week or their block time off for training at tech schools. All of this was worked for and it was difficult.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The situation was that, obviously, trainees were gainfully employed or engaged in productive employment prior to then because they were training on the job, but new training techniques developed. As those new training techniques developed, employers required that training be absorbed by the apprentices by dint of time off for training. I do not think the block training system came in at that particular stage but it certainly came in not long after—I wish my memory was a bit clearer than it is tonight. At that particular stage, the apprentices were not about to lose pay as the trade union movement did not think they ought to be losing pay by reason of a demand by employers that they should be receiving training, and much of it block training.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So now we have a situation whereby new skills and new ways of dealing with the training of apprentices will be required and it seems odd that, in such a situation where there will be further demand for apprentices, young apprentice technicians will be required to absorb more and more skills. They will be required to undertake education at times when they are not working on the job. It is very significant, I think, and regrettable that at this time we have what Senator Sherry has described, that is, a situation whereby we are being asked to treat those people differently. In other words, we are being asked to vote for a provision which will not give the apprentices and technical trainees that rock solid guarantee that their pay will not be cut.

        As Senator Sherry said, it will be cut if the decision is made that they will only be paid for time spent in productive employment. I agree with what Senator Sherry said. This is a very crucial issue in this piece of legislation

         —I want to speak about amendment 142 to schedule 13 of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This amendment does two things: first, it establishes the no disadvantage test for certified agreements and AWAs in preference to the government's originally proposed seven minimum conditions; and, second, it outlines special case conditions for persons engaged in apprenticeships and traineeships.
        </para>
       </talk.start>

        The no disadvantage test will seek to determine where the terms and conditions of employment of an agreement would result on balance in a reduction of the overall terms and conditions of employment of employees under the relevant awards and any other Commonwealth or state law. The establishment of the no disadvantage test is, in our view, a major advance on the original seven minimum conditions proposed by the government. The test does not just provide a broad protection in comparison to the entire award for unions and employees but also provides a higher level of flexibility for employers in packaging the overall mix of employment conditions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to speak briefly on sections 170XC and 170XD—the special cases in relation to employees undertaking traineeships and apprenticeships. It is a hard choice at times to identify which provisions of this bill have been most misrepresented by the ALP, but I think these sections would be a close favourite. Let us start with the argument that this will lead to a 20 per cent reduction in apprentices' wages because current award rates will be discounted for non-productive time. This is clearly not the case.

         Sections 170XC(1) and 170XD(3) make it quite clear that the special case exercise involves the approved training authority determining the amount of training time in the current apprenticeships or traineeships and setting this as the benchmark. The approved training authority is then required to determine what the proportion is in the new training arrangements and to establish a percent age between the two which then forms the discount for the wages.

        Thus, for example, if the award provides for a second-year apprenticeship of $300 a week—and to get that you have to spend a day a week in training—the non-productive percentage is 20 per cent. If the apprentice then agrees to an AWA—and he has to agree—including an approved accelerated training regime of two days a week, the percentage becomes 40 per cent. That would mean that the apprentice's salary, instead of being $300 for four days work would be $225 for three days work. But he has to agree.

        The Australian Democrats have insisted on a number of additional protections for apprentices and trainees. In particular, we have included a new definition of an approved training authority in section 170X, which covers state training authorities that exercise approval powers in relation to traineeships or apprenticeships, industry training bodies or bodies which meet the criteria on disallowable regulations. This precludes the approval function being given to local chambers of commerce or employer groups as some have suggested.

        The exchange of letters between the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, and Senator Kernot, which have been read into the transcript, make it clear that apprenticeships and traineeships will be approved only if they comply with the national training framework and lead to a nationally recognised accreditation. The letter also restates the government's commitment to move towards a competency based—not an aged based—wage system for trainees and apprentices and, consistent with this, to offer a fourth $220 a week income support pay point, which the Democrats achieved in addition, for employees who have already completed the equivalent of AQF2&amp;hyphen;level training.

        The no disadvantage test provides further protection for these workers in that an AWA or CA can only be approved if on balance it provides no reduction in award conditions. Section 83BB(2) will require the Employment Advocate to pay particular regard to the needs of trainees and apprentices in exercising their
        <break page="5532" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         powers, including their powers of vetting and approval of AWAs. Combined, this is a tight package of protections which allows the flexibility of the government's MAATS apprenticeship system to get off the ground while ensuring that the system operates with the interests of trainees and apprentices at the forefront and adequately protected.

        The one issue that I want to address is the use of injunctions in industrial relations. One of the features of this bill is the increased use of injunctions in dealing with industrial disputes. We see it here in this schedule: injunctions to enforce commission orders; injunctions against people paying strike pay; and, later, when we deal with secondary boycotts, we will find injunctions being introduced to enforce the most draconian provisions in this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problem is that injunctions in the industrial relations context are a very blunt instrument. They can be awarded without the court giving any consideration to the merits of the dispute. They do not act to resolve the dispute but merely to stamp out its manifestations. Injunctions also expose unions and unionists to great jeopardy. Breach of an injunction is a serious matter and can expose the union or unionist to unlimited financial penalties for contempt of court.

         The government knows all this. That is why they are making injunctions available, and in far wider circumstances. What is extraordinary is that the Democrats also understand this. Senator Murray in his report said at page 360:

         Why then, Senator Murray, do you facilitate them? Why be a party to increasing their use in industrial relations? I can remember Senator Murray in Melbourne during the Senate committee hearings telling the members of the International Centre for Trade Union Rights that he understood the inherent problems in ex parte injunctions—he did not even need their advice at that stage. Now he is going to vote in favour of them.

         We want to do something about injunctions in this schedule. If we cannot delete the injunction power, we at least want to modify it to considerably reduce its destructive potential against unions and their members. Our amendments propose two things. Firstly, we propose that an injunction, whether interim or final, cannot be granted in the absence of the other party unless the court is satisfied that the applicant has been given notice of the application to the other person. This ensures that an employer cannot rush off to the court behind the union's back to get an interim injunction.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, we propose that an interim injunction cannot be granted unless the court is satisfied that, first, the applicant is likely to succeed at the trial of the action and that, second, not granting the injunction will inevitably expose the applicant to loss or harm for which an award of damages is a wholly inadequate remedy. These strict requirements before an interim injunction will be ordered will at least ensure that the merits of the dispute will be heard by the court before an injunction will be ordered.

          The Bill defines "industrial action" to not include action by an employee based on a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to health or safety provided the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction to work elsewhere. This amendment removes the necessity for the risk to be imminent. It also deletes the proviso. The Opposition moves this amendment because the requirement that the risk be imminent is onerous and unnecessary, especially in such an important area as health and safety. The requirement concerning directions will simply create uncertainty and confusion. The judgement about what is "reasonable" will differ from person to person and circumstance to circumstance.

There is no need for additional power in the Commission to make orders stopping industrial action.

          The Bill provides for the payment of compensation and for injunctions relating to payment or acceptance of strike pay. These amendments delete these provisions. In relation to the injunction provision the Opposition is concerned that injunctions, in an industrial relations context, will be a very blunt instrument. Breach of an injunction is also very serious, exposing unions to unlimited financial penalties for contempt of court. In relation to the compensation provision the Opposition is concerned that these could lead to unlimited compensation awards. Such compensation awards have the potential to prevent an organisation from properly representing the interests of its members because of fear of being "sued out of existence".

          The Opposition moves these amendments because the "next best thing" is to removing the injunction power is to considerably reduce its destructive potential against unions. Similarly, the "next best thing" to removing the unlimited compensation provisions is to place a cap on damages to considerably reduce the destructive potential of unlimited damages. Indeed, when Margaret Thatcher reintroduced common law actions against trade unions she also introduced a cap on the damages that could be recovered. The cap we recommend reflects the amounts introduced by Thatcher.

          The Bill provides that an organisation can be deregistered if it or its members fail to comply with an injunction restraining industrial action or the payment or acceptance of strike pay.

There is no suggestion that companies should be deregistered if they fail to comply with these provisions.

        Amendment 143 is a small evidentiary change to section 127 to require the Commission to hear and determine applications for directions orders as quickly as possible. While it is expected that use of section 127 directions will be few and far between, and that the Commission has an absolute discretion not to grant such relief, the amendment recognises that where inappropriate industrial action
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         is causing significant damage, then obviously there must be a duty clearly on the Commission to act quickly.

        The Democrats will support the amended section 127 because we believe that it is incumbent on defenders of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that the Commission as the powers to enforce its orders. The current procedures of fines and bans clauses simply has not been effective and it is not unusual to find unions defying orders and recommendations of the Commission. As a result, the Commission has at times become almost reluctant to make an order or recommendation that it knows will be ignored. We believe that if the unions wish to have broader access to arbitration in the Commission, the quid pro quo must be that they respect the Commission and its decisions. And section 127, with directions orders, and with access to injunctions if those directions orders are defied, is, in our view an appropriate means of achieving that.

        The provisions are very similar to the provision of the draft Industrial Relations Bill put up by Labor in 1987, in turn based on recommendation of the comprehensive Hancock Inquiry, but was subsequently withdrawn under represser from the union movement in 1988. I commend the provisions to the Senate.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Amendments 144 and 145 re-instate section 166A into the Industrial Relations Act. This section provides for a compulsory period of conciliation to a maximum of 72 days before an employer can commence common law action against a union or employee in relation to a dispute. The provision reflects the current act, but with a few technical changes to ensure that unions do not engage in stop-start action to legally avoid the provisions, and to make it clear that it also contains a provision making it clear that action in breach of a direction of a State industrial authority is not protected by the section.

        Combined with the exclusion of primary boycotts from the Trade Practices Act, other than the narrow category of primary boycotts involving the movement of goods in and out of Australia, this provision will ensure that primary boycotts are dealt with in a very similar way to how they are now by the AIRC, with the added enforcement provisions by the directions orders process.

         I discovered the following: in the last 20 years in this field, 212 injunctions were applied for and 56 were granted. So the courts are very careful about granting them. Of those 56, only six were ex parte. So about three per cent are ex parte. I think that means we do not have to be as concerned that injunctions are the weapon we might think they are, because the courts are very careful about granting them.

        It is quite a difficult debate to be involved with sometimes tonight, because if people have incorporated comments about entire areas, including Greens (WA) amendments, there may well be comments that have been made about my amendments which I will not have had the opportunity to know about or respond to. That is something I would like put on the record tonight. It should be noted that, in the outcome, if there are comments about what we have done or said, it makes it extremely difficult and very unfair if those comments are incorporated without anybody having a chance to respond to the particular issues that we are putting up.

        Having said that, amendments Nos 77 and 78 amend the clause on payments in relation to periods of industrial action to avoid a potentially outrageous implication. It is possible—I am sure this was purely unintentional—that, as the clause currently stands, an employer must not make a payment to a worker who is engaged in industrial action, such as a work to rules campaign or a ban on administering dole diaries, which is a contemporary example. It might also include employees engaged in a campaign of, as we mentioned before in relation to workers' health and safety, avoiding a dangerous situation or

        These two amendments seek to limit the definition of industrial action for the purposes of the new part VIIIA. If these changes are not made, employers would have the capacity, and probably the requirement, to avoid their obligations to pay employees for industrial action, such as work to rule arrangements, even though the employees were gainfully, productively and fully employed. The current definition of industrial action applies to a wide range of action. The idea that workers could be not just made but prohibited under the law from receiving payment in circumstances where their action falls short of the withdrawal of labour is fundamentally inequitable and unjust. The bill as currently structured actually prohibits an employer from paying an employee for any period of industrial action, regardless of its nature or effect.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These amendments would not be necessary if the new part VIIIA, which deals with payments in relation to periods of industrial action, was not inserted into the legislation. The government is using a pre&amp;hyphen;existing broad definition of industrial action, which was inserted to increase the commission's powers to intervene in a wide range of disputes, to pervert the intention of that original use. The concept is perverted in this new part VIIIA by ensuring that workers must be docked pay even when the industrial action being undertaken not only is short of strike action but, in many cases, causes little or no damage to the employer.

        There are many examples where work to rules campaigns or even some other minor industrial action has brought about beneficial changes in the workplace. Perhaps people think that, if they are going to be killed for a sheep, they might as well be killed for a lamb. That means that, instead of taking sensible, low key industrial action, they may well choose to take strike action. That is what it says. You get the same penalty for strike action; you get your pay docked as you would for limited industrial action. It says `must'. It does not say `may'. Perhaps the minister could clarify whether that is not the case.

This proposed section says that if there is a work to rules campaign, the employees must be penalised by the employer. What a remarkable situation. The disputants would not go to court and have a hearing at which the matter would be adjudicated. The law says that employees who take part in such an action must be penalised.

         —This new industrial environment sounds like a pretty scary place. It means that an employer can ask almost anything of an employee, however reasonable or unreasonable, even if an employee says, `No, I do not think that is a reasonable thing to do for various reasons, including health and safety.' We will not have an improved workplace but a workplace of fear and at times exploitation. If, by the end of the week, you do have not quite enough money to pay your employee, I am sure you can trump up a few things you can require your work force  to do to which they will have to say, `I really cannot do that.' So maybe by the end of the week you can manage to dock them one or two days a week. That is a rather bizarre scenario, but we are dealing with a rather bizarre bill and a very bizarre part to the bill.

        I was hoping to have heard from the Democrats by this stage. I am happy to defer this issue if there is any chance whatsoever that there might be a movement in relation to this very silly proposal by the government. It is a proposal which will have many unwanted responses from employers who may not have any desire to dock their employees for what could be a ban limitation or restriction on the performance of work. It could be almost anything.

        You would know from your own experience that that is not always the case. Things are changing and we hope this bill might change things more. However, if you build up a straw man and say that employers will direct people to do totally unreasonable things, the fact is they already have agreements in place as to what their terms of employment are, the sorts of tasks they will be undertaking—job descriptions and so forth. Again, you have built up a straw man which you seek to knock over. People who want to understand this matter should realise that is what you are doing.

If they decide, because they do not want to disrupt patient care, that they do not want to do a certain amount of paperwork, then the Tasmanian government is directed by this legislation, if they can be, to withhold all payment for the entirety of the shift. That is what this provision is proposing to say.

        I do not know whether the government is seeking to impress upon groups like nurses, who do not want to take direct action but want to make an industrial point, that they have to either lose their pay and perform the work and make a token gesture, which will be pointless and have no effect on their employer, or alternatively say, `We'll go all the way.' You are saying to us, `If you do anything you don't get a penny.'

        I just wonder whether this provision is going to push groups who might take a minor action to a point where they will say, `What the hell. We are going to lose pay. Why don't we take the action?' Or will it be teachers? A lot of the teaching profession are seeking coverage by federal awards. From time to time they take action. They say that they are not going to fill in term reports or the like. If they say that they are not going to fill in term reports, how long do you dock their pay—until they do it? Are you saying to teachers, `Well, you might as well go all the way?' But when you do that you come back to this question of orders to stop or prevent industrial action.

        Is the agenda of the government with these amendments to come back and say, `We are going to force people to take action because we can injunct to stop it?' The culture of the amendments may be to remove the rights of many employees to take any form of industrial action in real terms. I think the Democrats ought to look very closely at this provision because I do not think they fully appreciate the impact that this will have on the industrial climate, particularly for groups who have traditionally been reluctant to take the absolute form of industrial action.

          the Democrats at least sleep on this. We have to take from the silence so far on the matter that they have not understood the import of what this section means.

        It has not been thought through by the government, let alone the Democrats.

        If this goes through, employees in any workplace in Australia who take such action are going to be penalised.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The question arises: what happens when an employer asks employees to do something which is illegal, which infringes upon workplace safety provisions or some other law providing for the protection of the wider society? I imagine the court is going to have the commonsense at the end of the day to make sure that the workers get back their pay. But in the meantime they are going to have to be docked. They are going to have to take a penalty. The employer is obliged, under this proposed section of this legislation, to impose that penalty or presumably that employer is going to be in breach of the law. What a remarkable set of circumstances.

        I say to the Democrats: at least take this home and look at it again. Senator Margetts has brought up a matter of extraordinary importance to the workplace in Australia.

Yes, it is black and white. It is very clear that what Senator Margetts has said is dead right. The matter is deadly serious. But there is still this silence from Senator Murray and the Democrat benches. It is a telling moment. It will be gone very shortly and it is a matter for prudence to be brought into place so that at least overnight consideration is given to the matter that Senator Margetts has brought before the chamber.

         —I am a little confused as to the response given by the parliamentary secretary when Senator Murray asked him about the effect of 187AD of the workplace relations bill. As far as I can see, it deals with the power of the court in respect of contraventions of sections 187AA or 187AB. But 187AA is not really relevant, because it requires the employer not to make a payment to an employee for a period in which the employee engages in industrial action, and then it qualifies that.

        I add another point. Given the point that the parliamentary secretary made in relation to a payment being withheld because of an employee refusing to obey an instruction to perform an illegal act, I ask: what about the case where an employee has a strong objection based on conscience at a particular time to the performance of a particular task? Is that not then requiring the employer to not make payment to the employee in respect of the exercise of that objection based on conscience?

        The second point that I want to make relates to contracts that are entered into from time to time. I am not talking about AWAs; I am talking about contracts for the performance of a job. The clauses of a number of contracts contain a provision that requires the contractor to perform the tasks in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth or the state. Section 187AA(3) says `a contravention of subsection (1) or (2) is not an offence'. It  is not an offence under this, but the party to

         the contract to receive the supply of goods could insist that a contractor who has made payment to an employee for a period in which the employee engages in industrial action had breached the provisions of the contract. That would be so, would it not?

        This serves to highlight that, regardless of the argument that is put to the Australian Democrats in a very clear, concise and well argued way, time and time again you simply have a closed mind. Through the hundreds of amendments that have been moved, you have not been prepared to concede on at least one occasion that the deal you entered into with the government was wrong on at least one point.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are two key aspects to which the opposition is strongly opposed. We are firmly opposed to the creation of enterprise unions. The problems they will create for the industrial relations system as a whole are manifest. The introduction of enterprise unions will lead to a multiplicity of unions, to the detriment of employers and the community as a whole. It will create federally registered unions which cannot be party to a federal award, thereby creating a gap in representation rights. It will permit the federal registration of a union which would traditionally, and indeed exclusively, be registered under state law. This will create a conflict between federal and state industrial relations systems.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is achieved in return? We do not think anything. At worst, these enterprise unions will be nothing but bosses unions. At best, there must be severe doubts whether a union which is exclusively centred on one enterprise can, even assuming adequate funding, appropriately represent the interests of members better than an industrial union. And what of its funding base? How can a union with so few members and such an inadequate funding base properly represent its
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         members? We do not think it can and we believe that the government knows it.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition is also firmly committed to opposing any changes to the existing `conveniently belong' rule. The Democrats did their best to prevent the repeal of the rule and they succeeded, but I must say that the compromise they have reached—as is often the case with compromises—does not improve their position and actually creates a provision which is so complicated that many industrial relations practitioners around Australia must be scratching their heads wondering what it all means.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The great tragedy is that the existing rules operated effectively to avoid what can be the harmful effects of union competition, including demarcation disputes and the problems associated with employers having to deal with a multiplicity of unions. I cannot recall at the committee hearings any employer support for the concept of competition between unions at a workplace brought about by the types of provisions proposed. In fact, I can recall only employer evidence that was supportive of the existing provisions in the existing act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The changes to the rule could lead to an increase in union conflicts as contests about effective representation develop. It is also extremely unfair that enterprise associations are exempted from the operation of the rule. There is no justification for this other than discrimination against organisations that are not enterprise organisations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second vital issue is the question of disamalgamation. The opposition's position on this issue is crystal clear. The opposition is concerned that the amalgamation proposals in this bill may create a multiplicity of unions. However, we accept the disamalgamation proposal in so far as it relates to the original preamalgamation constituent unions because we do not believe this parliament can prevent a union which has democratically amalgamated with another from democratically disamalgamating.

         But, as to that part of the disamalgamating proposal that permits constituent unions to further disamalgamate to their state branches, the rationale to which I have referred simply does not apply. Those individual state branch es did not individually elect to amalgamate and, therefore, there is no question of their individually electing to disamalgamate.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third and final issue I wish to address is one that I have discussed before—right of entry. The opposition totally rejects the regulation of right of entry exclusively by a statutory scheme. The regulation of right of entry by the commission on a case-by-case basis is the only appropriate system because only it can take into account individual circumstances peculiar to particular employees or industries.

        The Health Services Union of Australia has pointed out a very important example to the opposition. Many of its members work as health care workers in residential nursing homes. The relevant award takes this into account and permits unions to access residential homes so that the union can look after the interests of its members. Yet this bill prohibits the entry of unions into premises used for residential purposes without the permission of the occupier.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What happens to health care workers in residential nursing homes? There is effectively no right of entry. The opposition will move an amendment to remove this particular problem and I urge the Democrats to support it. They must realise that this is but one example of the practical problems which the statutory scheme has that they have signed up to.

        There is another example which I am sure will concern Senator Bourne—the problem of looking after the interests of outworkers. An effective right of entry provision requires entry not only to the place of outwork but also to the place from which the work is outsourced—that is where the records are and that is where the boss is. Under these provisions, unions have no right of entry to these places. We will move an amendment to address the problem and hope the Democrats will join with us.

For reasons already stated, the Opposition believes that if the existing `conveniently belong' rule is to be modified to permit greater competition between unions any restraints on that competition should be removed.

        Unions that we deal with already have difficulty getting on top of current industrial relations legislation. Clayton's unions, obviously, do not have the kinds of resources, researchers and legal advice necessary. They do not have people who can work with specific groups of people. That means they will be, if you like, dependent on the information that is largely provided by the employer.

The only occasion there has been a division is when there has been no amendment put to the item. Then the question is that the bill, as amended, stand as printed.

          —Opposition amendment 312 was to oppose item 17. But that is not on any running sheet and not proposed. What we have just done is to deal with opposition amendments Nos 313 and 314. After they were negatived, we had opposition amendments Nos 316 to 318 and they were lost on the voices. What we have now is the introduction of something for the first time in this committee debate. May I just say that it is the first time that this has occurred in this particular debate.

         What we are facing here—I remind the chamber that this is quite important—is the opposition, having put forward a proposal which was defeated on a tied vote, having another bite at the cherry by, in effect, putting a motion that the clause stand as printed. Is that what the opposition is doing? Is the opposition moving that the clause stand as printed? If it is, surely that is a ruse, because they do not want the clause to stand as printed. What they are attempting to do here is, by a device, move something that they are not in support of. We used to do that in the Trades Hall from time to time.

        The Democrats oppose these amendments. These seek to make clear that the amalgamation of unions is to be encouraged and facilitated. The simple fact is that the reality of amalgamation has not met the promise. Unionisation rates continue to fall, unions have spent more energy on restructuring than on recruiting. While we supported the union amalgamation rules when first raised seven years ago, I think it is now appropriate that the Act adapt a more neutral stance on these issues.

        This amendment seeks to establish the definition of enterprise for the purposes of enterprise unions. The definition is different from that used for enterprise agreements and deliberately so. An enterprise union can be formed in relation to a simple employer or an operationally distinct part of an employer. The term "operationally distinct" was deliberately chosen. As the explanatory memorandum makes
        <break page="5565" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         clear, the fact that a place is a separate workplace does not make it operationally distinct. In jointly moving this amendment, I believe that "operationally distinct" requires something considerably more than that. It must be an operation, a distinct operation. In industrial terms, that would mean an operation capable of organising and negotiating its own industrial affairs. In major corporations, that would mean an autonomous business unit. In the Government sector, it would probably mean a Government department or statutory authority. What the Commission should seek to avoid is a situation where the senior managers charged with industrial negotiations end up dealing with more than one enterprise union in their operation. This is a fairly tight criteria and combined with the tight criteria in proposed 189(1C), it will ensure that truly independent, truly enterprise based unions can be formed, and not sham bosses unions as part of a divide and conquer campaign.

        Following extensive submission from both unions and employers opposed to the Government's competitive unionism model, the Democrats have been able to persuade the Government to re-instate a version of the "conveniently belong" rule. This will avoid the free for all which would have been the result of the original bill. Unions already spend millions of dollars a year trying to steal each other's members, and the Democrats do not believe that the public interest would have been served by freeing this up completely.

        Under the compromise in this amendment, where a union applies for a rule to cover areas covered by another union, the current union can object on the ground that the members could more conveniently belong to it and be more effectively represented by it. The second criteria is a particular improvement in our view. It means that if a union is failing to perform, it can find itself liable to competition. But, if it is performing, then it should keep its coverage.

        The amendments also set the extensive rules for registration of enterprise unions.

A union which meets these criteria would be supported. But, the amendment would avoid the establishment of bosses union, unions like the Metway Staff Association and the Bond University

        The statutory scheme has three main elements.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, union officials will be required to obtain a general permit for entry from the Industrial registrar. Abuse of right of entry provisions could result in the permit being removed. This is based roughly on the provisions in the NSW Carr legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, the scheme establishes a general right of entry where the union has award coverage to a workplace for the purposes of consultations with employees, on the giving of 24 hours notice. The NSW legislation provides for 48 hours notice, so 24 hours is in our view more appropriate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Third, the scheme establishes a right to inspect wages books and investigate breaches more thoroughly where the union has a member or members. This distinction we believe is appropriate. Employers have complained to me of unions with no members, merely out of spite, coming in and tying up the employers books and generally acting in an unhelpful way.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In our view, unions should be concerned about the rights of the 33 per cent of members that are their members. They must have the right to recruit and meet with employees. We have provided that. But, in terms of enforcement, that should come back to only where they have members.
       </para>

        It should be pointed out that while this statutory scheme applies in relation to awards, nothing precludes the parties including even more generous right of entry provision in certified agreements or AWAs.

        I want to speak briefly to proposed section 285D(3), which makes it clear that a person in exercising right of entry is not entitled to enter any part of premises used for residential purposes except with the permission of the occupier.

And even then, entry could be agreed to with the permission of the occupier. The occupier is not the employer, but the residential occupier, the aged person in the room. Clearly, the common facilities of the unit, such as common rooms, dining rooms,

         —Senator Collins, when you did refer to the government earlier the question was seeking a quite general response in relation to outworkers and it is helpful to me that you have refined that somewhat. Senator Murray is obviously quite capable of putting his own position on the record. Again, I say to the senator that a number of honourable senators—particularly Senator Sherry on behalf of the opposition—have helped the progress of this bill by freely agreeing, without any coercion whatsoever, to incorporate their comments. They have given me the courtesy of showing me those comments in plenty of time before seeking leave. I am sure Senator Murray would give any other senator that same courtesy.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Of course, it is open to any senator—not that I encourage it—to refuse leave if they are worried that they will have trouble getting access to those comments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to the right of entry provisions in particular, which I am sure you are concerned about, when it comes to outworkers, subsection 285BGB(4) provides capacity for a permit holder to require an employer to produce records at a premises at which the employees work and at some other agreed place. In other words, the fact that the employees do not work at the employer's premises does not preclude the permit holder from gaining access to the time sheets, pay sheets and other relevant documents. We believe that a number of concerns which have, without any doubt, been legitimately put and are accommodated under subsection 285B allow, as I said, permit holders to require employers to produce those records.

This particular point of the legislation is perhaps the most serious because it is outworkers in the existing system who were being strained to the utmost.

        Those of us who were on the economics committee received evidence from a number of people. I would like to refer the parliamentary secretary to the real world of outworking. I refer to evidence that Ms Annie Delaney, the outwork coordinator for the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, gave the committee as an example of typical conditions outworkers were working under. She cited the cases of Mrs Mi and Mrs Nguyen. She said:

        They have four children aged from 3 to 18 years old. One of the children, who is now 18 years old, has been involved in production for the last five years. The younger children, aged 16 and 12, are also involved in production daily. They estimate that the children work an average of three to four hours a night and from 10 to 12 hours each day of the weekend.

        They state that they have no choice but to get their children involved to assist them. They state that the family's average income for the total hours is approximately $500 to $700 a week. They state that without their children's help they could not get enough to get by on.

        They inform me also that they have been subject to intense pressure and intimidation to complete work in less than the originally allocated time.

        They state it is not uncommon to be given work to be completed in five days but then the next day they begin receiving calls from the contractor to finish the work earlier.

        They state it makes them worried all the time about whether they will receive the money they are owed.

        If there cannot be an agreement, if the employer says that you have to travel 500 miles to go to see them and the union or other representative does not like that, they can go to the commission and say that this employer is being unreasonable and the commission can demand that documents be produced. But the reference to `agreed place' is not agreed as per anybody else but basically that if it is reasonable there be an agreed place that that is where the records be produced.

        That is what we are doing. It is a fair dinkum move and it is a step in the right direction. The situation you have just spent 10 minutes outlining is what has happened under your system.

        Whilst the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) claims that the government's preferred position is Badgerys Creek, it becomes clearer day by day as each announcement is made regarding the current environmental impact study that Holsworthy could well become the site for Sydney's second airport.

        Recently, on 6 November, the minister released a series of maps setting out the runway options for the two sites being examined—that is, Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. In the media statement the minister made that day, he indicated that the EIS team had developed two options for both Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. Further on in the statement he said that the runway locations and alignments on which the designs for the airport will be based are described in the brochure released by the EIS team.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The environmental consultants that have been engaged to undertake the EIS are a firm called Rust PPK Ltd. From what I can gather, they have had limited experience in respect of undertaking work on the development of a major airport. They, along with the Department of Transport and Regional Development, produced a glossy brochure, which I have with me. This brochure was part of the kit released by the minister on 6 November. Contained within that brochure are maps setting out the runway options for the two sites.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I now wish to specifically focus on Holsworthy. There are two sets of options. One is called the northern option, which is close to the suburb of Lucas Heights, where the nuclear reactor is located. It is also close to Sydney's large waste disposal area, at Menai, and it is not very far from large housing
        <break page="5571" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         suburban areas in Menai, Engadine, Sutherland and a range of other suburbs in that area.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The runways on the northern option are within the boundaries of the Sutherland shire which, as I said, already contains Australia's only nuclear reactor, contains a large waste disposal site that takes the great bulk of Sydney's waste and contains Australia's largest oil refinery. It appears that, if this government has its way, the Sutherland shire will also have visited upon it Sydney's second airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is another option, which is the southern option at the other end of Holsworthy. If it were to be selected, it would have a devastating impact upon the residents of Helensburgh. It would take flights virtually right over the top of the Woronora water catchment area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What I specifically wanted to draw to the attention of honourable senators this evening is that this brochure, which contains these maps, has some very major errors in it. In particular, the map produced by the EIS team has three of the major suburbs in the wrong locations. The suburbs of Engadine, Loftus and Woronora are shown on this map in the wrong locations. I will seek leave to table this map, which is the map handed out in the minister's kit that day.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One has to ask how it is that, on such an important issue as this—the siting of Sydney's second airport—the company engaged to conduct the EIS and the department which is the proponent of this second airport cannot even get their map correct. It shows one of the major suburbs of the Sutherland shire—Engadine—probably five to 10 kilometres from where it actually is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You really have to ask the question: how is it that this can occur? It can be nothing short of incompetence on the part of the company and the department. It demonstrates the disregard that this government has for following a proper EIS process—something that it has stated all the way through would be evident in this environmental examination.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If this is the sort of community consultation that we are getting, then one can only say, `God help the community.' If a company
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         cannot even get the map correct, as it currently exists, how can anyone in the community have any faith in a process which is supposed to be about locating Sydney's second airport?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also wish to take this matter further. As I said at the outset, it is becoming clearer that this government really wants to put this airport at Holsworthy. Last night I attended a public meeting conducted by the Sydney Airport Community Forum in Cronulla, and that meeting was held to enable community consultation with respect to proposals for flight paths out of Mascot airport. Airservices Australia has developed a range of proposed flight paths, and this meeting was held along with a series of meetings in other parts of Sydney to discuss those flight paths.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Sydney Airport Community Forum is chaired by Mr Joe Hockey, the Liberal member for North Sydney. He chaired the meeting last night. At that meeting he stated that it was his view that Sydney's second airport should be located at Holsworthy. This is the member for North Sydney—who represents an area that probably would be lucky to see one plane flying over it a day—telling the citizens of the southern shire and Holsworthy that they should have Sydney's second airport. He holds a senior position as chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum—a body which is supposed to be about consultation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It appears a decision has virtually already been made. I am here to say tonight, and I will continue to say to this Senate, that the people of south western Sydney and of south eastern Sydney and of southern Sydney do not want another airport in their locality. What they do not want and will not accept is incompetent companies and an incompetent minister and an incompetent department putting out brochures which are supposed to be about community consultation when they cannot even accurately locate on a map the suburbs people currently live in.

       (1) No. There currently exists a very good working relationship between Australian Defence Force (ADF) military police and the respective State and Federal Police forces. Within this working relationship, effective communication is maintained at all levels and on a regular basis. During times of increased military activity, these communications links are maintained on a daily basis. The military police provide detailed briefings on the numbers of activity participants and expected levels of interaction with relevant communities, and will assist and supplement local police as required. I am advised that, due to the size of Operation Tandem Thrust, the ADF is developing specific plans to ensure the necessary liaison and communication with relevant police forces is maintained in an effective and appropriate manner.
