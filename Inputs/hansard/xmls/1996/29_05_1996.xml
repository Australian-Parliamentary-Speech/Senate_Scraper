         I will say just a few words on the report. When I was being briefed by the secretariat upon taking over as chairman of this committee, I was surprised to find that this list of Commonwealth bodies—the list we always get each year but which I suspect few of us look at very closely—seems to be the only collection or, if not the only collection, the only readily available collection there is of all
         <break page="1240" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the various bodies of the Commonwealth. It is referred to quite widely by not only researchers but various government departments.

         I am surprised, just looking at this, at the enormous
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          number of Commonwealth bodies there are. We have asked for the reference to be recommitted or readopted for the current term. I think it will be a measure of this government's success if this book can be cut by half. It will be a very interesting exercise; the committee has decided to complete it up to the time of the election. I think it will form a very good reference point then to see all of the different types of Commonwealth bodies that grew up under the previous government. Then it will be an interesting exercise to have another look in 12 months time just to see where that list has gone.

         In speaking to the motion and perhaps in conclusion, I thank the staff of the committee for the enormous amount of work they have put into this. It does involve a hell of a lot of work. I understand that the committee staff do not always get the cooperation from the departments that one would expect. It has involved the committee secretariat in very intense work over a long period of time, and the efforts and commitment they have put into that should be recognised by the Senate.

       The effect of this order is simply to make applicants for refugee status ineligible to receive Medicare assistance. The Democrats oppose the order because we believe that it

       Presently, applicants for refugee status do receive assistance through the asylum seekers assistance scheme, or ASAS. This scheme has been operational since 1992 and is administered by the Red Cross. The scheme provides financial assistance to meet basic food, clothing, shelter and health services for those applying to remain in Australia as refugees. However, the scheme provides a lower standard of service than that provided for other Australians and thus creates a two&amp;hyphen;tier system. It creates a set of rules that says Australian citizens shall be treated in one way but those who are applying for refugee status will be treated in another.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The Democrats simply do not accept this arbitrary distinction. On the contrary, we believe refugees are amongst the most vulnerable in our community and they deserve to be treated with equality and respect. Refugees have often suffered torture, trauma and other forms of mental and physical abuse. Those from the former Yugoslavia, for example, may have been subjected to pain and fear that we, in Australia, can never imagine. To deny them access to the services that we take for granted is to say to them, `We will not give you the benefit of the doubt. We will not treat you like one of us. We will treat you as though you are of a lower order.'
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       To make matters worse, we now learn through a leaked cabinet submission that the government is proposing to significantly reduce funding for this assistance scheme that is administered through the Red Cross. In a quite breathtaking display of callousness, this government is proposing to abandon refugees in their time of crisis. They are proposing to pick on them for no reason other than that they are an easy target.

       The government certainly did see that it had a responsibility to provide welfare services, including health—particularly for urgent matters—to asylum seekers but that they should not be allowed, firstly, access to a package of welfare assistance and, secondly, access directly through Medicare. That asylum seekers assistance scheme provided the level of welfare that the government believed it had a responsibility to provide. In the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 financial year, that total package amounted to $14.83 million. Of that sum, $1.38 million was provided towards health services.

In this regard she has succumbed, if you like, to allow Senator Spindler this swan song before he goes.

       Let me point out a few other things about what the effects of your move would be, Senator Spindler, through you Madam Deputy President. The potential costs here would be something in the order of $30 million. That is derived by multiplying the number of protection visa applicants by the average annual costs, a very simple sort of arithmetical procedure. Let me point out to you that 85 per cent of those applicants are not allowed to stay in Australia because they are not valid in terms of their application status. They are not genuine refugees. They may be people with heartwarming stories who need care and attention, but they are not refugees and they are not, as you describe in your paper, part of the Australian community. They may want to be, but the fact that anybody wants to be a part of the community is not grounds for spending $30 million which can be spent elsewhere on these people. That is one of the crucial facts here.

        There is a group of people who are not part of our community; 85 per cent of them will never be part of our community, and our policy is to make sure that people who are genuinely not refugees, clearly not refugees, are repatriated to their appropriate countries as soon as possible. An example of that was announced in the other place recently where Mr Ruddock, the member for Berowra, announced that he had repatriated, I think, some 300 boat people within a very short time of their arriving in Australia because there was no justification for looking at them as refugees. That is an example of how this government compared with the previous government has the guts to do the right thing and make sure that only people who are entitled to be in Australia or have good reason to be in Australia are allowed to stay in Australia.

We are talking about a huge amount of money being spent inappropriately on people who are not Australian citizens and people who can come into the country and rort the system. Under the current immigration regulations, any person visiting Australia—listen to this—will be able to gain unrestricted access to Medicare arrangements simply by paying $30 and applying for a protection visa.

        Senator Spindler, is this the sort of rort you want to support? This is going to give any visitor to Australia cheap travel insurance. For $30 they can get access to Medicare.

I urge the parliament and the Senate to think again about this matter and see what happens in the budget context. When decisions are taken in the budget context, then this matter can be revisited.

       One other comment from Senator Woods earlier cannot go unchallenged. I accept that we are perhaps in some respects the de facto opposition in this parliament, but it is worth getting on record in this parliament the voting statistics since May 1994 since you are so convinced that the Australian Democrats have voted many more times with the ALP. It is worth noting that we voted alone since May 1994 in divisions 43 per cent of the time. In fact, the ALP and your coalition voted 43 per cent of the time together, when we have voted with the ALP since May 1994 only 35 per cent of the time. So, if anything, we would consider that it is the `laborials' on the other side of the chamber and not the other way around. On that note, I add my full support for Senator Spindler's disallowance motion and restate that the Democrat support for it is unanimous.

In effect, Senator Woods said that a person who is seeking asylum but has not yet been granted asylum is really not a human being like the rest of us. I have some difficulty with that and some regret about hearing those statements from a person who has taken the Hippocratic oath. His embarrassment must be very deep indeed, because he saw fit to resort to some slurs of both a personal and a political nature.

       I should also point out that this motion for disallowance was put on the record during the term of the previous government. When the then Labor government sought to take this action, I took the action of putting on record the motion for disallowance. It can hardly be said, then, that we are party-political in our support for this disallowance that needs to be made. Surely we must treat people who are on our shores as we would like any human being to be treated. If there are rorts, bring forth amendments to fix them. The government can expect to get Democrat support for any amendments that will get rid of non&amp;hyphen;urgent surgery that, as the government claims, is being paid for through this arrangement. That is open to the government.

But the government should not bring in a provision which denies basic medical services to people just because they are asylum seekers and their status has not yet been clarified. I am grateful for the support that I have received for this motion and rest my case.

        —Thank you, Senator Ray. However, I do need to respond to some of the claims made by Senators Ray and Schacht yesterday in the debate. Of course, I am used to abuse being hurled at me from many quarters. It is bemusing to listen to abuse from the ALP that is normally reserved for hurling at itself in its interminable faction fights when all sorts of allegations are made against each other within that party. The common reference to me has been that I am a dill. I am certainly used to that; my 10&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old son calls me a dill every time I tip the Adelaide Crows to win in Melbourne.

      <para first-indent="16">
       However, I take, at the very least, strong objection to the inference that I have lied to the Senate. Senator Ray's impassioned speech about my role revealed the true tactics in this. There is an attempt to get me; I suppose I should be flattered by that. However, the Labor Party is trampling all over Ms Ferris to have a go at me, and the nature of their motion clearly reveals that. Senator Ray's comments clearly reflected that. He basically said, `Senator Minchin has to appear in this chamber and answer these charges, or we have got him.' He is talking as if he was some mafia don, out to crucify the government and government senators.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The allegation made was that I deliberately misled the Senate about the timing of legal advice to Ms Ferris. As I understand it, the assertion was that the advice of 17 May from Wheeler QC was the only legal advice that she received and, therefore, I must have lied in my statement of 22 May, where I referred to earlier legal advice to Ms Ferris. This was what I had to come into this chamber and respond to immediately.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I refer the Senate to a letter Ms Ferris has handed to me, dated 28 May, from Josephine Kelly BA, LLb, Barrister at Law, Selborne Chambers, Sydney, in which she says:

        Dear Ms Ferris,

        I confirm that on or about 7 February 1996 we had a telephone discussion about whether or not you would breach s 44 of the Constitution if you accepted a position in the office of a member of Parliament after the election and until your term as a senator commenced on 1 July 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In response, and without going into the matter further, I forwarded to you several pages from the authoritative work "Lane's Commentary on the Australian Constitution", including pages 63&amp;hyphen;66 inclusive which deal with s 44. I also advised during a telephone conversation that I was not aware of any decided cases dealing with the circumstances you were foreshadowing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I referred you particularly to page 66 of Professor Lane's work where he gives his opinion about a "senator elect" in circumstances I understood to be similar to yours, and which supports the proposition that accepting the position you were considering while a "senator elect", would not constitute a breach of s 44.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following the election, you rang me again and asked me whether accepting a position in Senator Minchin's office until your term as senator commenced would breach s 44. Again, on the authority of Professor Lane's discussion and on the basis of the circumstances you told me of, I expressed the view that it would not.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the advice to which I referred in my statement. I did not lie to the Senate and I would appreciate your retracting the inference that I lied or misled the Senate. I will table that letter. I will also table a fax from Josephine Kelly, Barrister at Law, dated 7 February 1996, which encloses the pages from

It is somewhat ironic that I should be asked to do this but, apparently, I am the last speaker on this motion, and I am happy to do it. In doing so, I make some respectful comments about Mr Evans's paper. I am not aware that he is a barrister or a constitutional lawyer, but I am always interested in his views. Of course, I fundamentally agree with him on the question of a constitutional monarchy. But I have to say that I do not agree
         <break page="1251" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          with his advice. There is a fundamental error in his advice. He asks the question:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Did she hold an office?

       <para>
        He refers to my employment of Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris in my capacity as a senator and concludes that, as a senator, I am entitled to appoint staff without qualification. He then asks:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Was it an office under the Crown?
       </para>
       <para>
        He then refers to my employing her in my capacity as a parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister. He cannot have it both ways. Our whole point is, and the legal advice from Wheeler QC is, that the proposed appointment was made in my capacity as a parliamentary secretary, which was clearly subject to the approval of the minister, and the approval was not granted. That is why she concludes that there was no office of profit under the crown. So Mr Evans's opinion on this has a fundamental error of fact about the status in which I am purported to be employing Ms Ferris. I table this document, but I cast it to one side.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In speaking briefly to the motion, I do support what Senator Alston has said. The fundamental problem with this motion, as presented by the Labor Party, is its reference to section 376, because section 376 talks about the power of the Senate to refer any question respecting the qualifications of a senator or respecting a vacancy. Fundamentally, there is neither case in issue here. We are not dealing with a senator and we are not dealing with a vacancy. I do not see how this motion can then really stand up.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The motion exposes Ms Ferris to a double jeopardy. The Court of Disputed Returns may reject this petition on the grounds that the Senate is not capable of referring this matter at this stage when the person in question is a senator-elect and not a senator, and nor is there a vacancy. It poses the risk for Ms Ferris of having to go through this twice—of having to appear before the Court of Disputed Returns on this petition, having it thrown out and then you bringing it back and proposing that it be dealt with when she is a senator. I think that is outrageous.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         In relation to subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f) of the motion, this reflects the utter incompe tence of the Labor Party and the naked ambition of the Labor Party simply to have a go at me and to use the machine&amp;hyphen;gun to scatter everyone in their path. They refer in subparagraph (d) to any other senator aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring, or by act or omission being concerned, et cetera. Obviously, we all know that is directed at me. I understand the minor parties, at least, are not going to wear those provisions. Those words seem to have been taken from subsection 352(2) of the Electoral Act. It states:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For purposes of this Part, a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures, or by act or omission is . . . party to, the contravention of a provision of this Act, the

       </para>
       <para>
        That quite clearly is referring to breaches of the Electoral Act or the Crimes Act. Not even the ALP, I believe, at this stage, is accusing me of breaching the Electoral Act or the Crimes Act. If it is, I would like it to advise me. On that basis alone, this is a nonsensical motion in its reference in subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f) to section 352, which it does not indicate in this—you have to go and find it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I really think this is a very lightweight motion. It is nothing more than a witch-hunt designed primarily to get me and, in the meantime, to trample all over Ms Ferris. I table the documents. I regret that this motion has been brought in in the way it has been brought, dealing with a senator-elect. I think it is unbelievable that the Senate, in an unprecedented fashion, is seeking to force—by the power of the Senate, one of the great institutions of this country—a senator-elect, who is not a member of this chamber and is not here to speak on her own behalf, before the High Court to defend herself at considerable cost to her. It is unwarranted behaviour.

I anticipate it would be attractive to other parties as well, because not only does it pick up concerns that the other parties might have but also it picks up the concern that the government has about the date of operation. I think this mechanism picks up the concern that Senator Alston had. It also picks up the point that Senator Minchin was making that maybe this matter should be sent off after 1 July. Having heard the words of Senator Carr's amendment, I anticipate that the government should now consider supporting this motion.

       The documents tabled in the Senate show that Senator Minchin signed a letter on 25 March 1996 stating that he had appointed Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris to a position on his staff. An employment agreement for the employment of Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris was signed by her and Senator Minchin on 18 March 1996. On 3 April 1996, however, the Minister for Administrative Services wrote to Senator Minchin advising that he had not approved the appointment and had instructed the Department of Administrative Services to cease processing papers arising from Senator Minchin's "request" that she be appointed. On 19 April 1996 Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris and Senator Minchin sent letters to the Department of Administrative Services indicating that they did not wish the appointment to proceed. Money which had been paid to Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris by way of salary of the position in question was repaid.

       The expression "under the Crown" is taken to refer to an office of the government of the Commonwealth or of a state and, having regard to the reference to the Crown and to the rationale of the relevant provision in section 44, which is to eliminate or reduce executive government influence over the Parliament, it appears that the provision refers to an office of the executive government (

       As has been indicated, the senator is the person who actually employs a member of the senator's staff.

Having regard to the stated rationale of the constitutional provision, it is likely that it would be held that such an office is not under the Crown and therefore does not fall within the constitutional prohibition.

      <para font-size="-=2">
       At the time of  his engagement of Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris, however, Senator Minchin was an office&amp;hyphen;holder of the executive government, namely, Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. The documents tabled in the Senate indicate that it was in this capacity that Senator Minchin employed Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris.

       <break page="1254" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        senator making and subscribing an oath or affirmation before taking the senator's seat. A senator does not take his or her seat until the first sitting day after the term of the senator has begun.

       It is therefore possible to argue that the relevant prohibition in section 44 does not apply to a senator&amp;hyphen;elect but only to the time during which a candidate is chosen, that is, during the whole process of election, and the time after the senator has taken his or her seat. Such an interpretation may be regarded as a literal reading of the constitutional provision.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Such an argument, however, assumes an appearance of absurdity when regard is had to the stated purpose of the relevant prohibition, namely, eliminating or reducing executive influence over the Parliament. Senators, and therefore the Senate, could be influenced by the granting of executive government offices to senators&amp;hyphen;elect provided that the holding of the office lasted only from the return of the writs to the commencement of the senators' terms. This would be a circumvention of the intention of the constitutional prohibition. It is therefore likely that, if the question were to be determined, it would be held that the constitutional prohibition applies to a senator&amp;hyphen;elect in the same way as it applies to a senator who has actually taken his or her seat.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       In any event, this argument would appear not to be relevant to Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris, because her election was not complete at the time of her appointment: the writs for the election of senators for South Australia were not certified for return until 2 April 1996.

       On the basis that the election of senators for South Australia was not complete until 2 April 1996, when the writs were certified for return, it could be held that Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris' election was void, and that it would have to be determined who was validly elected, as in

       If the view is taken that the senator&amp;hyphen;elect was chosen in an election which was completed, and the disability occurred after the completion, it would probably be held that when a senator&amp;hyphen;elect accepts an office of profit under the Crown, the place of the senator&amp;hyphen;elect in the Senate becomes vacant. When a senator&amp;hyphen;elect dies, the place of the senator&amp;hyphen;elect is treated as vacant and is filled by the State Parliament accordingly (case of Senator Barnes, 1938, SJ 78). It would seem therefore, that the vacating of the place of a senator&amp;hyphen;elect by reason of disqualification under sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution would create a casual vacancy to be filled in accordance with section 15.

        —At the end of this debate, I think it is fair to say, very briefly, that we maintain there is a case to answer—a case not to be determined by the Senate, but to be determined by the Court of Disputed Returns. The issues have been canvassed pretty broadly. The issues, as the Clerk of the Senate put them, are as follows. Did she hold office? We would maintain that there is evidence to suggest that she did, but, as Senator Minchin has maintained continually, there is some doubt from his side on that. Was it an office of profit? I think the government itself, in Senator Vanstone's answer to the Senate, canvassed that. She made it clear that her view, representing the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), was that the office was one of profit. Was it an office under the crown? On that particular point, Senator Vanstone's advice, together with the clerk's advice, give us at least a case to be answered that the office was an office of profit under the crown. Does section 44 of the constitution
        <break page="1256" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         cover the position of senators&amp;hyphen;elect? There is advice on the record that needs to be addressed—advice from Senator Durack and advice that was tendered by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, to Senator Minchin on 3 April. That is advice that can be tested by the court if this matter does go to court.

       There are then consequential issues of filling the vacancy and whether Senator-elect Ferris is prohibited from being chosen and/or sitting as a senator. They are issues raised by the clerk. Given the clerk's firm view on this and other advice we have argued in the debate, those questions need to be addressed.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I say to Senator Minchin and to Senator Hill: the government's performance on this has not been satisfactory. We have asked for documents and the documents continue to dribble out. Yesterday after question time, in relation to the cabcharge documents, I made the point that our expectation was that there were more documents to come to us. It was interesting to note yesterday that when Senator Hill tabled Ms Wheeler's advice he said, `This was the advice that Senator Minchin relied upon.' Senator Minchin comes in here today and gives us advice from another lawyer from an earlier date. They cannot get their lines right. They cannot produce the right documents. They cannot produce all the documents.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       They have not produced, for instance, a letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) which was referred to in Ms Wheeler's document. They have not produced a letter of 26 March, which has been referred to in the documentation tabled already. They have not produced other documentation from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The government's performance in this matter has not been satisfactory and I suggest to Senator Hill that next time he goes through this exercise he would maybe have to lift his game.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       On the point of legal advice, Senator Minchin made it very clear that he relied on advice when he appointed Senator-elect Ferris to his office. Senator Hill yesterday made it very clear what that advice was and claimed it was the advice of Ms Wheeler QC.

You know this was a pretty important point in terms of the misleading of this place, but I make the point that the government has not approached this particular issue in a comprehensive way. Because of that, it is not looking all that good at the moment on this issue. Senator Hill, shake your head as you like, but, in respect to this, there are lessons for the government to learn.

        In summing up, there are issues here that need to be addressed and there are issues here that should not be addressed by the political process. They should be addressed through the venue that is provided for by law and in the constitution—that is, the Court of Disputed Returns. If you leave these matters for politicians to address, obviously our motivations are different. We have seen that arise in the debate. The proper mechanism to deal with this matter is the Court of Disputed Returns in the High Court. That is why previous ministers have been ready to refer these matters off. That is why Senator Ray, on a number of occasions, referred a matter off—

       This is a proposition which I do not want to speak to at great length. Essentially, it is an attempt to pick up some of the points that have been made in this chamber. It is not to acknowledge or to concede the validity of those points that Senator Alston has made, but to at least attempt to get a broader consensual view on this matter. It is also to take account of the discussion that I understand is being had about the prospect of Senator-designate Ferris actually resigning before this time. It is an opportunity for the government to get its own house in order before the action is taken. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

       The Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 provides for the appropriation of funding for the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, also known as the AESIP. It enables grants of financial assistance to be made to state and territory governments, non-government school systems, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educational institutions and education consultative bodies for the purpose of advancing the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Funding under the act is appropriated on a triennial calendar basis, with the current triennium due to finish at the end of 1996.

       The bill provides for a substantial appropriation for Aboriginal education. Following the Commonwealth's response to the national review recommendations and the positive response from the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs which followed soon after, bilateral negotiations have taken place between the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and senior officers of the state and territory departments of education. These negotiations have resulted in agreed understandings and a new commitment to shared responsibilities and a shared effort to further the goals of the AEP.

       Indications are that the state and territories are willing to commit in excess of $40 million of additional funds to this end. There is still a great deal of work to be done before the new arrangements can take effect. It is imperative, in the government's view, that the new legislation be passed as soon as possible to cater for the long lead time that is required in such an undertaking, particularly in the context of Commonwealth-state relations.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I now turn to the next two bills: the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 and the Airports Bill 1996. The purpose of the Airports Bill is
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        to establish the regulatory arrangements to apply to federal airports following leasing of the airports to private operators. The purpose of the Airports (Transitional) Bill is to implement a framework to effect the sale of federal airports under long-term leases. It is essential, from the government's point of view, that the Airports Bill, in conjunction with the Airports (Transitional) Bill, be considered in the winter parliamentary sittings to ensure that the government's airport leasing program—a significant part of the government's economic reforms and an important contributor to the government's budget strategy—is not unduly delayed.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I make the point: the sale of long-term leases for the Federal Airports Corporation provides an opportunity for the private sector to operate and manage development of a major part of Australia's strategic infrastructure. Leasing of the airports was included in this government's election commitments—and I think that is an important point to stress—subject to Sydney and Sydney West being withdrawn until there is a solution to the issues of aircraft noise, the opening of the east-west runway and a full EIS on Sydney West airport. We have taken the necessary action on these issues, with Sydney and Sydney West out of phase one sales, the east-west runway reopened and a comprehensive EIS being established. With these decisions in place, we believe that there is no reason for these bills not to be considered in this session.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Airports cannot be leased until the regulatory and sales legislation has been passed. The next stage of the sales process requires the release of information memoranda, which will need to contain full details of the post-leasing regulatory regime. To complete the leasing of phase one airports and receive proceeds 1996-97, the information memoranda will need to be ready for release well before the end of this year. Accordingly, it is essential that legislation be introduced and passed in the current sitting to facilitate the meeting of this timetable.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The Airports Bill establishes the essential regulatory framework, as I have mentioned, which will apply to federal airports post leasing. The Airports (Transitional) Bill sets
       <break page="1259" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        out the arrangements which will apply to leasing of the airports and transfers of assets and staff as well as the financial arrangements which are critical to bidders. Potential investors and airport operators require certainty about the regulatory and leasing framework before they can commence to prepare formal bids. To delay this process is simply to add further unnecessary delays in a process which has already been going on for well over a year.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The opposition, I hope—and I highlight this point—will not take the opportunity to hold up this legislation, as it wanted to introduce and pass similar legislation last year. If there is any delay in either bill, then the current sales timetable for the first stage of the airports will not be achieved. The states and territories have also sought fast tracking of the leasing process, which will not be achieved if parliament does not pass the airport bills.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The sales are expected to make a significant contribution to the budget in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, provided a timely passage of the bills is achieved. The bottom line is that any attempt by the Senate not to deal with this legislation could simply be interpreted as a ploy to increase the budgetary hole that has been left to this government.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Finally, I turn to the fourth bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Residence Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and state why we believe that should be introduced and passage obtained in the 1996 winter sittings. One of the election initiatives announced by the government was that newly arrived residents' waiting periods that apply before a person may be paid certain social security payments was to be extended from 26 weeks to 104 weeks. As a general rule, the initiative is to apply to a person arriving in Australia on or after 1 April 1996, or who is granted a permanent visa on or after 1 April 1996, whichever is later. Legislation needs to be in place as soon as possible to give effect to that initiative.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We believe the bill would also go some way in addressing concerns expressed by employers about inefficient bureaucratic processes. Amendments to both the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student and Youth
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        Assistance Act 1973 would facilitate a more efficient information gathering process from employers and other third parties. Amendments would be made to the Data&amp;hyphen;matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 to ensure that income data from the two financial years immediately before the current financial year may be used as a single data&amp;hyphen;matching program. Failure to proceed with the amendments at the earliest possible opportunity potentially jeopardises realising significant savings to revenue. The policy commitment given effect by this act has received wide coverage in Australia since it was released in mid&amp;hyphen;February and, of course, this was repeated around 1 April 1996.

       Information was provided by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to its overseas posts on 19 March 1996 for forwarding to intending migrants. A leaflet was sent out to the last known address of all visa recipients who had not yet travelled to Australia. There have been few reports of mail returned and unclaimed. In late March 1996, letters were also sent to assurers of support of applicants who had not yet arrived in Australia. DSS has also arranged for information to be provided in ethnic radio broadcasts on SBS for two weeks, from 20 May 1996, and DSS staff have also been conducting briefing sessions for ethnic community representatives throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The coalition gave a commitment that this would apply to new residents on or after 1 April 1996. As the existing legislative provisions will operate for 26 weeks from this date, it is important that this new legislation is passed before 1 October 1996 so that there is a continuity of waiting periods from the 26 weeks to 104 weeks. I urge the Senate to grant exemptions for these four bills.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I am advised that the bills have been made available to members of the opposition and the minor parties so that they have a chance to read the provisions of the bills, ask questions of shadow ministers and get briefings from officers on these bills. They are important to the government and we urge the Senate to ensure that the exemptions are granted so that these four bills can be debated and passed this sitting.

       Quite clearly, those conditions have not been met. This government, in the opposition's view, has not demonstrated that there is sufficient reason for urgency on these proposals and that the Senate should agree to the cut&amp;hyphen;off.

       Far from exempting the bill from the cut&amp;hyphen;off, it is critical for the Senate to have time to consider the consequences of the measures that the government is presenting in this bill. They include such things as retrospectivity in application; contravention of the anti&amp;hyphen;discrimination legislation and conventions; the possibility of sequential applications for the waiting period; the relationship between this legislation and reciprocal agreements between Australia and other countries made under the Social Security Act; the relationship between the proposed disallowable instrument and the provision in the Social Security Act governing special benefits; and the clear potential for the measures contained in the bill to jeopardise migrants effective settlement in Australia.

In addition, there are compelling reasons to allow enough time for the issues surrounding the location of Sydney's second airport to be resolved before the sale of Kingsford Smith can proceed. As far as we are concerned, the government has simply not demonstrated the justification for urgency on these matters. In fact, one suspects that, given what has been going on within the government parties, there is in fact all the more need to hasten slowly. I also remind senators that we still have on the

      <para first-indent="16">
       This issue has been the subject of discussion among all the parties represented in the Senate. Indeed, Senator Kemp has put to us all a variation of his original proposal which provided for a two-week gap between the introduction of and the debate on any bill. This matter has still to be resolved by the government. Logically it should be resumed before we are asked to consider requests for the exemption of the cut-off on an ad hoc basis, as we are now doing. On behalf of the

       If I could go to the specifics of the legislation:  Senator Kemp has indicated that the bills that will be introduced into the House of Representatives in regard to the FAC are the same bills as Labor's bills. That is not the case, Senator. If I have misunderstood you I will stand corrected, but I understood you to be saying that these were essentially our proposals. These bills are not our proposals. The provisions in these bills have very important differences in terms of the restriction on cross-media ownership in Sydney and in regard to those airports in Brisbane and in Melbourne. The restrictions that were in the bills for the last government have been removed from this government's proposed bills.

       The minister has also under the proposals been given the power to exempt replacement airport master plans and other environmental strategies from public comment, from the consultation process.

It would be incumbent upon the government to apply the same standards that they expected us to apply when they were in opposition.

       In terms of the social security legislation, as I understand it there are substantive issues that go to breaches of election promises, that go to the questions of whether the proposals provide an adequate safety net for residents of this country, whether they provide a new administrative precedent for waiting periods for new classes of persons under the social security provisions in this country and in regard to the extension of various waiting periods to a whole series of new benefits and support payments for residents of this country. There is the whole issue of the retrospectivity of these proposals. There is the issue of the difference there appears to be on the public record about the so-called costings involved in this proposal and what appear to be the facts in the bill. These matters require careful consideration. We have in this country relied very heavily on family reunion. It is an important part of our immigration approach in terms of our population policy.

       The social security legislation is completely new. It does have very substantial changes to the waiting period for social security arrangements for newly arrived residents. It is something we want to have a much closer look at before we consider it. We will be supporting the first bill, the indigenous education one, through the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion to be debated this session, but not the other three.

        —I indicate that we will not be supporting this cut&amp;hyphen;off motion—to Senator Kemp's surprise. I want to quickly comment on something Senator Bourne mentioned. It is not my understanding that the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill is an old bill. It has a lot of new material in it. I understand that the old bill she might be confusing it with was passed in the Senate last November.

       In that bill, $83 million is guaranteed for the calendar year 1996. It is true that of the new measures in this bill there is an increase in the money that would be available from 1 January 1996 to June 1997, an 18&amp;hyphen;month period. There is a small increase in percentage of the total amount. On the grounds that there are new measures in the bill and it is not putting anybody in financial difficulties not to exempt this from the cut&amp;hyphen;off, we do not feel that the urgency exists.

        We do not support any of the bills that have been nominated in this motion to be sufficiently urgent or to be old bills and therefore eligible for exemption from the cut&amp;hyphen;off. Senator Margetts will speak to the two air ports bills but both of us are adamant that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill definitely should be adjourned to the next session on the principle that it is utterly new and the community has not been educated to what is being proposed. There will be need for great community consultation and the need to listen to the concerns expressed. So we do not support the motion—and I await clarification on the indigenous education bill.

        —As Senator Chamarette has indicated, I will speak briefly on why the Greens (WA) are not supporting the exemption from the cut&amp;hyphen;off of the two airports bills. As has been mentioned today, the bills are similar to those presented before by the previous government, but they are not the same. Those issues that are not the same are quite extensive. It is interesting that now the current opposition is realising that there is a need for extensive consultation on a number of these issues. At the time, we were concerned that the consultation on the original bill was very brief and was limited largely to New South Wales. There was some brief consultation with a group of councillors from Western Australia and that was about it—and they said it was a very cursory consultation at that. Basically, what we have said all along is that these issues about airport sales are important and ought to be given proper community consideration.

       There are issues in this bill, such as the cross&amp;hyphen;ownership provisions, that are not just a minor change. Those provisions would have major implications. The fact that provisions for Sydney airport have been removed has major implications. The Greens believe that the sale of airports in general ought to have been considered. But the fact is that for many people the implications for Sydney, for the potential of a new airport, ought to be resolved. The fact that there is considerable community concern about this indicates that those issues are not minor. There is sufficient reason to say that this bill is not substantially the same bill and ought to be given proper

        —I thank senators for their contributions. I will be responding to some of the issues which have been raised. Let me just make a couple of general comments which I probably would not have bothered to make except for the somewhat provocative comments of Senator Carr. A response to a couple of issues he raised probably needs to go on record. If his comments were unchallenged, people might feel that Senator Carr was revealing truths.

      <para first-indent="16">
       In relation to the sessional orders, you and I, Senator Carr—and I think everyone involved—know of the extensive negotiations which have occurred. I would have hoped in your discussion about consultations you would have mentioned that there has been a great deal of consultation, more than existed under the previous government. We were not playing Labor Party rules, we have had regular meetings to consult and discuss.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       For the record, Senator Carr, there is just about complete agreement on the sitting times and the routine of business. You have attempted to load a couple of other issues into that agreement, as is the wont of the socialist left, which is all right. You can play your games, that is fair enough, but we should not let the public or the press gallery be deluded into thinking that the sessional orders are not ready and that there is not universal agreement, including your agreement, for the sitting times and the routine of business.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The opposition wants to load a number of other things onto that agreement, in particular question time, and negotiations have been continuing. So the new sessional orders have not come in and we are operating under the old sessional orders, Senator Carr, quite simply because of your blocking exercise. We are hopeful, Senator Carr, because we are people who like to consult and who like to bring people on side, as we have been doing. As I said, I think the record will show that the consultation carried out by this government in order to change things, such as sessional orders, has been far more extensive

       Senator Carr attempted to argue that the opposition has been hugely cooperative. Eight bills so far is certainly not a magnificent record; it is a very poor record, to be quite frank. Senator Carr, after the 1993 election—and it has to be said that we probably felt as bad about losing then as you undoubtedly felt about your dreadful loss at the last election—over 10 sittings days, which is less than the number of sitting days which we have had to date, 22 bills were passed in 18 packages. This contrasts with eight bills.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       So let us not believe that your performance has been any good. It might be good by your standards, but it is bad by the standards which the public would wish to apply to this chamber. I regret that and I regret that you have chosen to act in this manner. I hope that, as the weeks and months go on, a more cooperative approach will occur as you get over having been trounced in the last election. We are well used to the politics of the payback and we understand that that is part of the socialist left culture. It would be certainly helpful if we could see a more cooperative spirit taking place on your part.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The next point I wish to make—and thank you, Senator Woodley, for that useful help—is that there is a recognition by us all that the cut-off motion did not recognise what happens when a new government comes in. There have been some constructive discussions again on how we deal with that issue. In general—with a couple of exceptions, Senator Chamarette—I think there is the belief that we have to amend those standing orders to reflect what happens when a new government comes into office. Again we were pretty close to reaching agreement but, at the end of the day, because of the front-end loading practices which you have applied, that was not possible.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The fourth general point I wish to make is this. The government went to an election with specific promises and we are seeing in the Senate an attempt at times to make us break those promises and at times to frustrate the keeping of those promises. We only have to
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        think of the Senate's reaction to the Telstra bill, to the workplace reform bill and to the export licensing arrangements. I think the Senate has adopted a process which will be condemned by the public. Where we have gone to the election with specific promises, I would think that the Australian public believe that a government should be allowed to govern and be allowed to put into effect the policies with which it got clear approval at the last election.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That applies to the three bills before the chamber—the airport bills and the bill relating to the migration waiting times. They relate to issues which were very extensively canvassed during the election which the government won handsomely. If Senator Carr and other speakers had issues, they could have been very easily dealt with in the normal course of debate and consultation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       These bills are urgent bills. They are bills that the government needs. They are bills which had endorsement at the election. We went to the election with our airports policy and the migration waiting periods so I think we are seeing here something which is out of kilter, Senator Carr. We went to the election seeking an endorsement, we won that election and then the Senate—some times through spite and some times through misunderstanding—seeks to overturn that mandate and the policies for which we had specific endorsement.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is worth recalling that Senator Gareth Evans, not a man who is loath to make any concessions to an opposition, made very clear in statements in the Senate before the 1983 election that the Labor Party would not frustrate a bill where the government could point to a mandate it had received at an election no matter how obnoxious the Labor Party regarded such a bill to its own interests. That was a responsible statement. The Labor Party has overturned that and set a precedent which it may ultimately rue in the years ahead.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       With those general comments, I now wish to turn briefly to some of the issues which have been raised in the debate. First of all, in relation to the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, the bill
       <break page="1265" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        does contain additional funding. Once this bill is passed, the states and territories can sensibly work together on strategic initiatives to advance the education of indigenous Australians. Any delay, Senator Chamarette, will postpone work on this very high priority, a priority hopefully shared by everyone in this place.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures Bill) 1996, as I have stated, does require early passage. Budget savings can be maximised in this manner. Of course, the department needs to have sufficient lead time to have computer systems developed and new migrants properly informed. I am advised that the bill is not retrospective. The provisions only apply from the date of royal assent for new measures to be covered. Government has given sufficient warning to newly arrived migrants in election commitments and other actions to advertise.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We believe that this bill is an important bill; it is an urgent bill. It was a bill widely canvassed and discussed during the election. The Australian people have voted in favour of the government's policy. I put it to you that to refuse to exempt this bill, to delay and to frustrate and ultimately possibly—we hope this is not the case—to prevent the government from filling an election commitment, for which we specifically sought a mandate, means this Senate is acting in a dangerous way. It is, Senator Carr, quite contrary to the policies that the Labor Party has espoused for a long period of time. Senator Carr and Senator Faulkner may live to rue the day that they decided to act in this particular manner.

       In relation to the two airport bills, the bills are similar to ones considered by the Senate in November last year. There was no concern about the provisions of the bills themselves last year. The Senate amended those bills to reflect the coalition's view that noise issues at Sydney West needed to be addressed. The government has indicated that Sydney and Sydney West are off the table for the time being. The government has decided to remove restrictions.

      <para first-indent="16">
       The issue of cross&amp;hyphen;ownership was raised, Senator Carr. On cross&amp;hyphen;ownership, which
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        would have prevented Sydney, Sydney West and Brisbane, and Sydney, Sydney West and Melbourne from being owned by the one operator, removal of these restrictions allows time for the government to properly address concerns about noise issues at Sydney without creating unwarranted uncertainty about the sales processes.

           When the committee was first established it had a membership of three government, two opposition and one minority party senators. In the last parliament, the composition was the same. The government sees no good reason to vary the composition of the committee in this parliament. Given the number of committees of which senators are members and the fact that three select committees are already in existence, the government considers that a total of six senators—three government, two opposition and one minority party—as existed in the previous parliament, should have been the appropriate membership.

           However, I note that the Australian Democrats have circulated amendments to increase the membership to seven by adding one opposition senator. This will give the committee a non-government majority. The government is opposed in principle to this committee having a non-government majority. However, in order that the committee can resume its important work we will reluctantly—I stress `reluctantly'—accept the two amendments in order to break an impasse which has existed in its re-establishment. The committee has been essentially non-partisan in the past, and the government has the confidence that it will continue to be so.

         If we look at the various propositions relating to committees which have come before the Senate in the past, we see there is a clear pattern of government and non-government chairs. In the last parliament the Select Committee on Superannuation was one of those committees which were allocated a chair from the non-government parties. It was said that

          Senator Watson should secure the chair on the basis of his expertise—a proposition that we do not dispute; that is, he has expertise—but to now suggest that he should get the chair on the basis that he is an expert instead of a non-government senator is a different proposition altogether.

We have been quite prepared to enter into discussions about that matter, but those opposite have come in here with a proposition to try to preclude that option. That is a disappointment to me. Equally, we saw it with the Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling, which again should have had a non-government chair.

The only people who have shifted the goalposts since we have been back in parliament have been Labor Party senators. They are the ones who have shifted the goalposts. They have yet to realise that the numbers of the various parties in this chamber have changed. In the last three years that those opposite were in government, they never had more than 30 senators. We are in government with 36 senators, and we will have 37 senators after 1 July.

         The other thing, Senator Carr, that you should possibly take particular notice of is that Senator Watson was appointed as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation long before any discussion took place about the change in the arrangement of chairs that was made by the Standing Committee on Procedure on 10 October 1994. Senator Watson was appointed long before any of those discussions took place and he was appointed by that committee for a number of reasons: he was expert in that field and he had shown particular bipartisanship in exercising his position as chair. It is a position that he continued to take long after the change in chair arrangements took place.

         I have to say that the Select Committee on Superannuation is one of the success stories of committees in this chamber. In the past three or four years—I think it was set up in late 1991 or early 1992—it has brought down 17 or 18 reports and, almost to a report, they
         <break page="1269" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          have been unanimous because of the amount of discussion that has taken place on a bipartisan basis. Superannuation is such an important issue that we believe that there are many areas that need bipartisan discussion and support, because the people of Australia need to know that, in the event of a change of government, there is still some certainty in the arrangements that have been put into place by previous administrations.

         Senator Carr comes in here and says that the goalposts have shifted, but the only reason they have shifted is that you have shifted them, because now—with your 29 members of the Labor Party in opposition—you choose to have the same proportional representation on committees that we had when we had considerably more members in opposition: 36 in the last parliament. You would also do well to remember that when this committee was first formed there were three government senators and there was a government chair. That was your initial proposition and it was one which we rejected outright because of the numerical status of your party in this place.

         Senator Watson was only appointed as chair of this committee after Senator Sherry resigned, and he was chosen by the members of that committee with the support of the Australian Democrats because they recognised the work that he had done in the past and the particularly good work that he had done for superannuation in straightening out the whole superannuation program for Australians. No&amp;hyphen;one would doubt that the reports and the recommendations that have come from that committee have had a tremendous effect on the decisions that were made by the previous government with regard to superannuation. We were very sorry that some of the recommendations took a long time to come to fruition, particularly on things like small amounts and other matters, but eventually they did.

         Let me also say one thing with regard to deciding what the numbers on any of these committees could be. In deciding the numbers on this committee in consultation with the Australian Democrats, we have agreed that Senator Woodley, as the lone Democrat on that committee, would have the casting vote
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in any particular votes that take place. We have done that, taking into consideration Senator Woodley's past performance on this committee where he has shown himself to have the best interests of the committee at heart and has, in fact, worked very hard to get unanimous reports. We ought to recognise the efforts that Senator Woodley put into the superannuation committee during his time of service, and I am pleased that, as I understand it, he will be continuing in that role.

         I hope that the Australian Democrats will continue that principle on another matter that may be discussed in the future regarding the composition of reference committees. In this particular case, it is only right that Senator Woodley has a deciding vote on whether a report has a majority; yet we have seen in other cases that the Australian Democrats are prepared to abdicate that responsibility on reference committees and allow the opposition, with their 29 members, to have a majority in their own right on reference committees—a situation which is totally untenable.

         That will be a matter for future discussion, I am quite sure; and I am quite happy for it to be a matter for future discussion. But I hope that the principle that is applied in this particular case—where Senator Woodley, as the Democrat on that committee, will have the role of deciding which way a majority will go—will continue into reference committees at some later stage when, with the support of the Australian Democrats, the opposition will, with their chairs, still have a controlling majority, but they will not be able to do it in their own right with just 29 senators out of the 76 that are in this place.

I hope this committee continues to do the work that it has done in the past. It has had members who have superannuation at heart. Sometimes, members have put their own particular political point of view; but, while they have put that point of view, at all times we have managed when we have come to drawing up reports—and Senator Evans has been a member of that committee, and a good one—to have general agreement. I hope that

         Most of the things that needed to be said have been said. The numbers in the committee were the subject of very long negotiations. I had hoped that they would actually have been acceptable without having to go to amendments. Nevertheless, we are doing it in this form, and I hope that the Senate will accept what really is a compromise, but one that will enable us to continue the work of what I believe to be the best committee in the Senate. That committee has always sought to answer the question of what is best for Australians and good for Australia for the next 50 years. That is what we are really dealing with: retirement income for people in at least the next 50 years.

         I believe that the members of the committee have all been committed to answering that question rather than to party political point scoring, and that has been very satisfying to me. Unless there is cross&amp;hyphen;party support for the committee and for the conclusions of that committee, we cannot expect the public to trust the superannuation system which we have set up. Without that trust, I fear for the future of retirement incomes in this country.

         I trust that the present government will take notice of committee recommendations in the future. As Senator Ferguson has said, although the previous government did take notice of recommendations, sometimes it was a little slow. I trust that some of the legislation that has been projected may be looked at very seriously by this committee. There may be some amendments to what has been signalled that the committee will recommend to the government and that the government will again consider carefully. I commend the first two amendments to the Senate and trust that they will be acceptable.

          —It seems that this debate may have gone a bit off the track and there may have been some misunderstandings. The important point and the reason why we support the Democrats' amendments is that, while there is general recognition of the expertise of the current chairman—and I personally do not have any wish to see that changed—the committee has worked well under his leadership. That has partly been because of the creative tension on the committee that has required us to seek to come to some sort of consensus.

         In terms of the balance of forces on the committee, I think it was a very healthy thing that when we were the government we did not have the numbers; in that sense it forced government members to deal positively with suggestions from other members of the committee and allowed the superannuation committee to continue to do its broad policy work in advance of the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day political debate. That is not possible for all committees, and I do not advocate it as a system for all committees.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason we are in difficulty today is that arrangements with regard to allocation of chairs and membership of committees have been held separately from the debate around the superannuation committee or not held at all. So superannuation has been somewhat left out on a limb. We support the Democrats' amendments. Effectively, they will allow the
         <break page="1271" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         It does mean that the government will not have an automatic majority on the committee. I think that will be a healthy thing for the committee and enable it to continue the sort of role it has played in terms of being a committee that looks at broad policy issues two to five years in front of the current political debate. I can assure the Liberal Party members of the committee that not having a majority on the committee will be to their personal advantage in the sense of the pressures that can be applied to them, and it will allow them to apply their intellectual rigour to the issues that come before them. So it is a reasonable outcome.

         In terms of the section that deals with how the chair should be elected, my personal view is that that ought to have been handled as part of the general arrangements between parties in this place, as part of the overall allocation of committee chairs and divisions of responsibility. It is a shame that that has not occurred—I am not quite sure that is the case. As I say, we are quite comfortable with the current chairman continuing, although my preference would have been for that to be considered as part of the broader picture. For the work that this particular committee does, the balance that we arrive at today will be in the committee's best interests, if not perhaps in the political best interests of any particular party. I support the amendments.

        —I will endeavour to be brief. The point I was making is that there are four measures in the bill. The last two measures which I was referring to
        <break page="1273" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         were the appointment of a super auditor—which is duplicating a process already in place in terms of various serious auditing responsibilities within ATSIC—and the introduction of a super administrative power, which would automatically stop the functioning of the ATSIC board under certain circumstances and possibly freeze the budget.
        </break>
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       All those measures are very serious and deserve consultation. I understand that the reason this bill has been proposed for exemption and is being rushed through is that, if the matter in relation to the appointment of the chair is not dealt with, the timetable in relation to other election matters may be interfered with. That is not a good enough  reason, and it actually puts the credibility of the Labor Party and the Democrats in doubt, because they have made public statements saying that they believe the two latter matters in the bill deserve the widest community consultation before we decide on them. Those matters are within the same bill that we are proposing to exempt from that time period and that consultation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As I understand it, if this motion passes, the bill we are considering now, which was introduced in this place only last week, will become the fourth on the program of debate in this chamber. It is utterly outrageous to be even proposing such a thing and I want to go on the public record as registering my strong disapproval if the opposition, the Labor Party and the Democrats are prepared to support the government in pushing this through in a disgraceful fashion.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       No doubt there are Aboriginal people who have been consulted in the drafting of the bill, but this has not been extended as it should, under the ATSIC Act, to Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. I want to stress in the strongest possible terms that what we are doing is quite wrong in exempting this bill.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The government asserts that it would be in danger of having the ATSIC election timetable thrown out if this bill is not exempted, but I would put it to the government that if the measures in this bill do not receive support—and I understand on the best authority from public statements of the Labor Party and the Democrats that they will not support other
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        measures in this bill—then, in any event, it will delay that particular ATSIC election timetable. The government would be far better advised to extract any measures that relate to that and deal with them separately and leave the bill to have the consultation and the community discussion and exposure that it deserves. As we know, Aboriginal people find the information flow within this place going out to the communities very difficult. We are not doing them any justice whatsoever to make it impossible.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       My strong view, and I think I have made my point quite clear, is to oppose the exemption of this bill from the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion. I would like to know why the Democrats are not opposing this, in light of their public comments in relation to the content of this bill. I would like to know the same of the ALP. What is the basis on which they would allow this bill to be exempted from the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion and thereby deprive Aboriginal people of having the scrutiny and opportunity to discuss the measures in this bill which have such serious implications for them and their future?

        —I wish to indicate, on behalf of the shadow minister responsible, that we will be supporting the exemption of this bill. In answer to Senator Chamarette's concerns, I indicate that we will be insisting on proper scrutiny of the provisions of the bill. We share some of the concerns she has raised. In fact, at the selection of bills committee meeting this afternoon, we will be seeking a reference to one of the committees of the Senate to allow that proper consultation with Aboriginal groups and other interested parties on the provisions of the bill and to allow proper examination of the bill. But because of the reasons expressed by the parliamentary secretary in terms of the urgency, we are prepared, having looked at those arguments, to support the exemption from the cut&amp;hyphen;off. But, as I say, we will be insisting on a thorough and proper scrutiny of the bill and a proper consideration of its provisions.

I think it would be sensible to deal with all the amendments in three parts: firstly, judicial authorisation, items 1 to 7 and 10 to 11; secondly, notification to Customs, items 8 and 9; and, thirdly, tendering of the certificate, item 12. I am interested in whether Senator Bolkus and Senator Spindler are happy to deal with them in that order and move them in that way. I think that is just a rational splitting up of the issues.

        These amendments on the judicial authorisation are directed towards ensuring that, when a controlled operation is to be undertaken, careful thought be given before such an operation is approved. We need to remember that what is being done through this legislation is to authorise police officers to participate in unlawful acts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendments, as they are now before the Committee, seek to ensure that, before such an operation can proceed, the law enforcement officer who is in charge of the operation in the first instance approaches the relevant senior law enforcement officer—the commissioner, deputy commissioner or a member of the NCA. That officer, having satisfied himself that he supports what is being asked for—namely, the authorisation of a controlled operation—would then approach a judge to seek final approval.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A number of concerns have been raised about this procedure. It has been said that it is cumbersome. Well, so be it. As I have said, we are here in a situation where we are authorising unlawful behaviour. The Democrats feel that we need to be extremely careful in that situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other concern raised was that we are running close to interfering with the principle of the separation of powers by involving judges in an operational or semi-operational decision. There are numerous examples in legislation, a couple of which have already been canvassed during the second reading debate, where this is already occurring.

The World Heritage (Properties Conservation) Act 1983 requires a judge to approve a warrant for entry and search; the AFP Act requires warrants for the use of listening devices; the Bankruptcy Act requires warrants for the seizure of property—and so on. The principle is well established.

        The final comment that was made was of a practical nature: that judges are reluctant to undertake that task. There is then the question of what occurs if it is difficult to get judges to do that? I believe that is a consideration we need to test. I think we need to be told whether or not judges are, in fact, going to refuse to act in this particular manner when they are asked to do so. I believe that these amendments, taken together, are a distinct improvement to the bill that is before the committee. I commend them to the committee.

         —There is not much time available in this debate, but I just want to flag a couple of points that Senator Spindler may have the opportunity to reflect on during the forthcoming debates before we come back to this matter. He says that there is an expectation that judges would be reluctant to do this, and he puts the case that we should put it to the test—in other words, pass some legislation and see if it works. I just invite Senator Spindler to come back and indicate to us to which judges he has spoken who have indicated to him that they would be unhappy to undertake this task. If he can do that, I think his debate will have significantly more credibility than it now does.

         —Not even you, Senator Vanstone. I have been pointing out the reality, the facts, of what, I think, many of us in this chamber believe to have been the potential for conflict of interest involving the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, as a result of investments he made while he was Treasurer and deals he made while he was Prime Minister.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No-one objects properly to treasurers, ministers or prime ministers having investments and keeping those investments while in those positions of office. However, as I have pointed out repeatedly, many of the actions of Mr Keating and his partner raised the question of potential conflict of interest in this chamber. Honourable senators would remember that Mr Keating was the half owner of a piggery he acquired while Treasurer, and while Prime Minister he was the half owner of that piggery when it entered into a multi-million dollar joint venture with a foreign multinational company.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question of potential for conflict of interest has been raised many times in this place. I was intrigued to note that when it was raised recently in the other chamber, Mr Beazley quite wrongly said, `But Mr Keating sold out his interest when he became Prime Minister.' That is simply false. Apart from there being a campaign of personal vilification against me, what concerns me is that there is an attempt to rewrite history about Mr Keating's role—the real role he played in this piggery matter.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason why this matter has come up again is that Mr Keating has announced that he intends to go into various business enterprises in Asia, particularly in the country from which came the money that rescued Mr Keating from what was, on the face of it, a disaster in the piggery that resulted in a very handsome profit for Mr Keating while the Commonwealth Bank of Australia suffered a huge loss. This piggery is coming back to haunt him.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is no good members of the opposition saying, `Look, this has all ended a long time ago.' It did not end a long time ago, as evidenced by Mr Beazley's very recent attempts to rewrite history about it. I want to stress to this chamber that everything I said here was backed by documentary evidence, by searches of the Australian Securities Commission, the Land Titles Office and so on. The things that I pointed out as being improper, illegal and irregular have all been demonstrated to be exactly that. In fact, it is even worse than it appears on the surface.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Over several years I noted that the companies that Mr Keating half owned were in constant breach of the Corporations Law. Whenever I raised the matter in this parliament, I was accused of being everything that one should not say in this chamber, because the words are probably improper. I have been accused of even worse things outside this chamber, but the status and nature of the person making the accusations is such that I regarded his comments as an accolade. The reality is that Mr Keating was a half owner of these companies—while he was Prime Minister and Treasurer—while they were breaking the law. No amount of personal abuse against me can change that situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that there is a smell over the Keating piggery and Keating's involvement in it. That smell, that lingers still, comes not only from the effluent problem that prompted, in January of this year, the Scone Council in New South Wales to give the new owners of the ex-Keating piggery 60 days to clean it up or face closure—by the way, according to the locals, things are now less worse up there after some work has been done. Even more on the nose is Paul Keating's business partner
         <break page="1278" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and friend, the butcher&amp;hyphen;turned&amp;hyphen;accountant Achilles Constantinidis, who ran the piggery group for Mr Keating during their almost three&amp;hyphen;year piggery partnership.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Added to this problem is the Sydney solicitor Christopher Coudounaris, the secretary of the family company Pleuron, who has been found guilty in the Sutherland local court of three offences against the Corporations Law relating to his failure to file annual returns for three companies involved in the Keating piggery joint venture with the Danes. Four similar actions against Achilles Constantinidis have also proceeded. Mr Constantinidis has been found guilty of the very offences that I was attacked, in this chamber, for pointing out were taking place. This is on top of all the penalties imposed by the Australian Securities Commission—I think there were 13 or 14—on Mr Constantinidis and/or his companies for failure to meet the basic requirements of the Australian Securities Commission in respect of annual reports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The past does seem to be catching up with Mr Constantinidis. It is probably more like chickens coming home to roost than bringing home the bacon. That past includes the years of his very close involvement with Paul Keating—a relationship close enough for Paul Keating and his wife, Annita, to entrust Mr Constantinidis, together with Mr Keating's brother, Greg Keating, with their power of attorney since 1989.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why would Mr Keating, then Treasurer, give Mr Constantinidis his power of attorney? That power of attorney, according to records at the Titles Office when I last looked, had not been officially revoked. It may well have been subsequently; I do not know. But the fact is that this power of attorney indicated a very close relationship between Mr Constantinidis and Mr Keating at a time when Mr Constantinidis was seeking to involve the Danes in a joint venture which was needed to rescue this financially unstable company from disaster.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The former Prime Minister, when he was Prime Minister, was subject to severe criticism in the Danish stock market journal just before Christmas, which featured Paul Keating on its cover under the heading `Prime
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Minister involved in Danish scandal', describing the Danpork joint venture with the Keating-Constantinidis piggery group as a `fiasco' for which the Danish chairman blamed his choice of Australian partners. In that article Mr Keating was described as having `chaos in his money matters', his piggery group as being an `economic morass' that was constantly behind in their payments and the Keating-Constantinidis piggery site at Scone as `totally unsuitable' for the joint venture.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Added to these problems—and I am restating some of them because these are the matters that I have been criticised for raising; matters that go to the heart of the potential for conflict of interest—is the curious involvement in the cascading TV tender winner, Mr Albert Hadid—who, by the way, seems to have close business links with Mr Keating's sister, Anne Keating—and the New South Wales right wing Lebanese number cruncher Mr Eddie Obeid in the piggery group, along with Mr Constantinidis's business partnership, which I must say I cannot understand, with the Indonesian joint venturers Gerry Hand and Bechara Khouri. Mr Khouri, I understand, is a `best mate' of Mr Keating's electorate officer at Bankstown who is now the candidate for Blaxland.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In any event, at best the Constantinidis mess is an embarrassment to Mr Keating and an underlining of this potential for conflict of interest. This problem has been compounded by Mr Keating's obsessive secrecy about this piggery venture, which only really came to light in its full flowering, if I can use that expression, as a result of my inquiries which had to go through the Australian Securities Commission. They certainly were not revealed properly in any declaration of interest.

          What has happened to Mr Constantinidis since I raised the fact that Mr Keating's half-owned companies were being improperly run is this: Mr Constantinidis has been suspended by his professional body for unprofessional conduct. He is being sued in the Supreme Court for breach of trust. I do not want to enter into the rights and wrongs of that matter; it is before the courts. He has been found guilty of four breaches of the Corpora tions Law. He has been penalised repeatedly by the ASC for continual failures to meet its reporting requirements. He has been criticised by a Supreme Court judge for diverting company funds to an unauthorised bank account. He has been criticised in the Industrial Relations Court—in fact, only last month—for harshly, unjustly and unreasonably dismissing three piggery workers after their successful complaint about being paid less than the award wage while Mr Keating was a half&amp;hyphen;owner.

         He has been accused by his Danish former joint venture partners of having tarnished their image in Australia and blamed by the Danes for the Danish parent company's $10 million loss last year. He was also the chief executive officer of the piggery group when legal action was taken against member companies to recover years of unpaid workers compensation insurance premiums when workers superannuation fund payments were not made and when at least three workers were found to have been underpaid award wages for years—all while Mr Keating was the half-owner. There is not only the potential for conflict of interest; there is the potential for a Prime Minister being put in an intolerable position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite my repeated suggestions for Mr Keating to dissociate himself from, let alone condemn, the improper behaviour of Mr Constantinidis in Mr Keating's piggery companies, particularly his contemptuous disregard for the Corporations Law, Mr Keating's only response to me was personal abuse. I was even described, I think, as `parliamentary filth' at one stage for daring to raise these matters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The closeness of their relationship has some bearing—closeness evidenced by that power of attorney—on many of the unanswered questions already posed in the parliament about Mr Keating's own role in the piggery, particularly over the nature of disposal of his half-ownership, whether he retains any existing or potential ownership rights and the role he played in establishing the joint venture with the Danes in the first place. As I said, they had been close enough since 14 December 1989, long before Treasurer Keating became Constantinidis's 50 per cent partner

          in the Brown and Hatton piggery and refrigeration group on 15 May 1991, for Mr Keating not only to entrust him with his power of attorney but also with the absolute control of the company in which Paul Keating had invested almost half a million dollars in what he described as `punting the super on the future'.

         So all the time that Australian government officials, particularly in Austrade, were putting an incredible effort into generating the joint venture with Denmark that was the only hope of saving then former Labor minister John Brown's piggery group from financial disaster, Paul Keating had a very close relationship with Brown's then partner Constantinidis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Three weeks after Mr Keating bought his half-ownership of the piggery while Treasurer in May 1991, Austrade officials were warned that Keating's company's yet unnamed involvement in the Danpork joint venture was a `sensitive matter about which we should not make inquiries'. Even worse, Austrade's then boss noted in a memo to him on 26 March 1992 when Mr Keating was Prime Minister and a half-owner of the piggery:

         So here were government instrumentalities doing everything they could to bring a major benefit to the Prime Minister at the time, by way of a joint venture. If the opposition would like to have this letter tabled, I would be only too happy to table it. In fact, while I regret that I did not show it to the opposition first, I seek leave to table this letter.

         —I rise today to speak on a matter of the utmost public interest. I might say that I do not intend to get down into the gutter like the previous speaker did. I do not want to deal with personalities. I want to deal with an issue that affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Sydney: that is, the issue of Sydney's second airport.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This has been an issue which has vexed people and governments for over 40 years. The history of the coalition, when in government, in handling the problem of adequate airport facilities in Sydney has been nothing short of a disgrace. They were in government from 1949 until 1972, and again from 1975 to 1983, making a period of some 30 years. In that period, they did virtually nothing at all to deal with the problems of increasing congestion and increasing levels of aircraft noise at Sydney airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As Sydney airport grew in size and capacity, the coalition government sat on their hands and did nothing about dealing with the siting of a new, second airport for Sydney. Obviously, they were not really too concerned about this issue that affected the lives of many hundreds of thousands of residents, because those residents largely affected lived in safe Labor seats.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was only when the Labor government came to power—under Prime Minister Hawke and, subsequently, Prime Minister Keating—that real decisions were made to deal with this problem. As I have said, it is a very difficult problem and a vexed issue. As everyone knows, wherever you propose to locate an airport or some other major facility you will always have people who will be upset and who will object.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Nevertheless, the Hawke government and the Keating government took the issue on and dealt with it honestly and openly. After a process of site selection, commenced in 1983—there was a joint study undertaken at that time by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments—a suitable site for a second airport for Sydney was selected. That site was at Badgerys Creek in western Sydney. An airport was to be constructed
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         there, to be known as Sydney West Airport.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Some 10 sites were considered in that process of evaluation. One of those sites was Holsworthy. At the time, Holsworthy was rejected as unsuitable, for a range of reasons which I will come back to later in my speech.
         </tab>
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, Badgerys Creek was ultimately selected as the site for Sydney's second airport. The process of land acquisition commenced and has continued. Subsequently, the decision was taken to build a third runway at Mascot. That was urged upon the Hawke government by the Liberal government in New South Wales and the interests so closely aligned with the coalition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When that decision—albeit not necessarily a popular one with everybody—was taken, the decision also included a very firm commitment to proceed with the staged development of Badgerys Creek. Funds have been allocated, land has been acquired and the process of establishing an airport at Badgerys Creek has commenced. That decision was supported throughout by the coalition. They supported Badgerys Creek as the preferred site.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, on a number of occasions they attacked the Labor government for not moving fast enough in proceeding to construct the airport. That is an accusation that I totally reject but it nevertheless clearly highlights that the then opposition, now the coalition government, was committed to the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek. Holsworthy, of course, had been rejected. But look what we have now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has come to light in recent weeks that the government has a secret agenda to reopen the possibility of an airport at Holsworthy. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, gave the game away when he acknowledged this. Holsworthy has been put firmly back on the map as a site for Sydney's second airport. It has come to light that secret meetings were held between the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, the then shadow spokesperson on transport, Senator Parer, other representatives of the opposition, and the developers who were putting this proposal to the opposition at the time. As we understand it that was back in October 1994 and possibly at subsequent
        <break page="1281" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         meetings. Naturally, we do not have all of the details but, as each day goes by, a bit more leaks out and we get a bit more information. It all points quite clearly to a secret agenda by the coalition to put Holsworthy firmly back on the list as a site for Sydney's second airport.

        This is an absolute total breach of faith by the coalition. It is a breach of firm undertakings given by the coalition, both in opposition and in government, with respect to the issue of Sydney's second airport. It is a cruel deception on the people of Sydney, particularly those surrounding the area of Holsworthy. It is a cruel deception on the voters and the people in the electorate of Hughes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a breach of faith, a breach of undertakings, because the coalition—as I have said—is firmly on the record as supporting the site at Badgerys Creek for Sydney's second airport. They have done that on numerous occasions in the past. I will come shortly to the most recent instance of that which was the Senate select committee that was conducted last year into the issue of aircraft noise in Sydney. That committee included consideration of the siting of the second airport at Badgerys Creek.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, a cruel deception has been played upon the people of Sydney and in particular the people of the electorate of Hughes in which the site of Holsworthy exists. It is deceptive because at the last election the coalition went to the people committed to the construction of Sydney West Airport at Badgerys Creek. At no stage during that election campaign did the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, or anyone else, tell the people of Sydney or the people of New South Wales—in particular the people of the electorate of Hughes—that they were considering Holsworthy as a possible site for Sydney's second airport.

        A Senate select committee took over 5,200 submissions from people on aircraft noise. The the opposition at the time campaigned on the issue in the electorates of Lowe, Grayndler, Lindsay, Parramatta, Bennelong, Barton and Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith. It put up its proposal of reopening the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. I acknowledge that that was firmly on the agenda and was made known to the people. It was never made known that the government had a secret agenda in its back pocket to put Holsworthy back on the list. All the people who have bought land, built houses and achieved their dreams, in suburbs such as Wattle Grove, in the Sutherland Shire area and in areas surrounding Liverpool, have done so in the firm belief and understanding that there would be no airport in Holsworthy. They had the firm understanding that the coalition, like the Labor Party, was committed to Badgerys Creek as the site for the second airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the campaign, John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, made a lot of noise about honesty and integrity. Why did he not tell the people that this proposal of Holsworthy was in the back pocket and was going to be filtered out after the election? Why did he not come clean? Why did not the then shadow transport minister, Senator Parer, tell people about this proposal? Senator Parer chaired the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. I was a member of this committee as was Madam Acting Deputy President.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="1282" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The committee took 5,200 submissions and had 14 days of detailed hearings and evidence from people. At no stage did Senator Parer tell the committee what his party had in mind with respect to Holsworthy. On one or two occasions, the issue of Holsworthy was raised by witnesses to the committee, but not a word was said by Senator Parer or any of the other coalition committee members. Mr Pickrell from the North Shore raised Holsworthy on behalf of his group. I questioned him exten sively about the problems of Holsworthy; the problems of the environment; the issues as it affected the water catchment of the Woronora River; and the issues relating to the army base and the unexploded munitions. There was a whole range of issues that clearly ruled out any possibility of Holsworthy as a suitable site.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But Senator Parer and the other coalition committee members sat mute. This entire committee process was designed to take as much evidence, elicit as much information and give as much consideration as possible to this important issue. Senator Parer knew all along that the then opposition had a real proposal for Holsworthy as a site for Sydney's second airport. As I said, nothing could be more cruel than that sort of deception on the people of the electorate of Hughes and on the wider Sydney community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Danna Vale, the Liberal candidate who beat Robert Tickner and won the seat of Hughes, never once mentioned the fact that there was a real possibility that a coalition government would put Holsworthy back on the map. In fact, in one of her campaign brochures, she was in the electorate in a photo with members of the defence forces at the Holsworthy army base. She was quite prepared to acknowledge the presence of the Holsworthy defence base, but she was not prepared to say what the opposition had in store for the people of Holsworthy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I actually suspect that Danna Vale did not know. And if that is the case, she could not tell the electors of Hughes. But why didn't the leader of the then opposition, Mr Howard, tell Danna Vale that that was their proposal? Why didn't Senator Parer tell the candidate that that is what they had in store? I can tell you why they would not have wanted this to filter out: they would have known what the reaction would have been from the people in Holsworthy, in Sutherland Shire and the area surrounding Liverpool if this proposal had even seen the light of day in an election campaign. There would have been absolute community outrage—and Danna Vale would not have been sitting in the House of Representatives now as the member for Hughes; Robert Tickner would still have been there.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course they did not want this to come out, because they knew what the reaction of the people would be. John Howard himself, as the then leader of the opposition, gave evidence to the committee and never once mentioned this. But the people will certainly remember it.

         —I would like to comment on the issue of interactive television gaming. Last month I received a report from the chairman of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Select Committee on Interactive Television Gaming, Mr Tim Baldwin, MLA. The report examines the future impact of broadband communication services on the Northern Territory's racing and gaming industry, with specific reference to the impact of interactive television gaming on the Northern Territory's revenue base.

        The issues explored by this report will prove to be very important to every Australian state in the near future. I therefore urge interested senators to obtain a copy of the report from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly with a view to forwarding it to their state parliamentary colleagues and to the many contacts I am sure they have in the racing industry, the gaming industry and so many other areas of interest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at the table of contents to this important report it is very interesting to read the scope of the committee's activities and the headlines under which it addressed its report, such as the introduction of broadband capacity and the effects that will obviously have on communications policy, technology development, various Australian trials and the connections to homes and businesses—in my case, in the Northern Territory.

         There is a chapter in the report that addresses the racing and gaming industry, the international racing and gaming product, the Australian racing and gaming industry, gambling availability, gambling propensity, industry funding and taxation, pay television and the racing industry. There is a chapter on emerging interactive TV gaming opportunities; a very important section on the impact of broadband services and how they will affect interjurisdictional issues; and chapters on the Northern Territory TAB and racing impact, lotteries and lotto impact, casino gaming impact, community based poker machine impact, sports betting impact, the net effect on Northern Territory revenue, and consumer lifestyles and social impacts. There is a concluding chapter on risk management and opportunity enhancement. This includes such important issues as Commonwealth government regulation, the state level of cooperation, and references to the future of racing itself and the social impact of this important issue.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would now like to read some excerpts from the report, for the benefit of senators who are not familiar with the concept of interactive communication systems and the prospective threat they pose to existing state revenue bases. On page 25, the report says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Interactive television allows signals to be sent up stream (out) through a set&amp;hyphen;top box connected to a television set. This enables access to services such as banking, gambling or shopping.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The user can choose what to receive and when and how to receive it. Interactive television is distinct from other on&amp;hyphen;line services, which can be accessed through a variety of mediums such as computer terminals and the telephone.
        </para>
        <para>
         The terms of reference of the report limited the committee to examining the impact of interactive television gaming only. However, as the following excerpt from page 32 of the committee's report suggests, interactive gaming is currently available in many other forms:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club introduced hand&amp;hyphen;held betting devices which are accessed through free local calls. Hong Kong has a strong wagering industry, with 10 per cent of the population holding a telephone betting account. Between

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is envisaged that with the rapid advent of technological development it will not be long before such gaming systems are readily available in Australia. In fact, I understand that various gaming facilities are already available on the Internet. The obvious threat posed by such gaming facilities to Australian states and territories is the flow of untaxed gaming revenue out of jurisdictions. As we know, taxes raised from gaming within each state and territory greatly contribute towards supporting the local gaming industry, our racing industry, and the provision of a range of services in the community in general and sporting groups specifically.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee's report anticipates that in the medium term, the expansion of interactive television gaming may cause a net leakage of revenue out of the Northern Territory. The report proceeds to examine the various advantages and disadvantages the Northern Territory may experience in relation to other larger Australian states and territories. It also examines possible future opportunities available to the Northern Territory as interactive television gaming expands within Australia—something which is inevitable.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee came to the conclusion that interactive television gaming will become a major recreational activity in Australia. It is therefore important that every other Australian state and territory note the work the Northern Territory has done on this issue and prepare for the advent of a technology which knows no boundaries. I am not aware of any other report either of this parliament or of any state parliament that has so seriously addressed this particular issue. Therefore, I would commend the report for the consideration of senators.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I urge any interested senators to obtain a copy of the committee's report from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I am told that the report is also available on the Internet on the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's home page. The address is http://www.nt.govt.au/lant/. I certainly commend this important issue and this very important report to the Senate.

         —I rise today to draw attention to another program and series of funding, which organisations and individuals are uncertain about the future of: the national agenda for women grant program, which ends on 30 June this year. This program does a number of things. It has a section of its grant portfolio set aside to assist women's organisations, and it also has a significant part of its money set aside to give grants to individual groups, for small community groups to conduct programs as they see fit around the community and the countryside.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The program has proven very popular. What the women's organisations and the community organisations have been able to do with small amounts of money has been very, very good. The program has provided the women's organisations and the women in their communities with information, with access and with education, and in rural areas it has removed feelings of isolation and of disadvantage.
         </tab>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But we have not heard yet what is going to happen to the national agenda for women grant programs. There are 20 women's organisations funded for small amounts of money under the grant, but that grant runs out on 30 June. As I understand it, these organisations have still not heard whether there is going to be some interim funding to take them up to the budget—when, hopefully, there will be a commitment given in the budget. It is vitally important.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are talking about an organisation like CAPOW, the Coalition of Australian Participating Organisations of Women. This is a grouping together of 61 of the women's organisations in this country, so that they can come together and network and work together on programs. And they worked very well together in the build&amp;hyphen;up to the women's conference in Beijing.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         They were able to coordinate a response, and to seek information and responses from women across Australia about what the Australian position should be. They brought that to the government very well. It was included in the government's
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          position, and they were also able to have their delegates attend the NGO forum that was conducted at Huirou, prior to the conference in Beijing. They did very well and gained a lot of credit for the women of Australia. They also had a number of official NGO delegates who were able to participate and to lobby in the conference itself, in Beijing.
         </break>
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The work that those women did is absolutely inestimable. It was of high quality and was valued by everybody who came in contact with the Australian women. Comments were received by those of us who were delegates to the conference, about the valuable adjunct to our work we had in the representatives of those non&amp;hyphen;government organisations. A number of us met daily with the NGO women and we were able to exchange ideas and information, and generally have a very constructive time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What sorts of organisations am I talking about? I am not talking about radical organisations that want to overthrow society as we know it. I am talking about organisations that are dependent upon the national agenda for women grant funding. They are organisations such as: the Association of non&amp;hyphen;English Speaking Background Women of Australia; the Association of Women Educators; the Coalition of Australian Participating Organisations of Women, commonly known as CAPOW; the Catholic Women's League; the Coalition of Activist Lesbians; the Foundation of Australian Agricultural Women; the Maternity Alliance; the National Council for the Single Mother and her Child; the National Council of Women of Australia; the National Women's Justice Coalition; the National Women's Media Centre; the Network of Women in Further Education; the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia; the Older Women's Network of Australia; the Refugee Women's Network; Women in Film and Television; Women with Disabilities Australia; the Women's Electoral Lobby; the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and Women's Sport Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These organisations represent a very good cross&amp;hyphen;section of women's organisations in this country. It is absolutely essential that these organisations know beforehand that they do
        <break page="1285" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         not have to disrupt their programs or to spend time wondering about what they do between 30 June and the budget. If people ask this government any questions about funding, they keep being told to wait until the budget. These organisations cannot afford to wait until the budget. Either they have to be given a grant funding now for the next 12 months, or they have to be given interim funding.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am very familiar with the work of the Nursing Mothers Association. Prior to my involvement in politics, I spent a lot of time working as an early childhood nurse, and I know the valuable support that that organisation was able to give mothers with young children and small babies. Those mothers they had as counsellors, would be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Whilst many of the mothers knew where the clinical staff were and they could contact us, they felt hesitant to contact those of us in the profession. But they welcomed the ready availability of these volunteer women. The amount of money that this organisation gets, is small, but it enables them to have a network of support across this country for mothers and families with young babies. Anyone who has had a difficult young baby will certainly relish the assistance that was able to be given by that organisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You might wonder what CAPOW does. It is a network of all 61 participating organisations, running across a very wide range of interests and activities, from the YWCA, Unifem—the Union of Australian Women—Women in the Australian Church, and the National Women's Christian Temperance Union. That last organisation was one of the four leading organisations in the struggle for women to get franchise in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The sorts of organisations that are affiliated with CAPOW rely very strongly on the ability that CAPOW provides to provide information, to facilitate communication among affiliated groups, and to lobby as necessary. `Lobbying' is not such a terrible word; in fact it is a very vital word as far as these organisations are concerned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        CAPOW also puts out—four times a year—a bulletin that is available to all of its organisations. Some of the issues canvassed in the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         autumn 1996 bulletin relate to preparations for the Habitat II conference that is to be held. It talks about some of the issues that people may wish to raise at that conference and it gets women to think about the issues. They have reproduced an article from the national newspaper of the United Nations Association of Australia. There is also an item in the bulletin, in relation to the Habitat II conference, that relates to women with disabilities. It is getting women with disabilities to think about their habitat needs and that is very important. There is also an article on the ending of female genital mutilation. These are the sorts of issues that are vitally important to women. While some of these issues may not affect many women in Australia, the ability of Australian women's organisations to stand up and take a position on these issues adds strength to the lobbying, and it also adds strength to the pressure that women in other countries are placing within their own countries.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        CAPOW, as the networking body, has been responsible for facilitating the dissemination of the top 12 topics at the Beijing women's conference and for a brief summary of actions recommended in the platform for action. Again, this enables Australian women to understand and know the major issues addressed in Beijing. It enables the Australian women to understand the plans of action and to support, as necessary and as they are able, the pressure, the requests, the needs that women all over the world may have.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first topic relates to the burden of poverty on women, and the equal access to education and training. Those of us who went to Beijing were able to see very clearly, from the figures and statistics given to us, that in many developing countries the number of years that the girl child spends in education, or has access to, falls far short of what is available to her male peer. Of course, the women from those countries saw it as being vitally important that the girls in those countries had equal access. There is information for Australian organisations on how they can support their sister organisations and their sisters in other countries. This is also vitally important. It is an essential thing for women

        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I urge the government to look very earnestly at this issue and to act now to do something for these 20&amp;hyphen;odd organisations whose funding will cease on 30 June. It is something that we cannot afford to have happen. One such organisation is Women with Disabilities Australia. Their objectives are to develop a network of women, with disabilities, throughout Australia to work together for their mutual benefit, and to advocate for every woman with a disability to have the opportunity for true involvement in all levels of society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The organisation further states that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed that women with disabilities are more often institutionalised, less likely to work for money, earn less, less likely to own a home, and less likely to receive requested personal care and household assistance than men with the same needs. Of course, it has to be said that probably the men with the same needs are being cared for by women. But when it comes to the woman's turn to require this assistance, it is often not available to her as readily as it is to males. That is not meant to be a disparaging remark in relation to males but it is certainly a comment in relation to ages and the roles that women have assumed. This is the sort of organisation that will be affected.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn now to another issue. On Monday I asked the question of Senator Parer on drought exceptional circumstances and asked when we could expect to see the minister's response to the RASAC report which he had commissioned on 20 March and which he has asked to be presented on 11 April. Senator Parer initially was unable to provide me with an answer but came back at the end of question time saying that a decision was going to be made soon.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have been talking to people in the areas that have been affected, in the Wilcannia&amp;hyphen;Cobar area, and they are pleading that the decision be made quickly. They do not know, and being left not knowing whether or not they are going to be included in the exceptional circumstances area is causing them great anxiety. It means that they cannot plan.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         It means that they do not know whether or not they are going to get assistance. They are better off knowing that they are not going to get assistance than sitting, waiting and hoping that they are going to be eligible.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am told that the situation out there is desperate. People are desperate to have a decision now. The minister, I think, has had plenty of time within which to make that decision. He ordered the report on 20 March. He asked for it to be delivered on 11 April. It is now 29 May. Six weeks have elapsed, and nothing has been heard. The minister was able to make a decision quite quickly about cooked chicken meat, despite giving an assurance to the producers in that industry prior to the election that no decision would be made until after the Nairn committee report had been received. That is expected in October of this year. But he appears to have made a decision quickly on that one. Why can the minister not make a decision quickly on whether there is going to be an extension of drought exceptional circumstances?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A lot of work had been done on this issue prior to the change of government. There had been submissions and requests made to the previous minister to extend the drought exceptional circumstances. The information had not been adequate, and the minister had requested further information. That information would have been coming into the department during the changeover, in the caretaker period of government. It is vitally important. That information would have been there, available for the minister on his desk, as soon as he started having briefings. He would, therefore, have been in the situation of receiving good and adequate briefings early in his reign as minister. But we still have no decision.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On behalf of the people of the Western Division areas of New South Wales who are affected by this, I urge the minister to make a decision very soon—to make it now—so that they know where they stand and they are able to make decisions for their future.

My first speech on this topic was to take note of his original ban, which had been made on 12 May 1994 and which came on to the agenda of the Senate on 6 June. I moved to take note of the document. In my speech, which covers a number of pages of

          , I indicated my interest in this part of my state, my significant interest in justice for Aboriginal Australians, my involvement for six years on the Council of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, and my knowledge of the Coorong and Lower Murray area, which I love, as an environmentalist. I visit the area, I sail in the area, I travel to see this relative wilderness, with the birds and all of the pleasures of this great heritage that is in my state.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I conclude by urging Minister Tickner to tell me the reasons, even if it is on a private basis, so that I can be satisfied as one senator. But more than me, the interested parties in South Australia should be told the reasons. What is the Aboriginal heritage that is at risk in this matter which has escaped five years or more of investigation? If there is no disclosure and if this declaration is continued beyond 14 June for any reason, we will have a conclusion that can rightly be reached. We would say that this was the most intrusive power of any government or any minister to upset a development that may be to the benefit of thousands of Australians—a project that has involved many millions of dollars of work—without reasons being given to all of the parties involved.

This explanation should be given both in terms of the reasons for the declaration under section 9 being made (that is, the nature of the appeals or the alleged heritage matters to be protected) and then, later, in terms of the confirmed findings of any inquiries made as a result of the Minister's intervention. In particular, I respect the fact that some aboriginal heritage matters are secret to the specific guardians of that heritage. However, it would be a failure of Ministerial accountability if such secrecy denied an appropriate and substantial explanation by the Minister of the matters involved. Appropriate, intelligible summaries (which avoid the specific secret words) would still need to be given by the Minister.

        . . . as a consequence of Ministerial intervention under this Act, the Minister publish a clear explanation of the specific heritage matters that are in need of protection. This explanation should be given both in terms of the reasons for the declaration under section 9 being made (that is, the nature of the appeals or the alleged heritage matters to be protected) and then, later, in terms of the confirmed findings of any inquiries made as a result of the Minister's intervention. In particular, I respect the fact that some Aboriginal heritage matters are secret to the specific guardians of that heritage. However, it would be a failure of Ministerial accountability if such secrecy denied an appropriate and substantial explanation by the Minister of the matters involved. Appropriate, intelligible summaries (which avoid the specific secret words) would still need to be given by the Minister.

        I have incorporated Cheryl Saunders's direct response—that she received it. I have no evidence to show that it affected her whatsoever, because the report that she gave to the minister—which eventually was published—did not meet the criteria, the suggestions, that I have just underlined.

The nearest we have to it I referred to in a speech in the Senate on 11 October 1994, after I had read that Saunders report, and I briefly refer to it in these terms. I have not time to outline the four principal reasons why I was moving, on 11 October 1994, for the Senate to disallow the minister's ban on the bridge, because no reasons had been given. In six or seven pages and in that debate my views are set out, and they have been confirmed by the royal commission of last December into this whole matter. It found evidence of fabrication and that the bridge should now be built because the evidence for any ban was just not there.

        we have as to the reasons for blocking the bridge. Because a bridge is unmediated by water, it is somehow offensive to the spiritual significance of the lower Murray region for maybe five women. I respect the spiritual beliefs and views and anything that is dearly held by those five women, but they themselves did not know what the significance of this area was until April this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even though former Minister Tickner knew, there was not one person who knew anything about this apparent significance as of May 1994. That has been admitted totally by the main witness for this anthropologist's evidence, Mrs Kartinyeri. My speech continues:

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Does it mean that there is some fear amongst the four or five women there would not be live births or that their spiritual belief would somehow be obstructed or compromised? That is not being put forward. There is no logic in the explanation. If there is logic, please may we all be enlightened. The government is not being accountable and it is a failure of accountability for a minister to stop a bridge on the basis of some flimsy reference to the spiritual beliefs of some Aboriginal Australians.
        </para>

         I do not claim that any genuinely held belief is flimsy. I am saying that this fabrication is flimsy, as is the evidence purported by the minister at that time.

         Since then, a six&amp;hyphen;month royal commission was set up by the South Australian government. Mrs Stevens, who conducted the royal commission exhaustively, found in December last year that there was a total fabrication: everyone including the minister had been conned. Unfortunately, before that December finding of the royal commission in Adelaide, former Minister Tickner set up another inquiry and he appointed Justice Jane Matthews to conduct a further inquiry into the bridge. For legal reasons, the current government, even since the election, is not able to stop that further inquiry. It is an unnecessary inquiry in my mind, and I have some concluding remarks to make about it. Of course, we must take into account whatever Justice Matthews may have to say. The report is due in June next month.

         Yesterday, the full Federal Court made an important decision that, in a matter touching upon Aboriginal heritage, then Minister Tickner had denied natural justice. This is not just one federal judge; this is the full bench of the Federal Court. It was a decision in regard to the other controversial element, the only other ban that has been ordered, and that was with regard to a crocodile farm in Broome in Western Australia. The decision from this morning's

         In another part of the same article, there is the very apt remark that this ruling of yesterday may affect the Hindmarsh Bridge case. This idea is along the lines of my speech in June of last year, my discussion with Minister Tickner at the time and with investigator Saunders, and our motion of disallowance in the Senate of October 1994.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I support the words I have incorporated from the article. There must be natural justice, there must be an explanation and there must be accountability. I therefore use this forum of the Senate to directly address Justice Jane Mathews and say to her and those involved in the inquiry which is now under way and is to be reported next month that these matters must be faced. This whole inquiry of Justice Mathews is secret. There have been no public hearings. The press are not allowed to be there. I, as an interested senator, have not been asked for a submission. My colleagues
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         Most seriously, the decision of the Federal Court yesterday directly requires the judge to ensure that all parties have natural justice. I then put the same formulas that I put to Minister Tickner at the time, that I put to Cheryl Saunders and that I have argued for here in the Senate. If Justice Mathews fails to address the question of natural justice and fails to disclose to interested parties all of the relevant documents and papers that she has before her, she will not have any credible finding—as far as it would be received by this one senator or, I believe, by the parliament or by the government of the day. Let us consider her views and her findings when the report comes to our attention. In the meantime, I make the plea as abundantly clear as I can that the question of natural justice must be directly responded to by Justice Mathews.

        First, I would like to turn to a speech I made on the adoption of the aircraft noise in Sydney report on 30 November 1995. I said:

        by Tom Burton, headed `Coalition risks new airport noise protest'. He pointed out the fact that under the coalition government proposal—if they were to be in government—planes would be taking off to the north on the existing third runway. Of course, that is the secret plan. Although Senator Parer, as the shadow minister, was quick to deny it, I point out to the people of Sydney, particularly those people who will be affected, that this is just another way the opposition would, if they were ever in the government, vastly affect them in relation to activity that has been banned.

       <para>
        Of course, I was right and the people of Sydney were wronged, because the government of Mr Howard has gone ahead and is doing that. The major betrayal I want to refer to today is a much more serious one. It is the Holsworthy airport proposal whereby 450,000 people in various parts of south&amp;hyphen;west Sydney would be adversely affected. That is on one reading of it. That is one possibility. It is a serious proposition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The alternative is that this government is just putting up a smokescreen so that there will be no second airport for Sydney and so that some of the vested interests will not move out of Sydney. People in the inner city of Sydney will have to put up with extensive noise. Whereas our government was moving strongly to develop Badgerys Creek, this government now has stopped in the process and they have proposed this Holsworthy option.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I remember, as a member of this select committee looking into aircraft noise, that we had a proposal from a Mr Pickrell, from a North Shore group. He was following the tradition, I think, that people want an airport but not in their own area. I quote now from the evidence where Mr Pickrell said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It may well be that this has to be surrendered as a water source and used as a recreational facility instead.

        He is referring there to the Woronora Reserve.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Closeness to the Lucas Heights atomic energy installation was mentioned in the EIS and our view is that it may be necessary to move the facility, which would get a lot of cheers from the people of Sutherland. It certainly would not be accepted as a hindrance to a new airport.
       </para>
       <para>
        So he referred to it in his proposal. Yesterday, I asked Senator Parer, the minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology, what the government would do as far as a Lucas Heights proposal was concerned. Senator Parer did not answer that question that I asked him yesterday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is very significant because in the 1979 report of the major airport needs of Sydney, where a careful evaluation was made, the people making that evaluation made the point that Lucas Heights was a significant issue as
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         far as a nuclear reactor was concerned and, of course, that was not addressed by Senator Parer yesterday. It is a major problem and it seriously affects the financial probity of any proposal. But, of course, we do not know who the developers have behind them. We do not know what resources they have. We have no idea at all of how effective that proposal will be.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We certainly know that it is a problem, particularly for the people of Sutherland. As soon as Mr Pickrell presented his material to the committee, I got in touch with Mr Robert Tickner, then the member for Hughes, and he immediately took that matter up in opposition, leading the people of Sutherland against that proposal. The unfortunate thing for Mr Tickner was that the government, then the opposition, did not share that with the people. This is a devious government that we face in Australia at the present. Even though Mr Howard—`honest John Howard'&amp;hyphen; came before our committee he did not present to us what he had on his mind; in other words, the Holsworthy option was never given to the people of Sutherland.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Tickner fought that issue before the election and it will be very interesting to find out whether the Liberal candidate for Sutherland—she is now, at the last minute, taking up the issue—ever raised her voice on behalf of the people of Sutherland against the Holsworthy proposal. Mr Tickner pointed out to me at the time, as did other people, the reasons why the people of Sutherland opposed the Liberal and National parties' proposal for an airport in the middle of their backyard. People who saw the proposal rejected scientifically years ago, in the MANS report, are now seeing a Liberal Party that is desperate to do something after the election that they did not have the guts, the intestinal fortitude, to put to the people before the election.

        I can only say that there will be another election and those people will know the issues. We will make sure that the people know the issues.

        The Hawke&amp;hyphen;Keating government not only failed miserably in job creation but also played a considerable part in the growing fear about an underclass. When Labor came into office 694,000 people were out of work and 766,000 remained unemployed when they were booted out—not a proud legacy. Labor gave Australia the highest levels of unemployment since the Great Depression—947,000 people unemployed at the peak of the recession. The unemployment rate was stuck at 11 per cent or close, the highest unemployment rate since the great recession—and it stuck at that peak for almost a year.

         It is not surprising that this government is determined not to make the same mistakes as those made in the past. It is determined to deliver better for the Australian people; better in terms of jobs and wages, and greater hope for the future. That is why we are prepared to tackle the hard issues on public expenditure, rather than continually adopting Labor's recipe of borrowing and taxing more, notwithstanding that there have been many consecutive periods of growth. The objective is to balance the books to ensure that national savings grow and private savings grow and to take pressure off the current account and interest rates, in order that business might grow and employ more Australians, and give them hope for the future.

The answer then was no. But in the light of today's national accounts figures, which show growth at 4.8 per cent, wouldn't the rationale for your $8 billion cut be destroyed? Doesn't that growth number mean that somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion can be taken off that target, while, at the same time, still meeting your deficit outcome? Will the Treasurer now direct Treasury to revise those forecasts downwards and stop the scaremongering?

There is the issue of stocks and there is the issue of the March quarter figures being boosted by the increase in rural production.

         Let me answer the specifics of your question. The answer to your question as to whether it affects the budget bottom line for 1996-97 is no. The official forecasts for growth in the economy in 1996-97 remain at around the figure that is there—3¼ per cent. We think that is probably still in the ballpark for 1996-97. But those forecasts will be revised, as will budget estimates, in the context of the preparation of the budget. That is the normal thing that occurs.

         In relation to the point that you make about the concern for millions of Australians, the whole strategy of the coalition is to achieve that budget situation which enables long-term sustainable growth. You cannot have long-term sustainable growth when you have a black hole of $8 billion in the budget, because that means you are not getting the savings in the nation that you need for future growth, investment and job creation.

         The whole of the budget strategy is all about increasing national savings so that we can build an Australia in the medium and longer term that provides sustainable investment, sustainable consumption and increased job opportunities for all Australians. The great disaster of recent years came from the fact that the former government was not aware of those basic essentials for the building of sustainable economic growth.

         To come back to your question again: the March quarter results, which are historical, do not affect at this stage the forecast for next year.

         —Yes, it is a very important question, and it deserves a considered and responsible answer. The Treasurer announced on 2 May that this government would not be proceeding with the announcement of his Labor predecessor—that is, Mr Willis—in December 1995 to change the tax act to give tax exempt status of $7.60 a day to award transport payments for construction workers. I have to say to Senator McGauran and the Senate that that announcement by the former Treasurer, Mr Willis, was not only rash but also cowardly. It was rash because it could not be justified on the grounds of rationality or equity. It gave building workers special tax treatment not offered to any other workers who also receive award transport payments. A range of other employees receive award transport payments, including engine drivers and firemen, aircraft engineers and pilots, bank staff, insurance industry employees and

        Mr Willis's announcement, as I said, was cowardly as well. It caved in to pressure from some of his union mates. At the time of the announcement, in December last year, the unions claimed Labor's decision as a major victory. Not only was it a special deal; it was a special deal stitched up to buy votes. It was all about the forthcoming election. A report in the

        The rationale for our decision is very straightforward: under us all workers receiving award transport payments will be taxed in exactly the same way. The payments will be taxable, but workers can claim for deductible travel expenses. There will be equity; there will be no special treatment for union mates. We will stick by the law as it has always been. It says that those amounts are taxable. We are not changing the law.

The former Treasurer's, Willis's, special deal for building workers—it disadvantaged, I must point out, each and every other worker in Australia, including in particular those who received award transport payments—required a change in the law. Willis wanted to change the law. He never got around to doing it. The suggestion that we are changing the law, that we are doing something to affect the longstanding situation, is simply incorrect.

        There are a number of things I want to say to you with respect to this. You should understand, as you probably do, that it is not just the university sector that contributes to the tertiary exports of education; the TAFE sector does as well. I am sure you know that. The figure I have is that it is $1.3 billion for the universities in particular. Let's not argue about the basket. I think you and I agree that there is a very significant export industry here and it needs to be protected. I think that much at least we can agree on.

        I want to assure you that the government has absolutely no intention whatsoever of endangering that very valuable export revenue.

There is no question of education export markets being damaged by any contribution that higher education might make to fiscal policy.

        I come to the question of the strike action planned for this Thursday. You will well understand, because of your involvement with the unions, Senator, that the strike action planned for Thursday was not initiated as a response to the question of whether higher education would have to make a contribution to the savings proposal. You know that. The strike action on Thursday was initiated and planned long ago as part of a campaign vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis the higher education salaries dispute. You know that; don't shake your head!

         The higher education sector that wants to quarantine higher education completely and say, `Not us; we are not making a contribu tion,' is in fact piggybacking on the back of that strike. Nonetheless, I refer to the strike action. It is, as you know, being initiated because of the higher education salaries dispute. Why is that still going on? It is because the previous minister misled the higher education sector; went along and said, `I will do a deal. I will get it through cabinet,' and was unable to deliver. By raising expectations, he let people down and he made that dispute go even longer. Let's have no misunderstanding about what the dispute is about on Thursday.

There is a very real, in my view, and imminent threat to Australia's share of the international market for education because of this strike on Thursday and any implication by unions and other people involved that this strike will be repeated in the future. It is clearly premature. No decisions have been made. The higher education sector has been invited to make a contribution to shaping the savings proposal. All this does is reinforce stereotypes about Australia's industrial relations system. Universities and people interested in this matter must understand the higher education sector is a part of the global market and is at risk if people play with it at will

There are a number of ways in which you can address the problem. In some respects it is a health problem.

What you can say is that, to the extent there is an unnecessary climate of violence and that that is not in the community's interests, we ought to be doing something sensible about it. The committee which will report to the Prime Minister by the end of June will be looking at all those matters.

        Senator Ray, earlier this year I did attend several meetings and engagements in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. I visited Alice Springs, Hermannsburg, Tangentyere, Yuendumu, Anmatjere, Darwin, Port Keats, Daly River, Jabiru, Perth and Fremantle. And, yes, I was accompanied by a woman who might have stood beside me at doorstep interviews.

        It happens that my wife is about the same height as Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris. Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris did not attend any of those meetings. I suggest that you and your colleagues get your eyes tested. As you said yesterday—and I quote you, Senator Ray—most of you `thought' you saw her standing behind me. You should check your facts, Senator Ray, before launching into preposterous accusations that are paranoid in the extreme. It is the old Labor Party conspiracy theory—and does not apply here, I am afraid, Senator Ray. There has simply been an error on your part.

Would it not be better, Senator Ray, if you tried to get more women into parliament rather than one out.

        The economic growth rate figure released today for the March quarter of 1995&amp;hyphen;96 was 4.8 per cent. Did we hear about black holes today from Senator Short? The 4.8 per cent growth rate released today shoots one very big black hole in the black hole assertion we have heard coming from those opposite over the last three or four months. In fact, the only hole Senator Short can find now is a rabbit hole to run down to try to avoid the government's earlier comments about black holes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What does this 4.8 per cent figure mean to the budget? For every one per cent improvement in economic growth in this country, there is an improvement of about $1&amp;half; billion in the budget bottom line. What could Senator Short talk about today? As I said earlier, he did not mention a black hole at all today, not once. All he could say today was that the budget may be subject to some revision. He would not go any further and specify what the revisions would be—after the last two or three months of scaremongering about this alleged huge black hole of $8 billion based on budget projections.

        Senator Short, I suggest that, after today's figures, you go back to Treasury and ask them what their projections for the next two years are going to be; go back to Treasury and ask them what the budget bottom line is going to be over the next two financial years. If we look at the press release of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about this so-called black hole, it states:

        The current budget estimates for 1996-97 are based on Treasury economic forecasts (discussed below) and incorporate the impact in that year of spending and other decisions taken since the May 1995 budget but excluding election commitments. On a no policy change scenario, there has been a deterioration in the underlying deficit from $0.6 billion (0.1 per cent of GDP) at the time of the budget to $7.6 billion (1.5 per cent of GDP) now. The latest estimates, obviously, are based on more information than was available for the May 1995 budget. Nevertheless, the data base for 1996-97 estimates is entirely forecast and hence subject to substantial revision: that said, the figures here are the current best available estimates.

         Incidentally, the March quarter figures were 1.8 per cent of economic growth. I am not going to suggest that we multiply that by four and maintain that economic growth for the next three quarters, because that would give us 7.2 per cent. I do not believe that we will sustain 7.2 per cent over the coming financial year. But what we do have today is a substantial change, a substantial improvement, in a real figure way beyond what was expected by any, I think, economic forecasts.

R&amp;D expenditures represented 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992-93, up from one per cent of gross domestic product in the early 1980s.

         —I am pleased to contribute briefly to this debate. I do find it astonishing that Senator Sherry feigns anger here and now after questions, yet the matter was of so little consequence to the Labor Party, apparently, that he relied on Senator Kernot of the Australian Democrats to ask the question for him. I know questions get shared out at the broad caucus meetings, but I would have thought, if the Labor Party were interested in this subject, they would have at least asked their own question.

        The second point is that Senator Sherry, in fact, is demonstrating that the Australian Labor Party has learnt nothing from its economic mistakes of the past. The legacy that the Australian Labor Party has left us with is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         one of continuing budget deficits and their consequences—and that is what it seems to be advocating again. Just because we get one better figure—and we all accept that these figures jump around a bit—he wants this new government to abandon its policies of reducing public expenditure and go back to the Labor Party's recipe of hoping that it will all work out. And if it does not work out, you just borrow more. And, if that does not work out, you tax more. They are the recipes that have got this country into the awful mess that it is in.

Despite 19 successive quarters of growth, if you look at the last three years you will find total budget deficits under Labor in excess of $40 billion. So it had the opportunity for growth, and it squandered that growth.

        By way of preamble, it is worth bringing up a point that I know Senator Murphy would back me up on. I well remember the first time I came into a taking note debate. Senator Baume, who was then in the opposition, admonished government Senate backbenchers for taking up time during debates to take note of answers. He gave a great speech about how it was there for the benefit of the opposition;
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         they were the ones who had wanted it brought in and that was the purpose of it all. I draw the attention of the Senate to the minister hanging around in the taking note debate when he has had plenty of opportunity, one would hope, in questions from his own side, from the other side and from the minor parties, to answer a question. Yet he is still here to try and dig himself out of a hole in this debate.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at the sort of hole he is in. I was mystified last week when Senator Short told the Senate that `the $8 billion black hole is not a creation of the government or its imagination; it is in fact the best available forecast of the Treasury.' Why would he say that? I was puzzled, and I am sure any other economic forecaster or commentator would be puzzled by that sort of statement. Surely, at the very least, the numbers that we have had today in the national accounts would leave grave doubts as to this $8 billion number.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why would it be that he would persist? Why would there be this dogmatic insistence that this $8 billion number exists? There are two reasons for that: he does not understand the forecasting process, which is quite possible, or, which is far more serious, he is deliberately trying to mislead the Senate in terms of the fiscal position of the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at why he might not understand. Under the last government, some major reforms were brought in in terms of fiscal responsibility. When Senator Short was working in Treasury there was only one go per year at what the fiscal position was and that was in the budget—no forward estimates, no forecasting round, no midyear review, nothing. Under the previous government, the Labor government, you had the budget, the forward estimates, four rounds per year of JEFGA to estimate the fiscal position and you had a midyear review. All of those things were brought in by the Labor government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="1309" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The report that was given to the incoming government after the last election was based on the normal forecasting round and the midyear review, which the Labor government brought in and which the previous Treasurer, Ralph Willis, brought forward for the pur poses of the election campaign. They brought forward the forecasting from the normal period of January to November and December in order that the fiscal position for 1995&amp;hyphen;96 could be known. The midyear review had been completed and there would therefore be no dispute during the election campaign about the state of the budget for that year.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That approach could be contrasted with the sort of position we have now. There have been other forecasting rounds—and one wonders what they might have said—but it was never the case that anybody was going to attach any other meaning to the $8 billion number that this government received when it came in, other than that it was a projection and nothing more. Everything that has happened since then has moved against that projection being in any way reliable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Reserve Bank has said that growth is going to improve through the year, the housing cycle has bottomed, the terms of trade have started to improve and the world economy is improving, which leaves better a light for exports, so every sort of indicator for the growth in the out years is actually better. One would wonder why you would stick with a number of 3¼ per cent for the next financial year when you are coming off a base of what is now 4.8 per cent. Despite all that the Reserve Bank has said, all that other commentators have said about the fact that growth is going to be stronger, why would you still stick with a number which suggests it is actually going to fall? It is absolutely bizarre.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The real reason is this: Fightback had $10 billion in cuts over three years; now they want to have $8 billion in cuts over two years. Four billion dollars is one per cent in GDP growth. Anybody knows you need at least four per cent to do anything about employment because you have got two per cent for productivity and two per cent in natural growth in the work force. In other words, they want to take one per cent off growth, which will reduce the current figure below the level required to reduce unemployment. That is what Senator Kernot has been trying to point out. She gets nothing but abuse from the other side; nobody is prepared to listen to this. If that is not an ideological bent,

The first point that needs to be made is that these are the seasonally adjusted figures that have been put out. For some time now the Bureau of Statistics has been endeavouring to educate people to rely more on the trend figures than the seasonally adjusted figures. The trend figures for the last quarter are one per cent, as compared with the 1.8. Hence the trend figure for the year for the quarter just ended is 4.1, as opposed to 4.8. So let us not get too carried away about the 1.8 figure for one particular quarter. As Senator Short said, the government welcomes the increase economic growth.

Our budget numbers are to do with the Commonwealth government's part of that, which is about a quarter of it. What I want to point out is the absolute fiscally irresponsible way that the Keating government spent up taxpayers' money, particularly over the last four years. Let me quote the numbers. In the 1992-93 financial year the government's income from tax and charges was $95 billion. This current financial year, 1995-96, four years later, the budget estimate last May was $124.4 billion, an increase of over 30 per cent in income by the Commonwealth from all taxpayers over that four-year period.

By the time Mr Keating became Prime Minister, that figure was down to 4.7 per cent and this year it is down to minus 2.3. So not only has there been this huge increase in income, but the government went out and borrowed a huge amount, sold off the silver and stopped investing in infrastructure. The fiscal stance of the previous government was an absolute mess. No wonder we have to turn that around and live within our real income. That is where the $8 billion commitment has come from.

Is the government genuinely of the belief that there is an $8 billion deficit or is it putting that forward as an excuse for making cuts for some other purpose?

        In deciding that question—whether it is a genuine black hole or whether it is an excuse for cutting—it is fair and reasonable for the people of Australia to see how the government handles that $8 billion figure. If there are changes—and Senator Kernot has pointed this out today—in the figures that the government has to use to make a prediction upon, then the fair presumption would be that there ought to be at least some reconsideration of that $8 billion figure. But when you have changes in the predictions and the adherence by the government to the figure of $8 billion then it is reasonable for the people of Australia to say that $8 billion is an excuse for other things and is not a genuine figure put forward to justify a necessary cut in expenditure.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In other words, when the government makes absolutely no change in the approach it takes to the running of the economy, when it goes ahead with these cuts which are going to be quite severe on very many people and makes no change to the prediction it gives, it is a fair conclusion that the $8 billion is just a smokescreen and that there ought to be, in the interests of the welfare of Australians generally, a rethinking by government as to the cuts it proposes to make. It would seem, given this figure, that the extent to which the cuts were made was not justified. That is what I understood to be Senator Kernot's proposition. To date, it has not been replied to.

          We can tell from listening to speakers from the other side of the chamber that they have not learnt the lessons; they just want to run up the debt. Not one of them mentioned balancing the budget or bringing the budget into surplus.

        Even the disgraced Victorian Labor Party opposition under Mr Brumby have admitted their error and have written into their platform the need for a balanced budget. Even they have had to admit before the Victorian people—for whatever good it did them—that they need to put into their platform a balanced budget. Those on that side of the House have stuck to their old ways. They continually want to run up debt.

        The truth is that the government does have a strategy. Regardless of the hostility and obstruction of those on the other side of the Senate, we are going to stick to that. Whatever can be gleaned from today's national account figures—as my colleague Senator Gibson said, there really is only one quarter to be focused on and encouraged by—has to be built on and secured by this government. The strategy is for disciplined government expenditure and fiscal responsibility.

         —What will follow from that, Senator Sherry, is what your government was never able to achieve on the boom and bust roller&amp;hyphen;coaster you put the Australian people on. What will follow is downward pressure on interest rates. To this day, the Australian economy is facing the second highest real prime interest rates in the world—second highest to Italy, and that is nothing to be proud of. Australia's real prime interest rates are 6.8 per cent, compared with other OECD countries such as Britain with 4.6 per cent and the US with 5.35 per cent.

        So our strategy is to bring the budget into surplus so as to put downward pressure on interest rates.

It is worth noting that this government by good administration has already tightened its belt in many different areas, even before we get to the hard cuts—and there will be hard cuts.

        This bill authorises the commonwealth to formulate and enter into a new Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA) with the states and the territories, for the purpose of providing housing assistance so that people may achieve housing that is affordable, secure and appropriate to their needs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Through this bill, the government is demonstrating its stated commitment to the CSHA as an important instrument in guiding national housing policy. We also wish to signal clearly our commitment to a process for further reform of the commonwealth and state roles and responsibilities in the housing area. The government is keen to implement longer term reforms as soon as possible to build on improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance commenced in the new CSHA.

        The government believes that housing is not simply about bricks and mortar. As a policy goal, we are interested in providing people with greater choice in housing which is appropriate to their needs. We will be seeking to offer low income Australians a real choice between different forms of assistance and different providers of assistance. In achieving our aims, we will encourage private sector involvement in the supply of affordable rental housing for people on low incomes.

        Continuing changes in lifestyle, household and family structures and demographic shifts in Australia call for innovative housing responses. Such changes set a challenging agenda for housing reform.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In tackling the agenda for housing reform, it is necessary to take a national, strategic approach to meeting the future housing needs of Australians in partnership with state, territory and local governments and the private sector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The intention of the new CSHA is to enable the states and territories to get on with the job of delivering quality housing programs and enable the commonwealth to clearly monitor performance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is a direction which is strongly supported by the Council of Australian Governments' (COAG) micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform agenda. COAG has agreed that the "overriding objective" of the reform of commonwealth and state roles and responsibilities should be to "improve outcomes for clients and value for money to taxpayers". To this end, COAG has endorsed the need for clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities for housing provision and has noted that significant progress has been made with respect to these reforms in the housing area.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Indeed, the agreement enabled by this legislation will lead the way in measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs by rigorously measuring program outcomes.

        Let me now turn to some of the key features of the new agreement being negotiated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is intended that the next Commonwealth State Housing Agreement will operate from 1 July 1996 and will continue to be targeted to meet the needs of people who are most at risk of housing related poverty. It will be an interim agreement for up to 3 years aimed at achieving a number of fundamental reforms. As such, it will provide a basis for further significant longer term reform to achieve even greater improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The agreement will be funded by a special appropriation in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 of approximately $1,068 million. Funding for subsequent years will be determined as part of the commonwealth budgetary process and in light of progress in implementing longer term reforms and the report of the National Commission of Audit.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new CSHA will acknowledge that the states and territories will be responsible for managing both the delivery of services and the assets and resources associated with service delivery. It will also offer states and territories greater flexibility in the provision of housing assistance and make them better able to exercise a broader range of options in ensuring a target level of housing stock. Ultimately, this will provide for greater housing choice, better&amp;hyphen;performing housing assistance programs and a greater focus on the quality of the housing assistance products provided to the consumer.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is intended that the new CSHA will set out a number of broad principles in relation to the rights and responsibilities of consumers, and will address consumer expectations about consultation in relation to planning and service delivery. It is the government's intention to encourage the development by states and territories of Codes of Practice, in line with agreed national Guidelines, which will set out in a clear and consistent manner the respective rights and responsibilities of service providers and consumers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While conferring increased flexibility on the states, the new agreement will also acknowledge that the commonwealth has strategic national policy interests in relation to housing assistance. It will be the commonwealth's responsibility to ensure that the agreement is part of a coherent housing policy which is supported by, and responsive to, the commonwealth government's overall policies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The commonwealth's primary roles will be to specify the national housing objectives of the commonwealth government and to evaluate the performance and outcomes achieved by states and territories which are to be funded under the new CSHA.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is intended that the new CSHA will introduce nationally agreed measures of performance in relation to the achievement of consumer outcomes and administrative efficiency outcomes. states will be required under the agreement to report annually on their performance against key performance measures, thus providing an unprecedented level of accountability and transparency in housing operations.

        This bill is based on the principle that all Australians, regardless of their economic or social status have the right to affordable, secure and appropriate housing. This government is concerned with building an Australia that is fair, that offers all its citizens opportunities to prosper, to enjoy fulfilling lives, to participate in their communities—in short, to exercise the rights of citizens and to fulfil the responsibilities which go with those rights.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, it must also be borne in mind that a significant number of Australians do not have the means to secure adequate housing or to exercise a choice in their accommodation. Nor is affordability the only barrier to achieving an appropriate standard of secure and affordable housing.

        People who experience, or who are at risk of, housing related poverty are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage. They are also more likely to experience discrimination in their efforts to obtain housing and to experience adverse effects of inadequate or inappropriate housing. These include adverse effects on health, employment prospects, quality of life and life opportunities. Discrimination in housing markets affects many in the Australian community, in particular, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, women, single parents and their children, young people, people with a disability, people with a mental illness, people from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and people who are homeless.

        In giving effect to these intentions, housing assistance funded under this legislation should be planned and delivered so as to take full account of the range of factors which contribute to the quality of life of the people receiving assistance, including the liveability of communities, the promotion of opportunity and choice, and respect for the dignity and self&amp;hyphen;esteem of people receiving assistance.

        Vigilance against police corruption is an ongoing issue for Australian governments and the public at large. The more important provisions of this bill are focused on ensuring that the Australian Federal Police remains corruption free. A similar bill lapsed earlier this year due to the federal election. The government has decided to introduce a bill in a similar form to provide the necessary armoury to combat corruption within the Australian Federal Police.

        Senators will be aware that the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service has uncovered distressing instances of corruption and other serious misconduct. Such abuse of power and of the community's trust can never be tolerated in any police service. I know all senators were distressed to hear that serving and former members of the Australian Federal Police have been implicated in corruption and other reprehensible behaviour.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government and the administration of the Australian Federal Police are strongly committed to ensuring that it is never debilitated by a culture of corruption and misconduct. The institutional culture of a police force is of vital importance to a community. A police force stands at the threshold of the criminal justice system and is in effective control of the enforcement of the criminal law. Each police officer has an extensive authority over all other citizens, coupled with a wide discretion over its exercise. Subsequent stages in the criminal justice process, including courts and prisons, are largely dependent on the activities of police services, and will inevitably be affected by their deficiencies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth is, of course, particularly dependent on the integrity and efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. First, it is the principal agency for the general enforcement of the Commonwealth's criminal laws. It provides a vital link in effective cooperation with international law enforcement bodies. It is essential that the Australian Federal Police maintain the confidence of these bodies as well as the public's confidence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1989 the parliament, with the support of all parties, substantially amended the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. The reforms were designed, in part, to introduce a new and unique employment scheme which would inhibit the occurrence of patterns of corruption uncovered in other police services. One aspect of these reforms was the replacement of tenure with a system of fixed term appointments. Another aspect was providing the Commissioner with chief executive powers in relation to appointments within the Australian Federal Police, including the power to end the appointment of any police member or civilian staff member. One of the principles underlying this employment scheme is that the Commissioner should have a clear and specific responsibility for the integrity and operational efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. Naturally, the scheme also envisaged that the Commissioner should have the powers and authority necessary to fulfil these responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At present the Commissioner's power to terminate the appointment of members or staff members of the Australian Federal Police is subject only to two exceptions. The current legislation states that the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Commissioner must not make use of this power merely because a disciplinary charge has been or could be laid or a court has convicted, or found the person guilty, of a criminal offence. These exceptions were provided in order to separate the Australian Federal Police's disciplinary processes which can result in dismissal as a penalty for a disciplinary offence from the Commissioner's general power to end a person's appointment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In practice, the limitations on the Commissioner's power of dismissal can lead to situations which are clearly inconsistent with the policy aims of the AFP employment scheme. For example, it is not clear that the Commissioner can terminate the appointment of a member of the Australian Federal Police even if the member admits publicly that he or she is guilty of corruption or other serious reprehensible behaviour. To dismiss that person from the Australian Federal Police, it might be necessary for the Commissioner either to invite the member to resign voluntarily or to initiate disciplinary proceedings. The Commissioner's hands could be equally tied if the person were to be convicted of serious criminal offences by a court.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government believes this situation to be unsatisfactory. Corruption in a police service can seriously undermine the professional self respect and morale of the decent and honest police who comprise the majority of members. It can also seriously diminish public confidence in the affected police service, something that may now be apparent in respect of the New South Wales Police Service. Immediate and effective action may be the only way to minimise the harm. On occasions it will not be desirable to wait for lengthy disciplinary or court proceedings to be finally resolved before taking action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments will remove the limitations on the Commissioner's powers of dismissal which relate to disciplinary offences and criminal convictions. The intention is to give the Commissioner a broader and more effective power to end an appointment where the Commissioner has lost confidence in a person's suitability for continued employment in the Australian Federal Police. The amendment will, in particular, permit the Commissioner to act quickly and decisively to end the appointment of a person where the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that there has been corruption, serious abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the government believes it is necessary in the public interest for the Commissioner to have a wide discretion to end appointments, it also recognises that the employment rights of individual members and staff members within the Australian Federal Police should also be protected. Currently members and staff members are protected in two ways in the event that they are retired by the
        <break page="1317" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Commissioner before the end of their term of appointment. First, the person who is retired may seek judicial review by the Federal Court of the Commissioner's decision to end their appointment. Second, the retired person is entitled to compensation for the lost part of their appointment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As this bill will widen the scope of the Commissioner's powers to end appointments, the government believes it is also reasonable to extend to members and staff members additional remedies against the possibility that the Commissioner's power might be exercised unfairly or unreasonably. The government has been at pains to find an appropriate balance between the public interest in maintaining a corruption free Australian Federal Police and the rights of the individual member of staff member who may be retired early either because of allegations of corruption or for other reasons such as inefficiency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In particular, in reconsidering this bill the Attorney-General has focused on the need for appropriate safeguards to protect innocent members and staff members. The government has decided that, in addition to the existing protective measures I have outlined, individual members and staff members who have their appointments terminated early will also have access to merits review before the Industrial Relations Commission and the Industrial Relations Court. At present the Australian Federal Police is excluded from those unlawful termination provisions by the Industrial Relations Regulations. The relevant regulations will be repealed once these amendments come into force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill makes one exception to the opening of the unfair dismissal remedies to the Australian Federal Police. This is where serious misconduct is involved. The bill provides that where a person's appointment has been ended because of their conduct or behaviour, the Commissioner may make a declaration that the conduct or behaviour amounts to serious misconduct and that the serious misconduct is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on professional self-respect or morale within the Australian Federal Police or on its reputation with the public or with an Australian or overseas government or law enforcement agency. Serious misconduct is defined in the bill to mean corruption, serious abuse of power, serious dereliction of duty or any other serious reprehensible behaviour. Where a declaration of this kind is made, the person who has been retired will be excluded from the operation of the Industrial Relations Act provisions concerning unlawful dismissal and will not be able to obtain merits review. Such persons, however, will retain the present rights to compensation for their early retirement and to seek judicial review of the Commissioner's declaration, as well as the decision to end their appointment. Also a person subject to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         a declaration of serious misconduct will be able to seek a statement of reasons in relation to the Commissioner's decision to make the declaration. However, where the reasons would disclose information that it would not be in the public interest to disclose (eg operationally sensitive information such as the identity of informants or current investigations) the Attorney-General may, in the public interest, issue a certificate under subsection 14(1) of the Administrative Decision (Judicial Review) Act 1977 preventing disclosure of that  information. This solution reaches an appropriate balance between the public interest in maintaining a corruption free Australian Federal Police and the rights of the individual.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I have indicated, the Commissioner will be able to make a declaration only where the Commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, that there has been serious misconduct by the person who is retired. It is also necessary that the Commissioner believe that the serious misconduct is actually damaging, or is likely to damage, the Australian Federal Police in one of the ways I have described.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clearly these are special circumstances. They are circumstances in which immediate action by the Commissioner is needed to maintain the internal integrity or the public reputation of the Australian Federal Police and where it is not appropriate that an outside tribunal should be able to remake the Commissioner's decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment will permit the Commissioner to make a declaration either before or after the behaviour or conduct in question becomes widely known. This is to allow the Commissioner to act to pre-empt the threatened damage to the morale or reputation of the Australian Federal Police.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also contains several minor amendments concerning two separate matters. One group of amendments is intended to give the Governor-General the power to authorise the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioners to appoint or promote persons as commissioned officers with the Australian Federal Police. At present the legislation permits the Governor-General to give this authority only to the Commissioner. The new arrangements are administratively more convenient. The amendments allows for appropriate safeguards.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second group of amendments deals with the disciplinary obligations of staff members when granted special leave of absence for service with an industrial association. The effect is to extend the existing provisions which deal with members to staff members as well.

         There has been a period of extensive consultation on this motion with the opposition and the other parties in this chamber. On many areas we have reached agreement, but we have not reached agreement on all areas. However, a process was carried through so that, when this motion came to the floor of this chamber, we could maximise the areas of agreement and, in that way, cut down on the debate and proceed with other government business and legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments that we have moved are twofold. The first relates to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. The view expressed to us by the non-government parties in this Senate was that they were more comfortable with the previous arrangement which existed. Our initial proposal was to reduce membership numbers from 12 to 10 in order to look at providing some uniformity of membership numbers between the joint standing committees. But a different view was expressed to us, and we have responded to it. People prefer the larger size committees, and this amendment restores the committee's numbers to those which operated under the last parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second amendment relates to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is a very popular committee and which quite a few senators wish to join. This was an area which I had a particular interest in, as did
         <break page="1326" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Senator Bourne. Senator Brian Harradine also had an interest in it many years ago. The debate on treaties which has taken place over quite some time has reached its fulfilment in this committee. Our amendment would have the initial number of committee members increased by three to 16, with one position to be filled by a government member in the House of Representatives, one to be filled by a government senator and one to be filled by an opposition senator.

         The coalition government regards Australia's signing of international treaties as very important and we must ensure that the treaties serve Australia's interests. The establishment of the joint treaties committee will provide an opportunity for MPs to be fully involved in considering the implications of signing international treaties that Australia will enter into. The amendment will allow the treaties committee to enhance the effectiveness of its work by ensuring that there are enough members to effectively operate what will probably turn out to be an effective subcommittee system.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand that the Democrats will also be moving an amendment to the messages and to my motion. Those amendments will require that a member of the opposition and a member of the coalition be present at deliberative committee and subcommittee meetings to constitute a quorum. I would have to say that, while we understand some of the concerns which have been raised, we are still not convinced of the arguments that have been put forward. On the one hand, there is the fear that committee meetings could be set in a way which did not suit non-government members. On the other hand, there is the dilemma that properly established committee meetings could be sabotaged by non-government members not appearing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a very real dilemma. I have to say that if it reaches that stage you would really wonder whether our committee system will operate anyway. There may be some favourite stories that a few senators may have on this issue, but in my six years it is an issue which has very rarely emerged—you could count on a couple of fingers the number of times it did emerge. The reality is that if the committee system reached this stage—where one side
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          was attempting to gazump another side—both chambers would take action to resolve that difficulty. These committees do work, one would hope, out of a modicum of goodwill, and often a lot of goodwill. It is our hope that this amendment, on reflection, will not be supported.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I note that Senator Bourne has moved to indicate that the proposed amendment would apply to deliberative decisions of committees. That is certainly an improvement on the original motion. As I said, the government is not disposed to support it. We recognise there is this dilemma. It relates to whether, on the one hand, a meeting can be set without the involvement of opposition members, or can be set in a way which would prevent the involvement of opposition members. On the other hand, opposition members may very well, for strategic reasons, decide to prevent a committee meeting taking place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This motion does not resolve that dilemma. It tackles what is perceived to be one side of that dilemma. It is something we may turn our minds to in the future, but we do not feel that this motion, itself, deals with that dilemma in a sufficiently effective manner. I point out that there have been extensive consultations in this area. I hope that we have reached a reasonable degree of agreement. I look forward to hearing contributions from other senators.

         The matter of the joint house committees is a particularly important issue for this parliament to consider. I know that in some people's minds it is a matter that can be dismissed easily and lightly because it is just something that goes to the routine of business and we should somehow or other, in a casual way, say, `Look, a message has been sent over from the House of Representatives. There's been a change of government. We automatically should fall out with that and just accept that without further demure.' That is not a view that I take. In fact, it is a view that I strongly oppose, particularly given the

         I turn to the question of quorums for subcommittees of joint house committees. Under these proposals, it was proposed in a number of committees that the subcommittee be reduced to two, theoretically made up of members of the same party. That could mean that you have a subcommittee made up of two members of the Liberal Party. That, in my mind, is not an appropriate course of action to follow.

Would an attempt be made to reduce the role of the opposition on these committees, as we have seen in the original proposal put forward from the National Capital and External Territories Committee?

Day in and day out he came in here and explained to us how wrong it was that this parliament did not adequately consider treaties. But then what happened? When the government is sworn in they roll over yet again and suddenly there is a change in position. Suddenly they do not really want to have proper consideration of treaties, because that is the sort of thing they only talk about when in opposition.

         Most of the joint committees are mainly concerned with external matters, particularly the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It is said that that committee is different from other committees and it should not be treated on the same basis. It is said that the issue of parity—that is, the relationship between the House of Representatives and the Senate—should be put to one side because that committee is involved in a lot of overseas trips and delegations and very unseemly matters like that. Great attention is paid to participation on that committee and I can understand that such issues are involved.

        <para first-indent="16">
         However, on a more substantive level there are concerns that that committee is involved with the geopolitical forces at work within our society and our relations with the rest of the world. However, that is not the same argument I would put concerning the question of the treaties committee. Substantially it goes to the issue of the powers of this parliament, particularly those relating to the foreign affairs power in section 51(xxix) of the constitution. That section concerns the legislative power of this parliament and the capacity of this parliament to make laws based upon foreign treaties which have an impact on our society at large, and in particular it goes to the scope of the legislative authority of this parliament to make such laws.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why is that important? Senator Kemp has drawn the concerns that he has with these issues to our attention on a daily basis. I also draw to his attention the importance that it has for many members of our society particularly concerning issues involving the International Labour Organisation. These are very fundamental rights; the right to work, the right to organise and the right to defend one's living conditions. These are fundamental industrial concerns which go to the very heart of our obligations under those conventions. It also concerns the rights of unions to operate, unfair dismissal, freedom from exploitation, freedom from discrimination, the right to equal pay and the right to family leave and other great family values which I know this government is so concerned about. That is

         It may be the case that we might have to look at our international treaty obligations very carefully. When we look at these issues we cannot simply and idly say that it does not really matter whether or not there are X number of senators or Y number of members of the House of Representatives. There are fundamental issues at stake here. The question of parity and the relationship between the houses of parliament is of fundamental importance. To say otherwise is to suggest that amendments could be moved on various other pieces of legislation on the basis of whether or not you have the numbers in one place or the other, and that the Senate should in some way be limited to the number of amendments it could move on any piece of legislation. Quite clearly that would be a ridiculous proposition.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In essence what the government is saying is that there should be more members of the House of Representatives on this important committee which goes to the legislative power of this parliament, and that somehow or other the role of the Senate should be reduced because there are not as many senators as there are members of the House of Representatives. That is clearly not an argument that I accept.

To argue any other proposition would be silly. It is not a proposition in terms of the brake on parity that is put forward on a whole range of other committees in this package of messages from the House of Representatives. It is not the position with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories even under your new proposal. Therefore, it seems to me to be quite an extraordinary thing that you would

I cannot accept, given the amount of trouble and energy you have put into this discussion in recent times—I might be flattered by the energy you have placed on these issues—that you do not have something in mind when you come forward with such a proposition.

These are fundamental constitutional issues and cannot be simply dismissed in the way these messages would suggest, in the way these messages were considered in the House of Representatives and in the ruthless way numbers were used in such a cavalier way to enforce the government's position on very basic constitutional considerations.

In regard to the other two committees where there is some confusion, I see the point that Senator Carr has made about the treaties committee and we should all keep that point in mind. However, I also see Senator Kemp's point and how he has come to those figures—a committee of 16 members: six from the government side of the House of Representatives and three from the opposition side of the House of Representatives. What the House of Representatives does is up to it.

We can see that, on the basis of tradition, for it to be exactly half is a reasonable way to do it. That has been accepted as a reasonable way of doing it in this place for many years now.

          —True. Yes, it can hear evidence. I see what you mean. If those two people are there, they can take and listen to evidence. That might be a position that can be accommodated. The only problem we then might face is that the sorts of questions that are asked of witnesses could tend to be confined to one side. What concerns me about that proposition is that, if the witnesses are left to be examined by two people from the same party, we will then not get the sort of examination we might have got had two people from a range of parties—or, as in this case, two separate parties—been present.

         Upon reflection, the point she raises ought to be taken into consideration. In the event that only two are required to be there when examining witnesses, I think it would be proper for at least a member from separate parties to be present. Having heard the debate, probably Senator Carr's position on the quorum is the correct one.

         I want to associate myself with all of those very kind remarks that Senator Carr made about Senator Kemp's remarks on treaties. His name was almost changed for a time to Senator `Treaties' Kemp because of his continual raising of the matter of treaties in this place. Not only did he do so practically every day, but on some occasions he did it twice and three times on the same day. The culmination of his work was the reference to what was then Senator Cooney's committee—the Legal and Constitutional References Committee—which later became Senator Ellison's committee and which produced this magnificent report which has had such an impact—

The newly established government, which is only now getting around to establishing the joint parliamentary committees, has already responded to this report. We have already congratulated them on the speed of their response to the report. Let us hope this type of response will be continued and that the very sensible amendments moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition, together with the amendments moved by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Democrats, will be taken into consideration and the standing orders associated with the committees will be implemented properly.

          One other matter that I want to refer to in all seriousness is to pick up the remarks by Senator Cooney and the interchange between him and Senator Margetts. In my time in this place I have participated in the work of a large number of committees—far more than I care to remember. On all the committees—and I say this without exception—there has been on the part of all members of the committee a will to address the matters that the parliament has asked it to address. I believe that on all occasions great efforts were made to ensure that the views of all political parties, where they were properly represented on the committee, were taken into consideration. There was a willingness to ensure that their views could be heard and could be taken into consideration as the respective committees progressed about their work.

          I am aware of only one occasion on which the quorum rule, as it stood, was used or, dare I say it, abused. That occurred in November last year, to my recollection—I have not searched the records—during a Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee hearing which was scrutinising the estimates of a particular government department.

          One former opposition senator got somewhat upset about the line of questioning or, more properly, it might have been the line of response from the minister at the table, and spat the dummy. She absented herself from the hearing and informed the committee there was no quorum because the opposition was not represented. Of course, the committee had to adjourn. It was quite an extraordinary performance because the estimates hearing had to be adjourned until a then opposition senator and member of the committee could be found to sit at the table and get the hearing back under way, so that the opposition could continue their series of questions to the minister at the table and the whole scrutiny process could continue.

          I assure Senator Kemp that performances like that will not happen from this opposition.

It is not for us to say how those on the other side should operate their business. That is one of the things I place on the record as having happened. It was an extraordinary occurrence. It will not happen from opposition senators as we go into the estimates scrutiny process.

          —This is an interesting and complex issue to which everybody brings their own particular experiences. Senator Cooney said he could cite no instances where a committee would meet when no decision was to be made. I interjected to give examples of occasions when I have been in a place where the last plane has left at a certain time, one or two people were left, somebody has travelled a long way to give evidence and a decision has been made on whether or not the two people who are left constitute a quorum. On such an occasion it could be considered reasonable to hear the evidence of a person who has travelled a long way. Such an example gives weight to leaving the word `deliberative' in describing the actions of a subcommittee, because the quorum of a full committee can decide that a subcommittee can act in such a way.

         Let me tackle a couple of the remarks made. Firstly, in relation to Senator Carr: in reality, Senator, you have not tackled the fundamental dilemma we have with this quorum. Whereas you are worried—I think unduly—that the government may seek to gazump an opposition, you have not actually dealt with the problem where an opposition refuses to attend a meeting in order to prevent a meeting which may be properly constituted occurring. It is a real problem.

         We can all go round day after day saying, `Hey, you've all changed your position.' The rules which you were content to operate under, and which I think generally worked pretty well—I do not think too many arguments have been adduced in this debate that those rules have not worked well—show that you are indeed seeking to impose a position on the government which you yourself are unwilling to accept in opposition. So that is the first dilemma.

          I listened very carefully to your arguments on the size of the treaties committee. I was not convinced on that. The reality is that this is a larger committee. You sought a larger committee and it is not unreasonable that a larger committee, in the first instance, more accurately reflects numbers in the chambers. Secondly, as Senator Bourne so accurately put it, it is directly and intimately linked with the nature of our foreign affairs arrangements.

          Senator Carr, at no stage did any member of your party complain that the ratio on the foreign affairs committee was 20 government and 12 non&amp;hyphen;government. It is all very well to seek to distinguish that from this particular committee. I think that distinction failed. Like the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, this committee is also intimately linked with Australia's foreign relations. Those rules were perfectly acceptable to you. I will have to check the history book, but no&amp;hyphen;one has recalled in this chamber that we ever complained about the ratio on that committee and sought to campaign against it.

          Again, by analogy, you are attempting to produce arguments in opposition which you certainly were not prepared to accept in government. Fair enough.

That is all I am saying. That is the logical fallacy there.

I note that there seems to be some divergence of opinion in relation to the treaties committee. But we welcome the support we have received from the Democrats on this issue, and we hope that this is but the first of many occasions where the Democrats will be prepared to offer support for important principles and well argued arguments which have been put forward.

        I understand from the debate a few days ago that opposition members were raising the issue that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Mr Williams, had in a previous debate suggested that a judicial officer should take on this role. Apparently they have taken some comfort from that with respect to the amendments they now want to move. In other words, they are saying, `The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, in a previous incarnation, indicated this was not a problem. We think there is some political opportunism in this change of heart and we do not see any risk in proceeding down this path.' I think that is not an unfair summary of the view that you can have confidence in Mr Williams's view and, therefore, you can with confidence move these amendments.

         not a change of view on the facts that existed at the time. It is a change of view by Mr Williams because of the very significant case expressing concern about these matters. Mr Williams, being the very eminent lawyer that he is, has modified his view to take into account the Grollo case.

They certainly made those arguments at the time and those arguments still stand. They are not changed by anything.

        In terms of whether the judges are prepared or not, it was not me who raised concern. I raised it in the debate because the comment had been made to us by the government that there could be concern. I would answer Senator Vanstone's question with a question: who are the judges who refuse to act in this capacity? Who are the judges who have indicated that they might refuse to act in this capacity? It seems to me that it is up to the government which has raised that concern to identify the judges that are not prepared to act in this way. Even if one or two judges are in this category, is the government prepared to say that no judge is prepared to act in this situation? It seems to me that it is for the government to bring forth evidence that this is so.

Before the election, shadow Attorney-General Williams advocated the course of action that Senator Spindler is now advocating. We opposed it. After the election we have taken a closer look at that and, given the final product before us today, we feel that we can support Senator Spindler's motion.

As I said at the start of my contribution, the principle, the objectives and much of the structure of this bill we want to see in place.

         There has been a lot of concern in the community about the extra power given in these circumstances and how that power as it has been claimed can be abused by enforcement officers. There is always a chance of that. We have to rely on the basis that police do an honest job. We also work with the knowledge that, for instance, in the Woods royal commission there have been quite a number of incidences of behaviour which is not in conformity with that description of an honest job. A continual balance has to be struck in these matters.

We are keen to ensure that it is not a burdensome one. Senator Spindler's approach of invoking the mechanism of the interception act is one we are attracted to. Senator Vanstone says it is constitutionally unsound—and I will go to that argument in a few moments.

We are concerned to put in place mechanisms that are sustainable. That is a concern of ours, Senator Vanstone.

        Granting police the power to engage in illegal activities even under specific conditions is an extremely undesirable step. These amendments, as I understand it, are a way of at least providing some kind of ameliorating or accountability mechanism for that and ensuring that police are not conferring those extraordinary powers on each other but are incorporating at least some other authority. But that, specifically, is not what we are perturbed about; we are perturbed about this bill being yet another example of the battle between the judiciary and the executive—regrettably, in this case the executive supported by the parliament, as it seems that the Greens are the only ones opposing the bill.

It is an attempt to enable the police and investigating authorities to carry out operations that do not do violence to the rule of law but enable the investigating body—the Federal Police or the National Crime Authority—to obtain evidence that can be put before a court and which may be accepted by that court.

As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, it is proper to point out that the Federal Police and the NCA have a very high reputation. Those at the head of the Federal Police—the commissioner, the assistant commissioners and the deputy commissioners—all have high reputations, as do members of the NCA.

         The similarity is that you are asking a judicial officer to approve something. I can agree in that sense. But what you are asking them to approve involves qualitatively different things. In one case—the telecommunications interception—what you are asking a judicial officer to do is to weigh up a balance between the invasion of someone's liberty and the good that is done. In this case, if Senator Spindler's amendment is successful, you are asking a judge to make an operational decision—not weighing up the good or bad.

         There is a similarity of judicial officers involved and they need to give a tick, but that is about as close as it gets.

Section 45 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act states:

It seems to me that although the words are different—and I would appreciate Senator Cooney's opinion on that—in substance, there is very little difference.

        The other point to be made about that is: would we be agreeable to the proposition that a police officer should be allowed to engage in unlawful conduct unless there was some impartial judgment made on whether or not the targeted person is likely to commit an offence? If that is not a prospect, and if it is not done on objective grounds, why should we allow the police to engage in unlawful conduct?

        The problem that I had with these provisions was that we were asking law enforcement officers to make that judgment, to arrive at that conclusion.

The certificate issued by the judge is then required to be tendered in evidence in resulting proceedings.

If that does not in some way contribute to a view that the person has committed an offence, I do not know what higher level you need. A committal proceeding is started before a magistrate and what do we give?

But Mr Kerr did understand this. He said that in his view it was appropriately balanced broad questions about law enforcement, accountability, preventing abuse of powers by police and maintaining the rule of law. He went on to point out that there was a difference between police authorising telecommunications intercepts, that is, a balancing of rights and responsibilities—judiciary doing that—and, on the other hand, being satisfied that someone was likely to commit an offence.

        With respect to this argument, I might touch on another couple of points. A non&amp;hyphen;judicial power conferred on judges can only be exercised by consent. It is not and cannot be mandatory. In that respect, it may be important for people to know two things: there are at the moment a significant number of Federal Court judges who are currently respondents in proceedings in their own court for judicial review for warrants issued under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. There is a significant number. So you have got judges appearing in their own court with respect to those matters. So let us not pretend that this is one or two judges and it is not going to happen. The advisers advise me that the
        <break page="1343" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Attorney advises them that there are a significant number in this matter.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Further, if you are not satisfied, Senator Spindler, that there is any reluctance in this respect, you should know that so many Federal Court judges have declined to issue telecommunications interceptions warrants that applicants have had to turn to Family Court judges for the warrants. So there is a reluctance. This is not a mandatory conferring of a task; it is to be done by consent. With respect to the telecommunications intercepts, which I have indicated the government believes are a qualitatively different matter in any event, they are reluctant to the extent that people are turning to the Family Court. This is a higher task you are asking—of involvement in an operation and a conclusion to be satisfied that someone is likely to commit an offence. On that basis, I think it is very reasonable to conclude that an even more significant number will decline. So you will have these things being done by Family Court judges. I mean no disrespect to Family Court judges, but it is not your intention, Senator Spindler, that this be a Family Court matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not up to me to read the minds of Family Court judges. But, if it continues that Federal Court judges decline to exercise this, it will not be long before Family Court judges are in the same position. So I come back to the point that, if you think there are judges happy to do this and who welcome not so much an extension of what is being asked of them in telecommunication intercepts—because we know a significant number are not happy—but taking an even more serious decision, then you should let us know. You might not want to name them publicly; come and tell us privately. But we do not believe that that is the case. We believe this is a very significantly different matter from the telecommunications intercept things.

If more people go free because the bill is passed in the form that you want, and it is then discarded as unconstitutional, then it will be on your shoulders and not on ours. I think that goes to the very guts of what this is about.

I wonder whether she can refer me to any cases or any claims made in cases in any of the bills that have similar provisions—and I named about half a dozen of them, apart from the intercept act—where it was suggested that a judge's involvement had in any way affected the final judgment of whether a person was guilty or not guilty.

        Another matter is the availability of judges. I do not know how many intercept cases are dealt with per year. I venture to say that there are at least several hundred, possibly thousands; whereas here we are dealing with about 12 cases. So I think the order of magnitude is considerably different. If the minister can provide some information on that, that would be enlightening.

Because we are not doubling the task, if you like, but simply adding to it, it does not take away from the point that we can see, from the involvement of the telecommunications intercept cases, which are going to be significantly higher than these, that there is a follow-on workload.

        It is not just finding a judge who is prepared to exercise this power by consent. That is not the end of it. We know that, even with the intercept approvals, there are a significant number of judges who are required to be respondents in proceedings in their own courts with respect to telecommunications intercept matters. We add to that the argument that they are qualitatively different. That is a balance of judgment about interference in your rights to privacy and the public good. In this case, what you are asking a judge to do is not to balance that judgment but to draw a conclusion that he or she is satisfied that someone is likely to commit an offence. So they are qualitatively different things.

        You could therefore expect, because what you are asking in this respect is a much more serious judgment to be taken by the judicial officer, that they are going to be contested perhaps to a greater proportion than the others. So, yes, there are fewer numbers. But, because you are asking for a much more serious task, you could expect every one of them to be much more seriously contested than, say, the telecommunications intercept ones.

As I understand it, there is no provision in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act or indeed in any act where a judge, to issue a certificate, has to be satisfied that a person is likely to commit an offence. As I understand it, in the intercept act the model for this provision is one which requires a judge to be satisfied that a person might use particular equipment.

In other words, what the amendment would do is not ask a judge to be satisfied that an offence was to be committed but ask a judge to be satisfied that the person applying for the certificate was satisfied that an offence was to be committed.

         —While the officers are considering the remarks made by Senator Bolkus, let me respond to what Senator Cooney suggested. I was working on what he suggested, and this may well be the same point. It seems to me that, in not allowing a certificate to be presented that says to a magistrate a judge has satisfied himself that a person was to commit an offence, you are suggesting the certificate should say that a judge was satisfied that the policeman was satisfied, which does not seem to me to be a very substantial improvement at all.

        In fact, if you want to put it in the words of someone who might be wanting to point the bone and accuse—bearing in mind you are now thinking of this from the position of an innocent person—they might say to a jury, `Look. You've heard what the police have told you. They were involved in this controlled operation. You've heard that this was all about being satisfied that someone had committed an offence. The police went along and this judge, a judicial officer, was satisfied that they were telling the truth.' That is incontestable. The judge could not satisfy himself that the police were satisfied if he thought they were lying. That is what I would say. I would be on my feet quick as a whip and saying, `This is what the situation is: a judicial officer has listened to the police and is satisfied that the police were telling the truth—this person was likely to commit an offence.' Too right I would be.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So I do not think you help yourselves with that proposition. I understand what you are looking for. I just do not think you can find a mechanism which will both be constitutionally sound and protect parties who may be innocent. I could turn around the Wood royal commission evidence and ask whether you in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         your heart of hearts believe that every person charged with an offence is guilty. If you do believe that, you could scrap the criminal law. You would not need the defence of the innocent. But, presumably, you do not believe that.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sadly, there are cases where—I am not sure that they have been reported in the Wood royal commission but we have all had anecdotal evidence about this and have read about it in the papers—people have been set up by the police. So we do need to have adequate protections for the innocent as well—and that was the balance that former minister Kerr was talking about. We have people peddling these drugs around out there and we want to get at them. We want to make sure they are locked away. But, in the rush to do that, do not forget people are innocent until proven guilty; do not forget that sometimes people are set up; and do not forget that sometimes things are not as they seem and that the wrong person can be charged. There are two things to balance in this respect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also make this point: the dual approval process that you are seeking will ensure that urgent certificates—these crooks do not ring up and say, `Listen, it's happening next week; you've got seven days to organise yourselves,'—will rarely be available. It is apparently a frequent occurrence that the customs service or the AFP will detect at the barrier a person carrying narcotics who will advise—often enough, I suppose—that he or she is to deliver the drugs to a person at a particular place. That is when we might want to move into a controlled operation. The window of opportunity for conducting such a controlled operation in these circumstances is not likely to be large. They are not going to detect someone at an airport with a bucket load of drugs who says, `By the way, I'm delivering these in a fortnight's time. Take all the time you want to find someone suitable to approve this.' It is not going to happen like that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It may well be the case that someone is coming in with a significant quantity of drugs and going out the next day or that afternoon. There is not a lot of time here, and the need to involve both a senior official and a judge
        <break page="1346" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         will probably ensure that in these instances a controlled operation is unlikely to be possible.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What will be the consequences of that? And we add on the burden that you are taking upon yourselves. I have already indicated the burden about an innocent person being affected by the process that you want and perhaps improperly convicted, and that is by having the judicial officer come to the conclusion, in your modified version, that the judicial officer is satisfied that the police were satisfied, which means the judicial officer believed the police were telling the truth. If that is not against an accused, I am at a loss to imagine what that, other than a confession, would be. You have got that burden; you have got the constitutional burden that people might be walking free because you are prepared to take a risk, because you wanted the balance to go the other way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then you have got this burden, too: where things do happen, there is a short space of time available and you do want to get a controlled operation in, what will happen by the dual process being required is that, yes, the courier will be arrested. I do not have any sympathy for couriers. But you and I know, Senator Spindler, that they are not the ones. You know that, Senator Bolkus knows that, Duncan Kerr knows that and Michael Lavarch knows that. So what will happen? The courier, probably some unemployed person who has been sucked in by these creeps and given what they think is a fortune in money, has taken a chance. You will catch that person, sure. They will be arrested and will probably go to gaol. But what will happen? The importer will go free. So you can add that on to the burden.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point I want to make with respect to this suggestion is this: the decision to authorise a controlled operation will be an administrative decision which will come under attack at a subsequent trial. That is the case irrespective of your change. It is still an administrative decision that is going to come under attack at a subsequent trial. The decision by the judge really would seem to duplicate that of the authorising officer, but it is the final decision authorising the conduct of a controlled operation—not making an on&amp;hyphen;
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         balance decision as to rights and liberties.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Accordingly, it is almost certain that the judge will be subject to cross&amp;hyphen;examination to ascertain how it is that he or she was satisfied of the requirements set out in proposed section 15M, which would include under the modified version how he or she was satisfied that the police were telling the truth, that they were genuinely satisfied that this person was likely to commit an offence.

        We say that is clearly an inappropriate position in which to put a judge and is a position which no judge is likely to accept. You have to understand that what you are asking of them is qualitatively different from that which is asked of them in a telecommunications intercept. What you are asking is several steps up the ladder. We do not believe judges will be likely to accept this task. We point out there are already problems with respect to telecommunications interception matters. If you do not think those problems will be multiplied with respect to this, again, I say: on your shoulders.

        In terms of time, you have the same imperatives regarding the interception act requirements as well. Things happen very quickly. That is why in 1979 we worked through this issue in the parliament and that is why in subsequent legislation there was a mechanism put in place to ensure quick access to an issuing officer for warrants under the interception act. In similar circumstances we are conscious of the need for urgency, but we maintain that the provisions that will apply here under Senator Spindler's amendments will cover that.

         You may read the functions which a judge has to perform under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 in terms of warrants. There are quite a number of things that they have to address their minds to in terms of the processes of issuing a warrant in respect of telephone interception. There must be urgency; there must be reasonable grounds for suspecting that a particular person is using, or is likely to use, the service; there must be an awareness of the fact that information that would be likely to be obtained by intercepting under a warrant communications made to or from the service would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by the agency of a class 1 offence, or class 1 offences, in which the person is involved. I can go on. You must have regard to the extent to which methods of investigating the offence or offences that do not involve so intercepting communications have been used by, or are available to, the agency. A judge must be satisfied about all these things, including how much of the information referred to in para graph (d) would be likely to be obtained by such methods, and how much the use of such methods would be likely to prejudice the investigation by the agency.

        These are all important operational considerations that have to be taken into account by the judge.

Qualitatively, it is very much the same. I have spoken for too long as it is. I do not want to speak any more about this issue. I think we have got the balance right at this stage.

I believe there is a qualitative difference between saying that the judge is being asked to decide whether the officer spoke the truth and saying that the judge is being asked to decide whether, as the amendment suggests, the officer is satisfied that the person targeted is likely to commit an offence—that is, the officer believes that the person may commit an offence. That need not be the truth, and the judge is not being asked to decide that. The judge is simply being asked to decide whether the officer genuinely believes that the person is likely to commit an offence.

         —In response to that point, I put it to you this way, Senator Spindler. I understand the difference between satisfying yourself that someone else is satisfied of something, and being actually satisfied yourself. There is a slight distancing. I did not say there was no difference at all. In fact, I said I do not think it gets you very far at all. I mean that—it does not get you very far at all.

         You are saying that the judicial officer simply has to satisfy himself or herself that the police genuinely believe that in their heart of hearts. What are you doing when you tell the truth? You are putting forward that which you genuinely believe. By signing a certificate in the form presented by yourselves, a judicial officer is basically saying, `This person is obviously qualified to put this view to me.' The judicial officer is certainly not going to sign such a certificate if he or she believes the person has no competence and expertise. I think you would agree with that, Senator Spindler—you could save a bit of time in the debate if you could just give a nod or something to indicate that you understand a judicial officer is not going to sign a certificate, in the form you are now suggesting, if they believe the police officer before them has no competence to come to a conclusion. You accept that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Equally, you would accept that another decision the judicial officer would have to make in order to sign the certificate is not only the question of whether the person has the competence to make such a conclusion but whether the police officer believes the person is likely to commit an offence. You have ended up with a certificate from a judge that says, `I was satisfied that a competent person, professional in this area of law enforcement, came to the conclusion that this person was likely to commit an offence.'
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Basically, you could say to the jury that this certificate does not say a judge has listened to this and he has concluded it himself—that is, he has become the investigating officer and has concluded it. What you would be entitled to say, if you, the accuser, are there pointing the finger towards an innocent person, is: a judge has heard this matter; he has listened to what the police have to say; he was satisfied that the policeman was a competent person to make such a decision, and he was satisfied the policeman was telling the truth. As I said, there is a very slight shift, but I think it is inconsequential.

         There are a couple of extra points to make because I believe that if the Senate is of a mind to proceed with this, it is about to make a very serious mistake. These decisions by a

         It is still quite likely that judges would be asked at a subsequent trial to explain how they were satisfied that the prerequisites for the issue of the certificate had been complied with by the applicant and the authorising officers. One can imagine the difficulty which will arise as a judge is cross-examined about how he or she was satisfied that the law enforcement officer was satisfied of certain things. You are not going to evade that point.

         There are issues which go to the heart of the expertise of a trained investigator. There is a very strong possibility that judges would decline to exercise the function and that the state and territory governments would refuse to make their judicial officers available for the purpose. This is made even more likely by reason of the burden of numbers that is likely. It is expected that there will be a significant number of applications for certificates each year.

         Senator Spindler, I think you made a guess at around 12 applications. It is important to understand the difference between the number that might be engaged in involving some sort of overseas operation and those that might come from just the start up point at the barrier, where it is all domestic. As I understand it, that would be a significantly more significant number.

        I think there is a great difference between a judge being satisfied that a person is likely to commit an offence and a judge being satisfied that an investigative officer is of a genuine belief that an offence is going to be committed. By nature, investigative officers must be suspicious. My experience of the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority is that they are people of outstanding ability and integrity and are good investigative officers. The fact that you have an investigative officer believing something, is the sort of thing that a jury or a judge who was hearing the case would expect, because the officer's function is to look around and see what looks suspicious and investigate that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a different function altogether from a judge who must decide, in a balanced way, on all the evidence before him or her, whether a person is likely to commit an offence, or has committed an offence or whatever. Whatever decision he or she makes, it must be made on the basis of a considered approach. The judge's function is entirely different and, therefore, the impact that a decision made by a judge would have on a jury or another judge is going to be different from the impact of a similar decision made by an investigative officer.

         I do not think that the judge should be asked to make that decision either because, as Senator Vanstone said, it is an operational decision. It is not for the judge to think about how to obtain evidence.

A judge should be divorced from that decision as well. The introduction to (2) should read:

         I think that Senator Spindler wants some sort of control over what the investigative agencies do in this respect, and that would be consistent with getting warrants to search, intercept and what have you. What is being asked of the judge here is simply to be satisfied that the investigating forces have a genuine belief in what they are on about and that they do what they do in a responsible way to obtain evidence. I think there is an argument for that. So perhaps an amendment along the lines I have suggested, but perhaps

         —I understand the goodwill of Senator Spindler. I do not attribute any bad faith at all to your position. But I would just come back to the point I made to you a few minutes ago: I do not think what you are suggesting gets over the problems. I understand the problem you want to get over. It has been a problem for everyone; no doubt it was for the government, as it then was, a difficult decision to make. But, in the end, there has to be a balance about accountability, effectiveness and constitutionality. Otherwise we are engaged in a debating exercise that is going to make no difference at all to putting these creeps away.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand that Senator Cooney's suggestion may be an even further improvement; but I still say that it is very marginal. Because what were the key evils we wanted to get at? Firstly, the problem that judicial officers will decline to do this. They will decline to take on this task. Presumably, no&amp;hyphen;one here is disputing the advice that I have been offered by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's officers, that these judicial officers are already declining to exercise the power given to them with respect to telephone intercepts. You understand that this is a much more serious task you are asking them to do, and we expect therefore—it is axiomatic—that they will decline to do this. So you pass a bill through parliament that has all the intentions of getting at these creeps, these peddlers in drugs, to find that the judiciary, not out of any bad faith but out of their belief as to what is appropriate, decline to take on these tasks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What will you have? You will have a bill that is going nowhere fast and a whole lot of drug runners who still get away. That is one point. You do not, Senator Spindler, address the question by the amendments. The amendments proposed by Senator Cooney may be very sensible, they may sound good. You might think, `Oh well, that's made it better'—
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         you might think a lot better, and I would say not much better. But in the end whether it is better or not is irrelevant to the question of whether or not you get over the key problem.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The key problem is: at the moment judicial officers are declining to exercise their powers with respect to telephone intercepts. This is a much more serious matter and, therefore, you can conclude that they will decline to exercise these powers. So, where there is an operation that could be effective and catch one of these people rather than just the courier, that opportunity may be lost because of timing—which is, in fact, the second point. But because you require this and there will be judicial officers who will decline, you will run into the timing problem. I would say that, even if you were able to find a judge immediately, you may well on occasions face that extra timing problem when you get a courier who comes in—and that is where the controlled operation is seeking to start.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So you have not fixed the problem of judicial officers perhaps declining. Even if those judicial officers did not decline, you would still face a timing problem with those matters that suddenly arise in association with an intercept at an airport. Not all of these things are a consequence of law enforcement intelligence through, for example, Asia, where we think we know what will happen in advance and we can put someone in there to be a part of it. They are not all like that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So you have not fixed the declining of judicial officers problem; you have not fixed the timing problem in that the drug runners may get away and you will end up only with the couriers; and, in our view, you still have not fixed the constitutional problem because you are still asking a judicial officer to exercise what we believe is a decision that can be challenged constitutionally. I am interested to hear an argument as to why you think you have got around it. Have you made it better? Yes, maybe. But have you got over each or any of those hurdles? No.

        Let me go to the argument I raised with you a few minutes ago. The judicial officer could give the policeman he trusted a stamp and say, `When you are telling the truth, put my signature on this.' Now that is not what you are suggesting. You know that the judicial officer is going to have to make inquiries as to how the senior police officer formed the reasonable view, came to a conclusion, that the suspect was likely to commit an offence. That is going to involve the judicial officer weighing up the arguments put by the police officer as to why he believes this. He may say, `Look, there are five factors I have taken into account. Three go on balance this way. There are two other points. I am telling you the truth because I think three to two and that is how I have formed my reasonable view.'

         A judicial officer is going to have to do more in order to have reasonable grounds to sign the certificate. They are never going to get away with simply saying, `Are you telling the truth?' They are going to have to go into those matters and make a second guess, if you like. Senator Cooney was quite right when he said in his summing up that `a genuine belief' is a difficult matter to ascertain. I do not see how you can do it by saying, `Are you telling the truth?'

In other words, I think Senator Spindler agrees that you are asking for more than the simple question, `Are you telling the truth?' What other questions do you think a judicial officer is going to ask to satisfy himself that the relevant police officer has genuinely satisfied himself? What other questions are there that do not go to the operational matters, that do not involve a judge in the things that we say will taint the bill? Tell me what those questions are that would allow a judicial officer to come to that conclusion.

That is what he or she has to do there and that is what we are invoking here. They have to be satisfied about certain things, which are provided to them by the senior law enforcement officer. The senior law enforcement officer has an obligation—under threat of contempt or other proceedings if he or she was to lie—to the judge.

I think Senator Cooney, in embracing in his amendment the whole aspect of factors that need to be taken into account by the judge, covers all of the points that you were making earlier. In essence, you have a situation here which is very close to the issuing of warrants. I think your arguments are just spurious.

That is true, but it does not answer the point. One of the things that you would be asking them to do under this particular bill is qualitatively different from all of the things that you ask them to do under the Telecommunications (Intercept) Act. Nowhere in the telecommunications intercept legislation does a judge have to satisfy himself or herself that a person is likely to commit an offence.

         Let us not pretend that we are simply talking about the issue of how a judge looks at certain things. Every time a judge makes a decision he looks at certain things. To say that that does not contribute, with respect, is not right. I come back to Senator Cooney, who I think understands and is trying to draw a line, and say that I do not think it is pos sible to draw the line. We are saying that, yes, in both cases judges would be asked to make certain conclusions but that in this particular bill you are asking for them to make a much more serious conclusion. Nowhere in the telecommunications intercept legislation do they need to draw a conclusion that someone is likely to commit an offence. They have to have reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone is going to use a particular service and that the information that would be likely to be obtained by intercept would be likely to assist. I mean, big deal! Under this, you could authorise a tap on a phone that was not the phone of the person whom you thought in the end you were going to catch. It might not be the phone of the guilty party.

        I think it is correct that there would be a number of intercepts, and Senator Spindler would probably be aware of this from the previous committee experience he has had. There would be a number of intercepts—quite a lot—that you would ask a judicial officer to authorise. They are not intercepts that have anything to do, other than gathering evidence for an offence, with the person who is likely to be charged—that is, the targeted person. Even in those circumstances you have judges refusing to exercise their discretion and exercise the power that they could, by consent.

        But in this case, inevitably—not just every now and then—there has to be the involvement of a person where conclusions need to be drawn by a range of people that that person is likely to commit an offence. So it is qualitatively different. To say judges decide certain things and take things into account all the time is irrelevant. This is qualitatively different. It is not possible that they can, as I understand it, authorise an operation where there is not a conclusion that someone is likely to commit an offence. So it is qualitatively different from the telecommunications intercept example.

That process of being satisfied that the investigating authority is going about his or her task in the appropriate way is an exercise that judges have been carrying out for centuries—or for a long time, in any event—in terms of applications for warrants for arrests, warrants for breaking into premises, and search warrants.

        I see some merit in what you say, but I think it condemns your argument.

If that is the case, it begs the question of the purpose of this extra approval. If the facts are not going to be tested, if they are largely uncontested, we must come back to the point that you are either asking the judicial officers just to say yes on the basis of the fact that they trust the person or you are asking them to go to those facts and make a conclusion.

In that sense, you are losing some of those people that we did not know about in advance and are picked up at the barrier, who fall apart at the prospect of being caught and start openly yapping about where they were to take the drugs, whom they dealt with and so on.

I do not infer from that that you necessarily agree but I see that you can see the merit in the argument I am putting. At least you can say that. I understand what you are trying to get at. I know you want extra accountability. You say we need this because the senior law enforcement officer has to be accountable to someone, as if, if your amendment was not accepted, we would be proposing a situation where a senior law enforcement officer could give a tick and that would be the end of it.

         Can I just take you briefly through the following steps. The authorisation by a senior law enforcement officer is central to the accountability measures in this bill. These officers will be accountable for their decisions to the minister, the parliament and, through it, the public. Do not forget the mechanism that we have provided in the bill. The senior law enforcement officers do not just make the decision and be accountable to no&amp;hyphen;one. They have to report to the minister, to the parliament and, through it, to the public.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not the end of the process that is already in what we say is a sure, constitutional bill, one that you are taking a risk with. The authorising officers will also be accountable to the courts, to judicial officers. Where an authorised, controlled operation results in a prosecution, the authorising officer is likely to be called to testify to justify the granting of the certificate. We do not deny that that is a good thing and, presumably, you think it is a good thing. So someone has the opportunity to challenge and say, `This should not have happened. The certificate should not have been granted,' and the authorising officer will be called and cross&amp;hyphen;examined.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So it is not in the interests of the authorising officer, as we would have it, to just give things a tick without giving consideration because, as a later and appropriate step, we provide that judicial scrutiny. That step is removed from the making of an operational decision before you go into the operation but allows judicial approval where defence counsel think it appropriate to put it to the test. You will get your judicial officer, but at an appropriate point where you are not putting the bill at risk.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If it is decided that the certificate was granted without a proper basis, and it is a judicial officer who will make that decision, a court may exclude the resulting evidence. We think that is the most sensible way of providing judicial scrutiny of a certificate for a controlled operation. If I can put it at its most simplistic, I understand the good faith you bring to this task but you are getting a judicial officer to give something a tick prior to the operation going into effect and becoming operational.

          We are arguing that you cannot possibly achieve that without involving the judicial officer in the operational matters.

You can in one way or another extend it inch by inch or millimetre by millimetre—or, as Senator Cook would say, by a nano&amp;hyphen;millimetre or a nano&amp;hyphen;distance—but you will not get away from it. You are asking for the judicial officer to give approval to an operation before it goes into effect.

        If the view the police officer has come to is that this person is likely to commit an offence and the judicial officer does not come to the view, should he still then sign the certificate? I see Senator Spindler nodding yes and Senator Cooney nodding no.

        All we are asking for is that there be a discipline—an extra discipline, that is true—upon the investigating force before it goes ahead with this very dramatic step. If you look at the Ridgeway case, the High Court obviously thought it was a dramatic step. All that has been asked for is that the judge exercise an additional discipline. It might not be a very great discipline in the sense that the material that is supplied to the judge comes from one side but, nevertheless, it is a discipline and doing that is in the tradition of the law as it has so far been administered in this society.

I think we all agree that judicial officers would not sign certificates if they thought the relevant police officer was lying to them. I think we agree on that.

        You are saying to me that you think the judicial officer has to make a conclusion that the police officer has this genuine belief, but you think he can do that without having that genuine belief himself. In other words, when he looks at the facts—and he is going to have to look at the facts presented, uncontested as they are—how is he going to decide whether he thinks the police officer has the genuine belief?

        If he is going to do more than just ask, `Are you telling the truth?'—which is one option, and that would be ludicrous; presumably, you would agree that that would be ludicrous—then he has to look at the facts and say, `Would a reasonable person come to this conclusion?' You are telling me that, if he makes a conclusion that a reasonable person would not come to that conclusion, he can

        In the circumstances where a judicial officer looks at a set of facts and says, `A reasonable man would not come to that conclusion,' how does that judicial officer conclude that, nonetheless, this senior law enforcement officer holds that view reasonably? How does he come to that conclusion? He cannot do it other than by simply asking, `Are you telling the truth?' You just cannot get out of this. In order to conclude that the police officer has that view, the judicial officer has to go into those details. If judicial officers do not have to go into those details and make a conclusion themselves, then the only other way they can be this extra tick is just by being a rubber stamp.

With respect, I know you do not mean to be in any way diminishing the role of the judiciary, but to say you just want the judicial officers to be an extra check, an extra tick—send them down to the schoolmaster and the schoolmaster will say, `Flick,' or, `No flick'—is demeaning what you are asking.

        The opposition is not asking for just a tick; you are asking judicial officers to give their time and consideration to something. You are asking them to give time and proper judicial consideration to a set of uncontested facts and to draw a conclusion from that. You cannot tell me that the judicial officer could draw one conclusion and still believe that the police officer had come to another one. You cannot possibly be suggesting that. I make the point that, in any event, you are taking a risk because you have got the judicial check at a later stage.

        That sort of problem and situation has existed for decades. It has existed from the time there has been common law in Australia, and it existed in England before that. The issue that Senator Vanstone raised—about how effective the issuing of warrants is—is one that ought to be looked at from time to time. But that is how warrants are issued. All that has been asked now is that that tradition and history be continued in respect of this matter.

        On Monday, two business days later, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) referred in the parliament to this letter to me from British Telecom. The point of this chronology is simply this: clearly, British Telecom is not a disinterested observer but a player with a possible financial interest in the outcome of the Senate vote. Their actions, in my opinion, should be viewed accordingly. They are not a disinterested observer. Yet Senator Alston, interestingly enough, continues to rely almost exclusively on information from British Telecom as the source with which to refute figures which other people might raise in the debate. I prefer to rely on more independent sources, such as the National Consumer Council of the United Kingdom and Oftel, the British telecommunications regulator, and the Australian Consumers' Association.

       <para>
        Since 1993, the position has improved. I have always acknowledged that. It has been because of a range of changes by Oftel, the British telecommunications regulator. Price capping was an important factor. So too was the exclusion of volume discounts from the price capping formula, which had benefited business customers at the expense of residential consumers. Oftel reports that the degree of variation between business and residential consumers has now reduced. It also notes that regulation has played a key role. I quote from the Oftel report:

        I do accept that in recent years British Telecom's charges regime has improved. I have said that before. It is regulation which has had the significant impact on this. That is why we have so much in common in this parliament in seeking to strengthen the regulatory regime for telecommunications. I think we know full well that a privatised Telstra, without price caps, would increase prices. Price caps and regulation are an essential precondition to consumer benefits, but privatisation alone is not. That is why the Australian Consumers' Association has called

        It is those kinds of concerns which have motivated the majority of this Senate to send the bill off to a references committee. I think the Australian Consumers' Association, representing the consumers of this nation, is actually grateful that the Senate has had the sense to do this.

        In conclusion, Senator Alston can bluster all he likes about British Telecom information. The fact of the matter is that Australian consumers have had a decade of privatisation. They know what they were promised on banking—lower fees, for one. They know what has been delivered.

         —I rise to talk about the issue of building construction workers having their take-home pay reduced as a direct result of a decision by the coalition government not to proceed with the formalisation of a legitimate tax deductibility on a component of the workers' travel allowance. This decision makes yet another mockery of the commitment given by John Howard. On 8 January he gave the commitment that workers had his rock solid guarantee that they would not be worse off.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Short responded to a dorothy dixer today in question time which, as usual, gave a very narrow and biased perspective of the background of this issue. I want to set the record straight. The building industry is an itinerate one. The work is generally one of daily hire and one which requires workers to follow that work. The tax deductible allowance to which we are referring has existed for more than three decades and has its origins in the unusual itinerate nature of the building industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was an agreement between the tax office, the then government and the workers' representatives—the unions—to the effect that on-site building construction workers' travel allowance would be exempt from tax. I am sure, if the government of today looked hard enough, that it would find that John Howard, as Treasurer in the Fraser government, was part of such an agreement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1989 the tax department challenged this agreement, saying that as the allowance had increased over the years the tax exemption was becoming increasingly significant. As a result of this, the tax deductibility of that allowance was restricted to the allowance as it stood at that time. At that time it was $7.60 per day and the deductibility of this allowance was cordoned off at this point. It is important to note that this allowance has grown since then. It has grown to the degree that this tax deductibility component of this allowance
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         now stands at around two-thirds of that complete award allowance.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1995 the tax department again attempted to renege on this agreement and put in place taxation ruling 95/22, which effectively excluded building workers from qualifying for that deductible component of two-thirds of their travel allowance by putting in place two tests. By and large, the first of these tests related to requiring the workers to carry bulky tools. It even went so far as to define these bulky tools, being wheelbarrows and ladders. Also, it was contingent upon there not being a lock-up on site. Given that a tools lock-up is now part of the award, that requirement is very difficult to fulfil.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second part of the test put in place required building workers to be eligible to work on more than one site in any one day. But this particular aspect was quite ambiguous and there were situations where building workers could work on one site for one day, provided they moved around. So there was a lot of ambiguity there.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, as you can see, the strict application of this ruling is administratively very difficult for all in the industry and not just the workers themselves, including the tax department and employers. Hence, in itself, this fact shows that this agreement was a very sensible thing to do.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 8 December 1995, Mr Willis, in his capacity as Treasurer at the time, moved to formalise this existing agreement and instructed the tax department not to expect employers to tax their employees the full travel allowance in anticipation of moves on his behalf to resolve once and for all the ambiguity surrounding this issue. The tax department subsequently wrote to everyone to this effect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is this course of action that was set in train which this government has now decided to stop. In taking this action, it will actively be denying building workers between $12 and $28 in take-home pay, which is the weekly pay implication of the decision to apply taxation ruling 95/22.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Also, the application of this ruling, as it stood in 1995, raises the frightening spectre of retrospectivity. The coalition government,
        <break page="1362" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in stating that they will not be proceeding with this exemption, have implied and have not refuted that it will apply retrospectively to the financial year of 1995-96.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If this is the case, this represents a very serious circumstance, firstly, because the taxation department has advised to the contrary in this current financial year and, secondly, this could mean that building workers stand to receive a huge bill in the vicinity of $1,200 come tax time this year. I cannot think of a more unreasonable, unfair or even spiteful decision by a government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Needless to say, this action has provoked an understandably angry response from thousands of workers right around the country, and it begs the question: what is motivating this government to axe a longstanding agreement—an agreement that is bipartisan in nature and has stood for some 30 years? Not only is it an agreement that has attracted bipartisan support, but it is an agreement that is grounded in commonsense, that recognises the itinerant nature of building and construction work, and that makes a lot of administrative sense. It is a practical agreement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To answer the question of what is motivating those opposite we need only look at the coalition's whole approach to working people. We can see by the workplace relations bill that any noises this government has made about no worker being worse off have been totally disregarded. It is no wonder that the many thousands of building and construction workers who protested today have taken a very strong stand. They stand to lose some of their take-home pay and will be faced with a massive taxation bill because of the retrospective application of this decision.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition has, by their action, provoked an industrial campaign that has reinforced the fact that they have embarked upon a road of industrial confrontation. I say in closing that the words `no worker will be worse off' are echoing in the same streets where thousands of building workers gathered today. Thanks to Mr Costello and this decision, workers will now be worse off.

However, it is instead an unfettered commitment to unfettered woodchipping in this country.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The export control regulations relating to woodchipping which were tabled in this place on 30 April 1996 are a reflection of this commitment to unchecked woodchipping. The regulations do not and never have reflected a real terms drop in the woodchip quota. Any reduction in quota granted by the previous government is in place only up until the regional forest agreements are signed. Unfortunately, once regional forest agreements are in place, there will be no national ceiling on the woodchip quota. So export control regulations do nothing to protect the old&amp;hyphen;growth forests of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The national forest policy statement proposed phasing out woodchipping from old&amp;hyphen;growth forests by the year 2000. Both major parties claimed their support for this statement, yet the regulations that I mentioned earlier have conveniently avoided any mention of a phase&amp;hyphen;out by the year 2000 and instead legislate for what might sound quite innocuous by its title—a regional forest agreement. But that agreement has no intention of phasing out logging in our old&amp;hyphen;growth and high conservation forests by the year 2000, no transition to a plantation base, no genuine protection for our environment in Australia and no respect for the needs of the planet or for the conservation of our last remaining old growth native forests.

         I believe that this is a further example of the government's regrettable eagerness to exempt themselves from any control over protection of the environment in this country. The RFAs, the regional forest agreements, will eventually do away with the yearly export licence renewals. The previous govern ment was criticised by the now government for merely mounting a stratagem to make it look as though the forests were being protected. I have to agree with them. They are quite right. But I regret that they are following that same stratagem.

        Yearly export controls are specifically designed to assess industry and state agency adherence to environmental conditions placed upon the granting of woodchip export licences. Until 1994, it was very clear that very little or probably no monitoring of export licence conditions was occurring. Senator Bob Collins might remember—it is certainly memorable to me—the estimates committee at which we discovered exactly how much, or how little, monitoring was happening of the conditions under which the export of woodchips occurred.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In the south&amp;hyphen;west of Western Australia logging of Giblett coupes 7 and 8, two pristine forest blocks supposedly protected by woodchip licence conditions, led to them being logged `by accident' last year. No action has been taken by either government. The Bunnings woodchip licence for Western Australia's forests is in fact a 15-year licence, but yearly licence renewal is specifically to address adherence to conditions. We do not see a satisfactory monitoring of those conditions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had no commitment from the present government that they will improve on the shoddy record of the previous government. The regional forest agreements will do away with even that essential intent and yet again emasculate the government to prevent it honouring its environmental responsibilities and its responsibilities to rural forestry workers and future generations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Further, we have still no indication of this government's position on the protection of national estate forests in the south&amp;hyphen;west of Western Australia. Senator Hill gave a less than helpful response to my question of last week regarding this issue. In Western Australia and other places there is the very real spectre of this and other woodchip licence conditions being waived before regional forest agreements are signed, and as early as 30 June of the given quota year if `significant
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         progress' has been made towards RFAs in any given region.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Who determines what this `significant progress' is? Western Australian RFAs may be in place by the end of 1997. Under these regulations, the much acclaimed 20 per cent reduction, or 40 per cent off 1995 levels by 1997, will be abolished by June next year. It sounds much more like a department store fire sale than a forest policy. Maybe it is a forest fire policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is it that promotes this insane and extraordinarily counterproductive situation where the concrete protection of areas eventually contributes to their ultimate downfall to woodchipping? In effect, we are saying, `Tell us which areas you propose to protect and we will give you an unquotaed licence to woodchip them.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are other questions of very real urgency regarding the government's intentions in relation to the export control regulations. Will the DFA woodchip licence condition coupe exclusions of last year be adhered to? If the government increases the woodchip quota, and in so doing further puts the lie to its commitment to a phase&amp;hyphen;out of woodchipping by 2000, where will these woodchips come from? Will we see the areas of old&amp;hyphen;growth forest not protected within the DFA conditions logged with even greater voracity, further cementing unsustainable logging practices; or will the government take the disastrous armchair approach of simply revoking those conditions and reversing any short&amp;hyphen;term protection afforded Australia's most magnificent old&amp;hyphen;growth forests under the DFAs?

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to support the Dutch government's action whereby the Dutch public works department found that karri forest logging was less environmentally acceptable than tropical logging. We are actually in danger of disgracing ourselves in the international community. It is true that CALM in Western Australia is fighting this. Certainly, we want to commend the Netherlands for being far more thorough than Western Australia and the Department of Conservation and Land Management.

         The point of raising this issue at this stage is that behind closed doors the agreements are being made to sell out our last remaining old&amp;hyphen;growth forests. The people of Western Australia were lulled into a false sense of security by the Conservation and Land Management Department in Western Australia requesting last year a moratorium of two years before putting the RFAs into action.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we see now is that it was really a moratorium to wait for a change of government. Now we see that it is going ahead and we must be very, very careful that this government takes up the opportunities which the former government lost and denied the people of this country in relation to preserving our old&amp;hyphen;growth forests. They are precious and they are incalculable in their value to future generations. The indifference that has been shown by major political parties towards this devastation will be looked upon by the next generation with scorn, disbelief and an enormous feeling of sadness for what has been lost.

         —I rise on the adjournment tonight to draw the attention of the Senate to the unbelievably ham&amp;hyphen;fisted performance of the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, on the question of the importation of cooked chicken meat. In his attempts to squirm out of an impossible situation—I might add, one entirely of his own making—he has allowed both chambers of this parliament to be misled in recent days. I am very pleased that Senator Boswell is in the chamber tonight because he knows—and I know he knows—just how bad the minister's performance has been on this matter.

        In terms of the discussion paper which the minister circulated to his government backbench—and I have a copy of it—if he thinks his backbench are mugs, he is foolish indeed if he thinks the chicken industry are mugs. It is the industry to which he provided a written assurance two weeks before polling day that he would not be allowing the importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia before the completion of the Nairn review and `the implementation of its recommendations in

       <para first-indent="16">
        I read that discussion paper with disgust, I inform Senator Boswell, because some spin doctor in the minister's office, some bush lawyer, has tried to put this spin on it now. The chicken industry in Australia—and Senator Boswell knows it—was in no doubt about what the minister meant when he handed them that letter two weeks before polling day. He was not talking about uncooked chicken meat at all, which was not even on the table for discussion at that time. It was cooked chicken meat that was the order of the day. The minister's behaviour on this casts no credit on him at all.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senators would recall my colleague Senator Burns asking the junior minister in here, Senator Parer, a question last week. That question was about an article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         —a very interesting article. The article stated that the newspaper had been told by Mr Anderson's office that the minister had signed off on a decision to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia from the United States, Thailand and Denmark, only to be told in a panic&amp;hyphen;stricken call the journalist received half an hour later that this was wrong and a decision, although it was imminent, had not been made pending further consultation with industry.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Given that the decision is made by delegated authority, Senator Burns asked whether Senator Parer could, on behalf of his senior minister, advise the Senate if the delegated officer—that is normally the director of AQIS—had signed off on this approval and, if so, when. Senator Parer then provided to the Senate a detailed response, obviously prepared by Mr Anderson's office in anticipation of the question. During this response he said that AQIS had conducted a quarantine risk assessment and considered the importation of cooked chicken meat from the USA, Thailand and Denmark under specified conditions would not represent a disease risk. He added—this was in question time—and I quote:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        AQIS will publish a statement within a few days—

        </para>
        <para>
         This was widely and accurately reported in the media, as one would expect, as a decision by the government to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia. In fact, the AAP story was headlined, accurately, that—`Government allows importation of cooked chicken meat'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As senators may also recall, I raised this matter in this chamber again in question time on Wednesday last week. I asked Senator Parer why this decision had been taken in complete breach of specific, written undertakings given to the chicken and salmon industries in a letter from Mr Anderson two weeks before the election when this issue, I might add, was red&amp;hyphen;hot in regional seats. That was the issue of importing cooked chicken meat, not uncooked chicken meat, as the minister is now trying to slide out of this mess that he made by saying.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I read out the final paragraph of the letter which stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A coalition government will suspend the approval of all proposed new import protocols—
        </para>
        <para>
         which, I might add, includes cooked chicken meat, because we have not had those protocols published yet so they are new protocols—

        </para>
        <para>
         And the letter was signed `Yours sincerely, John Anderson'. Senator Parer was totally nonplussed by this information, said he had nothing to add to his original answer but was quite happy to read back the answer to Senator Burns into the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         . The junior minister clearly had no idea what a hornet's nest Mr Anderson had created and what a complete lack of attention he had given to the detail of this issue that he had then stirred up in the rural community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But things got worse. Within an hour of Senator Parer telling the Senate that he had nothing to add, Senator Woodley's urgency motion was brought on on the same issue straight after question time. During this debate, Senator Brownhill, the minister's
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          parliamentary secretary, said, `No decision had been made.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What was even more interesting was what Senator Crane said. Senator Crane is, of course, the newly elected chair of the coalition's primary industries and energy committee—and I have got a fair idea why Senator Crane got to be chair of that committee. Senator Crane informed the Senate that he had been so concerned about the original answer Senator Parer had given the Senate—and I am quoting Senator Crane—that he had `gone to see the minister'. He had been told by the minister that `no final decision had been made', the matter was `under review' and `the review would be very ruthless, very rigorous and would take some time'. Have a look at the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         , Senator Boswell; those are Senator Crane's words straight from the minister. I understand that Mr Anderson had some answers to give to his backbench, not unreasonably, following this affair.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An information paper, which I have a copy of, was then distributed to the government's backbench. When I read that information paper, I was astonished and disgusted at the minister's attempt to squirm out of the commitment that he had given the chicken industry by claiming he had been talking about uncooked chicken meat, not cooked chicken meat. I can tell you the reaction from the industry on that: I spoke to two industry representatives only two days ago, and they were disgusted. I am reliably informed that this information paper was actually the PPQ, the brief for question time, with the question taken off the top—and I have very good information about that. I am reliably informed that some of the backbench were not complete mugs on this issue either, as none of the chicken industry people were mugs and not very impressed by it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem for the government was that we had an answer given by Senator Parer here in question time, a statement made by Senator Crane 24 hours later directly from the minister and an information paper issued to the minister, all of which absolutely contradicted each other. The briefing paper states:

         That was not a problem apparently two weeks before election day. It says:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         A further meeting of industry representatives will be convened to present the final AQIS statement on this access request.
        </para>
        <para>
         You can understand my reaction to these three absolutely conflicting explanations from the government on this issue. Had the minister not signed off on a letter to the chicken meat and salmon industries just weeks before the election pledging no action on this issue until after the Nairn review recommendations had been implemented? That was the intention he meant to give the industry, and that is the intention that they accepted: there would be no cooked chicken meat coming in for at least a year. Was he really suggesting that he did not know the requirements of the Quarantine Act?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I refer you, Senator Boswell, to the four dot points on that information paper where the minister said that these were the things he did not find out till he got into government and that he did not know while he was in opposition. The first dot point was the requirements of the Quarantine Act. Was he seriously suggesting that he had to get into government to find that out? The next two dot points talked about the AQIS process, which had recommended—and you know they did, Senator Boswell; it was a matter for a Senate committee—that the cooked chicken meat be allowed in. That was a public process. Both the draft risk analysis and their final report were public documents available to everybody including, I assume, the shadow minister for primary industry. He did not have to wait to get into government to find that out either.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         According to Mr Anderson, I took a decision. To my astonishment, he said in the House of Representatives today that I took a decision to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat last year; I approved that decision and then sat on it and did nothing. Well, can I ask the Senate a very commonsense question? If, as Mr Anderson said, I approved this action last year, which I did not, why are
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          we not up to our ears now in imported cooked chicken meat?

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is an absolute nonsense and sheer duplicity on the part of the minister—and there is no question that that is what it is: his attempt to dupe his own backbench and his attempt to dupe the chicken industry as well. I have to say that he may have succeeded with his own backbench, although I do not think they are that stupid, but he certainly has not succeeded with the chicken industry. At a later point in time, I will table these documents for everybody to make their own assessments and compare them. In fact, if the minister had done the slightest research, he would have discovered—and he could have asked Senator Brownhill—that his own parliamentary secretary, Senator Brownhill, was still arguing about the rigour of the scientific assessment conducted by AQIS on cooked chicken meat before a Senate committee in November last year and he was doing so on behalf of the Chicken Growers Council of Australia. Mr Anderson did not even bother asking.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) Asset Services, acting in the capacity of a contractor to the Department of Primary Industries, was required by the customer to provide the services of a trade-qualified painter to ensure that industry standards were maintained. Painters on Cocos Island are not formally trade-qualified and would be classified as "brush-hands" within the painting industry. The provision of a mainland tradesperson not only ensured that the industry standard was maintained but also provided training to local workers who were also employed on the project under the supervision of this tradesperson.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) The return air fare to Cocos Island was $899.00 and the total cost of supplying the tradesperson, inclusive of this cost, was included in the price contracted to the customer.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) The actual cost differential is unable to be quantified since, as detailed above, there are no local employees with equivalent trade qualifications and also because of the variance in oncosts allocated to local (Cocos Island) employees and mainland employees. The base loaded wage of the tradesperson was however markedly lower than that charged for Island workers and this, allied to the reduced supervision necessary on the project and productivity gains made would together ensure that any overall differential in costs would be minimal.
