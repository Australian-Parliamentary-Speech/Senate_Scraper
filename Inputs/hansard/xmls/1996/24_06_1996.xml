         —My question is to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. Are your government's election promises to maintain the pension benchmark of at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and to continue to index the pension twice yearly core commitments, to use the Prime Minister's terminology—that is, promises you intend to keep? Was your spokeswoman telling the truth when she said yesterday, `The government has ruled out fixing the pension by any different formula. It stays at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings'?

         —I thank Senator Abetz for his question. I am pleased to note that the Commission of Audit does support the government's policy for a charter of budget honesty. In particular, it supports updated budget forecasts being released before general elections in a way that will keep governments honest, which is something the former Labor government was never prepared to do. The Commission of Audit stresses that the frequency of fiscal reporting has a strong bearing on the extent to which such reporting increases the pressure on governments to act responsibly. We agree entirely with this.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is particularly important that the public has access to up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date information about the fiscal outlook during election campaigns. We all know the record of the Keating&amp;hyphen;Beazley government in that regard. They did not believe in budget honesty. They refused time and time again to release updated fiscal forecasts. If I understand it correctly, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has confirmed that position since the budget.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The previous government put their narrow political interests above those of the Australian people. When the forecasts were finally released two days after the election—and they were available to the then government before the election—they revealed Mr Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Before the election, we said that our charter of budget honesty would ensure that governments publish up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date economic and fiscal forecasts before general elections. Publishing updated forecasts is not only good in terms of fostering fiscal responsibility; it is good for democracy all round.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am very happy to reconfirm the government's commitment to these important reforms. We are very pleased that the independent Commission of Audit supports our position. The Commission of Audit also recommends that legislation be introduced to give effect to budget honesty and that the mid&amp;hyphen;year reviews show updated forward estimates. The government supports these recommendations as well. The shadow Treasurer, Mr Evans, made some interesting remarks about these matters on Friday night on ABC television when he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the problem around the end of last year or the first few weeks of this year was that there was no more reliable data that would give any better an estimate as to what's going to happen next year than what we'd said last August.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para>
         First of all, the shadow Treasurer got the date wrong. The budget was handed down in May of last year. Given that it was their last budget, I am surprised that Labor cannot get the month right.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me make it clear that that was not a mere slip of the tongue by the shadow Treasurer. Rather, it revealed a disturbing ignorance of how much additional economic information was around in the period leading up to the election. Because, at the time of the May budget last year, the former government and the Treasury had access only to the December 1994 national accounts. But by early this year, well before the election, the September 1995 national accounts were available. In other words, since the budget was brought down last year, Labor had access to three&amp;hyphen;quarters more economic information by the time the election was called. Of course, they had estimates of significant policy
         <break page="2012" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          changes made subsequent to the budget. Yet the shadow Treasurer last week said that there was no more reliable information available before the election, and that of course was nonsense.

        It seems to me that one of the things the opposition is not prepared to recognise is the fact that the regular indexation of pensions was introduced by the Fraser coalition government during the late seventies. So why should we be in any way wanting to walk away from a fair go for elderly Australians? The Whitlam government did not introduce that; it was the Fraser government.

         —I think Mr Blount's comments were of great interest to all thinking Australians, because what Mr Blount did was effectively spell out on behalf of the board—in other words, on behalf of the entire company—what he thought was in its best interests. He went through I thought in very careful detail five key advantages which he said flowed from privatisation. The first was that Telstra would be accountable to its shareholders on a daily basis. It certainly isn't at the moment. As we know, the only shareholder it had prior to 2 March was Paul Keating. He did what he liked and ran rampant over the outfit.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is precisely what Mr Blount's second point was: that public ownership has the potential to distract management from maximising the value of the business and to reward good politics rather than commercial excellence. So that is precisely what Mr Blount was saying should not happen and would not happen under a privatised Telstra. He also said that it is important to have regulatory and policy transparency. In other words, he wants to avoid that conflict of interest. He also wants to lower Telstra's overall cost of capital. Again, he makes it clear that privatisation would achieve that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, he said incentive schemes as announced by the government in its privatisation policy will give a new edge to the motivation of all Telstra's people. He says that competition is vitally important and that, if you could have only one, you would go for competition but, if you can have both, you ought to have it and the result will be better outcomes over all. In other words, Mr Blount is making it quite clear that Australia has the opportunity of having the best of all worlds if it goes down the path of sensible reform, as has the rest of the world. And can I add to that long
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and growing list of countries that have now gone down the privatisation path. I have seen a note that tells me that Kuwait has raised more than a billion dollars by selling stakes in its state firms and is leading its Gulf Arab neighbours in privatisation.

        I do not know where you can go, Senator Kernot. You can run but you cannot hide. No other country is locked in the technology time warp you would have Australia in. There is no expert in the world who cannot see the virtues of privatisation. All Mr Blount was doing, I thought in a very measured and calm way, was pointing out the overwhelming benefits to Telstra, to consumers and to the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For those who express doom and gloom, as Bob Brown did the other day—he makes these statements that somehow we will all be worse off—what Mr Blount said was this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I'd like to make an unequivocal undertaking: we will deliver a higher quality of service and better value to you as a partially privatised company, without diminishing or compromising Telstra's proud record of community service and community involvement ... I guarantee that what is best about Telstra ... will be enhanced and not devalued by this change in our ownership ...
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Blount also says the positives add up to a pretty persuasive case, especially in light of his own experience. He says that he has seen just about every possible permutation of the public-private monopoly&amp;hyphen;competition matrix and that he has come to a simple conclusion.
       </para>

        Everyone else has come to the same simple conclusion too, and that is that the Democrats and others simply refuse to face the facts.

        In relation to superannuation and other issues that go to the heart of arguably the most significant problem facing Australia—that is, lack of savings—the report makes some very useful comments about the role of superannuation and its performance in recent years, and makes some suggestions for the future.

Every other excuse has been blown out of the water, so now we have this line that somehow there is this $2 billion of guaranteed income that might be put at risk.

        Just in case you are not aware of it, let me tell you that this very week Optus will announce a new local call charge rate. At the moment the local call business is worth about $5 billion out of about $12 billion total. If Optus actually manages to achieve, say, 15 to 20 per cent of market share, which is not unreasonable given what they have done with mobiles and long distance, 20 per cent of $5 billion would be $1 billion in revenue that Telstra could lose overnight—so much for this guaranteed $2 billion stream!
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But it is much worse that, this logic, because in the financial year to July 1995, Telstra's profit after abnormals was about $1.7 billion. Nothing like that amount goes to the government. Obviously, any business that is making profits and has earnings after tax has to reinvest. Senator Kernot may have a 100 per cent dividend policy but we do not and nor did our predecessors.

        Telstra finds it necessary at the moment to invest about $3.3 billion a year in upgrading the network, called the FMO. If you take that and put that to one side and ask yourself how much it actually gives to government each year, you will find that last year the dividend figure was about $790 million. Would it
        <break page="2019" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Government debt at the moment is about $83 billion. I am sure Senator Kernot understands that our commitment, after giving $1 billion to the environment, is to use the remaining $7 billion from the sale—it may well be more—to repay government debt. At the moment the government is paying interest on that $7 billion of about eight per cent. In other words, $560 million of taxpayers' funds simply goes down the drain in debt reservice. Under our model—and under Senator Kernot's too if she followed the logic through—is that you would not have to pay that $560 million but you would lose $260 million. I would have thought that is a pretty good deal. You would be getting about twice your money.

        The fact is that, far from the government foregoing $2 billion of revenue income, you would get all of that money up front. The net present value of that would be capitalised, so you would have all that money to invest. If you use it to repay debt, instead of wasting the money on debt service, you can use it on the things that you constantly argue should have more money spent on them. That is what it is all about. You would rather have the money going to repay interest and debt rather than having it to spend on welfare, housing, and all those other important issues that taxpayers' funds are raised for.

        There is never enough, in your view, I know. You would like to have enormous amounts of money to spend. But just remember that at the present time it is not there. It is very scarce. You have a $8 billion deficit. What we are proposing is nothing more or less than a very sensible and modest approach, not squandering it, not splashing it up against the wall as this lot did. We are going to use it, not to pay for recurrent expenditure, but to retire debt. If you follow the logic through, you will find that is a very good deal for taxpayers.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I would like to know from Senator Sherry is why he is prepared to accept that argument, in relation to compulsory superannuation, but is not prepared to recognise that accumulating government debt at the horrendous rate that was racked up by the previous government—of which he was a member—imposes a similar millstone around the necks of our children and our future generations?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the argument that we must protect our children from our spending excesses is good enough for private saving, which it is, then why isn't it good enough for our collective spending through government? There is a fundamental symmetry to the argument that Senator Sherry either will not or cannot see, because on the one hand he champions intergenerational equity—very rightly—whilst on the other hand he is a member of a party that has no qualms whatsoever in running up a significant fiscal burden for future generations when in government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To compound that error, Senator Sherry, either deliberately or through misunderstanding—I will be generous—continues to misrepresent our policy position on superannuation. Let me just take some of his comments on retirement savings accounts. In his speech Senator Sherry said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What an RSA seeks to do is discriminate between the banks and all other providers of superannuation products.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is not true. Banks will not be afforded special treatment. Institutions such as building societies, credit unions and life offices will also be able to offer RSAs. As Senator Sherry knows, the government has indicated, in fact, that it will allow all prudentially supervised
         <break page="2021" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          financial institutions—not just banks—to offer superannuation products. Senator Sherry also stated:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is no suggestion by the government that RSAs will be subject to similar prudential requirements as that set down for superannuation providers.
        </para>
        <para>
         Wrong. For his sake, I will reiterate the government's stated policy: RSAs will, Senator Sherry, be a superannuation product and, as such, they will be regulated by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. They will be subject to the same preservation rules and will be extended the preferential taxation treatment that is applied to superannuation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, as RSAs will only be offered by prudentially regulated financial institutions, one wonders whether Senator Sherry has concerns that the prudential regulation of the Reserve Bank is inferior to that set down for other superannuation providers. The government's entire superannuation policy reform agenda, including RSAs, will help ensure that the superannuation guarantee works much more effectively at providing improved retirement income for many thousands more Australians.

         —I thank Senator Patterson for that question because it does bring to mind, first of all, comments of a previous Prime Minister, Bob Hawke who said in the late 1980s, or perhaps early in 1990, that by the end of 1990 no child would live in poverty. That was a disgraceful commitment by the Prime Minister when he knew he could not live up to it. All the people opposite went along with that. They were happy to go along with the jingoistic approach to looking after young Australians in real distress.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In her remarks earlier today, Senator Newman highlighted the intellectual poverty of people opposite who are prepared to use groups in the community either in a scaremongering exercise or, in the case of the promise that no child would live in poverty by 1990, to unfairly raise the aspirations and hopes of these groups only to let them down—all in the name of the political advance of the party opposite and at the time all those people opposite were happy to go along with that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Coming back to the specifics of Senator Patterson's question, there are two things that the government is doing at the moment to address this question. First of all, the now Prime Minister gave a commitment in October 1995 that he would set up a youth homeless pilot program, and that was one of the first projects that the Prime Minister took on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A task force has been set up to oversee the development and operation of that pilot program. It has a number of major elements which include an enhanced role for community groups. They will be advising on the eligibility for longer&amp;hyphen;term income support. Of course, while the final decision will be left with the relevant government agency, there is a place for bringing community groups into this area and not leaving it entirely up to the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         government agency. As well, there will be an increased emphasis on early intervention and mediation and, wherever possible, reconciliation with family members.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Additionally, there is a commitment to improve the coordination between various state and Commonwealth agencies. There is no nationally even situation in that respect—some cooperation between states and the Commonwealth is better than others—but there is a general agreement that that area can be improved, without doubt. The pilots will be up and running by the end of this year and will make an important contribution to assisting the young homeless.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, a number of grants have recently been made to community organisations to fund projects which focus on early intervention and prevention strategies. For example, the YWCA has been funded to coordinate services in the inner&amp;hyphen;Sydney area. A very important project which will bring together service providers and, we hope, will improve servicing arrangements and the provision of information for young people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Youth SA in my own state has been funded to provide support for young people who are at risk of becoming entrenched in the juvenile justice system. That will work by the employment of youth development officers who will be based in police stations in areas of high youth unemployment and high rates of youth offenders.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A local drop&amp;hyphen;in centre will be established at Eden with a youth worker funded to try to build relationships with disadvantaged young Australians. There will also be a mobile service for western New South Wales so those people can get the advantage of some individual and family counselling. There will also be projects for two well&amp;hyphen;known researchers to develop strategies in a number of communities that have a high incidence of youth homelessness.
       </para>

         Where a taxpayer understates their taxable income and as such pays less tax than is required, the law provides for the imposition of both a penalty and interest component on the underpayment. The penalty is designed to address any culpability on the part of the taxpayer in underpaying tax. The Commissioner of Taxation has decided that where a taxpayer completes their own return and makes a genuine attempt to follow Tax Pack and its related publications, no culpability penalty should be imposed.

        The Commission of Audit has recommended we do that on at least a six&amp;hyphen;monthly basis regarding both income and expenditure streams, and the recommendation for forward estimates is at least every three years.

        The important principle is that we make sure there is openness and transparency in government accounts. Amongst other things, that means separating out capital accounts from operating accounts so we do not mix up the sale or purchase of your house with the groceries, which is what in fact the previous government was doing. It tried to mislead and confuse the Australian community as to the true state of the Commonwealth's finances by including loan repayments from the state of Victoria plus asset sales by the Commonwealth in its claim that the Commonwealth was in fact running a budget surplus. It did that in May last year and again in December last year with claims to the Australian community that it was actually running a surplus, but we now know the facts of the matter.

        The ABS in fact said, in the No. 1 statement to the budget papers in May last year—right over at the back of the budget papers—that the Commonwealth was running a budget deficit of $8.3 billion. And what did the Treasury announce in March this year after we came into government? We learned that the true underlying deficit is in fact $9 billion. This is despite all the claims made by the government of the day during the election campaign that they were actually running a surplus, and it was despite the fact they refused to put the numbers into the public arena so the community could judge for themselves and see what was the true state of

        So, in speeches this time last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) committed us to bringing in a charter for budget honesty which means that we will publish, on a six&amp;hyphen;monthly basis, the state of the books—revenue and expenses, and capital as well as operating expenses. Also, during the election campaign, the Prime Minister committed us to locking into legislation to ensure that the same sorts of numbers will have to be produced when an election is called so that there can be no argument as to what is the true state of the books.

        Senators opposite and the previous government stand condemned for their attempt last year to fool the Australian community about the true state of the books.

That is why we are committed to putting into statute a charter for budget honesty.

         —I am pleased that we are taking note of Senator Short's answer in respect of the National Commission of Audit, particularly in regard to the charter of budget honesty. Senator Gibson ranged widely in his contribution in this regard. Through you, Madam Deputy President, in respect to honesty, I pose a question to Senator Gibson who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. It will be fascinating to see if the government releases the April forward estimates. Senator Gibson, that is a direct challenge for you to take back to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in respect of charters of budget honesty.

        What is interesting about the process that the government has just been through with this National Commission of Audit and what we should be noting is that the general terms of reference contain a request to examine a charter of budget honesty, associated recommendations and possible legislation. Those terms of reference were drawn up by the government. If we look at the letter in the

Why on earth Senator Newman was not consulted in respect of the terms of reference for the benchmarking level for aged pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, I do not know. The fact that she was not consulted is certainly a poor reflection on Senator Newman.

There was no opportunity for the press to question the Treasurer.

Thanks for drawing it to the attention of the Senate and the gathered media, Senator Watson. The brief that Senator Short had in front of him was courtesy of Senator Watson.

         —The government will not run a mile from this charter of budget honesty. That was the essential issue raised by my colleague Senator Gibson. Senator Gibson confined his remarks to the response given by Senator Short—and a very good answer it was. Senator Sherry, you are the one who ranged widely. It does give the government the opportunity to outline some of those areas where the previous Labor government year after year fiddled the budget figures.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What were the essential aspects of that fiddling? There was a failure to distinguish between capital items and revenue items. Every good accountant knows that in a profit and loss statement you attribute your expense items to those elements that are going to be expired within the period under review, generally the 12&amp;hyphen;month period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I wish to use this debate to outline some of the various devices used by the previous government? You might recall, Senator Sherry, that on 22 May 1996, in an adjournment speech, I drew attention to a whole range of the various fiddles, including the failure to distinguish between capital and revenue items. But it was not limited to a failure only to distinguish between capital and income receipts and outlays. Senator Sherry,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         you are well aware of the devices which include bringing forward tax payments to artificially reduce the deficit. The best example would be in the HECS area. There is also the underestimating of the time that major asset sales would take. This allows the revenue from the sale of an asset to appear in several years accounts, not just the one.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another device is taking liberties with the receipts from public enterprises by classifying them as dividends or debt repayments, depending on what suits the bottom line. There are examples in Telstra and Australia Post. Madam Deputy President, these are just a few methods of deceiving everybody in the electorate in the budget presentation. It was interesting that a professor from the School of Economics and Finance at Queensland University, Professor Robinson, articulated very clearly some of these deceptions. He did it in one of the prestigious and widely read journals of the accounting community, the journal of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As all true accountants know—this was written for them—you must distinguish, as I mentioned earlier, between capital items and revenue receipts. When you make a profit for a particular year on a revenue account, you do not include capital items. This has been the big problem with the budget. We mix up everything and put it together in an unholy amalgam. This unholy amalgam is presented in such a way that it does not present a clear picture. When auditors of public companies present their report, they say that it represents a true and correct view of the state of the company's affairs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to note that the Auditor-General never puts his signature to the budget deficit. Does it present a true and correct view? It might be an interesting addition to the Commission of Audit's inquiries in relation to budget honesty to ask the Auditor-General to put his name on it, thereby confirming whether that budget statement represents a correct view and whether the issues have been classified according to normal accounting parlance. I would recommend this as a further measure to bring back greater honesty, disclosure and meaning to the budget

         figures. We can then get away from the concept, held by previous Labor administrations, of hiding the true light and correct position. This great recommendation should be added to the Commission of Audit's recommendations in this charter for budget honesty, which I support.

If you look at the various tables of revenue and expenditure, the various dissections that occur there, we find in some detail—I think commendable detail in terms of the figures that are outlined—the list of `unfunded' superannuation liabilities.

         On the issue of unfunded superannuation liabilities for the public sector, it is important to note that the Labor government did initiate some important reforms in respect of public sector superannuation. The first change we made—and these are not necessarily in chron ological order—separated a number of financial institutions, such as Telstra, and ensured that they fully funded their own superannuation. There are about 100,000 people employed in those areas—or maybe a few more. So we did separate for the purposes of superannuation a considerable portion of the Public Service superannuation payroll and we ensured that their superannuation was fully funded. That is one change we made during our term in government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second change we made was to close down the old Commonwealth superannuation fund—that is detailed here in the appendix—and to introduce a new fund. We also introduced the superannuation guarantee—and I am not going to go into the details of that in the Senate chamber today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A great deal has been made about the approximately $74 billion in unfunded superannuation liabilities for pension payments to public servants in either a lump sum or in a pension or annuity form. Part of the point in asking the question which Senator Short did not answer was: if we are to accept that superannuation is a liability in that way, why did not the Commission of Audit examine pensions in the same way? Just as superannuation is paid off the budget to former public servants and it is paid out of general budget revenue in the main—overwhelmingly, public sector superannuation is funded off the budget—why should we not treat pension payments, that again are funded totally off the budget from revenue, the same?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That was the point that I was hoping Senator Short would recognise. I was hoping he would inform us why the Commission of Audit did not treat pensions in the same way or at least make some reference to it.

        I noticed that Senator Short had a speech I made last week drawn to his attention and he publicised it through the Senate and to the media. Thank you very much for that, Senator Short. I am very pleased for all the promotional efforts you have been making. I am not so sure you will be pleased with the promotion you have been getting as a consequence of question time as a result of the opposition's efforts.

         I want to make the point that the unfunded superannuation for public servants in this country has been accruing for over 50 years and it is not as a consequence of 13 years of Labor government. Let us be honest about it, Senator Short, it is a consequence of a succession of governments in this country.

         —Having briefly looked at the National Commission of Audit report, I notice that it does acknowledge, Senator Sherry, the need for further research. It goes so far as to recommend improvements in national savings. For example, on national savings the report states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The government should undertake a comprehensive review of options for improving the contribution of household saving to national saving, including in the area of superannuation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        This review should entail a full review of tax and social security arrangements in terms of how they affect incentives to save. The review should also examine options for addressing the private saving offset problem and other options for stimulating private saving . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to say—and I will elaborate on each of these in a moment—that further research is needed. It states under the heading `Further research':
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At this stage there is considerable uncertainty about the long term outlook for retirement incomes and, more specifically, the impact of compulsory superannuation. Much of this uncertainty cannot be avoided. However, it is probable that the community has yet to fully respond to the more recent superannuation reforms and therefore the data available upon which to project the impact of those reforms has been very limited. Given the importance of national saving trends to long term government economic and fiscal management, there appears to be scope and justification for continued work in retirement income data gathering and modelling to reduce this uncertainty.

        The Commission notes the advances made to analysis of retirement income trends and policies by the RIM Task Force but considers this work incomplete, particularly in the analysis of private saving offsets to superannuation . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        So in a sense, the report of the National Commission of Audit, which was given recently to the government, acknowledges the difficulties and acknowledges that there must be further work in this area.

         I think one of the problems, as you well know, Senator Sherry, is that nowadays we are really expecting too much of superannuation. We are having people wanting to use superannuation for all sorts of purposes, such as for deposits on houses, for education and for all these sorts of things.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What really is needed is an extension of the savings vehicles that are permitted within Australia. Perhaps our superannuation committee, Senator Sherry, may well look into other forms of savings that would complement superannuation. This would relieve a lot of pressure by requiring so many things which are not really commensurate with this concept of superannuation to be picked up by savings products other than superannuation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As we all know, with superannuation you must start contributing early and saving over that very long period of about 40 years to have any hope of getting the income needed to provide for the normal requirements in retirement—certainly to provide above the current level of the age pension. This is a prime requirement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps we should move away from the concept of unfunded government superannuation liabilities. The sooner governments start funding liabilities, putting moneys aside and building up reserves, the sounder the finances of the Australian nation will be. The concept of unfunded superannuation contributions has been a problem for many years. Without funding, it makes nonsense of the concept of true accrual accounting.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For every entity, whether it be a government entity, a public organisation or private enterprise, the entity should allocate all the expenses attributable to that period. Those expenses include a portion of long service leave and superannuation as they build up during the period under review. Provision should be made for each of these components of cost. The best way to make these provision is to set the money aside in some form of trust fund or vehicle where it can be invested and earning interest.

         —Pursuant to standing order 81 Senator Murphy, by letters dated 17 and 24 June 1996, raised with the President a matter of privilege and asked that he make a determination on the matter under that standing order. Senator Murphy, as former chair of the Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases, has received submissions which allege that deliberately misleading evidence was given to that committee. The submissions state that the existence of certain documents was deliberately concealed from the committee when evidence was given relating to the existence of the documents.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Normally, the committee concerned would investigate any such suggestion, but in this case the committee ceased to exist after the presentation of its final report. As past cases and reports of the Privileges Committee indicate, the Senate has always taken very seriously any allegation that deliberately misleading evidence has been given in the course of a Senate inquiry.

The President has therefore determined that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence.

           wish to make a comment concerning the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. This bill that has come about, as I understand it, because of a recent decision in Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission v. the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Because of a conflict between section 256 of the Migration Act and paragraph 26B of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, the government's hands are tied in relation to dealing with a type other than was intended when dealing with illegal entries.
          </break>
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's position is that we have a responsibility to enforce the immigration laws pursuant to the Migration Act. As I said, the interpretation of this demonstrates an unintended consequence. Therefore, the government has an obligation to remove as quickly as possible that unintended consequence, thus permitting the continued timely removal of current unauthorised arrivals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The decision in that case was only very recently handed down, and the government has expeditiously sought the passage of an amending bill to overcome the problem. That bill has been introduced into the Senate, and the Senate wishes the bill to be examined by a Senate committee through our reference of bills to committee process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst we do not object to that process, as this is the last sitting week and as this unintended consequence is likely to apply to a large number of new cases before the parliament sits again, we would hope that the Senate committee could consider this matter during the course of this week. I would suggest to the committee chairman that Wednesday night might be a good night to listen to the human rights arguments and to put down the government's concerns, with the objective being that the committee would report before the end of the week and the Senate would still have time to consider the bill during this last week of sittings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Although the committee has as its reference day the first day of the next sitting, I understand that has always been interpreted in the past as being on or before that day. In this instance, the government is anxious that it be
         <break page="2037" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          interpreted as being before that day, provided the committee can give the matter proper consideration this week and the chamber can still deal with it this week.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These very urgent matters do arise from time to time. Although it may not allow the Senate the length of deliberation that it requires in normal circumstances, the Senate has nevertheless usually accepted that, in exceptional circumstances, the processes should fit the time available. We will ensure that those witnesses who should be heard do get the opportunity to be heard during this week.

          —by leave—I accept what the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) has said and I thank him for agreeing that the Selection of Bills Committee process is one that we should continue to carry out in the same way. I must put the Democrats' view on what he said about having a hearing on Wednesday night.

        <para first-indent="16">
         First of all, I would hope the hearing that the legislative committee has on this is one which all the witnesses who would like to attend are able to attend. We should keep in mind that this bill was introduced into this house of parliament—it has not been introduced into the House of Representatives yet—and the first we saw of it was quite late on Thursday night of last week. I would be very upset—and I am sure the rest of the Democrats would feel the same—if all of the witnesses who wanted to be heard could not be heard because the hearing was held at a time which was not convenient to them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not believe—and I know this is going to the substance of the bill, but Senator Hill did the same during his speech—that our immigration programs will be thrown into chaos if this bill is not considered by a committee before 20 August. Only 15 per cent of all illegal immigrants ever go to court. I cannot imagine that this consequence—even if the government does believe it to be unintended; we certainly do not believe on our part that it is unintended—and this amending bill will cause any more chaos to our immigration programs than is already the case.

         The content of this report should concern all senators. Unfortunately, we do not know the outcome of the further indications from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) with respect to the Senate budget but this report, specifically the comments on the budget allocation to the operations of the Senate, is deeply disturbing.

         The report mentions under the heading `Budget 1996-97' on page 3 that the two per cent efficiency dividends—one per cent in 1995-96 and another one per cent in 1996&amp;hyphen;97—have been absorbed over the past five years. On top of that, there was an additional two per cent reduction in the 1995-96 budget.

          The President has been asked by the finance minister to absorb in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 a further two per cent reduction in running costs. That amounts to a $623,000 reduction in the operational budget of the Senate. On top of that, the President and Speaker have been asked to find a further $10 million in savings, of which the Senate's component is approxi mately $500,000, in a year. That brings the total reductions in Senate funding in one year to $1,123,000—approximately a seven per cent to eight per cent reduction.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a massive reduction in Senate appropriations. If we look through the budget that is proposed for the operations of the Senate, we find many areas of operation of the Senate will be affected. To name just a few, the staff development budget is to be reduced by 50 per cent; various staffing arrangements of parliament, including parliamentary committees, are to be significantly affected; and the installation of computers for senators and their staff is to be affected. They are just a few areas which are to be affected by reductions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report goes on and makes it very clear that the reductions, particularly for the committee structure of the Senate, will without doubt affect the operations of the committee system—the legislative, the general purpose and the select committee structure. It also refers to a breaking of an agreement with the President by the finance minister in respect of how Senate committees are funded. Where has this come from? Where has the approach of the finance minister, Mr Fahey, come from? It has come from the Expenditure Review Committee.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Page 5 of the report makes it very clear that the committee was informed by the Department of Finance on 14 June that the proposals on expenditure had been rejected by the Expenditure Review Committee. Some $866,000 has been severely reduced as a consequence of the approach of the Expenditure Review Committee. Who is on the Expenditure Review Committee? I will not run through the membership of it, but it is the executive government. What we have here is the executive cutting back the funding of the Senate, particularly the Senate committees—the legislative, general purpose and select committees.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is true that when we were in government we certainly had complaints about the number of select committees running rampant around the country. I think at one stage we had six or seven operating at once. There were arguments about funding, but we never attempted
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to throttle or gut the committee system of the Senate by breaking a pre-existing agreement and by rolling back the budget of the Senate by over $1 million. This will have very severe consequences for the operation of this place, particularly for our committee system.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The operation of the Senate is going to be substantially affected. The government should not complain if legislation takes longer to move through the committee system than would normally be expected. How can the government scream, shout and complain about obstruction—and there is no obstruction in our approach to the government's program—when the committees are not funded adequately? How can the committees do their job when there is not sufficient money to examine the government's legislation?

         What we have here is an example of the government creating a bottleneck by slashing the funding of the committee structure of the Senate. Do not complain if committees take longer to consider the government's legislative program than would otherwise normally be expected when we have a cutback of more than $1 million in the operations of the Senate—particularly as it applies in a range of areas to the committee system and when we have the breaking of an agreement by the finance minister and his department on instructions from the ERC.

         Clearly the Expenditure Review Committee is attempting to throttle and restrict the work of the Senate and particularly its committees. It is creating a problem that it will have to address. It certainly cannot complain if legislation takes longer to move through the committee system than is the norm as a direct result of the cutbacks in select committee and general staff funding that are outlined in what is quite a horrific budget for this Senate; it is a horrific budget to have to face up to. I was pleased to see at the two meetings of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, which I attended, that all senators present, including government senators, expressed their extreme concern with what is proposed in the budget for this place.

         If anybody is assuming that we are being asked to make `efficiency cuts', they should ask, `What is the definition of efficiency?' My definition of efficiency is that you are able to do the job you are required to do by using fewer resources. Then you have to ask, `Has the Senate got less work?' No. In fact as time goes on the Senate is being asked to deal with more and more pieces of legislation which often have great complexities.

We have done the things we are supposed to do in the normal way, but there is no more money so we have to stop this inquiry.' What sort of democracy is this? What right, under the constitution, does a new government have to say, `You have been elected as senators. You have this much work to do. This is what the community expects you to do, but we are not going to let you do it. We are going to slow down the process. Each committee will handle fewer inquiries—that is the inevitable aspect of providing fewer resources—and then we are going to blame you if the work is not completed on time.'

Basically, you are saying to the people in the small parties, who cannot pick and choose the representatives they want at those estimates committees, that they either miss out on a part of the estimates if they need a cup of tea or biscuit to survive until 11.30 at night or they do without.

I do not think it is possible for the Senate to avoid participating in the cost cutting exercise that the current government is undertaking. It would be most unfair for the Senate to be exempted when every other department in government is required to contribute to a savings program. However, there are some very strange aspects to the way this has been approached. I do not allege a conspiracy by the government to try to stitch up the Senate. This has been driven from elsewhere.

         There are three lots of cuts coming into the Senate's budget in the next financial year. The first is the $10 million cut to parliamentary departments, which, in a budget of $120 million, is quite severe—almost of ABC proportions one suspects. It is in the order of a seven or eight per cent cut off the top. That is going to have quite a lot of ramifications around this building.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A lot of the cuts will relate to equipment replacement and maintenance. This means that we will build problems over the long term. Equipment, such as the cameras filming everyone in here, the sound system and the airconditioning system, will break down. They will gradually run down given the effects of those cuts. It is a requirement on the Senate to at least contribute half a million dollars of its usual budget of around $23 million or $24 million to that process. It is an election promise that you can say the government is keeping.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The second cut is a cut of two per cent to running costs. This affects the Department of the Senate as severely as any other depart ment because all the expenditure for the Department of the Senate, bar a couple of minor items, are running costs. If you were to apply a two per cent cut to a lot of other departments, you might affect only 30, 40 or 50 per cent of their total budgets. Basically, this two per cent cut is to 100 per cent of the expenditure of the Department of the Senate. Furthermore, it comes on top of a one per cent efficiency dividend operating since 1991, a special levy in the last budget, and other cuts that the Department of the Senate has had to incorporate into its budget process over the last five years.

But I think it is inevitable that the Senate will put forward $500,000 as part of the $10 million cut. I also think it is inevitable that the two per cent cut to running costs will go ahead.

         This matter really comes down to a question of funding the committee system, a matter which has been subject to debate in this chamber on many occasions with many accusations being made. The real story is that agreements were forged last year after a long series of disagreements between the then Minister for Finance and the Senate department. Essentially, that agreement allocated two half&amp;hyphen;million dollar blocks to the committee system.

I am sure that a lot of those schemes will be knocked back again but the Department of Finance, this driving force, wants to cut parliamentary departments as much as it can.

         The argument comes down to this: this is new policy; if you want that extra $1 million, you will have to find offsetting savings. On top of a one per cent efficiency dividend and a special two per cent cut to running costs, in order to find that $1 million you will need to put another eight or nine per cent cut on running costs. No&amp;hyphen;one would argue that you should be suffering so with running costs, with cuts of 12 to 14 per cent over a couple of years. That would be an absolute joke.

If we are going to have a federal parliament, surely the most central function it has is to act like a parliament. If you look at the constitution, of the first 80 sections 60 are devoted to the parliament, 10 to the executive and 10 to the judiciary. I see Kim Rubenstein up the gallery. She is a very eminent academic from the University of Melbourne—a most august body with a most august law school.

          Certainly, I am not saying that there should not be cuts to the Department of the Senate, but those cuts should be determined by the Senate itself. There is concern about the way democracy is going and that concern has been expressed by very eminent people. One, for example, is the present Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Gerard Brennan, who, in the Blackburn lecture in August 1990, had this to say:

          Apart from legislative debates, Parliament's continuing contribution to democracy is its holding of the Executive to public accountability.

There is the press of the fact that we are members of parties. In respect of two of those parties, they take it in turns, as it were, to form the government of this country. Once you form the government of the country, there is great pressure to fall in with the proper demands of the executive.

         This is a very important report because it demonstrates an extraordinary lack in management, certainly by previous governments, of this vital problem of environmental management of Commonwealth land, particularly site contamination and pollution prevention. The intriguing thing that emerges from this is that there is no central land managing authority in the Commonwealth. Land management responsibility is vested in a whole range of Commonwealth entities, particularly the Depart
         <break page="2045" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          ment of Defence, which has many unexploded ordnance problems around, but also the Department of Administrative Services, each individual government business enterprise and some particular statutory authorities. There are national parks and the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, particularly dealing with Australia's external territories.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The lack of such a central body in charge of this problem means that a range of problems, from disastrous to moderate, have emerged in some of these potential arrangements for disposal. There is a very large amount of money involved here. For example, we keep on hearing about the previous government selling off the farm, but one of the interesting things about the previous government was that, in the three years from December 1992 to December 1995, returns to the budget from flogging 792 federal government properties exceeded $440 million. From the audit report I am not quite certain whether that includes returns to GBEs which did not in fact involve a specific benefit to the budget, but there is no doubt that some of these GBEs did raise quite an amount of money.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also noted in the audit report that most of the GBEs did not appear to have any particular guidelines about how they should perform when disposing of contaminated land. The Audit Office found in its report that:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . departmental oversight of GBEs' performance in terms of managing environmental risks is patchy and inconsistent. For example, while Telstra has clear guidelines as to the Government's expectations on environmental performance, other entities such as Australia Post and Australian National do not. Australian National in particular has major contamination problems with some of its sites. The ANAO found that these departments could become more proactive in oversighting environmental issues (including site contamination and pollution issues) of the GBEs within their portfolios. The benefits of a more proactive position relate to the achievement of Government environmental policy and financial objectives for GBEs.
        </para>
        <para>
         One of the problems is that, even with those GBEs that do have clear guidelines as to government expectations on environmental performance, they do not necessarily live up to them. In Sydney I have heard of examples where Telstra has disposed of local properties
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          which in fact have had enormous contamination problems resulting in at least one incident I know of when the sale had to be cancelled.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I suppose there is a balance. The question is to what extent do you constrain these organisations very severely without in fact severely damaging their capacity to raise appropriate amounts of money. The Audit Office, being involved with money, found that:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . strategic oversight mechanisms were needed to ensure that the real value of the Commonwealth's assets is maintained; current administrative arrangements do not encourage entities to be fully accountable for their environmental performance.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think that is a very significant point that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General has made. I must say that I hope the new government responds to that need in a way that the previous government, over 13 years, did not adequately do. In this context, I read on from the report:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In relation to the estate which AEM managed directly, the ANAO found that AEM was seeking to meet State legislative requirements in relation to known site contamination problems. However, in the absence of a systematic environmental risk assessment, the ANAO considers that AEM was not in a position to assess the full extent of contamination and potential pollution risks of its estate.
        </para>
        <para>
         I know this is a problem because there are state laws and these are federal bodies, but it really looks as though something much more positive should be done than has been done over the last 13 years. The audit report says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AEM was not as advanced in assessing its environmental risks as some other agencies audited. However, AEM indicated that it intended to commence a contamination risk assessment of its estate during 1996&amp;hyphen;97.
        </para>
        <para>
         This seems to me to be a very delayed reaction to the sorts of problems we have known have existed for quite some time. The report continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANAO also found that property managers at seven of AEM's regional offices had not received any recent training on environmental issues and site contamination information was not collected on a regular basis to assist land management decisions.
        </para>
        <para>
         Clearly this is a serious problem.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Despite being under consideration since 1993 by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (EPA), there is no specific Commonwealth legislation or formal policy to guide Commonwealth land management entities in tackling environmental matters such as pollution prevention and site contamination. As a consequence, environmental management is afforded a low priority and is often an afterthought dealt with when sites are scheduled for sale. The ANAO notes that the

On page 23 there is a picture which is of particular concern to me. We can see used drums stored in the open on an air force base. Quite clearly visible on the side of one of the drums is `PCB'. There are drums on their sides, some of which are rusting, used for the storage of PCBs. It would not be acceptable anywhere.

         When the Audit Office conducts reviews, they usually have to base their audit on required standards or guidelines. As mentioned, there is no specific Commonwealth legislation or formal policy to guide Commonwealth land management entities. The
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          necessity for such a policy becomes even more important when we consider the level of privatisation and development over the last few years of government business enterprises. Those business enterprises are often asked to pull a profit when playing a government role in buying and selling land. However, often they have not been involved with such things before—for example, the Department of Defence. Then there are longstanding problems with land if there is contamination or, in the case of defence, unexploded ordnances. But without any clear guidelines, lots of these decisions are made when spurred by information that the community is able to obtain or when concerns are expressed.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Senate would clearly recall my concerns about the land at St Marys in western Sydney where you have the whole kit and caboodle—a water problem, nitrification, endangered flora and fauna species and contamination caused by unexploded ordnances. Basically, when a government enterprise is operating on a commercial basis and at the same time has a long&amp;hyphen;running exemption from state and federal laws, whatever happens tends to be selective. That is not good enough, and it is certainly not a good enough standard for the Commonwealth to set.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some of the recommendations are not very clear—for example, the development of a proposal for consideration by ministers to clarify the Commonwealth's policy position on contaminated sites. In regard to the recommendation that there be a commitment from land management entities to administer pollution prevention, detection and remediation, it is no good having rules if nobody is going to enforce them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="2047" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          Another recommendation is that there be a more proactive approach to oversighting the environmental performance of government business enterprises where there may be high financial or environmental risks. If you want to make money from a land sale, you do not then sweep things under the carpet. For example, senators may remember the questions I asked about why the St Marys site was not available for the western Sydney biodiversity survey. Answer: there is no reason except the fact that Australian Defence Indus tries would not allow the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service to conduct the survey. No reason was given. There were indications of endangered flora and fauna species on the site that needed to be looked at more carefully and the western Sydney biodiversity survey wanted to look at what environmental resources existed in western Sydney. But ADI said, `No, you can't look at this area.'

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I go back to the list of recommendations. The list includes: a commitment from Commonwealth land management entities to have full regard to state and territory environmental regulations—yes, and it is long overdue; more strategic and timely identification of the impact of environmental issues on the Commonwealth disposal program; consideration of introducing independent auditing of environmental performance to protect the value of Commonwealth land assets; and a demonstrable commitment to protecting the environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         People around Australia will be stunned to think that the Commonwealth, whose main environmental efforts tend to be to exhort other people to do better, is not doing a good job with its own properties; is using its exemptions from state and federal laws to make commercial decisions; and is using exemptions under commercial in confidence provisions for its government business enterprises not to be accountable to the parliamentary process. People will know how that has been the case, based on the questions that I have asked on a number of occasions.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is simply not good enough. I am very keen to see the response to this by government departments. But it really is not up to government departments: it is up to the government and the parliamentary process to institute these changes and to make sure that they are properly enforced.

         It is important to maintain a degree of balance about this report. There are some pretty nasty pictures there. But looking at more industrialised countries like the United States and Europe, their problems, purely as a consequence of higher density populations, are far worse than any we face. Some of those, I would think, are quite irremedial, whereas ours, I believe, are all remedial if we have the will, which I hope we do.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The stories coming out of pollution behind the Iron Curtain countries in Eastern Europe, particularly in some of their defence facilities, are really quite horrendous and far beyond any scale that exists in Australia. Looking at some of the problems of the former Soviet empire, for example, the Kola Peninsula, with their nuclear weapons, particularly their nuclear submarines, the mind boggles that those can ever be cleaned up. But I do think the problem is manageable in Australia if we turn our minds to it and I believe it is a matter of urgency that we should do so.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The particular part of the report I wish to refer to is the section on unexploded ordnance because my own state of  Queensland is by far and away the worst affected state in Australia. On page 40 of this report there is a table listing the unexploded ordnance sites in Australia. Queensland is listed with 403 sites that have been identified. That may not be the maximum figure; it may well be higher than that. New South Wales is next with 169 and a total of just over 1,000 sites are identified around Australia. So Queensland, very roughly, has about half the sites that have been recorded so far. That is not surprising because Queensland was the major training ground, particularly for land forces, through the Second World War when most of this pollution occurred. It is very easy today for someone who was not alive at that time to look back and think there was a great degree of negligence about at that time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But it must be remembered that at that time the population of Australia was about seven million. We were facing a desperate attack on
         <break page="2048" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          our own homeland by Japan and there was not the culture of concern for the environment 50 or 60 years ago that exists today. There was a great urgency to train and prepare. There were relatively huge numbers: probably five divisions of the Australian military forces training in Queensland and over a quarter of a million Americans passed through Queensland in that period from 1942 to 1945.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there was a great deal of live ammunition used in training. The general ethos was that if there was no&amp;hyphen;one around to be harmed by the blast, if it was an open part of the countryside with no habitation and there was a camp nearby, it was used as a training range. The consequence is that records are poor or non&amp;hyphen;existent in some cases. Lest you think that was purely a matter of the Second World War, let me say that I can remember as a small boy going to a brigade training exercise behind the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. The air force was bombing onto the sand dunes and the army was firing from Noosaville with 25&amp;hyphen;pounders into an impact area on the beach somewhere behind Peregian. That had been a training area from the Second World War through to certainly the early part of the 1950s and, I suspect, into the middle of the 1950s.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In all those cases there was not any monitoring of the fall of shot as there is today when firing artillery to make sure all the blinds are detected, sought out afterwards and detonated. The consequence is that there are these areas where old munitions exist. Old munitions are extremely dangerous. The explosive often becomes unstable with age and the munitions are often not recognisable as such—because of the corrosion and the exposure to the elements—by children seeking things to play with. In real estate developments, excavators and bulldozers could easily disturb something. So we do have a real problem. The liability of the Commonwealth is a bit obscure as paragraph 3.50 on page 40 of the report states:

However, as noted in legal advice obtained by the ANAO, the Commonwealth's legal liability depends on the circumstances of each particular case. At the end of World War II, compensation was paid to some land owners at the time for damage to property caused during the occupation. In other cases no record of compensation can be found at all.

        </para>
        <para>
         The problem is made complex again by the existence of state legislation. It is a plausible argument in some cases that the problem is more a state matter than a Commonwealth matter. The problem is now rearing itself in Queensland, and has for the last several years, as urban development takes place in areas that were formerly remote. There are great arguments running as to who should pick up the tab for cleaning up those sites.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The state government in Queensland has been particularly reluctant to buy into it. The Commonwealth, if it never owned the land or had sold the land and had paid compensation to the previous owners, quite rightly said, `We paid compensation for it and the owners bought this land at a discounted price and with full knowledge that the land was contaminated.' The fact that that might have been 20 or 30 years ago and the purchaser today may be three or four down the chain, is not aware or does not recognise the history, is another matter again as far as the Commonwealth's liability is concerned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not have time today to go into the legal arguments. All I will say is that we have been lucky to have had so few deaths from unexploded ordnance upon these sites. I do not think the sites are heavily infested with unexploded ordnance but there is certainly some ordnance there—and it has to be cleaned up. The role of the Commonwealth, as I see it, is to move in in a coordinating role, assign responsibilities to various people and put a scheme in place so that these areas are cleaned up because all these areas are going to be used by Australian citizens for development in some way in the foreseeable future.

           fact that I am pleased to see that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General has highlighted the problems that we identified not so long ago.

         On our inspection we were told that it was going to cost something like $400,000. In the next report the sum was creeping up towards a million dollars and then, with very little prompting, they said it could go as high as $15 million. This kept rolling on until they suggested something like $30 million. In this report it says $50 million but it looked as though it could have gone to $100 million if we had not said, `Hang on a minute.' It was open ended. There was no policy or knowledge. They had a steam cleaning arrangement on site that was supposed to be cleaning up the soil where there were remnants of TNT. We were concerned as a committee—not that we did not believe the advice we had been given—about the escalation in costs. Through our committee—and it shows the advantages of the committee system—we employed a private consultant who made the point of asking, `How far do you go with some of these suspected contaminants in the soil?'

         We looked at a couple of sites where a lot of work had been done in this area of so-called toxins. This consultant said, `How far can you go in these things? You could go into the backyard of someone who has been growing brussels sprouts and cabbages and find just as much toxin in the ground from them as you would from this contaminant. It is a question of degree.' Given the escalating costs and what was developing, we recommended that things be put on hold until we were satisfied that there was better knowledge of what was going on and some more direction from the powers that be.

Briefly, graphite rods are inserted into the pits where remnants of the plutonium and uranium remain along with steel and other material that was left over from the Maralinga tests. High voltage is generated into the soil. The result is that the soil, and hopefully everything else, turns to glass.

I have great concerns about the decontamination, as has the Auditor-General. I hope that we can get some clear policy directions on it in the near future.

It was one of the more thorough inquiries I have seen since my time in the Senate. Therefore, I would say the Aboriginal community is well aware of these proposed amendments. One amendment in particular, the question of vesting land in individuals, attracted a lot of attention.

The ILC would then have to change tack, as it were—not dramatically so but, nonetheless, it would have to change tack—in how it looks at certain things; for instance, in the granting of land or in the maintaining of land which has been granted to individuals. That is a departure from the current regime under which the ILC has to work.

       I might refresh people's memories of this. The bill we are considering at the moment contains aspects of the land fund bill which were passed by the Senate and then abandoned when they came back from the House of Representatives as a potential double dissolution trigger. At that time, Mr Howard in his previous role as the Leader of the Opposition announced that he would reintroduce the bill. I believe it would have been a dereliction of duty if we had not seen the bill reintroduced at this point in the proceedings of this parliament. However, people also know that I am committed to the idea of the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion as `introduce one session, debate the next to allow for consultation'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I feel there has not been sufficient opportunity to allow for consultation on the matters that are contained within this bill. It may have been another matter if this bill had been introduced in the first week of the session and was due to come up for debate in the last week of the session. I feel the matters are somewhat similar, but they are not identical. I think that is the sticking point which I have.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that Aboriginal communities which gave very considerable support to some of these measures when they were canvassed for their views by the two land fund committees that were looking at these areas may well have changed their view in the light of the months of operation of the ILC under its present arrangements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An argument in support of that is that we are not seeing here a bill that contains the complete list of identical amendments as voted up in the Senate; we are seeing quite a number of changes. That is because circumstances have changed. Whereas I would have liked to have seen the extra $3 million for administration committed to the ILC to allow its operation not to intrude upon the amount that was available in terms of funding for acquisition and management, that is no longer in the bill. It is not there because—my understanding is—the ILC has notified the present government that it does not need that additional money for administrative costs. I find that amazing, but it is an illustration that the government too, because of its concerns about budget funding, et cetera, has, I think with relief, accepted that from the ILC very readily. That illustrates that matters have changed since the time this bill was passed in the Senate and then returned again following rejection.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe there has not been sufficient time between the introduction of this bill on Thursday last and today to debate it, having exempted it from the consultation that it deserves with the Aboriginal community. I think one of the unstated reasons for its urgency is that this is my last week in the Senate. The government would have been fairly confident that the items within that bill would have my support, and they would be right. I do not have queries with the content
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of the bill; but that is not the point. It would be blatantly hypocritical of me, having spent a lot of my time defending the cut-off motion as being democratic in its nature, to say that some bill that I particularly supported should come up for the simple reason that I would be able to vote for it.

        So, while I do support most of the measures within that bill and express regret that I cannot agree to its exemption, I do not think there is any way in which I could agree to its not being laid aside in the Senate, having been introduced. I welcome its introduction. As I said before, the coalition would have been able to be criticised quite severely if it had not introduced it in this session. I welcome its introduction but I do not support the urgency of its being considered this week, in spite of the pleas made to me by Senator Ellison. I believe that the Aboriginal community should be consulted to see whether these measures are still measures which they would like introduced. If they are, I believe this chamber should give that due consideration and support it when it is appropriate.

        —The Democrats will not be supporting this exemption either, but we did support the exemption for the bill which relates to the ATSIC election being held in October. We thought the government made a reasonable case for why we should consider that bill now. I am mindful of what has been said by previous speakers. I agree with much of what has been said. There are changes in this bill, and those changes require consultation.

       This really has come quickly upon us. We have not been appropriately warned ourselves, let alone Aboriginal communities, about the timing of the introduction of this bill. While we have been prepared to look at each bill on its merits, there is such a difference between what is proposed in the ATSIC bill No. 1 and in this bill that we cannot proceed hastily without being able to go back and ask Aboriginal communities, and the Senate, what they think about the changes between the first debate here, the committee stage, the Senate select committee, and the revisited recommendations of the Senate select committee.

        —I briefly put on the record my abject disappointment at the position taken by the opposition parties, but particularly the Greens. I must say, I was shocked to hear that this would not receive an exemption. When Senator Chamarette asked Senator Herron a question a fortnight ago about where this legislation was Senator Chamarette, either by way of interjection or by way of taking note—I do not recall just what it was—actually suggested to the Senate that this bill would not require an exemption. I think at some stage Senator Herron in his answer to Senator Chamarette during question time had said: `Why are you doing it? It does not need an exemption.' Today we have a different story.

       I think Senator Carr was probably not as closely involved in this debate. I know Senator Bob Collins, Senator Kernot, Senator Chamarette and Senator Ellison were very closely involved. It is absolute nonsense to say that there has not been consultation on this. I accept Senator Chamarette's view as one that certainly has some merit—to say that things might have changed in the last nine months on these issues. I suspect that in regard to the issues that are dealt with by this bill there would not have been any change at all because we have gone to the ones that circumstances have not changed. As I have said to Senator Chamarette privately, we went through the amendments that were listed in the select committee's report debated in this chamber. One of the amendments the Senate wanted was that the national strategy should be based on regional strategies. The majority of the Senate agreed that it should be a ground upwards process of determining a national strategy. The national strategy has been determined and tabled in this place. So clearly with that sort of amendment time has overtaken it. But Senator Herron, you will

        note, in his second reading speech said that we still think that principle is important and at the end of the review period we would still want to see whether or not the Senate majority was right in the first place and, indeed, the national strategies in future should be based on regional strategies. That is something I think a majority of senators would still agree on.

       Crucial to this is overcoming the most hypocritical and sad change that the previous government made to this legislation. We all recall that when the native title legislation was debated in this place a reason for the establishment of the land fund was that the preamble to the native title bill, as it was—act as it is now—stated that a land fund would be established because it recognised that only a very small number of people would be able to benefit from native title. This land fund would be to help those people who had been `most severely dispossessed', to paraphrase it.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Effectively, what the land fund legislation did by entirely ignoring that principle that was enshrined in the preamble—the preamble that I think Senator Kernot called a marvellous, beautiful and wonderful statement—was erase that entire concept from the Native Title Act. The land fund legislation erased a significant section of that preamble that Senator Kernot described as a pristine, beautiful and marvellous statement.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Part of this legislation that we are seeking to deal with today reinstates a part of that principle, and that is to ensure that those people suffering most disadvantage in relation to access to land be given preference. Of course that was a contentious issue. We took that issue around Australia. We went to 12 different centres around Australia. We certainly did not consult with every Aboriginal person, but I do know that we consulted with a lot more people in a lot more detail than the previous government ever did in relation to any of its acts.

       The concept of assisting those suffering most disadvantage in access to land was one that had actual general agreement—even the Peter Yus and the Noel Pearsons actually came up with this sort of wording to reach consensus at their crisis meeting. If you go

       The reason they opposed having it dealt with in the initial bill was that their position was quite a pragmatic one. When you are around Aboriginal affairs for a while—and I have only been around it for a little while—you do have to learn to be pragmatic and achieve what is achievable. Their view was, `We should get legislation; we do not want it held up.' They said, `Look, forget about all your amendments; you're holding up our bit of legislation that we need for  social justice reasons.' They were saying, `Good amendments, Senator Campbell; good amendments, coalition parties; good amendments, Senator Chamarette; but stop making so much fuss about them. Just get the damned legislation through the Senate.' That was the approach.

       The amendments that are contained in this bill are the ones that were entirely non-contentious to all bar Lois O'Donoghue and probably David Ross. When you left Canberra and went out to Dubbo, Brisbane, Cairns and Darwin, you found that all of these people wanted that. In this chamber, Senator Bob Collins said, `You cannot have individual ownership. That whole concept is absolutely anathema to Aboriginal people; it is not part of their culture.' I remember Senator Evans saying that you have to have this white man's

But, funnily enough, when we got out to the goldfields, when we got up to Cairns and spoke to Torres Strait Islanders, we found a lot of Aboriginal people—not just Torres Strait Islanders but Aboriginals from the goldfields all around Australia—saying, `No, no, you cannot rule that out; it can happen.

       I had to say in this speech that I was shocked at the decision not to exempt it after our discussions prior to this date.

        we were pushing it uphill to get it through the Senate and would not get it through the Senate. We decided we would try and win the election. We decided that we would go to the election with our amendments written in black and white on a policy that was sent by the former shadow minister, Christine Gallus, who did a superb job distributing them to a huge number of Aboriginal communities. There was massive support.

       The day that we decided to pursue that course, that is, to try and win the election and win a majority in the House of Representatives, the now Prime Minister and former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, got up in that place and said to the whole of Australia and everyone who took a very close interest in this bit of legislation, `We cannot get it through the Senate. Trying to get it through the Senate is not going to achieve our ends. Pursuing that course is the best way to achieve our ends and to achieve the wishes of all of those Aboriginal people who came in and supported us.' The support we got was absolutely phenomenal.

       The network of people who have come to share the views of the coalition in relation to so many Aboriginal affairs matters was built up enormously during that process. I have met a lot of people who I regard as my friends in Aboriginal Australia through that process. They were horrified to know that we were not going to insist on the Senate getting the legislation through. I said to them, `We are going to win the election down there and, as soon as we can, we are going to bring this legislation back here. That is the promise of John Howard MP, the member for Bennelong, then the Leader of the Opposition—that, if he became Prime Minister, as soon as he could possibly do so, he would reintroduce the legislation into the Senate and try and get these amendments through.

       That was the promise we made. I thought that that was very much something that Senator Chamarette understood.

As Senator Bob Collins would know, you cannot simply get a one- page policy document and turn it into a piece

        of legislation in about two minutes. It does take a little bit longer. Senator Herron is to be commended for the drive that he has brought to the process of bringing this legislation back in. I know this because I spoke to him within 48 hours of him becoming the minister. He has been determined to bring this bit of legislation into this place as soon as was physically and politically possible. He has got it through all the processes of the cabinet and brought it in here, and he is personally responsible for ensuring that the Prime Minister's promise is kept. It is just a great shame to me personally that, because of the failure of the Senate to grant it an exclusion from this exemption, it cannot be dealt with before this session is over.

       As Senator Chamarette said before, she has lost her place in this chamber.

       I will not prejudge what the Aboriginal views are because we will carry out that consultation, but I would be very surprised if they have changed one iota on the substantive matters that form part of this bill. They are matters of high principle for us and for many people in Aboriginal Australia. It is a great shame that we cannot deliver to them what I regard to be a crucial part of their social justice. But, again, it takes a long time to move things in a democracy the size of Australia. If we have to wait another five months to deliver what I regard as absolutely basic to their human rights—that is, ensuring they have freedom in relation to accessing land issues and not some paternalistic approach that tells them how they should own land—then we will wait a few more months. We look forward to the support of the Senate when that occurs.

         —In speaking on the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill on behalf of the opposition, I indicate we will be supporting the legislation. The government has decided to proceed with legislation similar to that introduced into the House last year by the former government. This bill is not controversial. The development allowance is a well&amp;hyphen;targeted and effective initiative introduced by us when we were in government. It was announced in the One Nation statement and was successful in its objective of giving Australia a more competitive investment environment.

        The allowance is administered by the Development Allowance Authority, which is a statutory authority operating within the Treasurer's portfolio. I wonder whether Senator Short has heard of it. He should have, because on 17 June 1992 he informed the Senate—I refer to page 3841 of the

        I will very quickly outline again why we are opposed to the Development Allowance Authority Bill and the Pooled Development Funds Bill. The Development Allowance Authority Bill establishes a one&amp;hyphen;member statutory authority—the Development Allowance Authority, the DAA—which will have the task of assessing the eligibility of large projects with a capital cost of $50m or more. The basic objection that we have to this is that no earthly reason has been presented as to why we have to set up yet another quango to handle a matter such as this.

        I do not know whether Senator Short intends to speak on the legislation on behalf of the government, but I am pleased to see that now, four years later, those opposite have been converted on yet another issue and are in fact proposing legislation very similar to that which we put forward last year in the House of Representatives.

         —The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill is a small bill, as Senator
         <break page="2057" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Sherry said, to extend the development allowance tax concessions to a wider group of people. The financial impact of this bill is to increase the amount of revenue forgone as infrastructure concessions by about $92 million over nine years, or about $10 million a year. The bill removes certain restrictions on the restructuring of the ownership of projects eligible for the development allowance, and the amendments will allow the transfer of the allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred to another entity or to another type of entity structure before the application was registered.

        The development allowance was one of the initiatives of the 1992 One Nation package designed to encourage business investment in new plant. Senator Sherry made some comments about it being well targeted. We agree that it was probably necessary at the time, but look at what has happened over the last few years in this whole area. Powered by the development allowance, the investment allowance and accelerated depreciation provisions, private sector capital investment has picked up significantly in recent years. That is what it was designed to do. To that extent, it has worked.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        According to the OECD, private sector non-residential investment picked up by 15.2 per cent in 1994 and 9.5 per cent in 1995, and it is projected to rise by 9.9 per cent in 1996 and a further 14.2 per cent in 1997. In the five years from 1993, Australia's capital formation will have grown by the second highest rate in the OECD. Considering the OECD is forecasting strong economic growth in 1996-97 and beyond, I think we should be asking how appropriate it is for this to be widened even a little bit. Is it necessary?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The figures that I quoted previously about how capital formation has picked up in the five years from 1993 show that the counter&amp;hyphen;cyclical measures that were needed in 1992 to kick&amp;hyphen;start the economy, like the development allowance and cutting sales tax on cars, were basically successful, but we would argue that they are no longer needed. So from a macro&amp;hyphen;economic point of view I really question the need for this bill.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, with the budget under pressure, we should question whether we should be extending tax concessions which have outlived their usefulness. The development allowance can be added to the list of business welfare. It is surprising that this government has chosen to bring this particular piece of welfare forward at the same time as it is changing or dismantling the export markets development grant and the development import finance facility.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But I think you can contrast this with the issue of infrastructure borrowing concessions, and they are also governed by the Development Allowance Authority. This borrowing concession—which is supposed to encourage private sector investors to get into infrastructure; they are not doing anything about that—remains current.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill is a technical bill seeking to clarify some aspects of the Development Allowance Authority which were not clear in 1992. But I think the government should have a long, hard look at the activities of the Development Allowance Authority in the area of infrastructure borrowing concessions when it looks at its budget in August.

         newspaper's national affairs editor, Mike Steketee, described the infrastructure concession as a much worse rort than the government sales tax exemption which had Mr Costello so outraged a few weeks ago. What was Mr Costello's response? This is Mr Costello who a few months ago accused the states of unjustified rorts and promised to attack rorts in the system. Earlier today the same Mr Costello announced that, instead of tightening up the infrastructure borrowings concession, he is going to extend it. He is going to ignore all the expert opinion about what it costs the budget. He is going to reinstate the concession for urban roads.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last year in this debate the Australian Democrats tried to draw attention to the role that the infrastructure borrowing concession has played in subsidising, in our view, entirely inappropriate infrastructure projects such as City Link in Melbourne. These projects enjoy not only a federal tax concession but also often a wide range of benefits from the states. And for what? What do we taxpayers get back for this?

        <break page="2058" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The former Prime Minister requested EPAC to look at the effect of private sector investment in infrastructure. EPAC, in its private infrastructure task force release last October, concluded that there was little efficiency to be gained from private ownership of roads and that private financed projects are `likely to be least advantageous for urban roads'. It also concluded that the cost of building private roads was inflated, because of legal and financial complexities and network risk where the viability of the project is affected by decisions on competing roads and public transport.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In response to that, the former Treasurer, Mr Willis, last December, in responding to what he described as widespread community concerns about the City Link and M2 projects, removed the borrowing concession. He said, `I hear what you're saying about the benefits the private sector is getting; double benefits that are doubly inappropriate.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But today Mr Costello has announced that roads will get their concession back. We do not believe there is any good economic or commercial reason for this. Tollways in New South Wales, in Victoria and in Queensland have proven to be excessively profitable without the concession. This is an appalling case of business welfare and it is appallingly targeted. In the committee stage I will move the amendment which has been distributed and deal with it then.

        The essential criteria in the principal act of 1992 must still be met. The purpose for the allowance will not be changed, but the opportunity for investors to benefit from the allowance will be enhanced. What this bill is doing is merely changing the eligibility criteria.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Where all other criteria in the principal act have been met by the applicant, this bill will allow the benefits granted by the Development Allowance Authority to be transferred in certain circumstances.

        This amendment will operate where there has been a transfer of ownership after the application for the development allowance has been made. It will also operate in situations where the project is now owned by another entity type structure and the ownership was transferred after the application had been made but before the registration of the allowance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To assist business the act will apply retrospectively. I am not one, as this Senate well knows, to support retrospectivity when it means placing obligations on taxpayers for circumstances which operated in the past and whose legality has since been changed. But in this case applications for the allowance closed on 1 January 1993, so it is vital that there is retrospective application in this particular case because it is retrospective legislation not in respect of a tax but in respect of a benefit.

       <para first-indent="16">
        However, the development authority will be given the power to decide whether an application has lapsed in particular circumstances.

        I know that my honourable colleagues will be asking how much the application of this Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill will cost, and so they should. That is a perfectly legitimate question. I am delighted to say that it will cost the government no extra revenue in the sense that revenue has already been incorporated into the budget figures. So there will be no extra budgetary implications.

        On the other hand, the benefits to successful applicants will be substantial. Some $10 million in one year will be available to applicants who will now be successful because of these amendments. For the extent of the operation of the allowance—that is, from 1993-94 to the financial year 2001-02—successful project applications would benefit
        <break page="2059" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         by approximately $92 million. That is a substantial amount even in terms of major industrial projects. It will be ordinary Australians who will ultimately benefit from employment opportunities and using the facilities once those facilities are completed.

        The Development Allowance Authority was set up to increase investment in Australia. When it was set up in 1992 its aim was to improve Australia's international competitiveness, through the application of tax incentive schemes, to increase investment for infrastructure by the private sector and to accelerate investment in major industrial projects. The allowance could also be used for investment in labour relation reforms and input pricing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Up to the end of the 1994-95 financial year, all the projects had been for infrastructure in New South Wales. The projects which have been certified are: the M2 motorway in north western Sydney—I wonder whether that comes within the ambit of the Democrat's amendment; the electricity cogeneration plant in Smithfield, Sydney; a water treatment plant and water supply for the Illawarra district of south of Sydney; and the light rail system and related facilities between Ultimo and Pyrmont in Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There have been over 500 applications for the allowance, 250 of which were registered by 30 June 1995. These represented a capital expenditure of well over $100 million through to 2002. The mining and manufacturing sectors are the greatest beneficiaries and great employment generators. While 11 projects, which have been registered, involve expenditure of over $1 billion each, the largest single registered project involves almost $5 billion.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that the time is right for a more detailed examination of investment in Australian infrastructure. These types of long-term projects are ideal investments for superannuation funds. For example, the AMP Society is pioneering investments such as these. The present level of superannuation savings has now exceeded $240 billion and is likely to rise to some $2,000 billion by 2020. This amount of $2,000 billion will largely be the result of an increasing level of compulsory contribution and the ageing population. Unless we are very vigilant in using this money to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         extend infrastructure type projects on a voluntary basis, much of this superannuation money could well end up overseas if we are not careful.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we need to do is make it attractive to investors, particularly superannuation funds, to put their money into Australian projects. We need to encourage them to keep their money in Australia by giving them incentives rather than dictating to them. It does not have to be legislated for and it should not be made compulsory. But irresistible options should be offered to people and their superannuation funds to have appropriate products, such as those I have just described, available and as such ensure that super funds make a valuable contribution to the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a response to business and industry groups, the previous government had legislation to effect these sorts of changes. The House of Representatives passed all stages of a similar bill in 1995, but because of the backlog of legislation in the House it was not passed before the parliament was prorogued prior to the election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Business and industry representatives have rightly called for a review of the eligibility criteria. With the passage of this bill, all types of project restructuring of a bona fide nature will be able to go ahead while retaining the rights of project managers or joint developers to the development allowance. The government is treating the removal of some restrictions on the restructuring of ownership, which had previously jeopardised eligibility for the allowance, as a matter of high priority. Here is another commitment delivered by this government. The bill previously enjoyed bipartisan support. I commend this bill to all senators because it will increase the benefits of the incentive scheme to investors in Australian infrastructure and will therefore be of long-term benefit to Australia.

        I also think it is probably necessary to record, as Senator Sherry did, that the minister with notional authority for this bill in this chamber is the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short. When the former government introduced this bill—indeed this bill is a direct copy of the bill introduced by the former Labor government—Senator Short saw fit to oppose it. Now he is the minister bringing it forward. The irony ought not be lost that the terrible things that the former government did are, at least in this theatre, being promoted by the existing government. As Senator Watson just said, this bill has served a very worthwhile purpose and continues to do so.

        The development allowance and the authority that the development allowance spawned was a measure introduced by the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in 1992 when he brought down his trail blazing One Nation statement. In economic terms it is a countercyclical measure to stimulate the economy to provide an incentive for major projects to claim further advantage on the depreciation of plant and equipment and to reinvest in projects of a significant size.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The development allowance itself no longer operates but the projects it spawned still make a significant contribution to the economy. The initial purpose of the legislation, therefore, was achieved. It brought forward a huge number of major mining and infrastructure developments around the country which otherwise would have languished on the back burner longer than economically desirable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The upsurge in demand created by those major projects brought about more employment and, because of the multiplier effect of those projects in the broader economy, orders were placed with companies hanging off the supply of materials, plant and equipment for those projects. As a classical Keynesian counter&amp;hyphen;cyclical measure, the development allowance scheme worked, and that has been

         a matter for comment on all sides of the chamber. This bill is necessary to focus that measure further.

        The government's support of this bill gives rise, to put it at its mildest, to a quizzical question from industry about the government's approach to industry support mechanisms. The development allowance and the continuation of the Development Allowance Authority is clearly a government program to support further economic and industrial development in Australia. To that extent, we know that, at least in that area, the government supports this initiative. But let's consider the development import finance facility scheme, better known as DIFF.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We know that the government is chopping the DIFF scheme, a scheme in which a host of Australian companies have millions of dollars tied up in developments with overseas companies. The soft loans authorised by the Australian government under the DIFF scheme went into aid type programs in developing countries and to generate growth in those developing countries. But it was Australian entrepreneurs who, given the support of the DIFF scheme, won the contracts that would create an advantage in our economy and a market for the export of infrastructure development skills and other skills—notably green DIFF industry skills in environmental technology—in developing countries. On one hand, the government continues the development allowance scheme; on the other, in an area of vital export earning power for Australia, it chops off a scheme that has served the nation well.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Madam Acting Deputy President, you, like me, are a senator representing Western Australia. One of Western Australia's most famous companies, Clough Engineering, has been a great beneficiary of the DIFF scheme and won initial contracts in Indonesia for major engineering works. Now, the scheme which helped that company to grow and to become more internationally competitive—winning contracts without the advantage of soft loans for development, winning contracts on its own merits throughout the booming Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific area—is to be chopped off while

       <para first-indent="16">
        We know that the government also has on the chopping block the export market development grant scheme. A bill referring to that scheme came through the Senate in the last sitting week. That scheme repays small and medium&amp;hyphen;sized Australian companies, at a lesser amount than the actual cost, the costs incurred in developing new export markets for their goods and services. That scheme is to be put under the knife by the razor gang known as the ERC. Industry has lined up in a long queue, along with all of the industry associations, the names of which are nationally famous, to oppose the removal of the EMDG scheme.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also know that a number of other industry schemes, under the broad heading of AusIndustry, provide help and assistance in a range of ways: through research and development incentives; through discovering the best and most appropriate technology for their needs and at a lower cost to them; and through helping small to medium&amp;hyphen;sized companies prepare their own market strategies and corporate plans.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the AusIndustry schemes are to be chopped substantially as well, and all in the interests of chasing what the media have dubbed the `illusory black hole'. Really, it is in the interests of pursuing this government's ideological obsession about small government. On the way to that goal, it is chopping off valuable schemes with proven and refereed track records of assistance to industry. A mixed message is emanating from this government about what it does and does not support in the industry sector. Many industry figures ask me what I think will happen with various schemes. Witness, for example, the diesel fuel rebate scheme.

       <para first-indent="16">
        At a meeting of the National Farmer's Federation just over a month ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in response to some intense questioning from the floor, gave a wink and a nod to the federation, indicating that the diesel fuel rebate scheme would continue for them, as would the 150 per cent tax reduction for rural research and development. The two questions put to the Prime

         Minister were about that. The media widely reported his remarks as meaning that, because of the loss of votes in the New South Wales state by&amp;hyphen;election from the National Party to the Labor Party, and because of rural unrest over the gun issue, the government had moved to mend its fences, giving a wink and a nod to the rural industry.

        then what about all the other industries that have schemes on the chopping block that do not have that sort of political clout or political urgency that the federal government recognises in one sector? What about the other sectors that a wink and a nod does an injustice to? For example, I have received—as I am sure you, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, as a Western Australian senator, would have received—a whole host of submissions from the mining industry about the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Is it going to continue for that industry?

Perhaps you might be kind enough to suggest a little bit more relevance in the reminder of his contribution.

         —My point of relevance is that this bill gives a positive signal to industry, as far as the development allowance is concerned, while industry is receiving negative signals across a range of other areas in which there are proven programs of industry assistance which increase our exports, reduce our current account deficit, create jobs for Australians and create, by virtue of Australian companies making profits, reinvestment in Australian industry. Therefore, those schemes should be seen as positive. But I have made that point.

        I ask the government to give some thought to unscrambling the message that it is sending to Australian industry. It should give clear, long, strong signals to Australian industry as to what the framework of its industry programs might be because Australian industry depends on many of those programs to provide competitiveness. Given that the Australian economy is now more internationalised than ever before—international corporations compete against Australian companies within our domestic economy and we compete through Australian companies on the international stage as well—in order to generate investment and longer term planning by companies, strong signals that are going to ensure that companies can raise investment capital against are necessary.

That will come back to haunt the government. I commend the legislation.

There are issues in relation to the Development Allowance Authority grant which are of concern to the Greens (WA). They include the type of privately funded infrastructure that we are asking taxpayers to support. One in particular is dealt with on page 7 of the Development Allowance Authority annual report. It states:

         included electricity generation. In Western Australia the Greens were concerned that it seemed to be very carefully designed to include investment in the Collie power station. For various reasons, we thought this was sending a very wrong signal in relation to what it was that we were going to encourage—that is, to subsidise. It might be useful to find out whether or not the applications include coal fired power stations because it would be a great concern if that is what we are doing—not only not moving towards any real greenhouse goals in Australia but actually providing a public subsidy for privately funded coal fired power stations.

        There are, however, some useful projects, including the certificates for a light rail system, but I join with the Australian Democrats in raising concern about this kind of public funding going to tollways. I believe that that is the wrong use of funding. I indicate at this stage that the Greens are prepared to support the amendments proposed by Senate Kernot for the Democrats in relation to the inappropriate nature of that use of public funding.

If state and federal governments are working to assist in these plans, they should be looking into demand management strategies which look at how we use those sectors.

         —This bill amends the principal act,  the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992. The purpose of this amending bill is to allow a restructuring, basically, of ownership of projects that have applied for this assistance which was offered by the previous government for the calendar year 1992, as explained to the Senate previously. That window of opportunity was available for 12 months for projects of over $50 million each. The benefit offered was a 10 per cent deduction of the capital cost over a 10&amp;hyphen;year period.

Hence, that is what this amendment bill is all about—we are simply making sure that some 10 per cent of the projects which are currently before the DAA will still qualify. It has no financial impact whatsoever because the previous government, with bipartisan support, allowed for this change in the previous budget and in the forward projections.

        This matter came on at very short notice. In indicating our support for the amendments, we are being consistent with the position announced by the former Treasurer, Mr Willis, and the former Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, on 15 December last year, when it was made clear that the decision taken then followed the findings of the Economic Planning Advisory Council—commonly known as EPAC—private infrastructure
        <break page="2064" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         task force report released in October which stated that private finance is `likely to be least advantageous for urban roads'.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Despite its general support for private infrastructure projects, the EPAC task force found that little efficiency was to be gained from private ownership of roads. It also concluded that the cost of building private roads was inflated because of legal and financial complexities and network risk where the viability of the project is affected by decisions on competing roads and public transport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My attention has also been drawn to a more latter report—that of the National Commission of Audit. I refer to pages 295 and 296 of the report. Indeed, today we asked a question on this section in which the government has very firmly pronounced that it will be adopting a charter of budget honesty. In respect to tax expenditures, it says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One area where current budget reporting is clearly inadequate is the cost of tax concessions (that is tax expenditures). Treasury noted that a forthcoming OECD publication shows that Australian reporting of tax expenditures currently falls short of overseas best practice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The different budgetary processes that apply to tax concessions and expenditure programs in Australia have contributed to the lack of transparency of tax expenditure reporting.
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Then it gives a number of reasons and concerns about this issue of tax concessions. The final reason given is as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . procedures exist for the Department of Finance and the responsible portfolio to examine ways of containing blowouts in program expenditure but not blowouts in tax concessions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a result of all these factors, tax concessions are a largely non&amp;hyphen;transparent form of assistance. This lack of transparency makes less visible the effect of tax concessions on the budget and reduces accountability. It also increases the likelihood that poorly targeted concessions will remain on offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are being consistent in our approach in this area of roads and in the way tax concessions are targeted.

        It is interesting that Senator Gibson says that this has been done fairly hastily—it is true—and that it has been done without consultation with the government.

        As to its relevance, the infrastructure borrowing concession is contained in the Income Tax Act but the concession is subject to the Development Allowance Authority, and that is governed by the act we are debating at the moment—so that is its relevance. The purpose of the amendment is to reinstate the eligibility of the infrastructure borrowing to the status it had this morning, before the Treasurer's announcement this afternoon. That means it seeks to remove the eligibility for urban roads from infrastructure borrowing.

        Senator Sherry has told us of the Labor Party's attitude, as stated by previous Treasurer Willis in December last year. I have that press release, too.

On the second page of the press release Mr Willis gave two examples. In the case of the City Link project, he said:

         Why, today, does Treasurer Costello, without much warning, announce this?

It says, `Here's a little sidekick to you, boys, because it encourages developers. You can say to them, "Look, not only can you get this tax concession from the federal government but you can get a few benefits from us at the state level as well. That is really enough to get you going".'

         What an analysis of tollways in recent years shows us is that in those three states where they are used extensively—New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland—they are shown to be profitable without these concessions. So it is a consolation prize, a sop and a totally inappropriate use of the tax system. That is why we have moved this amendment today before Treasurer Costello can even get an opportunity to change it back from previous Treasurer Willis's considered opinion in December last year.

         —I would like to say a few things in support of the Democrats' amendments to this bill. The opposition supports the bill in general and it also supports the amendments moved by Senator Kernot. The reasons why Ralph Willis and Laurie Brereton indicated on 15 December last year the changes to the policy that were announced concerning the future application of infrastructure bonds to road projects need to be highlighted to the Committee. Essentially, those changes went to the question of the uneconomic effect of the application of infrastructure bonds to road projects and the distortions to the economies that occurred as a result of the application of privatisation to roads.

        The City Link project in Melbourne is the best example of which I am aware of just how much impact a project can have on a community. The point has been demonstrated again and again. Some studies have highlighted that it is much more expensive for private than public enterprise to complete projects such as City Link. In Melbourne, $300 million worth of additional expenditures were granted to the City Link project as a result of direct subsidies by the state government. They do not appear on the budget papers as costs of the project by the consortia building that project. This includes features such as flyovers, which have been constructed at
        <break page="2066" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         public expense, to avoid traffic lights and the construction of bridges which are not included in the prospectus. For instance, the bridge over the Yarra resulted in a dock needing to be moved. That led to additional expenditure of $200 million by the people of Victoria.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The City Link legislation was rammed through the Victorian parliament in such a way that it denied public debate and consultation. We have seen 66 measures undertaken by the state of Victoria to undermine public debate and prevent public discussion in terms of the anti-competitive aspects of that project. That included items such as the corralling of traffic, the closing of roads and the prevention of compensation claims by residents affected by the City Link project. There has been the avoidance of environmental law considerations in the whole project. No EIS has been undertaken for the Tullamarine extension. A grossly inadequate environmental process has been undertaken with regard to the other two legs of that project.

        This contract locks in the future policy options for the people of Victoria for 34 years, which is extraordinary. In today's dollar terms, that means additional expenditure for motorists who use that freeway of $1,500 per year. That is a guaranteed profit for 34 years. There are guaranteed subsidies from the state to make sure that various measures are undertaken to protect the privileged position of that consortia with regard to Melbourne.

        Advisers to government have mentioned that this legislation includes 350 projects.

        The former Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), and the former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), indicated that the building of private roads inflated the cost because of the legal and financial complexities. The network risks that were involved ensured that there was a direct subsidy to the consortia building the road, the

        There could be no clearer example of the anti&amp;hyphen;competitive nature of such a project than the attempt being made to ensure that there is a monopoly of freight on the Tullamarine freeway, which is the link between the docklands and the airport. A real issue that arises concerns the implications of the transport options for Melbourne city. A major metropolitan area of this country is being undermined by this project in terms of private, secret deals. They are enforced through a legislative program by a government that is quite clearly not interested in a proper discussion of these sorts of issues.

        As the minister indicated last December, the actions of the national Labor government at that time indicated that its concerns reflected widespread community apprehension about the implications of projects such as City Link and the M2 project. For the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to indicate to us today that the government would reverse this matter is totally inappropriate. In policy terms, it is a retrograde step and one that I trust the Senate will strongly oppose and continue to do so.

         —The opposition supports this measure, which flows from an inquiry which I set up when I was immigration minister just a few months ago. The measure goes to the operation of the migration agents registration scheme, a scheme which has been in operation for some time now and which was reviewed under the previous government by a committee of the parliament. That committee brought forward a number of recommendations, one of which was for the scheme to continue. The other recommendations went to tightening the scheme, focusing on some of the rorts that occur in the migration area.

         When we talk about the migration area we must acknowledge that we are talking about an area which has developed as a rather sizeable industry. We are also talking of an industry in which the overwhelming majority of operators play the game by the rules. But we must also acknowledge, as was discovered by the parliamentary committee once again, that we do find shysters and operators working extensively in this industry.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As a consequence, the previous government brought in legislation to try to control the conduct of these people. Not just unethical conduct, but also of concern to the previous government was the capacity of people in this area to charge exorbitant rates. So it is incumbent on this parliament to focus on the continuing need for this legislation, to focus on the need to have standards applying in a regulatory manner and to focus on the need for those standards and those laws to continue to apply.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, this legislation has, from its initial introduction, had to live with a sunset clause which, for some reason that I could not quite fathom, the Senate has always insisted on placing on legislation like this. I would anticipate that legislation like this will need more than a sunset clause. I think there will be a need for legislation like this to continue for quite some time and it was always my personal view that the legislation should, in fact, be allowed to continue without a sunset clause. What we are doing today is canvassing a bill which extends the sunset clause of this legislation for another 12 months. If I were to put anything to the government in terms of an amendment, I would suggest to them that maybe a bit longer would be appropriate, given the continuing necessity for legislation like this. But, of course, that is something for the government to consider.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing I would put to the government is that we are waiting, on this side of the parliament, for the government to consider what it wants to do now with changes to this particular scheme. As I say, the parliamentary committee did investigate the operation of the scheme and did advise and recommend on a number of fairly important amendments. It is now up to the new government to tell us
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          where it wants to go with those amendments. We hope that those responses by the government—the policy statement in this area—are not all that slow in coming.

Though I have no questions to ask Senator Short, I put him on notice with respect to the recommendations of the committee and ask when we can expect the government to respond and indicate to the parliament where it wants to take the registration scheme, particularly in view of the recommendations raised by the parliamentary committee.

         —The Senate is dealing with the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. The purpose of the bill is to amend part III of the Migration Act 1958 which deals with the registration of migration agents. The bill seeks to amend the sunset clause contained in the legislation, which will terminate on 21 September 1996, having operated for four years, unless the migration agents registration scheme is further extended. The bill seeks to extend it for one year only, in recognition of the fact that the government has not yet considered, addressed and reported on the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration which reported in June 1995. That report certainly recommended that the scheme be extended but the government has not yet addressed all the elements of that report.

        The Australian Democrats certainly support this bill, which provides for, as I said, a one&amp;hyphen;year extension of the registration scheme until 21 September 1997. That time will, no doubt, be used by the government to further review the scheme, to consider fully the report that the committee has placed before the government and to consider the prospect for enhanced self&amp;hyphen;regulation by the migration advice industry. In the Democrats' view, that industry needs to be treated with some caution because, as Senator Bolkus has said, while there is certainly a majority of ethical operators in that field, there are also a few whose behaviour leaves a lot to be desired. If we
        <break page="2070" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         went down the route of self&amp;hyphen;regulation, then it would be necessary again to put in checks for monitoring and supervision, which may or may not be the most cost&amp;hyphen;effective way of ensuring that proper standards of behaviour are followed in that industry. As I said, the Democrats will be supporting this bill.

         —I thank Senator Bolkus and Senator Spindler for their remarks on the bill, which, as has been said and made clear, is simply designed to extend the operation of the MARS scheme for a further 12 months. If the bill were not passed, then the scheme would expire on 21 September. I was a member of the parliamentary committee that produced the report entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Protecting the vulnerable?
         </emphasis>
         and my contribution to the title was to add the question mark. It was an important question mark because one proposition was that the report just be entitled `Protecting the vulnerable'. The implication of that was that the scheme does protect the vulnerable. I added the question mark because I thought that the case was unproven. In many respects, many of the committee members felt that the case was unproven and, hence, we extended the operation of the scheme for a period of time so that it could be reviewed.

        The examination of the MARS scheme was a very interesting exercise. I think the report we produced was a good report and one that bears very careful consideration. The government will certainly be giving it that consideration over the ensuing 12 months. There are many recommendations in the report. In response to Senator Bolkus's question to me, my answer would be that the various recommendations will be looked at in the context of looking at the scheme over the next 12 months with a view to where we might go from here.

         —When I was speaking to this bill when it was last dealt with in the Senate, I was talking about some of the issues which were involved. A number of people who gave evidence to the inquiry into this bill expressed concern about the nature of the operations of Wool International.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I must say that I was concerned initially with the fact that a precedent was being set in relation to the disallowable instrument, in that decisions were being made by Wool International about operations. For instance, the new body which was to be set up on the futures market would be disallowable, but the decision was to reduce that to three days notice. I thought that was a slippery slope in relation to parliamentary scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, one of the issues that became clear was that the nature of the operations that Wool International Holdings would be participating in might be used at some stage to point the finger at the Senate—that is, in relation to whether or not the Senate was responsible for Wool International being able to make decisions on the futures market. I think our concerns with this go further than that. We are concerned with the fact that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Wool International is to be given power to undertake, through a subsidiary such as Wool International Holdings, wool marketing activities, includ

        I point out that the Greens have generally opposed public companies moving into hedging and speculation and that such speculative activities are some of the avowed purposes of Wool International Holdings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That these operations would be funded by what in fact is a compulsory levy is also of particular concern. Leaving aside voluntary levies, if you have a compulsory levy and under that levy you have a body engaged in market speculation, who then becomes financially and legally responsible if bad decisions are made? Nobody can tell me that a body operating in this market will be insulated from poor decisions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I know there is the issue of defusing risk, but entering the speculative sphere and dealing in currency, futures and other speculative areas is problematic. Ignoring the fact that speculation is risk, even if you speculated in enough areas and the right areas to defuse the risk of currency fluctuation speculation, futures speculation and natural variation in commodity markets, you are still doing something other than the promotion of wool sales. You are also ultimately doing something which further adds to the instability of many aspects of the global economic system. We are simply adding to speculation and making speculation into standard business practice.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Basically, it is a problem. I think it is a problem if we as a Senate are being asked to require wool growers to be indirectly involved in the speculative market—that is, non-real things, what might happen in the future—and gambling using a public levy. Therefore, I have circulated an amendment—people will either have it already or get it soon—to remove mention of this extra company within Wool International so that the Senate will not be asked to sanction, to approve or to disapprove of speculative investments by a company which will be far removed from political scrutiny in reality.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe this is the wrong way to go. Just because the speculative economy internationally is getting big, it does not mean to say that, first, we should get involved with it in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         this way and that, second, we should require wool growers to be involved. Quite frankly, a growing number of wool growers are very unhappy with this. Certainly in Western Australia that number is large and is growing. I believe it is the wrong thing to do. In that sense, we will be putting our amendment in the committee stage of the bill.

         —I rise to speak on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1), which is before us. Being part of a family wool growing operation, I declare an interest. The current situation in the wool industry is of grave concern to all of us in this chamber and to many people in the Australian community. I say that because the wool industry has for so long underpinned the total social fabric, social structure, economic fabric and economic structure of so much of Australia. Other industries, whether they be grain growing or beef producing—and in a sense this even applies to a lot of mining operations—have benefited from investment in the wool industry which has provided shops, services, transport and the various things that go with it.

        The hearings we held relating to the legislation before us concentrated primarily on one issue: the establishment of Wool International Holdings, the proposition we have before the Senate now. I want to make a number of things clear in terms of this piece of legislation. In my view, in a lot of senses it is a very strange piece of legislation—it emanated from the previous government—in that the Wool International Holdings proposals can only be termed as enabling legislation. It allows a proposal to come before the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) for the possible development of a scheme which deals with various options for marketing wool—whether it be through the futures market, through forward selling or through matching or combining growers' clips.

         selling season. As yet, no proposal has been put forward. We can talk about this proposal and certain aspects of it, such as what it might or might not be or what it may or may not do, until the cows come home, but the reality is that until such time as we see that proposal we have nothing before us in this chamber—nor does the minister, the government or anybody else for that matter.

        Various witnesses made a lot of comments on the proposal, and many comments have been made outside the inquiry by people involved in the industry, whether it be through growing directly or through the chain of events that occur in getting wool to the marketplace and then exported. I find it rather interesting—in fact, I find it frustrating—that we have so many experts with so much knowledge about a proposal when in fact there is no proposal. It is quite amazing how people can come into this place and talk for so long about this so&amp;hyphen;called proposal when there is no proposal. I wanted to make that point tonight.

        I want to make a couple of other things very clear. A number of people who appeared before us expressed what the proposal might be. No&amp;hyphen;one from any of the industry organisations who gave evidence said that they were opposed to the proposal of Wool International putting forward a plan. We did have some variations of what may or may not be contained in that particular plan. For example, in relation to the pastoralists and graziers of Western Australia—and a lot of publicity has come out of Western Australia in terms of this piece of legislation we have before us, particularly with regard to Wool International Holdings—I asked Mrs Lyn Johnson directly, `Are you opposed to the formation of Wool International Holdings?' I do not have her exact words in front of me, but in essence she said, `No, we're not opposed to it; but it must be a fully floated commercial company.' That is what she said.

        The Western Australian Farmers Federation said, `If there is $24 million to come out of growers funds or to be supplemented by growers funds, then that must be in the form of a loan with a government guarantee.' The position given to us by the South Australian

         Farmers Federation was not dissimilar to the position of the Western Australian Farmers Federation. When we listened to organisations in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales—I think I can add Tasmania, because the President of the Wool Council is a Tasmanian—they all said that they supported what is generally the popular version of what may or may not come forward in due course from Wool International Holdings.

        With all the speculation, the comments, the criticisms and the claims that have been made around the place that politicians—particularly members of the Senate, me included—have come down on a particular position as far as any proposal from Wool International Holdings is concerned is an absolute nonsense. Until such time as we see that proposal, it comes to the minister and then goes back to the House of Representatives and this place through a disallowable instrument, which was an addition we included in the legislation, I have to say again and again that we have no proposal on which to make a judgment.

        There was some criticism of Wool International not appearing before the committee. I want to make a couple of points on that which have already been made by others here. Wool International were there on the first day. They put a submission in. They did speak to me, as chairman of the committee, after the first day. This is on the public record, but I think it bears repeating. We did discuss it and I said, `It's entirely up to you people whether you appear or not. I would prefer that you did, but at the very least I would expect you to reply to the criticisms and the claims that have been made.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They chose a particular route to do that and to not appear before the committee. I respect that as their right and I put no pressure on them whatsoever. But I think they made a mistake. I think it would have been very useful if they had voluntarily appeared. Nonetheless, as I think Senator Bob Collins said before the debate finished the other day, they were there and any one of us could have called them before the committee had we so chosen.

        We also had a recommendation in this report to, in essence, bring attention to the
        <break page="2073" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         concerns of many of the people who appeared before the committee with regard to the lack of confidence in Wool International and their wool selling policies. I would like to think that there were some magic wand we could utilise in their selling policies which would see a significant change in the market situation; but I do not believe there is.

        There could be some room for a marginally different approach to the way it is being handled. But, at the end of the day, the thing that is cruelling the market at this time is that lack of confidence which emanates from the overhang of the stockpile over the market. If the government continued to deliver the government guarantee, I would certainly fight for it if there were a suspension of sales. But any move made to not continue the reduction of the stockpile in some form or another would create a situation where the pain would continue longer than it otherwise might need to.

        As well as the round table conference held by the minister there is the development of targeted promotion, certainly some developments of options in marketing and the situations now occurring in the economies of Japan, Italy and in particular Germany. I believe that the impact of the unification of Germany is only just coming home to roost—the cost of that to the German people and the impact that has flowed through into such commodities as wool or apparel fibres. It is not only the wool industry that is finding things a little difficult at the moment. If we look right down the whole clothing, manufacturing and apparel fibre market we see that things are not as serious as they are for many woolgrowers but they certainly are not good.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As we work through this, we move towards the next round table conference of the industry. This chamber and this parliament has a real challenge in how we will administer the reports that will come back to Minister Anderson and how we will deal with particular issues before us. I must emphasise, as has already been said in this debate, that it is absolutely crucial that any announcement to the selling policies and the operations which will exist after 1 July 1997 be made very quickly. The biggest fear that the `trade' has
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of people who are involved in the buying, the selling and the processing of wool is the uncertainty of what might occur after that date.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We must also acknowledge in this debate that when looking at the debates that were held in this place after the 1990 and 1993 elections, the majority of pundits and commentators spelt out doom and gloom. They spelt out—and I am not saying this is good—that we would be looking at a tax on the wool industry in the vicinity of nine, 10 or 12 per cent. This legislation seeks to remove the tax on wool, which is currently 4.5 per cent. The impact of the removal of that tax will be somewhere in the order of 25 to 30 bales of wool. In simple terms, that means somebody who produces 100 bales of wool will receive an additional $2,500 to $3,000.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some people in the press and others have raised issues with me regarding the removal of that tax. There was not one woolgrower who contacted me prior to the hearings and in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the election who wanted anything other than the removal of that tax. That is a very important aspect of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Despite the difficulties, the position in relation to the wool stockpile is certainly better than was anticipated by the vast majority of people in the industry. Approximately half the stockpile has been sold and the current balance sheet—if you could take into account the assets and so on—would show somewhere in the order of $700 million. In 1990 and 1993 we had people running around the place saying, `We ought to burn the stockpile and the government should write off the debt.' We are not looking at that sort of desperate situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have always viewed the stockpile as an asset and I have said that in this place before. I believe that by the time the stockpile is eliminated we will find that it was a very valuable asset. Over the next couple of years the wool industry will adjust to its new situation and the totally free market. There will be major adjustments. We are already seeing that in my state of Western Australia. I am sure that Senator Panizza, who is in the chamber, would also attest to the fact that many people involved with the wool industry
        <break page="2074" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in Western Australia have significantly increased their grain production. They have responded in a positive manner to the particular crisis we have before us.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Nonetheless, having said that, that certainly leaves our pastoralist, who do not have that option, and a number of people in the areas where it is not economical, even with the improved grain prices, to produce grain, in a very precarious position. Unfortunately, at this time, they do not have the option of moving into the beef industry. When they could have done so, a year or two ago, the price of cattle was very high, particularly the price breeding stock. Anybody who was involved in purchasing breeding stock would realise that, in the last six or nine months, we have seen a collapse of the beef market and a collapse of the grain fed side of the beef industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many people took out contracts—and I give this as a warning to producers; they have to be so careful—to purchase grain to fatten their stock and they are now able to meet those contracts. They either cannot purchase the grain to feed their stock or alternatively cannot get rid of their cattle. The prices quoted to those people just six or seven months ago cannot be obtained now and they find themselves unable to carry on in that business. Whenever you talk about options there is always a downside.

         —I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to lay before the Senate material that I believe shows clearly that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) is presiding over a completely unnecessary crisis of his own making in Aboriginal Australia. Honourable senators will recall that on 27 May I asked the minister a question about concerns
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that had been raised with me by CDEP schemes across my electorate of the Northern Territory. They were completely unaware of what was going to happen when their funds run out, as they will, this Friday. They were desperate to get some firm information because of the six&amp;hyphen;week waiting period which applies after a person makes an application for unemployment benefits.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the moment, and I know this first-hand, a desperate effort is currently going on to clear these schemes by Friday of this week—an effort which I hope will be successful, but I fear will not be. Certainly the schemes involved fear it will not be successful. Senator Crowley mentioned in her question to the minister today in question time that the minister informed the Senate on 27 May, in answer to a question from me, that he did not think his appointment of a special auditor to ATSIC would force any delay in the provision of CDEP funds to Aboriginal communities. I assured the communities, on the basis of that answer from the minister, that he had given these assurances in the federal parliament and they did not need to be concerned. Last Wednesday, Senator Herron told this parliament, in answer to a dorothy dixer from Senator Ellison:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Over the last three months I have visited many Aboriginal communities that have taken the initiative to try to improve their situation. Many participate in CDEP, a work for the dole scheme, when they would be better off financially by being on welfare.

       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        That is true. It is an utterly undesirable thing to place any uncertainty on these schemes, forcing people to go on to unemployment benefits—which, of course, it is their right to do.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a direct result of the minister's completely unnecessary actions, and particularly his utter failure to consult ATSIC on the appointment of a special auditor—which was confirmed last Friday in a Senate committee—it looks like these people are about to start applying en masse for welfare, and the predictions of these communities are about to be realised.

         —The letter is self&amp;hyphen;explanatory, so in the time available to me tonight I will not bother to read it out. The issues in the letter were raised with Senator Herron today by Senator Crowley. She asked if he was aware that the Bunuba Aboriginal Corporation had been informed—it has been—that no funds for any ATSIC grant, including CDEP and essential services, would be released until at least 15 July because of the activities of the special auditor. That is precisely the advice the corporation received from the regional ATSIC office—despite what Senator Herron told the Senate today, and I will pursue that at another time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Crowley also asked if Senator Herron was aware that funds for more than 900 CDEP recipients in and around Fitzroy Crossing will run out on Friday and that those recipients are now being advised that they might have to sign up for the dole. He was asked if he was aware that the supply of diesel to generate power for the sewerage and water supply systems would stop without a continuation of the grant moneys and that the corporation was about to declare a state of emergency. Senator Herron was asked what he intended to do to remedy the situation. Senator Herron replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        None of those things have occurred as a result of the appointment of the special auditor.
       </para>

       <para>
        Leaving aside the fact that that is gobbledegook, the thing that absolutely flabbergasted me about that answer is that Senator Herron appears to be unaware of the impact of his own ministerial direction to ATSIC. That is what caused the problem—not the fact that the special auditor started work only this week.

        The ministerial direction directed ATSIC not to spend one further dollar on any grants—CDEP or anything else—until these

It is not what the Chief Executive Officer of ATSIC, Pat Turner, said last Friday when she appeared before the Senate finance and public administration committee. She said that every organisation will have to be cleared by the special auditor under the red, amber and green priority arrangement that has been put in place. I know that CDEP has been prioritised, and I also know that a desperate effort is under way to have these schemes—about 280 of them across Australia—cleared by Friday.

Copies of that letter were sent to the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and the Director of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. I might also add that the reason that I have this letter is that it was sent to organisations in receipt of funds to explain why there is this confusion across the Northern Territory.

        That is not what the Junjuwa community in the Fitzroy River valley were told. They have been having meetings with the minister all afternoon. They sent a letter to the minister today informing him that as of 1 July—next Monday—210 workers at Junjuwa will have no source of income unless the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 funds are released. I was advised by the organisation today that its council will meet again on Wednesday, when it will lay off 210 people unless they hear from the minister and get a special clearance. I am informed that those workers are in the same position as around 1,000 CDEP recipients in the region who will face a similar fate before the end of this week.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Junjuwa have also been told that the release of their funds is reliant upon the special auditor visiting the Derby regional office on 8 July. I refer that fact to you, Minister, in light of the answer you gave to the Senate today. However, those people have a special problem. Their organisation is one already audited by KPMG about 18 months ago. They were advised that KPMG, the special auditor, has a conflict of interest and that their grants decisions will all have to be audited in Canberra. But they will have to wait until KPMG arrives in Derby before that decision can be made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My office is advised that both these organisations are caught in a further catch&amp;hyphen;22 position. If they attempt to switch any other grants monies—organisations across Arnhem Land have been given the same advice—to meet the CDEP and essential services provisions they have to continue to provide, they will receive a red light from the special auditor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Any decision by the 900 or so CDEP recipients in the 40 communities in this area to apply for the dole will also cause a major administrative log jam at the tiny Fitzroy Crossing CES office, the nearest regional centre being at Broome, hundreds of kilometres away. In any case, there is a six&amp;hyphen;week waiting period for unemployment benefits, as I have already pointed out.

I would suggest that if he has any problems, he refers to ATSIC and asks them because the only things that have occurred have been directed by ATSIC, and, as I say, I questioned them about it this afternoon to check that the previous statements that I have made were consistent with the advice that I had had from them.

         —Tonight I rise to draw the Senate's attention to a rather unique report that I had the pleasure of launching a couple of weeks ago. It is entitled, `
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Youth Answers
         </emphasis>
         ' and it is unique because it is about the Aberfoyle Park and Happy Valley community in South Australia which actually commissioned five young Australians to consult their peers,
         <break page="2079" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that is, young people around the ages of 13 to 25, about health issues and the community needs of their environment.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Most research, including the Australian Democrats youth poll that we conduct every year where we ask young Australians about the issues affecting them, shows that young people believe that they do not have enough opportunities to have a say in the decision making processes in this country. Nor do they get a chance to be actively involved in the community and health needs of their society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So I draw the Senate's attention to some of the recommendations in this report; but first I should note its cost. For nine months these young people spoke to young people in the community—and at a cost of less than $2,000. It is worth noting that for such a small outlay we have perhaps put off more expensive costs in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the most overwhelming things I found in this report was that young people identify issues such as safety and security, freedom from sexual harassment and violence as some of the key issues in their community. This is as important a part of their diet as access to bulk&amp;hyphen;billing and medication—two other recommendations contained in the report.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As some participants noted, violence starts early. I only hope that the same political and community will can be applied to addressing violence in all its manifestations, especially violence affecting young Australians in the home, as has been displayed in the recent debate about gun law reform.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another finding of the report that I found of interest was young people complaining about a lack of space for young people to go to. Interestingly, our society seems more preoccupied with cracking down on young people's access, be it through curfews or other regressive measures—rather than providing some of the simple things that young people are asking for, be it skating ramps, pool halls or just quiet areas where young people can hang out.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another finding in the report was that young Australians have a real fear of authority figures, security guards, and have a sense
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that older people are there more so to judge them than to assist them.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The interesting thing about this report is that young people actually provide strategies for countering and coping with some of these problems, be it providing more personalised health centres or youth access centres, improved signage, different people for different jobs, youth magazines and newsletters—better ways of targeting and directing young people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The strategies in this report also highlight the diversity and creativity among young Australians. I especially like the proposal for `a community built fishfarm run by youth with a pool table which could be profit making'. I thought that was particularly entrepreneurial as well as indicating something that might be rather ecologically sustainable. Why do we not see more of this creativity and positive imagery of young Australians reflected in all decision making bodies, but specifically in the media? I should note that these young Australians had their first encounter with the media during this report and found themselves stereotyped and portrayed in a rather patronising and negative way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have noted that the recommendations in this report highlight young people's diversity. It is worth reiterating that young people are not a homogeneous group, especially looking at the age range of 13 to 25 that was covered in this report. Whether they are generation X, generation Y, the Nintendo kids or however we chose to pigeonhole young Australians, certainly the overwhelming feature of this report was a sense of caring and concern for the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One particular controversial strategy in this report that I would highlight is the call, overwhelmingly, by young Australians to have condom vending machines not simply in places like schools but in places such as service stations. It was interesting to note that young people feel that they are not being listened to on this issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was particularly revealing in the prime ministerial debates that when John Howard and Paul Keating were asked the question about the availability of condom vending machines in schools, they did not ask what
        <break page="2080" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         young Australians thought; they simply ruled out this issue. It is worth noting that, not only in this poll but in other surveys and research of young Australians, young people overwhelmingly would like condom vending machines in schools. I challenge this government to take up that controversial issue.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, young Australians said they were not happy with the fact that they have very few outlets to express their fears and their interests, and their concerns generally about community life. I challenge this government to take up an initiative that the Australian Democrats began: an annual youth poll which surveys young people aged 15 to 25 on the issues affecting them. Maybe that would be one way that the coalition government, as well as other political parties or decision making bodies, could more actively involve young Australians in the world around them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I congratulate Fiona Buchanan and the five consultants who were commissioned to undertake this report. I think their work is of a very fine and high standard. I urge members of this parliament and other people to look at the recommendations and think about how we could more actively involve young people, not simply in the politics of this parliament but in day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day life generally.

        The documents comprise the correspondence between the government of the Netherlands and the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management regarding the use of Western Australian karri in hydraulic engineering, namely as canal liners, in the Netherlands. Document No. 1 is a letter dated 12 April 1996 to Dr Syd Shea, Executive Director of the Western Australian Department of CALM, from a B. de Jong of the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management.

        The second document is the substance to which this letter relates. It is titled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Research into sustainable Karri forest management and potential use of Karri timber in hydraulic engineering
        </emphasis>
        , by the Directorate General of Public Works and Water Management, Roads and Hydraulic Engineering Division, the Netherlands. The third is a letter from the Wageningen University of Agriculture to the Dutch water management authorities supporting the methodology and thoroughness of the Dutch study. The fourth is a background paper relevant to both, an article by M. C. Calver et al from the periodical
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        , volume 59 No. 1, titled `Science, principles and forest management: a response to Abbott and Christensen'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Dutch embarked upon their study of the sustainability of karri forest management approximately five years ago out of a concern not directly related to karri. Previously, the Dutch water authorities had used the tropical hardwoods azobe and basralocus for their hydraulic engineering in wet environments in the Netherlands. Document two states:

       <para>
        In 1993 the government of the Netherlands drew together a world&amp;hyphen;renowned tropical timber covenant that would ensure that only timber produced in a sustainable way would
        <break page="2081" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         be imported into the country as of the year 2000. Their research indicated that the traditional woods azobe and basralocus could not reliably be said to be produced sustainably.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Importantly, a key tenet of the 1993 Tropical Timber Covenant was that `logging primary forests'—those which show no signs of serious anthropogenic disturbance, have high biodiversity and no change in original composition—`is arbitrarily not sustainable'. What we call old&amp;hyphen;growth or virgin forests are the ones that they believe are arbitrarily nonsustainable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, the Dutch policy states that the logging of conversion forests is not sustainable, either. That is where wood comes from forests that have been felled to make way for other land uses, including regrowth forests on what was previously old growth. These points are based on the elementary understanding that old&amp;hyphen;growth forests cannot be returned to their former complexity under the current logging regimes of CALM. Single species, uniform age trees, usually of non&amp;hyphen;indigenous species, planted in rows in place of a thriving, self&amp;hyphen;supporting, dynamic old&amp;hyphen;growth ecosystem, does not equal ecologically sustainable forestry. Even in terms of logging rotation, when trees replanted in place of 400&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old trees are felled between 40 and 100 years, that forest never returns to its original majestic state.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the turning of dynamic old&amp;hyphen;growth forest ecosystems into monoculture plantations and the logging of previously virtually untouched forests are both linchpins of Western Australian forest management, it is easy to see why karri forest logging failed the Dutch test. The Dutch documents go on to spell out what makes policy for sustainable forest management. It has three tiers relating to ecological concerns, socioeconomic aspects and socio&amp;hyphen;cultural issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ecologically directed component states that forest policy should be `aimed at safeguarding the sustainability of ecological processes, regulatory environmental functions and the ecological condition of all forest functions.' This means protecting the size and quality of forest ecosystems, maintaining the forest's capacity for natural regeneration and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         its function as a hydrological or orological screen for its surroundings, and protecting threatened species.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With a national forest policy that has not seen one hectare of old-growth forest protected securely and which has been totally ineffective in stopping export woodchipping from chewing up our precious ancient karri, jarrah and mountain ash, it is clear how far we are from the mark as far as the Dutch are concerned. The final decision, as indicated in these documents, is that the terms for using karri timber for Dutch hydraulic engineering purposes as per the 1993 sustainability agreement are these:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Only karri timber from the existing areas of sustainably managed production forest is allowed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, that means timber from plantations and agro&amp;hyphen;forests. Specifically, this item does not include karri timber from primary forests, conversion forests, national parks and conservation reserve areas. Hence, all areas of regrowth forest grown on top of what was previously old growth have rightly been described by the Dutch as being unsustainable methods of forest management in terms of the broad and sensible issues of biodiversity, greenhouse, water catchment and habitat functions of the original forest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To prove that karri is extracted from sustainably managed production forests, it has to be certified by an independent organisation. The WA department of CALM's assertions as to its so-called world&amp;hyphen;class sustainable forestry clearly do not cut it internationally. The Dutch believe that an international audit is warranted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The documents also note with concern that more than 50 per cent of the globally unique primary karri forest will be transformed into production forest under business as usual principles; that is, we will continue to be logging unsustainably because, as has already been stated, conversion forests do not constitute sustainable forestry. More pointedly, they state that, if things continue, only 40,000 hectares of this primary karri forest will remain in the world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Overarching all of this is a pervasive concern about the lack of knowledge of the effect of present forest management policy on
        <break page="2082" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the ecological values of the karri forests. The precautionary approach is not being honoured. This effect will become increasingly clear after monitoring on the basis of the stability of the biodiversity pool; the effectiveness of buffer zones; the effectiveness of disease control measures, such as the control of dieback; how burning policy compares with true natural fire frequencies; how timber production affects ground water levels and salination; and what current forest management means for climate change. These issues need to be monitored on a true ecological time scale that extends well beyond the few months or years usually devoted to such monitoring programs.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Biodiversity works on a time scale of thousands of years while climate change works on a time scale of decades. We cannot ascertain changes to it in a forest management lunchtime. The precautionary approach is more essential than ever at this time in history.
       </para>

        The Dutch decision to reject south-west karri on the basis of its unsustainability is a development in international affairs that will have far-reaching ramifications for forestry management in Australia. This government can no longer hide its head in the sand from the truth of its environmental recklessness in our precious forests. We must radically rethink our approach to the management of our environment not only in the forests but across the whole spectrum of our day-to-day life.

However, information from industry indicates that there has been a noticeable increase in enquiries for kangaroo meat but these enquiries have yet to convert into actual orders.

        (a) With reference to fisheries resources in marine waters within the outer limit of Australia's exclusive economic zone, the Commonwealth's Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) has been able to identify 80 current research projects funded by it in which issues surrounding the breeding habits of fish species constitute some component. The sum of the total original budgets of these projects comes to some $18.4m, with funds being drawn from allocations over a number of financial years. It is not possible to accurately earmark a proportion of this amount against the components related to breeding habits. The CSIRO Division of Fisheries has estimated that, during 1995-96, it will have spent, from CSIRO funds, amounts of $0.4m, $0.4m and $0.9m respectively on pertinent research projects in the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery, south east fishery (SEF) and northern fisheries. A small number of current projects focusing on breeding habits are receiving funding from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) Research Fund or the Torres Strait Research and Monitoring Program (TSRMP). The total expenditure on these projects is to be under $0.2m.

The sum of the total original budgets of these projects comes to some $8.6m, with funds being drawn from allocations over a number of financial years. CSIRO Division of Fisheries has advised that it is currently involved in cooperative research with New South Wales Fisheries and the New South Wales fishing industry on gemfish and the SEF ecosystem habitat. Total CSIRO expenditure on these projects is of the order of $1m per annum.
