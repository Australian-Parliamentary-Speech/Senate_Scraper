         —My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Has the minister received a high level tutorial from her department on today's ANZ figures for job ads? Does the minister acknowledge that job ads are now at their lowest level since January 1994, that job ads have now fallen for four consecutive months and this is the first such sequence since the four months ended December 1991? Given the government's back&amp;hyphen;pedalling on the purported employment benefits of the workplace relations bill, how is the government going to reverse this disastrous trend? Where are the jobs going to come from and when will they materialise?

         —I thank the senator for his question. His reference to a high class tutorial comes from my using that remark in a Senate estimates committee on Friday. Simply to make the point: every month when the labour force statistics come out some of the most talented people, the people most equipped to discuss unemployment trends and statistics, come up to the office with an embargoed copy of those statistics and we discuss the pros and cons of what is happening in the labour market.

        Has that happened today with respect to the release of some ANZ material? No, so I cannot give you any further information on that matter. But, more importantly, Senator Bishop, you go to one of the most important questions facing this country; that is, where are the jobs going to come from and how are we going to generate them? There are two things to tell you with respect to that. First, they are certainly not going to come through a continuation of the make work schemes that the previous government—of which I accept you were not a member—wasted so much money on. That government spent something
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         like $700 million or $800 million in the last financial year on the three least effective brokered programs, programs with effectiveness outcome levels varying between the low 20s and low 30s. If you average that out at a 30 per cent effectiveness rate, you chucked 70 per cent of that $700 million to $800 million down the drain.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the first thing we are going to do is we are going to put the money that we have available for labour market programs and training into a new scheme, taking the best of Working Nation—the bit we think did work, the one on one case management—and building on it very substantially; and discarding the worst of Working Nation. So we will spend the labour market program money that we have far more effectively than your colleagues' previous government did, with a view to making sure, as best as possible, that when people get the benefit of labour market assistance they end up in a real job.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the question of the creation of real jobs, as you probably realise, Senator—although I know some of your colleagues do not—is an across government concern. In fact, it is an across the nation concern. You asked me how we are going to generate the real jobs into which people will go. Even given that we are revamping and improving the efficiency of the labour market programs, the jobs have to be there to put them into. I see you nodding and you understand that—I know that some of your colleagues do not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me tell you, Senator Bishop, that you say that we have walked away from the contribution that we believe a more flexible market will make, but nobody says it is not going to make any contribution and we think it will make a contribution at least. I do not think even you deny that. More importantly, one of the best things we can do to create real jobs is get the budget back into black, clean up Beazley's bankcard, the $8 billion deficit that you left us with, and give confidence to the business community to generate real jobs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the business community and the financial markets can see that this government is prepared to make the hard decisions to clean up the mess that you made, we have a really good chance of doing things like keeping

         —Senator Bishop, it might be of some surprise to you to understand that this government, unlike the previous government, works as a team. I have tried to explain it to you and I will take the opportunity to do it again. I speak to my department regularly, at least every month, in a fairly detailed way on unemployment issues and trends. That is what I just told you in the first answer. I do not need to ring up and say, `Please, could I have it in writing?' I speak to these people regularly and focus quite specifically on these issues when the labour force survey is released every month. I do not think you can necessarily put any great spin on that, which you are trying to do—I think it absolutely falls on deaf ears. This is unlike the previous government where then Minister Faulkner could not work with then Minister Beddall to such a degree that the cabinet was torn to shreds and someone else had to be given the job. Treasury looks after forecasts for this government.

        According to the HIA housing report, in the September quarter of 1996 housing became nearly 10 per cent more affordable for the average Australian first home buyer. The loan repayment needed on a typical first home mortgage fell from 20.7 per cent of household income in the June quarter of 1996 to 18.9 per cent in the September quarter. This has contributed to the figures which show that housing is now more affordable than at any time since mid&amp;hyphen;1994.

        For Victoria, as Senator Ferguson said, the index shows that housing is indeed now more affordable than at any time since the index was first introduced in 1984. Lower interest rates and higher family incomes helped increase housing affordability by 10 per cent in Melbourne and by 13.5 per cent in the rest of the state.

You might not agree, as I would put to you, that it was unfair and discriminatory. That policy restricted the ability of parents to choose non&amp;hyphen;government education, and it discriminated against parents whose children were in schools that had their funding limited regardless of the needs of that school.

         In view of the Commonwealth's national leadership role in school education, the government has rejected the recommendations of the Commission of Audit that schools funding be handed back to the states and territories—and I think they recommended at the same time that it be reduced by 10 per cent.

         The government does not favour one sector over the other. Commonwealth funding will follow the student, as I explained in the Senate last week. The budget provided for the enrolment benchmark adjustment that would reduce the incentive of the states and territories to shift students to non&amp;hyphen;government schools. It is a perfectly simple matter for people to try to get across—perhaps it is not as simple as one might imagine in the beginning but it is, in the end, pretty simple: what the states are trying to do is shift the share of students over to the Commonwealth.

         Why are they trying to do that? They are trying to do that because the Commonwealth funds to a larger extent the students in non&amp;hyphen;government schools, and that is why the states are interested in shifting the share of students over that way. That is absolutely why they are interested in doing that, and that is why we are keen to put a stop to that. It is estimated that since 1983 the shift of students to non-government schools has saved the states and territories more than $3 billion.

         We have an important commitment to government schools and we believe that, if you take into account the specific purpose payments and the FAGS, students in  government schools will actually get a per capita increase.

        What you perhaps get wrong, if I may suggest it, by the inference in your question, is that these figures were used in some way to justify the proposed changes to HECS in Australia, as if somehow the ERC and cabinet sat around and said, `What does everyone else do? Hell, let's go along that line.' If that is the suggestion you are putting, it is an incorrect suggestion. Those figures were used merely to fill in the picture and give an indication of what charges were elsewhere. So

        Let me tell you what was the basis for the decision to increase the HECS contribution, and I have probably got enough time to outline why we thought we would shift to a differentiated HECS as well, why we think that is fairer and more equitable. The first thing to consider is: why have an increase in the HECS contribution in any event? Students get an enormous private benefit from graduating from university. You know that, I know that and all of your party knows that. That is why your party introduced the higher education contribution scheme. It is a recognition that universities have a private benefit and a public benefit. The HECS charge is meant to be an acknowledgment of the private benefit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe that the private benefit is not adequately recognised in the HECS contribution paid thus far. Senator, you might like to look at the World Bank report which was very kindly drawn to my attention by Senator Stott&amp;hyphen;Despoja, which points out that, with the quantity of people going to university from higher socioeconomic groups, the subsidy of tuition fees by the Commonwealth is redistributing funds to the wealthier in the community. You might like to take that into account as well, although that was not in my mind or drawn to my attention when we were making the decision to increase the contribution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But it does bear repeating and understanding that roughly 15 per cent of Australians in the work force have been to university; 25 per cent of school leavers now go to university. When I attended a speech day for one of Adelaide's best private schools on Saturday, I was told that the percentage from that school who go to university is 85 per cent. That was the percentage from a wealthier private school. So if you want to maintain a situation where we should continue to subsidise the tuition fees of children of wealthy people and you do not think we should ask for a greater contribution from those students, then you run out and argue that case. But I am going to run out and argue the other case—that these people get an enormous private benefit. They are very substantially
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         subsidised by the taxpayer and it is fair to ask for a higher contribution.

       <para first-indent="16">
        With respect to the differentiated HECS, we have picked up the recommendations of former Labor premier Neville Wran, who recognised that it is completely unfair and inequitable to charge the same per annum contribution of a teacher with a low cost course at a lower income later in life, as it is to ask of a doctor with a high cost course and a higher income later in life. Senator, if you want to tell teachers they should pay the same as doctors, you go to it. But you won't find me with you.

        It is possible to compare student performance over time because of the presence of common items. You can give any school a base test to any adult, and they will probably get some of the items wrong. This does not invalidate the test. The basic point—which all Mr Toohey's commentary nonetheless does not obscure—is that since 1975 there has been no basic improvement in basic reading comprehension skills for a significant number of year 9 students and the performance of boys has worsened.

        Your government, the former government, introduced a means test designed to get at those people who can so structure their affairs as to have a very small taxable income and to hide assets. We support you on that. We think you did the right thing to get at those sorts of people. We are changing the means test in the sense of changing the way we ascertain the means of a person, but not essentially the levels. So, frankly, I do not think there is an argument here.

The situation is that some weeks ago Mr Laurie Ferguson wrote to the Presiding Officers asking for permission, asking for an opportunity, to display some photographs of World War II in relation to that area. That has been agreed to. The time for the exhibition has not yet been agreed. Initially, they wanted it, I think, on 11 November. That was not possible within the structure of exhibitions because there are exhibitions booked in the Presiding Officers' area up until some time in 1998.

So the question you raised last week when you wrote me a letter about a Dili exhibition is, as I have told you in a letter, a matter that has come up since the last meeting the Presiding Officers had and will be on the agenda for the next meeting.

Another suggestion is that when it came to the crunch Europe stuck together and, rather than deciding that there should be one European member and one from elsewhere, they decided that if they had the numbers it would be better to have two from Europe. Certainly, it was a disappointing result to us. A lot of work had been done in past years under your government and ours to try to achieve success in that vote. We think we could have made a very useful contribution in the Security Council. It is important that, having lost, we learn from the experience.

        In fact, unfortunately, much of the unsatisfactory human rights record of the Burmese regime has been built up through the isolation of Burma. There is an argument that, by isolating Burma, all you will do is strengthen the hand of the SLORC. So each of these initiatives has to be examined carefully as to whether they might bring about an effective result.

The first is to close the Austrade office in Rangoon. Considering how many officers of Austrade are being retrenched, I think that closing the Austrade office in Rangoon would be a very good move.

        Housing affordability is now at a two-year high. In some cities the index is the highest that it has ever been and, of course, that is welcome news for home buyers. But home buyers are not the only beneficiaries, Senator Tierney; low income renters are also going to be beneficiaries of it. Of the 1.2 million low income renters in Australia, over 900,000 are in the private sector. For them, the level of housing affordability is going to have a

        One of the concerns which are motivating reform of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is that we need to involve the private sector more in the provision of low cost housing. The public sector is just not doing its job. For example, in 1988-89 the various state housing authorities built 14,000 new homes but by 1995 that number was down to 5,000, despite the fact that funding levels had not changed. If nothing changes in coming years, no new homes will be built and the Commonwealth's funding will just be chewed up in maintenance and administration, as has increasingly been happening over the last few years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The solution is to involve the private sector more, both in the capital funding of public housing and in the provision in the private sector. Lower interest rates can help that process—something which the Housing Industry Association, I am glad to see, has also recognised. If we can get more landlords providing cheaper accommodation to low income renters and also providing greater rental assistance to low income people, we can alleviate one of the great causes of poverty in this country—excessive housing costs. To keep housing costs down and to encourage this process, it is vital that the government's budget comes through this chamber intact. Every extra cent taken from the public purse puts pressure on interest rates. It would be a terrible shame if this did not happen because cheaper housing for both home buyers and renters would go a long way to relieving poverty for the long term.

       <para first-indent="16">
        From the chattering classes on the opposite side of the chamber, it is clear that, despite their time in government, they have not recognised that the Social Security Department's research makes it very clear that the people who are receiving rent assistance through the Department of Social Security, who are on low incomes, are renting right across the geographical areas of Australian cities and towns, and right across the rental levels. In other words, people are sometimes sacrificing their standard of living in order to be able to afford a standard of housing.

         That has been the choice for a number of years of people renting in the private market, even though they are on low income. We say that that is right and proper, that they have that choice. But at the moment there is an inadequate rent assistance for those people. What we want to do is make sure that there are sufficient people investing in the private system and that there be quality accommodation for low income earners to rent.

         The minister was asked to explain this. She simply cannot, because what she has engaged in is a whole issue of myth making. It is not about fact; it is not about understanding.

         The budget estimates in particular seem to be most flexible. We have seen a situation where, within a two&amp;hyphen;month period, this government has presented to the Senate a figure for the cost of its new schools policy, which has then changed, in terms of a submission presented to the Senate legislation committee last Friday—an increase of some $50 million dollars within a period of only two months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is quite an extraordinary flexibility. Last Friday we saw this exercise in myth&amp;hyphen;making taken a step further with Minister Kemp indicating that he was seeking to pre&amp;hyphen;empt the states grants bill inquiry by the Senate legislation committee with a claim that this government was seeking to increase expenditure for school education by $1.5 billion. Nothing could be further from the truth in terms of the statements already given to this parliament through the budget process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality of this story is simple: such an attempt to repackage this budget will, of course, fail because it is predicated on a total myth. That myth is very simply this: rather than increasing money for schools, particularly for public education, this budget is about reducing money for public education. What we see is that this figure of $177 million in tied grants has been taken from government schools while there is, in fact, an increase in the non&amp;hyphen;government school sector of $150 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now, of course, what these calculations are based upon is that undermining, false claim that somehow or other we can add together the monies provided by the commonwealth to the states for financial assistance grants—the FAGs. We can add together special purpose grants and then we can divide by the number of students in this country and then somehow you get an improved number for spending on schools overall. And, of course, the minister
         <break page="4987" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          has failed to take away from his calculations the $1.5 billion that this Commonwealth government has already deducted from the states at the June premiers' conference.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is abundantly clear what these lies are. Instead, around 24 per cent of FAGs actually end up being spent on government schools, but only two per cent will be spent on non&amp;hyphen;government schools. Now, of course, it is wrong to rely upon those states like Victoria, which has set out over the last four years to undermine the public education system. To rely upon those same states to replace the moneys that the Commonwealth is taking out of the education system, of course, is to fly in the face of all reality.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now, Minister Vanstone has sought to repeat these myths in such a way as to try to give the impression that this government is actually spending money—which it is not. Under their new, proposed, deregulated schools policy, the enrolment adjustment benchmarking program that they have undertaken will see $177 million actually taken away from the public sector. And, of course, rather than working with the states as this minister states, governments—such as those of Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales—have all categorically condemned this government for its unilateral action in undermining public education and from taking money away from the states rather than adding money to it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we are talking about cost shifting, as this minister did today. What we see is a situation where the Commonwealth is seeking to shift costs to the states in such a manner as to fundamentally undermine the public education system. For the first time in the history of this country, the Commonwealth government is actually turning its back on its obligations to public education and the children of this country.

On a number of occasions she has misled the Senate and Senate estimates committees and has then come back to correct her information.

         —Last Friday the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, David Kemp, announced an unbelievable proposition to Australia; that was, that this government had actually increased funding to the government school area. That reminded me of the events that occurred in the televised world series wrestling. In this case, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, was on the ropes and ready to go down for the third of the best of three falls. Minister Kemp has jumped into the ring to try to save her from that third fall. This is an unbelievable proposition.

        As we have just heard from Senator Carr, when the budget was announced cuts to the government school sector totalled $128 million; they are now almost $177 million. That is according to the most recent answers that we have been given by Minister Vanstone and her departmental staff in relation to the impact of the abolition of the new schools policy and the application of the enrolment benchmark measure to the funding of the schools sector in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There clearly is a case of cost shifting to the states in this area, and a big question mark hangs over what is going to happen to the funding of both the government and the non&amp;hyphen;government school sectors arising from this policy. The minister and departmental staff have consistently said that what happens with the funding of schools in the states is going to be left to the states, that they are going to be freed up to make their decisions. When you look at the regulation of the non-government schools that applies in the various states, it is pretty clear that they have relied upon the Labor new schools policy as a de facto means of regulating the education sector. There is no doubt it is on the public
        <break page="4989" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Labor had announced and established a review of that policy to finetune it. This government is simply saying, `We will sweep all of this away and, as we do so, we are going to make some massive changes to the funding of the sector.' We have been told that we will now see at least $177 million go from the state sector. We have been told that the non&amp;hyphen;government sector will get an additional $150 million from the enrolment benchmark measure. But if that figure is as rubbery as the figure that relates to the reduction in funding in the government sector, perhaps we can expect that there will be an even greater increase in funding to the non-government sector.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         None of the private school areas are able to give us any real estimate of the effect of these measures in terms of the additional funds they will be receiving from the Commonwealth. Some would have us believe that there will be a small impact. Some would have us believe that there will be no impact at all, which makes a deception of the figures announced by this government. There are others who say that the impact of this measure will be to greatly increase the funding of the non-government sector and to reduce the funding of the government sector, perhaps to the effect of doubling the funding of the non-government sector and reducing the funding of the government sector by as much as 20 per cent over a five&amp;hyphen; to 10&amp;hyphen;year period. So we have had a variety of answers on this question.

        The answers that the minister has given today and earlier are demonstrative of the fact that even the minister does not know just how much of an impact these measures are going to have.

It is a disgraceful policy approach by this government, an approach that can only destabilise the government education sector.

It is going to destabilise it; it is going to destroy schools. It will see the educational opportunities for 70 per cent of Australians reduced on the basis of choice, a choice which is going to be exercised against the interests of the majority.

        We do live in a liberal democracy. We do have choices in all areas of life. There is public and private provision in many areas of life. Listening to the evidence in the hearings we are having on the schools bill, one would think that there should not be any choice, that parents do not have a right to spend their own money on sending their children to private schools. It is as though we were back in the old Russia or the old eastern Europe. For some reason people think it is a terrible thing that parents are putting in money for their children's private school education and that the state should in some way support that.

        I put to the Senate that if we did have a totally public education system and no private education system, which some of these people opposite seem to want, we would have to find $1&amp;half; billion extra to support the schooling system.

        In this country, by rough measure, two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the children go to public schools and one&amp;hyphen;third go to private schools. There are natural barriers to increasing that number—something which people opposite do not seem to understand. Even though it has been stated in surveys that 95 per cent of parents would like to send their child to a private school, obviously they are not going to do it because of the cost.

A dramatic change is not going to occur in the balance between private and public schools, but this new policy will give parents who want to send their children to a private school the opportunity to do that.

        We have heard in the debate today, and also in the hearings, that there is a cost shift between the two sectors. For some reason, the opposition feel that state schools are going to be disadvantaged and private schools advantaged. But what they use in terms of figures is just propaganda because, of the $3,400 involved, half of that money leaves with the pupil if he moves from a public to a private school, but half the money stays in the school, with no movement at all and without the child to support because he has moved off to the private sector. People get up here and say the state schools are being disadvantaged. In reality they are left with the money even though the pupil has left. What is the disadvantage in that? We have had quite a number of people outside the parliament spreading propaganda on this matter. The head of the Teachers Federation had her name on a document which has gone around a whole series of schools and spread a whole series of untruths about this.

         Subject to agreement by the opposition parties, this bill could be dealt with as a non-controversial bill to be passed in the current sittings period. The measures in this bill and the benefits of securing its early passage are explained below.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Schedule 1 makes payments of financial assistance from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust to persons with medically acquired HIV infection and AIDS (and payments to the dependants and carers of such persons) exempt assets for the purposes of the assets test consistent with an undertaking given by a former Minister for Social Security, the Hon Peter Baldwin. Such payments are already exempt income for the purposes of the income test. Since the Schedule 1 amendments commence on the date of Royal Assent, an earlier passage of the legislation would financially benefit persons for whom it is often critical to receive financial assistance as early as possible.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Schedule 2 allows the continuation of automatic transfer of mature age partner allowees to wife pension when their mature age allowance partners transfer to age pension after 30 June 1995. Mature age partner allowees in that situation lost access to wife pension as an unintended consequence of the decision to phase out wife pension from 1 July 1995. Currently, they are paid an equivalent to wife pension by way of ex-gratia payments. These amendments commence on the date of Royal Assent. An earlier passage of the legislation would provide earlier legislative authority for payment of wife pensions to the affected women that would remove the necessity of relying in this respect on ex-gratia payments.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Schedule 3 contains two measures. The first measure corrects a technical fault in the Method Statement in point 1210-A1 of the Social Security Act to ensure that the Method statement provides a mechanism for the correct calculation of a `notional family payment rate'. The second measure amends saving provisions in clause 54 of Schedule 1A of the Social Security Act to continue the effect of this clause and so ensure that the results of the application of the Method Statement are correct. Customers affected by the operation of this clause are currently being paid correct amounts from funds advanced for that purpose by the Minister for Finance for the period that ends on 1 January 1997. The amendments made by the second measure commence on the day of Royal Assent. An earlier passage of the legislation would provide earlier
         <break page="4996" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          legislative authority for the payment of correct amounts to affected customers.

         Schedule 4 corrects an unintended error made by the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Act 1992 to Pension Rate Calculator A in the Social Security Act. This will ensure that the pre-1 January 1993 position for the treatment of reduction of ordinary income of a person who is a member of a couple and whose partner is receiving a social security or service pension, is re-instated.

        —I thank the Senate. When I saw the wording of Senator Cooney's notice of motion No. 293, I felt a level of concern and discomfort. The reason for that is that it is in three parts: it notes the beatification of Edmund Rice as the founder of the Christian Brothers in Ireland—and that is obviously a statement of a matter of fact; it remembers the coming to Australia of the Christian Brothers and says that from that time `they have given unceasing service to education initiative this country. . . '; and in part (c) it expresses its appreciation of the dedication of the Christian Brothers in Australia and says that it hopes they will go on to serve the community well in the years ahead.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       My concern is that there is an ongoing level of community concern as well about the incidents that have occurred, certainly in the past, in relation to children in the charge of Christian Brothers in schools and in other establishments. I certainly acknowledge that there are a great many people in Australia who owe their entire education to the Christian Brothers. I am quite happy to acknowledge that there are many people who are very grateful for that.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I will not be opposing the formality of this motion, but I will be voting against the motion. I think it is reasonable, if the majority of the Senate wish to vote for it, for me not to stand in the way of that and not to force a full debate. I contacted the group called Voices in Western Australia to see if my concerns were founded and I read through the wording of the motion.

        of this motion. They indicated that they would. In some ways, there are some parallels in relation to `the stolen generation'; the very first thing that must happen before real healing can occur is that there is proper recognition. If nothing else within my time in the Senate, I want to provide some voice for the voiceless, as that is necessary. As I say, it is not a comment on the general nature of Christian Brothers education, but it is a statement for those people who are still struggling for recognition and have not yet got the recognition or the acceptance of liability that I believe they deserve.

Practically not a day goes by without the opposition coming in here and attempting to tie up the administration of government in this country by a spurious return to order. We did not adopt this practice. Occasionally, when there was a serious matter to which this mechanism was appropriate, that is, requiring documents pursuant to an order to be tabled, we utilised the process.

        —By way of explanation, we are seeking documents here. We have not taken this position lightly. It is a critical issue that we are talking about here. We are talking about the implementation of the gun buy-back scheme. We are talking about the application of money raised from the taxpayer to ensure that the scheme is implemented properly and extensively.

       If we had taken the approach that Senator Hill suggests that we were taking, that approach being of frustration, then we could have very easily moved the process of suspending standing orders and embarking upon a debate. It was I who offered to Senator Hill a fast&amp;hyphen;track proposal for this, one that he was very keen to pursue. In terms of our discussion I acknowledge that where things are commercial-in-confidence there will be a fair degree of acceptance of those documents having their commercial-in-confidence aspects.

        So Senator Hill, we are not being destructive or frustrating you here. What we are saying is that there are some important documents, some important issues, some important information that needs to be seen by the public and by the Senate. For instance, during the estimates process the opposition tackled these issues through both the finance and public administration and legal and constitu tional affairs legislation committees. We are awaiting further information that we have not got through that process.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       One of the reasons that we want to pursue the reopening of this committee in the same way as the other committee is being reopened is to ensure that the information that we are given can be tested. You cannot test one side of the argument without testing the other. The government has accepted that they will reconvene the finance and public administration estimates process. It is important to reconvene this one as well. We are talking here about the agency that purchased the contract—Attorney-General's. They are the agency with responsibility for the funding, for spending the funding and for running the campaign.

       Since the last estimates hearings, some three weeks ago, we have seen corrections by the government of evidence provided at that estimates proceeding by Mr Smeaton and by Senator Kemp, correcting a very critical piece of information as to whether Mr Morris's intervention ensured the listing of DDB Needham on the short list, on the list to be considered, or whether that had already taken place beforehand. In the estimates process we were told that Mr Morris's intervention had nothing do with the company being listed. Senator Kemp had to come in here and embarrassingly apologise for the fact that the evidence was wrong and that it was Mr Morris's letter which ensured that this company, this tender, got into the ballpark.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There are inconsistencies between AG's and DAS in the information provided to us. So we need to clear it up at both ends. We need to clear up a whole range of questions that have been left unanswered. For instance, we know that three documents of advice have gone to the government in respect of DDB Needham. Elliott and Shanahan declared it to be a pretty poor tender and claimed that in no sense of the word was it up to scratch. OGIA, the government information agency, also advised the government that it should steer clear of and not touch DDB Needham with a barge pole.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
        The one document we do not have is the advice from the Attorney-General's Depart ment to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). We need to get that to address questions such as: why did the Attorney-General not take a position on this particular campaign when it was so critical to the implementation of the government's buy-back program? We need to find out on whose advice the focus of the campaign was changed. There is a whole range of issues that need to be addressed—issues of inconsistency and issues which go to tackling parts of the problem and not just concentrating on the perspective of the finance and government operation, Department of Administrative Services.

       The campaign has not started and it is five weeks late already. The campaign was supposed to start in October this year. We have not as yet seen the creative work. We do not know, and we should know by now, to what extent integration with the states—a critical part of the campaign—has proceeded. All these issues need to be addressed and this is why we have moved for a re-opening of the estimates process in the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in the same way that the process has been reopened in the finance and public administration committee. As I have said, documents are critical. We are not being `frustrative'; we are being constructive, and to that extent we are taking this approach with the government. Otherwise, Senator Hill, you know quite well we could be here all afternoon dragging this out, and that is not what we want to do.

         If there was any case for this, if there was an argument that something had been missed before or at the last hearing, then it might be a different matter, but no attempt has been made to develop a case for it other than that the opposition wants another go at it. In other words, it wants to drag the committee members out, and all the public servants, to run through it again just in case the opposition had forgotten a question on the last occasion and out of that fishing trip it might gain something for which it thinks it can get some political mileage. This turns the process into a farce, I would suggest. For that reason, this should be opposed.

         There was another question asked at the administrative services committee that dealt with the same matter and an answer was given that was subsequently found to be incorrect.

          proper for them to do so and we agreed, without having to come in here and fight the numbers, to that committee being re-opened to explore that matter. That did not seem to us to be unreasonable. A mistake had been made; it had been corrected, but nevertheless that does in our view give the opposition a legitimate opportunity to come back and say it wants to explore the consequences of the now correct answer.

The money for this campaign run by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department comes from the Medicare levy which was extended and paid for in good faith by Australian taxpayers. That department has had to come back to the Senate to correct one answer, as Senator Hill indicated in respect of DAS. We have had the same situation in respect of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board—their chief executive officer had to also correct an answer. On that basis, Senator Hill, I think you would be inclined to change your mind and accept that there has been a correction of evidence here.

        Through this bill, the government is further encouraging the participation of equity groups in higher education by introducing up to 4,000 merit equity scholarships between 1997 and 2000. The scholarships will provide a Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) exemption to recipients, and will be awarded by universities on the basis of merit, consistent with guidelines. The scholarships may only be accessed by members of a nominated equity group.

        This initiative is in addition to maintenance of the existing higher education equity program at an annual cost of $5.8 million, providing incentive funding to institutions to achieve improved outcomes for students from equity groups.

        The bill introduces additional opportunities and choice for Australian students by removing the prohibitions on offering fee&amp;hyphen;paying places to Australian undergraduate students. This will remove the existing anomaly in the treatment of Australian and overseas students.

        This measure will enable Australian students to have a greater chance of obtaining the higher education course of their first preference, freeing up government funded places they would have otherwise accepted with their second or third preference. It will also generate additional income for the universities and will provide an extra incentive for diversity among institutions.

        The overwhelming majority of students will continue to contribute to the costs of their education through the HECS alone.

        The number of fee&amp;hyphen;paying places available to Australian undergraduate students will be limited to twenty five per cent of domestic undergraduate students in any course. If an institution offers fee&amp;hyphen;paying places while at the same time failing to fill its undergraduate target with HECS&amp;hyphen;liable students, a financial penalty of $9,000 will apply for each place.

        Under current funding arrangements, if universities enrol more than the target number of Australian students, they receive no extra funding even though the Commonwealth receives HECS payments from the students. The government is removing this anomaly.

        From 1998, universities will be paid the equivalent of the minimum up&amp;hyphen;front HECS payment for each HECS&amp;hyphen;liable undergraduate student enrolled above the target level. This provides some recognition of the costs incurred by institutions which over&amp;hyphen;enrol. It will also present an opportunity for institutions with low marginal costs to offer additional places to undergraduate students without charging fees.

        The bill introduces differential HECS contributions from 1997. This measure strikes a better balance between the public and private funding of higher education. Students will now be required to make a contribution to the cost of their education which is more closely linked to both the actual cost of the course undertaken and the likely future benefits to the individual in terms of increased life&amp;hyphen;time earnings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides that the new HECS charges will apply in three bands: $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500. Each unit of study will be allocated to one of the bands. A student commencing a course in 1997 will have their HECS debt calculated according to the distribution of their units between each of the three bands. The student will be charged at the appropriate band amount for each unit, rather than being charged at the same band for all units.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In introducing the new differential HECS arrangements, the amendments ensure that no existing student will have an unanticipated increase in the cost of their current course. The government will not be increasing the HECS charge or debt levels for existing debtors or for HECS&amp;hyphen;liable students in their current courses. The new charges will only apply to students commencing a new course after 1 January 1997. The arrangements retain the essential features of HECS and ensure that no qualified student is prevented from entering higher education because of an inability to pay at the time of enrolment.

        Consistent with this measure, the bill also enables the open learning agency of Australia to set its fees at a level it considers appropriate. At present, the agency is constrained by its agreement with the Commonwealth to charge for undergraduate units at a fixed price. If this constraint is not lifted, the
        <break page="5007" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also provides new HECS repayment thresholds, which will mean that individual HECS debtors repay their debt more quickly. The provisions retain seven repayment levels, but set them at lower levels. No student will be required to make HECS repayments until their income reaches the minimum threshold set out in the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The lowering of the minimum threshold to $20,701 means that the current discount for voluntary payment at this income level will be discontinued. The repayment required at this income level will be less than $12 per week. The existing discounts of twenty five per cent for up&amp;hyphen;front payments and fifteen per cent for voluntary payments of $500 at any time, will remain.

        A new section 20a of the act will clarify that advances of operating grants may be made for a broad range of purposes, consistent with ministerial guidelines. Those guidelines will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and enable advances to be made for redundancy expenses and to assist institutions with the costs associated with restructuring.

        The bill makes amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to rectify an inequity with the mature age partner provisions. From 1 July 1995, wife pension and mature age partner allowance were phased out. However, those people who had claimed these payments and were qualified for them before that date were "saved" from the effect of the changes. The savings provision did not operate as intended for the mature age partner allowance. For example, when a disability pensioner turns 65 years of age and is automatically transferred to age pension, it

        This bill also makes amendments to continue the effect of savings provisions in clause 54 of Schedule 1A. Clause 54 provides a series of savings provisions which applied to maintain the status quo of various groups of family allowance recipients who were overseas when the family payment regime commenced operation on 1 January 1993. If not for these savings provisions, these people, who formerly received an add&amp;hyphen;on for dependent children as a component of their pension, would not have been qualified for the new family payment.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, clause 54 makes reference to "additional family payment", which ceased to exist on 1 January 1996. In the absence of the amendments made by this bill, clause 54 would not operate to provide the correct rate of payment for these people.

        You quite rightly point out that we regarded, as a result of the evidence given to us, that the employee ombudsman model, as shown in South Australia, was a very admirable model and one which seemed to work very well. It remains our preferred model. But the essence is that the government did not agree at this stage to introducing our preference and wished to take the development of this institution along the lines they originally envisaged. As a consequence, there may be areas of some conflict which could develop,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        My own belief is that we should give the government the opportunity to experiment and to live with this for a while. We should give the unions the opportunity to deal with and interact with that institution. We should give employer organisations the opportunities to deal with and interact with that organisation so that, in due course, after some months of experimentation and understanding as to how it is to work, they can make the appropriate recommendations for its further development. It is, in my view—and obviously yours—not going to be perfect, as it is envisaged. But the government badly want it to work, so I am quite sure that, if it does not work as effectively as they might want it to, they are likely to look favourably at changes.

        If matters came up that required any prosecution, that would not be the core role of that agency—those matters would be handed to another agency. Apparently that is the case with industrial award inspectors, for example, where, if they find a breach, they would then refer it to Attorney-General's for prosecution.

        The fair answer is that, if you wanted to define all of those matters in the bill, you would reduce the flexibility that the Employment Advocate and the Office of the Employment Advocate will have when they are established. As Senator Murray quite rightly said, this is something that the government wants to make work. Either you can be quite prescriptive, and limit the Employment Advocate's opportunities, or you can ensure that the objects and the intentions are implemented in the way we have described.

Senator Evans, the evidence before the Senate inquiry clearly indicated—in fact proved—that there are groups of employees and, indeed, groups of employers, and individual employees and employers, who have relative advantages and disadvantages in the bargaining process. Coming from a side of the chamber which is well represented in union negotiation, you would understand that to be a truth.

        Our intention, which I think I spelt out in earlier remarks made last week, was that the standard even&amp;hyphen;handed arbitration and conciliation process of the AIRC should, wherever possible, be supplemented in this legislation by a bias towards those who are disadvantaged. It is quite plain that, in the early days of the establishment of this new institution, the way in which that is to be implemented is still up in the air, and you quite rightly point out that that is not yet spelt out finitely. But I think the parliamentary secretary is correct in wanting to leave that open ended and let

        I should make the point that amongst a number of  consequences of the amendment process will be requirements that all AWAs include appropriate provisions on discrimination, that an AWA is offered to all comparable employees, that the employer explain the effect of an AWA to the employee, and that the employee genuinely consented to making an AWA. If the employer is explaining the effect of an AWA to a non-English speaking person, plainly that person is potentially at a disadvantage unless it has been properly presented. We would expect the Employment Advocate to have consideration for that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We say that these considerations will be most important in the development of the information statement prepared by the Employment Advocate, which all employers will be required to give to employees prior to signing an AWA. Whilst you may wish to categorise these statements about disadvantaged employees as somewhat motherhood, we are hopeful that they can be developed into a proper protection which does not currently exist.

         —I appreciate Senator Murray's intervention and that of the parliamentary secretary. I will, however, make a couple of points, because I do not seem to be able to get the answers I want as to how this operates in practice. The first thing is that, from reading the report of the committee looking into the bill, I understood that those concerns that were raised in evidence were the very concerns that led Senator Murray to recommend the separation of the offices to an advocate and an ombudsman's role to deal with that very conflict. I do not want to labour the point but, again, we do not see that contained in the legislation or the agreed amendments.

        The second aspect is that one of the reasons these workers are at a disadvantage is that they are being discouraged and prevented, in some instances, from collectively bargaining. We are not giving any encouragement to collective bargaining, so in many cases they
        <break page="5014" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         will be negotiating these agreements individually and relying on the employer to explain to them their rights. Anyone with any modicum of experience in industrial relations knows that there is potential for abuse.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point I make is that, from my experience of the Western Australian system, there are allegedly protections in terms of people having agreements explained to them, along with the workplace commissioner allegedly protecting people's rights. The reality of the experience is quite different from that. The commissioner merely seeks some acknowledgment from the workers that they have some idea of what they are signing, then does no more. A number of documented cases were presented in evidence to the committee about how unsuccessful that has been.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other reason for my cynicism is that the last time the coalition had a go at industrial relations legislation at the federal level, they introduced a similar clause in the charter of the Industrial Relations Bureau which called for a particular focal point on non-English speaking workers. That, quite frankly, was an unmitigated failure. They never achieved any of their objectives in looking after those people disadvantaged by an inability to speak English. It really is, in my view, a sop. We have not had any proper explanation of how someone can advise an employer and, at the same time, take some proactive role in trying to redress the disadvantaged bargaining position that the legislation recognises. It is a nonsense. There is no explanation, and that is why one has not been presented.

I propose: wouldn't the propositions put forward by the opposition perhaps broaden the present position to the point you would seem to be wanting it brought to? Senator Murray, the amendments that you are proposing to schedule 3, item 2, page 8, after line 14, at the end of section 83BB, would not seem to broaden the present 83BB functions to the extent that you might want.

        Having said that in jest, I do want to make a couple of serious points. The first is that it is self&amp;hyphen;evident to everyone in this chamber and listening that the government definitely gave up what they did not want to give up and the Australian Democrats definitely did not get everything we wanted to get.

        Since we are dealing with the amendments 1 to 12 reviewing the whole area of the Employment Advocate, I really do want to respond to the question of limbo. It is my view that the government have very properly said, `We have to deal with an area of individual agreements between employees and employers which, at this point in time, are informal. They are out there but they are in some sort of legal limbo.'
       </para>

        You and I both know that two&amp;hyphen;thirds of employees are not unionised. You and I both know—and I use the collective `you', not the disrespectful `you'—that large numbers of employees are presently on verbal contracts. It is my belief—and has been my belief consistently—that the introduction of Australian workplace agreements, provided that the protections are there, will contribute to a better legal relationship between employees and employers than presently exists. That is one of the reasons that we are prepared to give the government—to use a colloquialism—a fair go in the development of this institution and in the Australian workplace agreements area.

        I can see you are dying to hop onto your feet to debate this issue.

        Yes, there have always been many hundreds, and probably millions, of agreements that are verbal—so&amp;hyphen;called over&amp;hyphen;award agreements that are usually verbal, sometimes in writing. These agreements—in limbo, as you refer to them—will always exist. If you believe what you have just said, the Office of Employment Advocate, as we understand very clearly in this bill, is not to try to take some sort of control of or act as some sort of imprimatur on currently verbal agreements. I am sure that is not what the government has in mind.

        We question the whole reasoning for the creation of the Employment Advocate. As we pointed out earlier, the Department of Industrial Relations provides advice and assistance about awards and AWAs at the moment. We have investigations into breaches or contraventions. The commission also has a role in respect of the filing of AWAs. Why create another organisation to oversee these jurisdictions where this work is already being carried out? It is a duplication. I thought this government was all about cutting away duplication, not adding to it.

        The other contradiction, Senator Murray, that you admit—through you, Mr Chairman—is the contradiction between the representational role for employees and employers. If an employee who has a complaint complains to the Employment Advocate and then the Employment Advocate interviews the employer, who is the Employment Advocate to represent? They have to make a choice. There is a clear conflict there. This government does not recognise the clear conflict of interest about shares and they certainly cannot recognise it here. Senator Murray, you recognise it, yet you are supporting the government's position and you are not supporting an

Well, we are going to experiment with conflict, knowing there is going to be conflict of interest. You say that this is not going to be perfect.

        This amendment contains two new definitions for exceptional matters orders and regular part&amp;hyphen;time employees. Exceptional matters orders are to be an important part of the protection for employees under the new amended act. These will allow the AIRC to arbitrate on issues that are exceptional, that is, outside the allowable matters where the parties cannot agree and where the outcome would otherwise be harsh or unjust.

        These exceptional matters orders are not designed to ensure that the commission has the powers to fulfil the object of the act of providing for a labour market that is fair as well as flexible. They will provide a particular level of protection for employees in a weak bargaining position who might otherwise be unable to prevent an employer imposing a harsh or unjust outcome on them.

        The definition of regular part&amp;hyphen;time employee is also important. This definition is based

         on the wording of the AIRC itself in the personal carer's leave case. In particular, the AIRC will be required under proposed section 143(1)(caa) to ensure that awards, where appropriate, contain part&amp;hyphen;time employment provisions. This should accelerate the acceptance of part&amp;hyphen;time work across awards, combined with a ban introduced by this bill on quotas and maximum hours for part&amp;hyphen;time employees.

        Our amendment amends these new objects in the following ways—and this encapsulates our opposition to the proposals the government has in this bill and with respect to its amendment 17. Firstly, we say that minimum wages and conditions must be protected and maintained at relevant and fair levels by the award system. Secondly, we say that awards must provide relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions. Thirdly—and this is a key point that I hope Senator Murray will have some regard to—whilst accepting that awards must be suited to the efficient performance of work, we add that the interests of employees must also be taken into account.

        For 100 years—Senator Murray may not be aware of this—one of the objects of the act since Federation has been the settlement of industrial disputes. It seems to us that that is still a fundamental—a core, if we want to use current parlance in respect of promises—commitment or object that should be included in this section. What is more fundamental than encouraging the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes? Why doesn't it appear here, Senator Murray? It should do. We would argue strongly, Senator Murray, that you should support the inclusion of this in this section. My colleagues intend to make some further observations about these provisions.

We never did find what was meant by `fair'. We discovered it could mean anything from a fairground carousel to moderately good. If that is what stands between something reasonable for workers and potential exploitation, I am not very hopeful, I am afraid. With regard to `awards are simplified', that is one way of putting it.

I am just wondering what the additional words in the amendment envisage.

        It would seem to mean that somehow the commission, on its own initiative, is going to establish and maintain a system of enforceable awards. I would be interested to know how that could happen. In paragraph (b) you have changed the words `are confined in their scope' to `act as a safety net'. Again, I wonder what real effect that change will have. When it says `confined in their scope to a safety net', that means it cannot be any more than that, but when you use the words `act as a safety net' it cannot mean any more than being a safety net.

With respect to awards now referring to what are just safety nets—so we no longer have what we have regarded for near on a century as the award system but rather just safety nets, which might just as well be 20 minimum standards rather than an award system—and given that is what we are left with in this bill, I did not take Senator Murray literally when he was saying that

Minimum rates awards provide more than the mere safety net, for `safety net' implies an absolute minimum of conditions. While the provision of a safety net is a desirable object of awards, this new object makes it quite clear that the existence of a safety net is one of the reasons, but clearly not the sole reason, for awards.

        Senator Campbell, I give you this illustration which might help you to understand the question more, and I would also appreciate Senator Murray's response. We have awards of the commission at the moment. There are quite clearly awards where there are provisions that will not fit into the 18 allowable matters. They may not also be incidental to the 18 allowable matters. I am sure senators on this side of the chamber can give you numerous examples, and you are probably aware of some; I gave one in a speech not so long ago. The question then is: can they be brought in under the head of `exceptional'? That is a test it would appear you are putting forward as something that the commission can determine. You would look at concepts of harsh and unjust and so on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the problems I see here is that there can be a provision in the award at the moment that unless there is some agreement reached as to reflecting that provision by another method—such as an agreement outside the award—it would disappear out of awards in the prescribed period of 18 months.
        <break page="5022" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         You then have a position where a union may have to lodge a claim either prior to or after that period to try to get the commission back into the equation to rule upon whether or not this should be an exceptional matter that should be included in the award.

        The commission will be faced with the dilemma of saying, `We cannot make a finding of a dispute on that particular issue because it is not an allowable matter.' You have yourself in a real catch&amp;hyphen;22 situation. I can tell you that the commission and the High Court have spent a lot of time in the past dealing with the question of what an industrial dispute is for the purposes of exercising not only the powers of the act but the constitutional powers upon which this legislation is based—which you have conveniently left out of the objects.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am asking you to explain how your proposal will work in matters that you say are exceptional. We want a definition of them; give us some examples. I am putting to you that the commission will find itself in the position of being unable to make a finding of dispute on a particular matter in the first place, thereby enabling it to utilise its conciliation and arbitral powers. Do not respond by saying, as you did, Senator Campbell, that the commission can conciliate. Any industrial relations practitioner will tell you that the commission's powers to conciliate in situations where they do not have specific jurisdiction are only ever exercised if both parties to the industrial situation agree.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You will find, as we often found, that employers will call into question the jurisdiction of the commission. They will go to the act, they will go to this section and they will say, `Hang on! You cannot even get to step one, in terms of determining whether this is exceptional or not, because you cannot even make a valid finding of an industrial dispute under this section in the first place.' That is the problem you are creating. Yet the commission will be dealing with a whole lot of provisions which currently exist in awards and which have been held to be within the meaning of an industrial dispute time and time again.

        I respect your view. A lot of people in the industrial area are opposed to what we are doing, but we are taking matters out of their jurisdiction. How matters get back into their jurisdiction through the `exceptional' provisions is a matter that will clearly evolve when this legislation comes into force, if it ever gets through the Senate.

         —Senator Campbell, I think you have just illustrated very well the dilemma that this legislation will create. Fist of all, the word `maintained' has been put in as if it is designed to fix a problem that was seen in this area—which we have been pointing out to you for some time—that comes about because of the reduction to 18 allowable matters. Sure, I do not like it. The primary reason I do not like it is that there are people out there who have entitlements that have been ruled upon by industrial tribunals and, in many cases, may have been upheld by
         <break page="5023" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          courts of this land, but this legislation just takes those rights away from them without any real recourse. To suggest that the putting in of the word `maintained' can deal with that position is wrong.

        Secondly, to suggest, as the Democrats will suggest, that we will create this catch-all subclause so that these matters can all come within the definition of `exceptional' does not advance us any further. The position I am trying to explain to you is that it is said here that this is all about simplification of awards. The primary purpose of section 89A, which we will come to deal with later but which is related, is to simplify awards. Surely, the end result of this is an incredible amount of litigation in the commission and in the courts over what can and what cannot get in because of the restriction on the number of allowable matters.

        There will be debates about what is legally meant by the term `exceptional', what is meant by the phrase `harsh and unjust', and what is meant by the word `incidental'. It will not necessarily be the case that you can call on existing precedent to look at those issues, because what we have here is a fundamental change to the definition of an industrial dispute. That is the problem that I am putting to you, and you are saying to us that this is a simplification. How can it be a simplification when what you are really setting up is a regime for a massive amount of litigation from the very first day that this act comes into force?

I think Senator Cooney was making the point that, without an interstate dispute, an individual employer would not have the basis for varying the awards nor would they have the ability to create an interstate dispute binding a variety of employers. So what Senator Murray is suggesting has to be taken to the next step; that is, if there were a selective group of employers who were organised across states then perhaps that could happen. But I would suggest that that is perhaps rather a fanciful view of how the world would operate under this environment, given the history of the maintenance of awards. There have been very few cases where the award system, as it currently stands, has been maintained on application of any employer organisation or individual employer. To suggest that something like this bill will change that is drawing a rather a long bow.

        I note that we are removing from the objects provision a requirement for the commission to encourage prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. The emphasis is obvious. The consequence of this bill is that we will see a significant rise in the level of disputation, reflected not only in the amount of argument that will occur in the Industrial Relations Commission over the meaning of an `allowable matter', an `incidental matter' or an `exceptional matter', but in argument over many other issues as well. For example, what will be regarded as an `industrial dispute'? That is a matter I will follow up later.

        To address Senator Murray's comments, I want to go back to the point I made about the objects of this bill. There seems to be a comprehensive misunderstanding or delusion about what our award system is. Senator Murray referred to comments made in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Working Nation
        </emphasis>
        about awards, but nowhere in those comments was there reference to the fact that an award system that deals with more than just minimum safety nets would not continue. The Labor Party never said that and would never have supported that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have a feeling for the evolution of the type of industrial system we now have. It deals with more than just 20 minimum standards and the things that might be incidental or exceptional to them. We have worked with the system and we understand how the system works to benefit the nation as a whole in preventing and settling industrial disputes. Now we will have tremendous arguments about what constitutes an industrial dispute. I will come to that later when I deal with the definition of `exceptional matters', because that really highlights the point.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question I would like to raise at this stage goes back to what Senator Sherry said earlier: we have removed the requirement for the commission to take into account the interests of employees. Why have we done that here? Elsewhere we include the fact that we are supposed to take into account the interests and wishes of employees in relation to union representation. But on the fundamental matter of what goes into an award and
        <break page="5025" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         what award conditions are, we remove reference to the interests of employees.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Does that not explain the government's agenda with this bill? Does Senator Murray not see that quite clearly? Does he not see how he has been deluded about some of these things when the government is not prepared to insert a fundamental object in relation to the awards and the award system to take into account the interests of employees? I hope Senator Campbell will answer the specific and clear question: why has the government taken out the provision that refers to the interests of employees?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other thing that we need to give careful thought to—this was raised a few moments ago—is the way the bill changes the nature of how the system treats representative organisations. What will happen to maintain awards? The notion that the government and the Australian Democrats seem to have about trade unions is that they will be just bargaining agents. That is not the role that unions have played in our industrial relations system to date. How will we maintain this uniform award—I am reluctant to call it an award system—if we do not have representative organisations doing it? That is my second question.

         —I have one question following what Senator O'Brien and Senator Jacinta Collins have said in regard to the concept of the part the unions will play and the part that the commission will play in the system. The part that the commission seems to be playing in the scheme, as suggested through the amendments we are talking about, and the use of the word `maintained', is that somehow the commission
         <break page="5026" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Senator Murray has said that that could be initiated by small business, and I think Senator Collins and Senator O'Brien dealt with that. What adds some weight to the way this side of the chamber looks at how the commission is to work under the new system is the deletion of the present section 90AA in the act, which uses similar words to those used in 88A and 88B. The present 90AA(2) reads:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In performing these functions, the commission must:
       </para>

       </para>
       <para>
        Under the present act, what that would seem to mean is that, when the commission has the opportunity, as it would if there was a dispute, it ought to do these things.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The words `so far as it can' limit what the commission can do. They limit it, I would suggest, to the present constitutional limits that are put on it. For some reason, when you go to 88B—I know we have not come to that yet but it is related to 88A, and how you read 88A—the words `so far as it can' have dropped out and you use the expression `must ensure'. When you move from one piece of legislation to another and you purposely leave out certain words, then I would have thought a court and a commission ought to take note of that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was wondering how a court would treat the leaving out of the words `so far as it can' that are in the present act. I would have thought that what they would say is that the whole thrust of 88A, taken with 88B and the fact that 99A(2) is repealed, means that this particular piece of legislation is set up on the basis that the commission itself has somehow the constitutional ability to set minimum wages and standards on its own, which would be a very interesting development in constitutional law.

That is what this bill is changing. Yet there does not seem to be a comprehension of how this will affect the way in which the jurisdiction of the commission will function.

I ask the parliamentary secretary once again: where is the reference to the needs of the work force when you make great claims with respect to inserting the interests or desires of employees in provisions relating to section 118A?

That is fundamental, Senator Murray. And why did your grubby deal not include that in the clause 88A objects? Here is your chance.

For the first time in 100 years, that very critical object will not be here.

         , you will see where Senator Collins has admitted it. She says, `I am now going to ask you a question that I asked you three days ago in relation to this, and you did not answer it in relation to exceptional or any other matters.' There may indeed be seven or eight questions that have been asked in different ways. If you want to run a filibuster but retain credibility, you should go through and make some substantive points. You should send Senator Bishop off to research some other schedule so that you maintain credibility. If you stood over here and listened to your questions, you would find that they were basically regurgitations of questions that were asked last Wednesday and Thursday. If your object is to delay the debate, you are doing well. But if your object is to retain credibility at the same time—

        Maybe it is a fairly simple approach, but to me industrial relations is about the interaction between employees and employers. It is entirely about dealing with their interests. When I read objects of the part which include phrases such as `wages and conditions of employment', forgive me if I am a bit slow on things, but I would have thought that that referred to the interests of employees. When I read phrases like `enforceable awards', I am sure that relates to the interests of employees. When I read things which refer to safety nets and fair minimum wages and conditions of employment and other such phrases—I will not bore you by repeating them—I believe that they explicitly relate to the interests of employees.

        So whilst you may want to add to or reinforce your point, you cannot claim—either in this chamber or in the wider world—that this bill and everything to do with it is not about the interests of employees and employers. Our view is that the interests of employees have been reinforced by our intervention. We understand your angst about your role in this, but I am afraid that is the best I can do as an answer.

During our original debate, the lengthy debate on the object of the bill—now there are objects of the part; I wonder why we did not get an `s' on the object of the bill—one of the comments made by the government was that we should not put so much attention on the object of the bill, because as we went on we would find that those issues would be dealt with. I am also reminded of the fact that in my brief discussions with the government, with the Prime Minister and the minister, in relation to the bill—

Senator Murray, I would like to draw to your attention in particular the amendment you have when you don't have an amendment. Let us look at the government/Democratic amendment and refer to the original from page 24 to page 25(11). The original provision in the bill says in point 1 that `the Commission must perform its functions'. In point 2, `In performing those functions,' it lists from (a) through to (h). The government/Democratic amendment is mag

        I understand that the Democrats are sensitive about showing that they did a bit of work on everything in the bill but this is the Clayton's amendment of the bill. All it does is renumber (a) to (h). Senator Murray and Senator Campbell, we would like some explanation as to what significance putting in another number and simply splitting (a) to (h) into two sections actually has. We are happy to allow this to pass but what does it mean?

        It is about as impressive as the amendment we dealt with sometime last week—forgive me if I cannot remember what hour and what day—where we took out the word `regular'. That was another very impressive amendment that you have when you don't have an amendment. Senator Murray, could you tell us whether or not this was done just to convince us that you got the government to make an amendment to this provision? It means absolutely nothing—absolutely zilch. With respect to 88B, the Labor Party has circulated a number of amendments—they are on sheet 221. They are now numbered (1) to (7). I really do hope the Democrats are listening—

        Senator Woodley, I am confident that you are listening and that you would have great sympathy with these amendments. Just convince Senator Murray. Our amendments make a number of significant changes. First, we provide that the commission must perform its function to provide `relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions', not just a safety net of minimum wages and conditions, as provided in the bill. In (a) we state that the commission must have regard to `the need to provide fair and reasonable living standards for employees', not just fair minimum standards as provided in the bill.

        In (c) we state that the commission must have regard to `the needs of the low paid and those without the ability to bargain collectively'. In (e) where there is reference to training arrangements we insert a reference to the relevant commission decision. In (f) where there is reference to a supported wage system for disabled people we insert a reference to the relevant commission decision.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In (g)—and we have not touched on this in the debate yet, and I hope Senator Campbell does not accuse us of filibustering; this is a point some of my colleagues will certainly want to be asking you questions about—we state that the commission must provide the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value. That does not just mean equal pay for work of equal value, as provided in the bill. In subclause (i) we add a requirement for the commission to have regard to the need
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to prevent and settle industrial disputes. We have had some discussion about that. In (j) we add a requirement for the commission to have regard to the interests of the parties immediately concerned and of the Australian community as a whole. That deals with amendments 1 to 7. My colleagues will be making some contributions with respect to these matters.

         —l concur with the parliamentary secretary's response. The argument so far has been a little mischievous because we have indeed won back equal remuneration and that is picked up in a later schedule. On first hearing the argument, pay for remuneration sounds very attractive but it is, in our view, unnecessary because awards provide for rates of pay and the equal remuneration arguments have tended to be about above award—which is what was said earlier—and also cover a wide range of non&amp;hyphen;cash benefits. Equal pay is a term long understood and used by the AIRC, and the reference to equal pay in this principle reflects that this division deals only with awards which, by virtue of section 89A(2), are minimum rate awards. We contend that the equal remuneration argument, which you express warmly, is picked up in later schedules.

The problem is you have not addressed it appropriately. There is a lengthy diatribe of international law on the issue. We refer to equal remuneration because the principle is remuneration. Unfortunately, on this issue, the government and the Democrats have been meddling where they should not be. We cannot introduce into Australian law—internationally we will look like fools—the principle of equal pay at this point in our history. The notion is simply ludicrous.

        If that is the situation, isn't it a bit hard on the commission to say it must have regard to matters that it cannot really do anything about? Why shouldn't it just say that it may take into account these matters? That, at least, would be a nice statement and would probably better describe what we want to get at.

Since everybody applauds that, wouldn't it then be useful, or almost obligatory, to increase the allowable award matters that the commission can take into account, to better encompass the very good ambition that is expressed in 88B(3)(e)? In other words, by limiting the matters that the commission can take into account when making an award, you very much limit the very excellent sentiments expressed in 88B(3)(e).

        Hence if the parliamentary secretary can give me some more precise advice I would be anxious to get it. There are differences, for example, between a person who is paid an hourly rate and a person who is paid a weekly rate. A person who is paid an hourly rate may be paid for, say, five hours a week whilst a person who is paid a weekly rate gets the full rate of pay. Is the person who is paid for the hourly rate but only employed for five hours deemed to be a low paid person? These are the sorts of vexed questions that I think this legislation is going to throw open. Can the parliamentary secretary help me?

I also refer you to allowable award matters in reference to school based career paths.

That gave rise to the equal pay for equal remuneration debate.

          that is perhaps a little technical. In relation to section 88B as amended, I take it to refer to the performance of the commission's functions after it is seized of jurisdiction to deal with a set of matters in an industrial dispute. The commission would have to have regard to section 89A to establish whether there was an industrial dispute, and only after it had done that would it be referring to section 88B as to how it should perform its functions under the act.

We believe the word `remuneration' does cover this very issue of the extensive over-award payments—bonuses or whatever you may call them—in the award system. Most allowances are in the award, although there would be some allowances that are paid outside the award system. But this critical issue on which Senator Murray has not responded is very important to women workers in Australia. You may have another response, Senator Campbell, and we will let you do that now.

You are quite clearly going down the path of extending this debate for as long as you possibly can. I welcome a thorough debate on this bill. We have had some substantive questions. Senator Mackay asked a couple of very good questions. They were answered thoroughly. You do not like the answers. I am afraid that, because of the fundamental divide on matters of philosophy and policy on this bill, it is going to be very hard for you to like many of the answers that I give you. Nonetheless we will continue to give you answers.

The aim of my recent visit was to register the government's commitment to expanding trade and investment links with their countries and to finalise government agreements which will help our business people to expand their commercial activities in the region. I am pleased to say that the visit was fruitful on both counts.

        There is clearly a strong desire to expand their international links and to diversify sources of investment and imports. The strength of this interest in diversification is a potential asset for Australian companies. In my ministerial meetings, I was told that Australia would need to increase its political investment over the next several years if it aims to take advantage of their emerging commercial opportunities.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In central Europe governments play a major role in shaping the framework for business, particularly for foreign firms. I believe that Australian companies have the relevant skills and products to be able to benefit from this region's growth in the next three to five years. A small number of innovative Australian investors are already demonstrating their capacity to become major players in specific niche markets.

         Apart from their diverse histories, the size of the economies of Russia and central Europe differ so much that the two categories cannot usefully be grouped under one head ing. The combined economy of the Commonwealth of Independent States, of which Russia is the largest member, is approximately the same size as that of all the central European economies combined. Its population of 148 million compares with 60 million in Poland. Russia's global two&amp;hyphen;way trade was $US124 billion in 1995. Poland, the largest of the central European economies, recorded $US52 billion.

        However, I wish to stress that Russia is a composite of many regions. A number of its regions have achieved rapid growth and also established a reputation as being stable and predictable in the application of their rules and regulations. Therefore, potential Australian investors and exporters need to be acutely aware of the political, legal and commercial environment in the regions before entering the markets.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian investors whom I met in the three central European countries stressed the formative stage of these markets and the particular opportunities that the region can present to smaller Australian firms. Their point was that many of the larger European and North American firms can be expected to develop a dominance in their specific market segments as these economies move to a more mature stage. Many of the business people said that the next three to five years offered opportunities to enter a high growth market before the major players became entrenched.

        It is realistic to expect sustained economic growth in most central European markets. Poland and the Czech Republic are projected to average five per cent growth in the next five years. Romania achieved seven per cent GDP growth in 1995. The currently strong foreign investor sentiment can be expected to continue. Inflow of foreign direct investment, FDI, has risen significantly in the last two years. FDI into the five countries of the central European free trade area, CEFTA, more than doubled in 1995 to $US9 billion, and Poland surpassed Hungary as the main recipient of regional FDI.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Russia has yet to attract a significant inflow of FDI because potential investors remain concerned about unpredictability in the application of rules, in the level of nationalistic

        The government and business people, especially in Poland and the Czech Republic, had a strong international outlook. There is a good framework for growth in our trade and investment with this region. We have a good set of double tax and investment protection agreements with most countries. The Australian investors whom I met in the region also stressed some of the advantages of the region for them—a strong industrial skills base in their work forces, especially in engineering and related fields; and the generally good physical infrastructure—as advantages in comparison with most developing country locations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Joint ventures and service industries have good prospects. Many of the foreign countries establishing operations in central Europe use it as a strategic location for access to an expanded European Union market, once these countries become members. Poland and the Czech Republic already have association agreements with the EU, and membership applications to NATO are under consideration. Those two countries and Hungary are expected to become EU members in the near term.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In each country I sought improved market access for Australian products. In the case of agricultural products, import policy reform is especially sensitive in Russia, Poland and Romania. There are serious political constraints on rapid liberalisation given the large proportion of their populations remaining in rural areas.

       <para first-indent="16">
        However, I received a more positive response on issues of concern to foreign business.

        The privatisation of large numbers of public sector organisations has generated special demands for market relevant skills because many of these organisations are being weaned off government.

        Yet Australian companies are, regrettably, scarce on the ground.

I had hoped that we would have had a maturing of the government in Queensland, after they had been out of office for some six years. Instead, when the going got too hot, the CJC and the inquiry conducted by Ken Carruthers were interfered with. I do not say that lightly. I have here a statement by Ken Carruthers, a former Supreme Court judge, and I quote from part of it:

        On October the 24th, I received a letter from Mr Hanger, Senior Counsel Assisting the Connolly Ryan inquiry, which said, `There exists the distinct possibility that the conduct of your inquiries will be a matter to be considered by this commission of inquiry.'
       </para>

        I will just depart from that statement. That is the commission of inquiry established by the Borbidge government in Queensland. The statement of Carruthers goes on:

One would have thought that the Carruthers inquiry would have been allowed to go to its natural conclusion and then we would have had unfolded before us whether there were people culpable as a result of that inquiry and subject to charges under the laws of the state of Queensland. But not so. We found that the honourable person conducting the inquiry, a respected person, found himself in the position

        It is interesting to also then look at some of the follow&amp;hyphen;up material that has come out as a result of the fracas that has taken place in the state of Queensland. A letter to the editor on the day following sums up the whole position very well. This letter says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The resignation of Mr Carruthers QC should be the cause for great alarm in our community. Whether or not the CJC is deserving of an inquiry into its own operation—and many would say it is—the timing of that inquiry certainly leads one to question the motivation for it at this time. One irresistible view is that it was established in an attempt to cast doubt on the findings made by Mr Carruthers and thus protect or seek to protect the premier, his police minister and others, from criminal prosecution. These latest revelations, which place Mr Carruthers in such an extraordinary dilemma, are to be deplored.

        It is with regret that I stand here before you and this honourable Senate to contemplate what is happening in the state of Queensland. Where has fairness gone? Where has objectivity gone? If one is guilty, if one has to face the music, then surely one must have the courage to do so. If—and I say if—the Carruthers inquiry was allowed to proceed, one does not know what the outcome would have been.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would equally have been responsible for the government in Queensland, if the CJC is worthy of some form of rigorous inquiry, if the CJC has in some way stepped beyond its charter, stepped beyond the realms of what is reasonable in a society, to have postponed the inquiry into the CJC until after the Carruthers inquiry had finished. But no, what we saw was a return to the good old days—the return to save mates and the return to protect their friends. This, of course, has led to a lack of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        After the lengthy period that was spent in dealing with corruption in the state of Queensland, it is surely a sad day when we see what is emerging today. Obviously, people have not learnt from these lessons. There will be other occasions on which I will make further reference to this matter.

         —I rise to continue a debate that I have been having with the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone. In fact, last week in this place, I raised the issue of figures that were used in the 1996 higher education budget statement to justify HECS increases by the coalition government. The coalition presented a higher education budget which, according to the estimates committee hearings of the Senate, demands that students contribute up to as much as 60 per cent—potentially 80 per cent in some cases—of their course costs.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Examples from the government's higher education statement actually can include courses such as law and medicine—those courses in the highest band. So, contrary to evidence presented by the minister, we actually have the potential for course costs for individual student contributions in this country to be among the highest in the world—certainly the highest in the Western World, if not the highest in the world after Korea. I presented that evidence last week.
       </para>
       <break page="5044" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The issue that we seem to have been embroiled in—both in question time today and last week and on the adjournment debate last Thursday—is the OECD figures that I used to demonstrate that the minister had been using rubbery figures. She had been using incorrect statistics to prove her case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Senate question time today, the minister actually conceded that the position the Australian Democrats put to the chamber last week was in fact correct and that the OECD statistics she used in the 1996 higher education budget statement were wrong. The figures in question were actually used in section 2 of the budget statement, entitled `Fair balance between public and private funding'. Page 8 of the budget statement claimed that the average proportion of 23 per cent—that is, 23 per cent of individual course contributions—is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . substantially lower than the rate of private contribution to higher education in a number of comparable countries. For example, recent OECD statistics show that on average students in the United States contribute around half of the cost of their course, while Japanese students around 60 per cent and students in Denmark contribute 40 per cent.
        </para>
        <para>
         So an OECD table claiming that Danish students contributed 40 per cent of the cost of their education was used to justify this government's decision to increase course costs. The OECD report in question,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Education at a Glance
         </emphasis>
         , actually states on page 108:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The private shares of final education expenditures are higher than the initial shares because the former reflect funds that are transferred to as well as generated in the private sector; the former are found mainly in the forms of scholarships and other subsidies for students.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The private shares of expenditures (for all levels of education combined) after transfers range from 7.0 per cent in Canada to 8.8 per cent in France to over 24% in both the United States and Japan. The Nordic Countries, the Netherlands and Australia have very small initial private shares, but substantial private shares after transfers.
        </para>
        <para>
         It continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The final private shares of tertiary spending are sharply higher than initial private shares in most cases. For example, the initial and final private shares in Denmark are 1.2% and 37.9%, respectively. The differences are accounted for by public subsidies to students or households.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         </break>
        </para>
        <para>
         Those figures are 1.2 per cent and 37.9 per cent respectively. Yet the coalition and the minister in their budget statement chose only to quote the 40 per cent figure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since my question last week in this place, and after the OECD actually informed the minister's department that they are not even going to use this table in future publications, the minister has admitted both in an adjournment debate last week and in question time today that her higher education budget statement relied on `messy statistics'. Today in Senate question time, Minister Vanstone conceded that the figures for Denmark, Japan and the United States were all invalid. So this issue has now been resolved.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But one issue remains. These figures were used by the government, contrary to the minister's claims in here today, to justify the government's policy changes in relation to higher education—in particular, the increase in HECS and other fees and charges.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to draw on the relevant section of the government's budget statement, `Fair balance between public and private funding', which I previously referred to—that is, section 2. On the same page as the OECD figures I previously quoted, the statement says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . it is clear that the private benefits of university graduation are substantially greater than the notional level implied by . . . HECS.
        </para>
        <para>
         Yet the minister said today in this place that the OECD figures were not used to justify the HECS increases. This quote indicates that the coalition believed the current levels to be notional—an assertion that many potential students would, I suspect, agree with, especially those students who have decided not to continue or enter higher education as a result of this government's prohibitive course cost changes. I am sure those people would dispute the idea that they are notional charges, despite the minister's claim today in this place. The statement continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government therefore believes that a higher level of HECS charge is justified.
        </para>
        <para>
         The second quote from there states:

         That is from page 8 of the budget statement. It clearly refers to the OECD statistics as being a justification for course cost increases. The coalition has indeed used rubbery figures as a basis to turn Australia into the most expensive place to undertake public university and higher education. The fact that they used messy statistics is of little comfort to those many university aspirants and students at this time.

         The Australian Democrats did not accept the minister's figures at the time. We did not accept her figures in the budget. We did not accept her explanation or justification last week. Nor do we accept this government's policy change to increase HECS.

         Now that the minister and this government—and in fact the OECD—seem to have discarded these figures, we are arguing that the HECS charges and the other regressive budget policy measures in relation to higher education should similarly be discarded. I look forward to the minister's response on this evidence that I think is pretty irrefutable.

         —Tonight I rise to speak regarding two matters—one is a celebration; the other one, unfortunately, could well be an impending devastation. I want to speak about the community of Helensburgh, a town situated south of Sydney in the Royal National Park. Helensburgh has been a very close&amp;hyphen;knit community for well over 100 years. It has the distinction of being one of the few areas within the Royal National Park where persons are permitted to live. As I said, it has been a very close&amp;hyphen;knit community.

        On 9 November this year, the Helensburgh Workmen's Club will celebrate its 100th anniversary. The workers club was first formed at a meeting of a group of miners back in November 1896. The miners met to establish the club because they resented the attitude of the publicans who ran the local hotels at the time. As a result of that meeting they resolved to establish the Helensburgh and Lilyvale Workmen's Club and Mutual
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         School of Arts. I am advised that in present day currency, the entrance fee was 25c, with a quarterly subscription of 12c. Obviously, if you paid by the year you got a discount. In its early days, the club struggled to compete against the local publicans. The miners, in the great tradition of mining workers of this country, banded together and kept the club going.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also understand that the motto of the club in the early days of its existence was `Taste and try before you buy'. Apparently this was a reasonably cheap means of increasing the rather meagre revenue for the club. Within a 14&amp;hyphen;month period in 1903&amp;hyphen;1904, the committee of the workers club had written for and sampled, free of charge, no fewer than 11 different wines as well as a range of beers. If nothing else, the committee of the club at the time showed a great sense of ingenuity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The club was not only a place for a quiet drink and a chat with your mates but also a place where one could listen to lectures given by prominent members of the labour movement. I am reading from an article in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Worker's Journal
        </emphasis>
        . I am also advised that the great Australian poet and balladeer Henry Lawson was a regular visitor to and speaker at the club.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The club has gone on to bigger and better things. Last Saturday extensions to the workers club at Helensburgh were opened by Gough Whitlam. When Gough Whitlam first entered parliament he was the member for Werriwa. In those days the seat of Werriwa stretched from about Wollongong in the south, from Cabramatta and the Liverpool area in the west, through to Cronulla on the coast. Helensburgh was one of the many areas in the electorate that had a strong Labor and union presence.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It was great to go down to Helensburgh on Saturday and see the people of the town taking pride in their history and in the important role that the workers club plays—like many other clubs in New South Wales and other states—in its local community. I was certainly very privileged to be there, not specifically as an official guest but rather as a person who has often visited that quiet lovely area within the national park. Sadly,
        <break page="5046" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         after the celebrations on Saturday, I paid a visit to a picket line at a Helensburgh colliery called the Metropolitan Colliery, which is run by the company Denehurst. The picket line was established by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union because of the impending closure of the colliery. It was sadly ironic that on the same day that we were celebrating the establishment of that club which was created by the miners, we also had this impending devastation facing the workers at the colliery and, indeed, the community. The colliery still employs about 150 workers and is an integral part of the work force of the township and, indeed, of the great history and tradition of this town.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The company Denehurst has placed the colliery into voluntary administration. I understand that a meeting will be held as early as tomorrow to determine the fate of the mine. Unfortunately, there is every prospect that the mine will be closed. I hope that does not happen. The community and, of course, the workers do not want that to happen. It will have some devastating consequences, not only on these workers' employment but also on a lot of other families and on the community that depends very much on the existence of this colliery.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was appropriate that just before the adjournment debate we were debating the provisions of the workplace relations bill. The attitude adopted by the company on this issue has been nothing short of disgraceful. They had entered into an agreement with the miners federation not so long ago with respect to a continuation of the wages and working conditions, et cetera that applied at this site. As I understand it, they had also signed an agreement with respect to bonuses. Only a couple of weeks ago the union went in to negotiate with the mine management about the level of bonuses for the ensuing period. The response they got was, `There is no point talking to us now because we have just placed the mine in the hands of an administrator.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt that it has been due to the very bad financial and planning management of the company that the colliery has reached this stage. The workers at Metropolitan Colliery have proved themselves amongst the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         best, if not the best, in terms of producing record tonnages of coal far exceeding the expectations of the colliery management and what those workers were told at the time was required in tonnages to ensure that the pit would remain profitable.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The workers have done their part to keep this colliery operating. There are still substantial recoverable resources of coal in the colliery. But, unfortunately, because of bad management, the company has got itself into a situation of debt and it appears that the ultimate losers will be the workers. If the mine is closed, 150 workers will be retrenched. Also it appears that there is no money available to pay out the retrenchment pay as well as long service leave, holiday pay and other considerations. Somewhere in the vicinity of $2.4 million would be owed to these workers if that sad situation were to eventuate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I just finish by saying that here we have an example of bad management and also an arrogant disregard by a company for the fate of its workers; workers who have not only worked in one of the most strenuous industries in this country but have also put a heck of a lot into a local community.

         —I wish to again draw the attention of the Senate to the matter of literacy in Australian schools and to the ongoing remarks of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to the effect that 30 per cent of Australian 14&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds lack basic literacy skills.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the Senate will know, the data on which the minister so irresponsibly based his claims was not a literacy test at all. It was a small part of a 20&amp;hyphen;year longitudinal study of the transition from school to work of a group of young Australians. Not only was the test irrelevant to the minister's claims, but the study is not due to be finished until next year. Even after this had been pointed out to the minister, he continued to accuse schools of hiding the data. He said parents were entitled to know their children did not have basic literacy skills. In short, he continued to
        <break page="5047" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         scaremonger, to put fear into the hearts of every parent with children in school.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This morning we heard more of the story on Radio National. Commentator and journalist Brian Toohey was asked how he thought the minister would have handled the test himself. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The test is incredibly difficult and it is totally misleading to suggest that what most people would regard as lacking in basic literacy skills, was actually being tested here. For example, I think there's a strong suggestion that people can't get a job. Maybe when they're a storeman and packer they're told to go and get 12 boxes of Kelloggs and they come back with 12 boxes of Uncle Toby's or whatever. It's not testing that sort of thing, it's testing some very difficult questions about, in one case, a passage of writing about war which is really an extended metaphor.
       </para>
       <para>
        Brian Toohey put the test to its author, Melbourne
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        </emphasis>
        journalist Martin Flanagan. The test said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The story the writer tells us suggests the causes of war are often complex, invisible, justifiable or insignificant.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the question. Mr Flanagan answered with the word `complex'. That is what he meant to suggest when he wrote that piece. But the examiner, in this case, came up with quite a different answer. To get 100 per cent on this part of the test, the student had to say that the causes of war are often insignificant. Martin Flanagan says that is the last thing that he intended. But the very question and the use of the word `suggests' gives the game away. As Brian Toohey says, `It is not a matter of what the author said; it is a matter of what he was suggesting.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is nothing unusual about this kind of test of comprehension. Such a test is meant to be difficult and to make students think. You might well argue that the examiner's interpretation was incorrect, but who knows? In tests of comprehension, the answers are very often not black and white. It is not like finding out if a student can read, where you can say he or she can recognise and read that word or sentence. Comprehension is an entirely different matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This comprehension test, which the minister deliberately chooses to pass off as a test of literacy, is in fact a concept called mastery.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Back in 1975, when I understand the test was started, you had to get 80 per cent to pass.

        Will the minister now attempt to blame his advisers for this debacle? Mr Toohey offers the view—and I am very much inclined to agree—that the minister, who has a PhD from Yale University, should have known better. He says the minister has the gall to talk about 14&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old students failing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister has been the instigator of a beat&amp;hyphen;up of the most appalling sort: `shock findings', `alarming' and `a major cause of Australia's high youth unemployment'. As Mr Toohey points out, shock findings are not the cause of anything and they are certainly not the cause of youth unemployment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So what is the problem of literacy that schools and teachers in this country are dealing with? I do not say it is not a problem. But I think it is extremely unlikely that the problem is worse now than it has been in the past, and there is plenty of evidence to show that literacy levels have improved over time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the minister were not in such a hurry to make these alarmist pronouncements, we might be in a better position, if we have a problem, to understand its extent and how it might be addressed. The minister is well aware that we are now in the middle of the national survey of literacy. This survey was designed to provide the minister with just the sort of information that he says he needs to form policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This morning Senator Vanstone changed the government's tack somewhat. She now claims that there have been no improvements in literacy skills over the past 30 years. This leads me to wonder what sort of research the minister now draws upon to reach this latest conclusion. It falls a long way short of an apology and it certainly does not repair the damage that has been already done.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us return to the government's commitment to literacy in this country. The Senate will have seen the budget papers and seen that $45 million is to be provided by the federal government for a literacy program. The government is making much of this commitment. I need to point out, however, that this $45 million works out to be about $5 per student per annum. I sincerely hope that this
        <break page="5048" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         amount will be useful but I suggest that we should not hold out too much hope. There is one truth about literacy; that is, that there is no simple answer to the question of how children best learn to read and write. In any case, it is not all that we expect them to be able to do.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Undoubtedly there are students who are not literate when they leave primary school. I have taught some of these children. There are very complex reasons for their failure to grasp what their peers do with some ease. If the answer was as simple as to reschedule more English classes, doesn't the minister think that schools would simply do this? Why some children do not learn to read as well as others is a complex question—and so is the remedy. You cannot force children to learn and you cannot force them to value knowledge.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why is it that some parents read to their children from infancy and provide them with books—and others do not? Why is it that even this is not an absolute indicator of literacy levels in school? It would make much more sense for the government to stop making these wild pronouncements, to stop bashing teachers and schools, to stop alarming parents with such outrageous claims and to work towards the common goal of improving educational opportunities and improving outcomes for our students.
