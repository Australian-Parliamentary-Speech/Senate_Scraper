Indeed, what the government is hoping to do at long last is to bring about a renaissance of rail, as Mr Sharp described it. At long last what we want is a government that will address the real issues, not simply pander to the unions and sit by and watch what was formerly a very important part of the government business structure haemorrhage away.

        These reforms will lead to the creation of new jobs in regional Australia as well as securing sustainable jobs in the rail industry. They are in sharp contrast to the mismanagement of the Labor government. Over its 13 years of mismanagement more than 7,000

         jobs were lost in Australian National. As recently as 1995-96, Mr Brereton and Mr Beazley personally approved an AN business plan that saw a further 970 jobs go. During that time of course the rail network continued to decline.

        AN's losses for 1995-96 are now estimated to be around $250 million—much more than the Brew report estimated; dramatically more than AN's own business plan forecast. `If anything,' according to Mr Brew, `AN's situation would only get worse. The former Labor government, in establishing National Rail the way it did, created the straw that broke the back of Australian National. By handing over AN's profitable assets to NR, they were left with no revenue from these assets but all the debts and liabilities.' On that basis we took the view that we simply cannot allow this situation to continue. Failing to act now will inevitably result in the loss of all AN jobs and, if nothing is done, taxpayers will be subsidising each AN job to the tune of $220,000 a year.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore on 24 November, yesterday, the minister announced a $2 billion reform package to rejuvenate rail services in Australia. The key elements of the package are the sale of AN businesses in whole or in part; interstate passenger services to be offered for sale, with the government committed to their development as tourist attractions in their own right; the assumption of AN's debt and other liabilities, allowing the growth of new businesses without the existing encumbrances; exploring with other shareholders of National Rail the sale of Commonwealth equity; the establishment of a government owned national rail infrastructure body to control and maintain the interstate rail network; and funding for environmental remediation, $50 million, and regional assistance of $20 million. The sale process is to be handled by the office of asset sales.

       <para first-indent="16">
        A competitive rail industry open to market pressures and private sector enterprise is the only way of ensuring future jobs in the rail industry. The private sector will employ many people who are presently employed by AN. By reducing the cost of transport, many industries which were once not viable will
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         now be able to begin operation in regional areas creating further jobs. In areas such as infrastructure maintenance and freight operations in South Australia, we expect that the private sector will be ready to step in and take over those functions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Staff at AN workshops have the skills to undertake many more areas of work than just rail. Industries in regional Australia will also benefit from greater efficiency in the rail service. To maximise the future prospects of the region, the Commonwealth will provide a $20 million regional development program over two years. The program will assist local economies and assistance will be available through the department of employment as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I just hope that this program will be allowed to go ahead as quickly as possible. I was disappointed to see that Mr Carr is making some threats about blocking it, to the extent that the New South Wales government has shares in National Rail. But I am sure that he will see the light. He will realise that the Tasmanian and South Australian governments have endorsed this package. Anyone who has had anything to do with the industry will know that it is about time someone was prepared to take the hard decisions and try to put the industry back on a basis of profitability and to create new jobs in the rail sector, rather than simply standing by, wringing one's hands and doing as Mr Laurie Brereton did in telling Jack Smorgan, the Chairman of AN, that nothing would be done until after the last election. What a total abdication of responsibility.

         —The requirements of people over 55 who have been looking for work for nine months mean that, in the current climate of unemployment, sadly all too many of them have little or no expectation, realistically, of getting work later. You, like I, Senator Sherry, have no doubt had come through your doors too many of these people, constituents, who feel that their world has finished because they are no longer valued by our society. I have great sympathy for people in that position, and I would not want that to be understood in any other way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Nevertheless, in determining what assistance should be given to people in that position, a categorisation needs to be made of in what circumstances they will then be included in the means testing of their superannuation. Senator Sherry, I must point out that prior to 1993 your government had means testing of superannuation assets. Your government chose to remove the means testing of super products at that time. I understand that the projection that your government had of the cost to revenue was really quite small.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The experience of the last three years is that that projected cost was quite unrealistic and in fact many tens of millions of dollars—perhaps up to $100 million—of forgone revenue has been the consequence. This is a bleeding of the system which cannot be allowed to continue. It is not unfair that people who are effectively retired, even if it is involuntarily, should be means tested in the same way as they would be when they are 65.

Industrial relations reforms, relief for small business, benefits for families, lower interest rates, keeping inflation down, reducing debt, strong growth and business investment are what Labor should get behind, Madam President. It could do so by passing this budget in full over the next fortnight.

Do you agree, in the light of cutting $900 million from Commonwealth funding to New South Wales in the last budget, that asking the states to tender for incentives to set up Commonwealth facilities in regional Australia is an outrageous ask and that it flies in the face of the whole nature of our federal fiscal system?

Three days later, the same private researcher sold the same core technology to a syndicate for $14 million, ripping off the taxpayer.

Has the Australian government refused to resettle any mainland dissidents now living in Hong Kong ahead of next year's Chinese take over? Given that Australia was willing to grant residency to more than 20,000 Chinese students after the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, why is the Australian government being so inflexible on this matter? Is it not a fact that the Canadian foreign minister has offered asylum to some of these activists?

         —Madam President, as you know, our policies of trade liberalisation are designed in our national interest. I thought the Prime Minister put it quite well yesterday in Manila when he was asked a similar question: `What are the tangible benefits for maintaining this push for trade liberalisation of the Australian economy?' His answer was, `More jobs, higher rates of economic growth and the prospect that greater trade flows in the region will provide new jobs for Australians.' That is ultimately what the goal of economic policy is all about—generating greater economic growth. More jobs for Australians must always be the test of any Australian Prime Minister in applying, in effect, the theory to the practical circumstances.

        So we have taken the decision—which was also the decision of the previous government—that to press for further trade liberalisation will encourage growth and provide greater job opportunities for Australians. There has been some debate as to who is out in front in this liberalisation. These situations are quite difficult to equate at times because, in some parts of the policy mix, Australia might be out in front; in other parts—certainly in relation to agricultural policies—we have been out in front on trade liberalisation for very long period of time. We have engaged in a policy process that is finally starting to open up those who have protected their rural industries to the disadvantage of our efficient producers.

         In some other instances, of course, countries have pointed to areas in which they have had low tariff or other protection regimes and they have argued that we have been higher. That debate continues. It is interesting that, in fact, if we go back to exactly what the Osaka agenda states, it says that each economy would endeavour to ensure that its liberalisations were comparable. That is what we are seeking to do, although, as I said, it is sometimes difficult to compare. The important thing is that, out of this process of general liberalisation, we all should gain through greater economic growth, particularly job opportunities for Australians.

There are some very well&amp;hyphen;known examples in which we are seeking to do that. Whilst I say at times it is difficult to compare the various trade regimes, nevertheless, within the charter of the Osaka agenda, we believe that liberalisation, if it is comparable, gives us a legitimacy in arguing that, from the basis of our liberalisation, we should expect liberalisation in those areas, particularly within our region, where there are still considerable obstacles to entry by Australian firms. As a South Australian, I make particular mention of the car industry. We would very much wish to see greater access for Australian car producers within the region and we are doing everything possible to achieve that goal.

Students still came overwhelmingly from rich families. The change which the abolition of fees was supposed to sponsor had not happened.

Yet isn't it a strange thing, Madam President, that we have young graduates who are complaining that they should receive extra training before they get a provider number? I would have thought that the patients of Australia at the very least would expect that their GPs would have had adequate training before they are let loose on patients. It does not matter to me too much whether they are women or whether they are men or whether they are in a part-time situation or whether they are in a full time situation. The patient's interests surely are paramount. I would fight to the death to see that the patients get quality medical care.

This has become complex and requires rationalisation. Whilst rationalisation is likely to involve some overall liberalisation, this would be quite limited. Importantly, the general prohibition on the purchase by foreign interests of existing developed residential real estate, houses, flats, et cetera, will be maintained.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to the proposed abolition of the syndicated research and development program.
       </para>
       <para>
        In question time today, Senator Parer answered, in a most unsatisfactory way, a question that I put to him. We know that this government used the example of the Wright family, a fictitious family created in order to pretend that abuse of social security was occurring when, in the example provided, there was no abuse of social security. The government came into this chamber and admitted that the example they were holding out to be true was indeed false. That is now a well&amp;hyphen;known fact on the public record.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Today, and indeed last Friday, we have learnt that the government has been at it again—falsifying the facts, fabricating the evidence. It provided a press statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 23 July and again last Thursday alleging that that there were four examples of actual case studies in which syndication under research and development provisions had been abused. They attached those four case studies to their press release on 23 July. They re&amp;hyphen;issued that press release unamended last Thursday when they launched their START program. They have used those case studies as justification for terminating the syndication R&amp;D program.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not a light matter. This is a matter that has caused a storm of outrage in Australian industry. This has caused a storm of protest by reputable Australian companies that their reputations are being slurred by the government's continually exhibiting these case examples and pretending that there are widespread rorts in this system. The government did two misleading things. It said that it based its findings and its press report on a BIE report. There is no such BIE report. The report that it refers to is a report of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism. It also said that it based its decision to terminate R&amp;D on the four case examples. What did the press release actually say? The heading in the ministers' press release was `Use of R&amp;D syndication to generate tax benefits—actual case examples' and there were four of them. What we now know from evidence given to the Senate economics committee inquiry which sat on Friday is that these are not true. These examples are fabrications. These examples do not represent, as the heading on this press release says, actual case examples. Here, again, the government is caught red&amp;hyphen;handed, fabricating the evidence to justify its decision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You do not just have my word for that. On Friday, we had evidence from a whole host of industry sources who said three key things about these case examples. These industry sources represented 90 per cent overall of all of the applications for syndicated R&amp;D. What were the three things that they said? They said that they did not recognise any of the four examples as being typical or true. They said that those examples are not typical of the applications that they have made under this scheme. And, importantly for this debate, they said that none of those examples would have got through the guidelines as they had been tightened by the former government in December last year in the innovations statement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="5894" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          So the examples, if they had been applications, would have got knocked out under the guidelines last year. These cannot be examples that are true today and these cannot be examples from which the government can pretend that there is a justification for cancel ling syndicated R&amp;D. The government has been caught red&amp;hyphen;handed, fabricating the evidence, pretending on the basis of that fabrication that it can do things.

         The government has not apologised to the Senate. It has not corrected the record. None of the ministers have come out publicly and re&amp;hyphen;organised what they have said so as to reflect the true case. While they persist in pretending that this is the true case, the public are being misled, and misled in an important way because this touches on the ability of the Australian economy to grow rapidly, to create jobs in the area of research and development and to put Australia in the leadership of product development in the world so that we can win markets and create more jobs with the exports of those products. Industry almost to a person on Friday gave evidence that the government is wrong. It is about time that the government corrected the record.

         There was a whole series, and I might say that Senator Cook did a stirling job of pursuing this with great vigour.

         We came into government. We were advised of these particular rorts that were going on. I might make the point clear—and I think Senator Cook will agree with me—that during the estimates committee it was pointed out that, while the term `rorting' was used, it was not illegal, it was quite legal. Senator Cook pursued the departmental officials at great length by asking them, `Did this occur before or after the innovation statement?' I think he made the point in the little burst he gave a few minutes ago of saying that the industry people pointed out that none of this would have got through the guidelines.

         —I too wish to take note of Senator Parer's answer to Senator Cook's question—and I was somewhat incredulous at the answer, I am afraid. I was present at the estimates committee where I listened to Senator Cook's detailed, measured, persistent and careful questioning of the minister and department on this issue. I conducted my own questioning. I was interested in establishing just what validity there was for two things: firstly, the aspect of rorting, especially after the tightening of the system in December 1995 and January 1996; and, secondly, whether syndication should be dumped because it was ineffective.

        On the first question, Minister Parer began the estimates by using what I refer to as the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         `demon&amp;hyphen;speak' of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) —a method of demonising things he does not like—such as rorting. By the end—and the instant will be recalled, and I will paraphrase it—Minister Parer was saying that rorting was not perhaps the appropriate way of talking about this matter. Today I heard Minister Parer back onto the marketing or propaganda line of knocking it over.

        I have no quarrel with the belief that syndication might not be an effective or appropriate system. But to keep using the demonising language of rorting, I think, weakens the government's argument. Let me say quite clearly—and I have no ministerial record to protect, and I say this as an independent, objective person, I hope—that to me there has been no empirical objective or even circumstantial evidence on the record, in the budget debates, the estimates or the inquiry that has proven that rorting, which means scams, corruption, illegality, for those who got through a tight screening process, has gone on. Certainly, there were shonky people who tried to get up, but they did not get through the screening process—and that was acknowledged by the department.

        As such, the use of the word `rorting' is a clear slur, until proven, on the three firms that constitute 90 per cent of the approved syndication systems. I think, if I may say so, Mr Deputy President, that is an unattractive and unhappy way for the government to pursue their agenda, which is one of saving money by reducing these programs to cut the deficit. If that is your aim, that is clearly understood. But do not do it by casting aspersions upon those who have conducted their programs in a legal manner and who have not been proven—by the Treasury, the ministers or extensive inquiries—to have rorted or corrupted the system.

        We now know that this year AN is expected to run at a loss in excess of $250 million. The accrued debt of AN is now beyond manageable proportions. The subsidy paid per employee, above and beyond the salary that they earn, is $30,000 per annum. That is the state in which the rail system was left when we took over government. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) immediately took it upon himself to deal with that problem. He commissioned the Brew report. As it now turns out, the Brew report was quite conservative in relation to the estimated loss that AN would accrue during this year. AN announced the particular figure that it anticipated; Brew suggested another figure, which was higher. The real result is higher than both figures.

I was assured this morning that the Minister for Transport in South Australia, the Hon. Diana Laidlaw, will be working very closely with the federal government to ensure that the $20 million that is available to assist with the regional reconstruction both in South Australia and in Tasmania will be used to help those families and to ensure that there is a future in Port Augusta. Again, the same rail worker summed it up when he said, `We want a future; we want a tomorrow.' There are hundreds of families in Port Augusta who are committed to the future of the railways under a Liberal government and who want to work with them.

        Senator Abetz, in trying to be very smart, has condemned himself out of his own mouth. He said, `Women talk about hats and gloves.' Senator Abetz, that is precisely why Mrs Clinton wanted to meet some Labor women; she especially wanted to talk about issues other than hats and gloves. She wanted to talk about child care. She wanted to talk about women's health. She wanted to talk about Medicare. She wanted to talk to women who make policy—usually Labor women—and not to the hats and gloves brigade. She made that clear, to the point of getting her organisation to smuggle people in so that she could speak to them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        She was not averse to speaking to a whole range of people; but she was averse to having an organisation set up her luncheon to exclude Labor women in a petty, small-minded action which characterises Mr Howard's Liberal government. Senator Abetz, it is a major matter not because of the way you wish to trivialise it but because of what it is you are trying to protect with your trivialising response—that is, that Mr Howard became the Prime Minister and set the bar higher: `We will be different. We will not be like previous governments; we won't be mean and singular and everything else.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But Mr Howard has shown—and through this activity he has shown—that he has lowered the bar lower than ever before. He is prepared to be exclusive and, in a very mean action, to close out a whole lot of people from seeing Mrs Clinton. We have a woman on our High Court—Justice Mary Gaudron. She was rushed in at the last moment as an afterthought. The absence of the leader of the Australian Democrats was recognised at the last moment as an oversight and she was rushed down there. But no Labor women from the federal parliament were able to attend.

You are reducing the benefits to families. You are reducing policies for families. You are an embarrassment and Mrs Clinton recognised that. Hats and gloves are not what women talk about, Senator Abetz. Everybody in Tasmania will know that that is what you think women's policies are and what women's organisations talk about.

         —I find it amazing, as did I think Senator Hill, that Senator Crowley, with the very few opportunities that backbenchers on the other side get to ask questions, took the opportunity to ask the sorts of questions that she did today. As Senator Hill said, there are issues relating to this economy and the state in which the Labor Party left this country that are of much greater importance than who went to Hillary Clinton's afternoon tea, or whatever it was, and what they were wearing.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact that Senator Crowley wants to discuss whether they wore hats and gloves just indicates that she has really lost the plot and why people on 2 March this year voted for and elected the coalition to govern this country. Senator Crowley is now walking out of the chamber because she does not like to hear someone saying that what she was talking about was totally irrelevant.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the reasons Medicare is in such a state of disarray is that Senator Crowley opposed a co-payment and overlooked the fact that we do not have sufficient money to run Medicare. The Labor government refused to take the hard decisions we are taking in asking people who are on higher incomes to either take up private health insurance or pay an increased Medicare levy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor government were not prepared to make that decision, yet Labor senators have come in here today and asked questions, as they have done a couple of times, about people with higher levels of superannuation who retire or are unemployed at 55 and who have to make use of some of that resource. This is because the Labor Party will not admit that there are people who may not have employment after 55 but have provided for their retirement by putting their money into other resources such as shares—especially farmers and small business people who did
        <break page="5899" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         not have access to superannuation funds. And the Labor Party are prepared to treat those people differently.

        The Labor Party were not prepared to make the hard decisions. They were not prepared to treat people in an equitable way or make people who are on higher incomes pay. But Senator Crowley ridiculously talks about who was or was not at a function. That, to me, does not seem to be the issue we should be discussing in parliament.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       4. Law courses lead to a variety of occupations such that there are vast earning differences between law graduates regardless of whether they are in the legal profession or otherwise. The reality is that 50

          —Since this committee was established by resolution of the Senate on 2 May 1996, it has received more than 100 submissions, it has heard evidence from several major participants in the uranium industry and from government departments and agencies with major responsibilities in the field, and it has visited several mines in the Northern Territory, including Ranger, Narbarlek and Rum Jungle. Owing to the many parliamentary and committee commitments of members in Australia and abroad, the committee still has much work to do. In particular, the committee has yet to visit WMC mine at Olympic Dam in South Australia and the proposed mine at Kintyre in Western Australia. The purpose of the extension is to allow the committee to complete its hearings and inspections, and to consider the evidence before it and the results of its research programs in a proper and businesslike manner.

        What is happening now is that the superannuation scheme we have in place actually fails the test of fairness. When politicians are able to retire in their 40s and early 50s with benefits worth $1 million to $2 million, with 80 per cent of the cost having been borne not by the employee's contributions but by the Commonwealth, I think that does require us to look and ask in 1996 and in relation to other citizens if this can be judged fair.

        Preservation rules are now very tight for other sectors of the work force. Few people can now access their superannuation before age 55. Few workers born after 1960 will be able to access their superannuation before aged 60. But we are different. Federal politicians can do both those things. It is not just that: federal politicians can line up for other government jobs and, even though pension payments might be suspended while they hold that job, they can still line up for other benefits later.

        According to the Department of Finance, the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme involves a cost to the Commonwealth equivalent to 78 per cent of parliamentarians' salaries. The way the scheme is designed does benefit longer term parliamentarians while providing significant inequities for shorter term parliamentarians.

        With politicians running for office at earlier ages, which I welcome, and retiring earlier—I think that is something to be encouraged too; I think a healthy turnover of politicians is something we should pay attention to—the scheme is becoming less about retirement income and more about providing some kind of nest egg for a second career. That is where I think the big changes have happened in the career of parliamentarians and that is why I think it is appropriate now to ask whether this emphasis, this focus, is now appropriate.

        The National Commission of Audit, a great deal of whose report I vehemently disagree with, has made several recommendations about the parliamentarians' scheme. It has
        <break page="5905" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         recommended that benefits should be paid through accumulation benefits arrangements and that the amount of superannuation should be determined by the individual member as part of overall remuneration entitlements. Whether you agree with that or not, we are not seeking to pre-empt. We are simply saying that there is an element of transparency attractive in those recommendations. That is why we have incorporated those into the terms of reference. The terms of reference also cover federal judges' superannuation. This raises similar issues to those of the federal politicians' scheme. The National Commission of Audit made similar recommendations about this as well.

        Despite the entreaties of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), the final terms of reference that I am asking us to vote on do not include the Public Service superannuation scheme. I have thought about this at length and I do not agree that the Public Service should be included at this stage. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that I do not trust conservative governments with Public Service superannuation. We can look at various state examples, and I will come to that in a moment. I think it is much more appropriate that the issue of superannuation be looked at in the next enterprise bargaining round, not by a federal government seeking a pre-emptive strike. I think that is what they are up to. My second reason is that I think it is very inappropriate to seek to do this now in the context of a larger scale public sector reform move, evident in the discussion paper released today by Minister Reith.

        I remind the coalition of their election policy promises.

        If you look at history, you can see that conservative state governments in election campaigns made the same promises. But in government, in an effort to make a few bucks, to reduce the deficit, most moved to cut

         public sector superannuation entitlements down from the level guaranteed in current legislation to the minimum level set by the superannuation guarantee charge.

        I was on the Senate select committee some years ago and we looked at the unfunded liabilities issue. The conclusion of the committee was that this is not a major crisis. I would argue that there has been no argument sustained to cut entitlements based on the scare tactic of `we have got this major crisis at hand'. We don't. The government actuary regularly reports on the liabilities under the government's superannuation scheme and has reported a steadily declining proportion of GDP in liabilities. Indeed, the most recent report showed that accruing costs were less than emerging costs, suggesting that future generations of taxpayers might be worse off if we move to a fully funded scheme. The National Commission of Audit even conceded that this was an on balance decision. The commission also recommended that, in moving to a fully funded accumulation rather than an unfunded defined benefits scheme, the total value of remuneration packages not be reduced by the change.

In seeking support for this motion today I say that it would be a disgraceful reflection on this parliament if we use failure to agree on terms of reference, specifically the inclusion of public servants, as the reason for doing nothing at all about this issue.

        It is time to look at politicians' superannuation. There are a range of reasons. There is no doubt that the nature of work of politicians has changed.

         As has been noted in this debate, there is, on average, an effective contribution from budget of some 78 per cent of a federal politician's pay into their superannuation. With respect to judges—I do not think Senator Kernot mentioned the figure—it is effectively 60 per cent. Those two figures are way above the community norm and standard—not just above public sector superannuation in general, but substantially above what executives in the private sector could enjoy by way of superannuation. This is an important public issue. It should not be hidden. It should be appropriately debated and investi gated. This is the committee to carry out such an investigation.

        There are some other reasons. The Prime Minister gave an unequivocal commitment in writing. So why does he, presumably, want this issue of general public service superannuation to go to the select committee? It is a Liberal Party hidden agenda. The letter that the Prime Minister sent to every public servant in Australia is a non&amp;hyphen;core promise. He wants to reduce the superannuation entitlements of public servants, including the military, in this country. Labor will not have a bar of it.

        There is another reason for opposing this. I am surprised Senator Kemp has not read the third report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation published in October 1992. This matter has already been before the select committee, which spent many hours examining the issue of public sector superannuation. At page 24 under `Superannuation and Unfunded Liabilities' it goes through the issue of superannuation and unfunded liabilities, including state and Commonwealth public servants, for some 10 pages. I do not think the government has read recommendation 6 with respect to this area, which says:

I think it is true that we now have a situation where we are expecting people to fund their own retirement.

        However, this motion is a relatively discrete term of reference. It has not been given a huge amount of time, considering we have Christmas and early January coming up—and it is hard to get hearings during those times. So the first sitting day in March is not giving a great deal of time for wide ranging debates. It has been mentioned before that issues relating to Commonwealth public servants have been looked at before. I would agree that it fits in very nicely with the current attack on anybody who happens to be considered to be a public servant at present. I usually reject the word `reform' in relation to what is happening amongst the public service, because reform in my definition means a change for the better. It seems that an ideological attack can hardly be called that.

         —Pursuant to standing order 191, I believe that I have been misunderstood by Senator Kemp as a result of your intervention, Mr Acting Deputy President. I had, of course, considered the terms of reference proposed by the government and had considered amendments thereto. They were about to be referred to the drafting officers. But at that stage I did not know that Senator Kernot had amended her original terms of reference to excise senior Commonwealth public servants. If it is limited to judges and ourselves, that is why I am voting for Senator Kernot's amendment. Had it not been so limited, clearly, the government had every entitlement to extend to other public servants.

        The bill amends the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 to remove the ability of companies to register jointly for the R&amp;D tax concession, or as it is more commonly known, to register a syndicate.

        Amendments to the tax law in 1994 to allow the unused undeducted purchase price of a commuted superannuation pension or roll&amp;hyphen;over annuity to be further rolled&amp;hyphen;over had the unintended consequence of allowing amounts received on commutation or termination of annuities purchased with money outside the superannuation system to be treated as eligible termination payments (ETPs).

         Service. The 13 imposts are located in 2 new charges bills, and this Customs Amendment Bill and will apply full cost recovery for commercial Customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports.

        For instance, the user pays system is already used in relation to the recovery of costs of processing passengers at international airports, through the Passenger Movement Charge.

        To coincide with this measure, Customs has taken also the opportunity to streamline elements of two existing fees. The first relates to refund of customs duty application fees and the second relates to administrative arrangements for the determination of costs associated with out of hours work by Customs officers or for work by Customs officers at locations where Customs' work is not usually performed.

        This legislation package sees an extension of the current cost recovery regime for import related services. Customs currently recovers part of the cost of its electronic systems (amounting to approximately $18.5m in 1995-96) through charges levied on importers for import entries. The extension of the charging arrangements, however, relates only to commercial import processing. It does not cover activity associated with Customs' community protection function relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs. The Government recognises Customs' important role in this area and has, in the Budget, provided funds to Customs to significantly increase the use of sophisticated technology to maintain and enhance its community protection capability.

        103,000 importers generated around 2.2 million Customs import entries in 1995 containing 7.2 million entry lines. 98 per cent of these entries were lodged electronically with Customs. Based on the 1995 data, 95 per cent of entries have 10 lines or less and will incur the minimum charge. The new charges, for the majority of entries, will see the current electronic entry cost rise from $8.75 to $29.65 (sea) or $22.80 (air and post). The present charge of $8.75 only picks up some of the computer costs for entry processing and does not represent full cost recovery. Although the increase in entry costs are significant, in absolute terms, the additional costs-will be small for the majority of importers. For example, 65 per cent of importers make 4 or less entries per year and would incur a total cost increase of less than $85 per annum.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        After the Budget announcement, members of the Customs National Consultative Committee were briefed, at a special meeting, about the nature of the proposed charges. This Committee comprises representatives from the Australian Air Transport Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders, the Customs Brokers Council of Australia, the International Air Couriers Association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Their feedback resulted in some changes being made to the charges for entry processing and the methods of collection. This Committee met again in September where the charges were once more the subject of discussion.

        Informal meetings have been held with various sectors of the importing community, such as the air express couriers, the cargo terminal operators, and the Australian International Movers Association in regard to establishing the most efficient collection methods for the charges. In meeting with a variety of industry sectors, Customs was made aware of some difficulties the collection of cargo reporting fees and screening fees would impose on cargo terminal operators and shipping companies, for manual reporting charges, and on air express couriers for screening charges. As a result, the legislation now provides that special arrangements may be entered into for the collection of these charges, including periodic settlement arrangements to coincide with the operating environment and

        In addition to meetings called at the behest of industry, Customs has conducted a series of industry briefing sessions in all State and Territory capital cities and in several regional centres. These sessions have provided an opportunity for Customs to explain details about the charges and how they will be collected. At the same time, the sessions have provided a valuable forum for feedback from all sectors of the importing community, much of which has influenced implementation decisions.

        This bill gives effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria whereby the Commonwealth will pay Victoria an amount of money no greater than the windfall tax revenue that will accrue to the Commonwealth as a result of the settlement of a dispute over the passing on of the PRRT between Victoria and Esso&amp;hyphen;BHP. This agreement resolves a long running dispute between the Victorian government and Esso&amp;hyphen;BHP as to whether the producers could pass the effect of the PRRT on to consumers based upon agreements executed during the 1960s between the producers and the state of Victoria.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill will enable the Commonwealth to pay Victoria $555 million, representing a windfall tax gain accruing to the Commonwealth that they would not otherwise have received except for the settlement of this dispute. Victoria will, in turn, make a lump sum payment to Esso&amp;hyphen;BHP, and Esso&amp;hyphen;BHP will remit the Commonwealth tax on this payment. The overall impact on Commonwealth finances will be a $70 million contribution to the budget bottom line in 1996-97. As I seem to recall—and Senator Kemp might refresh my memory when he speaks—this is not in the forward estimates for the government's budget.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So on this occasion we are particularly happy to support an additional windfall to the government of $70 million. We are prepared to assist the government on a speedy passage of the bill. It enables settlement of a long running dispute over the impact of PRRT between Esso&amp;hyphen;BHP and Victorian gas utilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When PRRT was introduced in 1990, it replaced the existing excise and royalty regime. The introduction of the regime saw a dispute emerge over the meaning of certain clauses in long-term contracts which had existed between the producers and Victorian gas utilities. The argument centred on who had to bear the cost of the liability for the difference between the old royalty regime and the new PRRT and whether it could be passed on to consumers or whether the producers had to absorb it.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The agreement will see the Victorian government pay, on behalf of the utilities, a sum of around $1 billion to the producers to cover both past and future PRRT liability. This amount represents a third of the original claim of $3 billion, and the settlement represents the commercial judgment of both sides as to the risk of what the final outcome would be and who would win and who would lose. This settlement allows a win-win situation for all parties concerned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The settlement of the dispute also allows for the gas reform process to advance and for the liberalisation of the Victorian gas market. The settlement will see the Victoria gas corporation monopoly over gas distribution rights removed, and that can only be of benefit to gas consumers. Given the $70 million windfall gain to the government, the government could consider using this money to continue the funding of government programs it has cut. I hope you are enthusiastically taking that last comment of mine on board, Senator Kemp.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We want that $70 million to be used to fund government programs that have been cut. For example, my own state is suffering because of your draconian cuts to the Commonwealth dental program. It is not just my own state but many hundreds of thousands of Australians that are suffering as a result of the cut to that program. In respect of this windfall government revenue that is not in the forward estimates as I understand, the government could certainly do something productive by way of assisting persons who have suffered as a consequence of that vicious cut to the Commonwealth dental health program. I do not want to detain the Senate any longer, so I conclude by saying that we support the legislation.

         —For five years since the petroleum resource rent tax has been in place, the Victorian government has refused to pay Esso&amp;hyphen;BHP higher charges for gas because of a contractual statement that tax would not be passed on to the customer—in this case, Gas Corp.

        The courts have finally decided that the companies were right and Victoria would have to pay. This has resulted in increased income as a lump sum payment of about a billion dollars to the companies and an increase of tax liabilities by the company of about $620 million. Of that, the Commonwealth has agreed to pay $550 million back to Victoria. Rather than leave anyone in deep trouble waiting for a cheque and hearing the famous `It's in the mail, don't worry', a cheque trading meeting has been arranged for Friday; hence the urgency.

        It seems that the company is also making a windfall profit—either that or in some sense they have been seen as having been able to recoup a share of their profit that has been lost. If they are making a windfall profit, then tax on that is duly owing, not a windfall. If it is recouping profit lost, then the Commonwealth is recouping tax lost.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a fundamental issue of why the Commonwealth should not have been receiving this tax and why it is not theirs by right. I can understand that it would be difficult for Victoria to suddenly lose a billion dollars. I understand that this full tax will be paid in future. Perhaps the minister can let me know whether that is correct. If not, what is the situation? What will be the ongoing impact on Victorian finances and the cost of gas?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It may be argued that states do not pay Commonwealth taxes, but this situation is that of a state government business enterprise which is involved in commercial sales, including to commercial industry. State tax exemption would mean all such consumers, including commercial enterprises which use gas, receive tax exemptions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There are other issues here in relation to both the environment and competition. With the resolution of the tax issue, it is becoming necessary to renegotiate the contract. This renegotiation includes competitive measures designed to avoid competition policy laws soon to come into force. One aspect of this renegotiation was to remove contractual restrictions on building private sector pipelines. A concern was that competitive equity
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         may be used to allow private sector companies exemption from environmental or local planning regulations. I would like the minister to let us know if he will give an undertaking that no exemption from current Commonwealth laws or regulations and no reduction in stringency will be available to private sector gas companies for gas pipelines. Of course, this is what was flagged by Senator Brown earlier on when we dealt with the motion.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My understanding is that while contractual barriers to building pipelines, and for sale to end consumers, are being lifted, there remain legal barriers within Victoria. The Victorian Treasury states that issues like industry regulation, community service obligations and public interest requirements would be looked at `when the legal framework is changed'. While access to reticulated gas pipelines is on a unit basis, access to high pressure transmission pipelines is by distance.

        Increased costs mean that there is a competitive disincentive to provide services to those who live in more sparsely populated areas, especially when those areas are at a distance from major urban centres. In fact, this happens now under GASCOR, a government business enterprise which has those commercial pressures to a certain extent. The implication of this, coupled with a standardised unit price, is that more remote users and rural users will not get access to gas or will only get it if there is a shift to user pays, unless there is a universal service obligation modelled on that under the Telecommunications Act where all service providers pay a proportional part of cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies and where provision of services is an obligation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One implication of cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies is anti&amp;hyphen;environmental. Extension of reticulated gas or electricity to remote users may be a worse option than provision of stand&amp;hyphen;alone renewable power systems from an economic as well as an environmental point of view. A universal service obligation under competition policy should be amenable to obliging companies to offer cheaper, more environmentally benign alternative technologies or conservation measures.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The agreement between GASCOR, Esso and BHP is contractual and it is hailed as opening the way for competition. Yet we do not hear of any environmental considerations. There is no new regulation in this industry and we hear of no public interest requirement or community service obligations. There are issues whenever we move from a framework where a service is provided by government to one provided, even in part, by the private sector.

        Government is assumed to act in the common good and to integrate all its functions into decision making. Let's face it: that is what government accountability is all about. This includes social welfare and protection of the environment. Government can be held accountable for its decisions on the basis of all its duties, not just profit making for its shareholders.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Private industry has no such requirements. To fail to exploit is usually to miss a competitive advantage. When a corporatised government business enterprise competes with the private sector, it either completes ruthlessly or it loses competitive advantage. For this reason, when a service moves from the public sector to the private it is necessary to regulate explicitly. We have seen no evident desire by this government to do that.

         It is necessary to enforce regulations. It is not competitive if they are not enforced and other industries become disadvantaged. Failure to do this creates an inexorable pressure to ignore regulations or considerations of social and environmental impact. Those who retain a conscience are competitive losers in an amoral environment where nice people finish last. Under competition policy it is important to include regulations, obligations and agreements in major contracts with government opening a market. When these kinds of issues have been mentioned before, it has often been said, `Oh, but you can include that in the tender.' Where is it? They are not simply commercial contracts, and their implications are larger.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Victorian contract agreement is such a case. At the time of passage of the Competition Policy Reform Act there was a press release saying that states would have to submit their agenda for implementing competition policy, including exemptions, public interest considerations and community service obligations. Yet we still have little more than a vague public interest test in the competition act itself. It is circular: public interest equals competition policy equals public interest. It is not good enough. Here we are making major decisions and it is still not there. Therefore, I urge support for my second reading amendment.

We know that the payment will result in a windfall tax to the Commonwealth of about $625 million.

But in doing so we note—and we note strongly—that settlements of this kind will probably become more common in one form or another, because we will have privatised utilities and competition policy pitted together against what should have been monopoly suppliers.

I well remember the competition debate in this place. `All competition is

Time and time again we will be left to point out—I know; we can see it coming—the failures of the universal application, the unilateral application, of competition policy in areas where it is totally inappropriate, in areas where monopolies would have delivered the goods to consumers.

        In relation to the matters that were raised by Senator Brown and Senator Margetts, Senator Brown was kind enough to read into the record a letter he had just received from the Victorian government. I thought it would provide him with the assurances he wanted, but that was not clear. After having got the assurances he sought from the Victorian government, he then tended, I think very unfairly, to dismiss them. He sought those assurances at the start of this debate, and they have been forthcoming.

        From the Commonwealth's perspective, this bill essentially returns to Victoria certain windfall gains. Victorian gas utilities are subject to CSOs, which are funded from the Victorian budget. I am not aware that these CSOs have been changed by this settlement, and I do not think evidence has been produced to the contrary. That is a matter for the Victorian government, but no evidence has been produced in this debate that that situation has changed as a result of this settlement. I urge the speedy passage of this bill. This brings to an end a debate which has occupied this parliament for far too long.

         —I rise to put on the record the opposition's position in respect of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. Our initial approach in assessing this legislation has been that the government must be held to its word. During the election and since, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, `All we have done is extend Labor's six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period to two years.' Our position is that, if you do not have to wait six months for a payment at the moment, you should not have to wait two years for a payment after the bill is dealt with.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also maintain that the waiting period of two years should not apply retrospectively. We also maintain that those who are currently exempt from serving a six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period should continue to be exempt. We believe that refugees, humanitarian migrants, their families, Australian citizens and their families must be protected. We also believe that this legislation should not act in a discriminatory way and should not override the Racial Discrimination Act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For us, this legislation is regressive. It is intended to dismantle the underpinning of a very successful migration program. Its effect will be to erode the success of that program. It was just the other day that these comments appeared across our national newspapers:

        I would like to thank President Bill Clinton for those observations because they do go to the success of what we have done in this country, to the success of our migration program. In making those comments, President Clinton goes to four major points, which are worth putting on the record.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        President Clinton makes it very clear—he has brought home the international awareness that our single greatest achievement as a nation has been how we have developed by taking and absorbing into our community some five million migrants over five years. He has sought to educate us about ourselves, and I think in a very striking way has done so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He has made us dramatically aware that the world knows what is happening in Australia. He has put it on the front pages both here and overseas. He has highlighted the extent of our diversity. He has emphasised that it is not easy to do what we have been doing. He has emphasised that we have done something special. He has also emphasised that we have a particularly different and special approach—and I would maintain very strongly that this is through our settlement programs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, in saying that I think the President of the United States has sadly shamed the Australian Prime Minister—the man who cannot find it within himself to use the word `multiculturalism', the man who does not understand the importance of our diversity, the man who does not stand up for multiculturalism and indeed rejects it as more and more evidence shows, the man who does not attack the racists and the bigots in our society, and the man who has advocated racial discriminatory policies. Sadly, I think President Clinton has shown by his example that this government and this Prime Minister do not care about settlement policies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third thing President Clinton has done has been to expose the boring and insensitive nature of our administration. Standing within two yards of the dispatch box in the House of Representatives last week, I was embarrassed as an Australian member of parliament to see that, while the whole of that chamber—downstairs and up in the public gallery—applauded the President of the United States
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         a number of times, our Prime Minister did not.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was particularly concerned that, when the President of the United States mentioned the issue of race in the House of Representatives, Tim Fischer, Alexander Downer and everyone else on that side of the parliament applauded him except two people—our Prime Minister, John Howard, and Ms Pauline Hanson.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it really reflects on this Prime Minister, the person who has as his responsibility engaging this country with the rest of the world, that he stood there in stark isolation in his own parliament. I think what the President of the United States did last week was to very starkly highlight the difference between the leader of the United States and the person who claims to be the leader in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        President Clinton would not have read the

        to know why John Howard was not applauding him. He would not have understood the niceties that the Prime Minister wanted to stick to. All he could see from his position was that the person in closest contact to him was the one person in the parliament who was not applauding him on the issue of race and on other matters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was also particularly embarrassed to see, for the first time in a number of years, at an official function for a visiting head of state, that there was no reflection in the performances of the day of, for instance, our multicultural society, particularly the people of Aboriginal descent. The President quite pointedly referred to the talents of Aboriginal Australians the next day when he not only went shopping for some of their craft work but also referred to Aboriginal entertainment as part of the vital contribution Australians are making to the world scene. The other thing the President of the United States did last week was make it very clear at one critical point when he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        <break page="5927" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         President Clinton, I think, showed that we are doing something especially important. The opposition would maintain that there are dividends, both socially and economically, in how we handle not just migration but also migrants when they come here. There are huge benefits if we get it right and there are losses socially and economically if we get it wrong. It does not just happen.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What President Clinton was alluding to last week does not just happen by the wave of a magic wand or whatever. Getting people into a country is one thing. How they fit into that country and what infrastructure and support they get from their own families, from their direct communities and from the broader community is the most critical part. What this legislation is about is dismantling that very important social policy infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The difference between us and other migration countries is that we do have a settlement policy. It is based on inclusiveness. It is based on social justice. It is not just words; it is also programs. This is the bill that tries to dismantle so much of that social infrastructure, and it does so with blind disregard for the consequences. You do not expect this Prime Minister to understand the implications on migrant families, because he has shown a disregard for their plight. But what you see here is legislation without the preceding policy review, without any assessment of the impact of the legislation on individuals, on families and on the broader community, without any recognition of the role or the need for some of these programs of support that this legislation tries to dismantle.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This legislation is the work of serial wreckers because it is not preceded by any policy review; it is merely preceded by public opinion polls. The only research available to the government on the impact of this legislation is not on how it will affect our society. The only research available to them is the research they get from their public opinion polls.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Migrants have been marginalised under this government. They are being used as a political football. The problem with that is that, though it might resonate in some parts of the

         community, we are playing politics with the cohesiveness of our society. We are introducing legislation driven more by prejudice than policy review.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I say, social justice is the critical distinction between us and other countries with migration. We have always worked on the basis of a couple of simple principles. We invest in migrants when they come here, and they do pay back. In the immediate sense, they pay back through indirect taxes and direct taxes. They contribute to society. In another sense, what we are doing is providing a springboard for them and their families—a springboard which ensures that they do not fall into the underclass nature of society but have a chance to establish themselves and their families in a new environment.

Okay, they have got problems, and problems in terms of accessing jobs, but they are the community which already achieves high retention rates at schools and high participation in the workplace. They are the community which is already in the business of exporting and trading with overseas countries, particularly the country from which a lot of them have come.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Respect for family is also critical. One concern we have about this legislation is that it does not adequately ensure the capacity of families to reunite on the basis of the experience of a successful family migration program. This legislation makes it much more difficult for families to unite because it places in front of people that hurdle of the need for extra resources for families to come together.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill is, to the opposition, a wholesale attack on the social infrastructure. It is a pernicious one as well. At the same time as having this legislation, we get concern expressed to us by the government that they want debate. If they wanted debate, they would not have done away with the office of multicultural research and effectively abolished it. They would not have effectively abolished the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research and so on.

         This legislation has met with comment from quite a number of people in the community. One person I do not often quote but whom I would now like to quote is Bob Birrell. In his advice to the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs he said that, through this legislation:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Coalition Government is in effect saying that it washes its hands of responsibility for their welfare, unless they fall into the Humanitarian category.

        <para>
        </para>
        <para>
         Bob Birrell is, and I think has been for some time now, a strong supporter of the government, but I think he has got it dead right here. What this legislation does, paraphrasing Bob Birrell, is take away the difference between Australia and other migration countries. We feel it is racially discriminate. It is not just the opposition who says that. It was also the concern of the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Zita Antonios, in her evidence to the committee—evidence which the Attorney-General's Department sought to rebut but at the same time acknowledging that there was some force in Ms Antonios's argument.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We feel this legislation breaches some of Australia's international obligations. The International Bill of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention on the Rights of the Child all have principles that ensure that one has, for instance, a right to social security, that children have a right to their best interests being taken into consideration, and so on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, I think it is worth noting the evidence of Mr Stephen Langman, solicitor with the National Welfare Rights Network, who explained:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In our view, these provisions are certainly going to create suffering amongst children. For families with nothing to live on but the basic rate of family payment, which we think is going to happen, there is no doubt that children will suffer as a result. Even if the family is given the special benefit, the new provisions do not apply the same tests for
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          giving additional family payments to those families. So those families will be living on special benefit, which is limited under the act to the amount of a jobsearch allowance and $22.70 per child by itself.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para>
         Not only do we have those certain concerns; we have concerns about retrospectivity. We also have particular concerns about how this legislation has been implemented across the country, sporadically I must concede, before it has even come into effect. All these concerns build that basic picture in our minds that this legislation is all about bad policy, policy by prejudice and policy which, in effect, will undermine much of what has been done as part of a successful settlement policy in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said at the start, we are taking an approach to this legislation which tries to hold the government to its word. We in government imposed a six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period in respect of some payments. I accept now, as I did before, that there is some concern about that six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period. We maintained then that six months was a good balance. We also maintained then and we maintain now that two years is not a good balance; it is a poverty trap that migrants and this society can least afford. When the government said that all it would do would be to extend our six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period to two years, we said that if you do not have to wait for six months at the moment then you should not have to wait two years for payments after the bill is dealt with.

         We are the ones who, consistently over a period of time, put together not just the social infrastructure but a racially non&amp;hyphen;discriminate program—a program that took in the needs of families. In doing so we also respected and recognised the importance of a family in terms of migration. We also recognised the importance of one family feeling as though it had sufficient rights, equal rights, with another family in terms of sponsoring their families into Australia. This is where this legislation has a pernicious effect. It will be much harder for those from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds across the world in so many different circumstances to be able to sponsor their relatives, because of the combined impact of this legislation and some of the regulations that you have tried to bring into play.

        The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 seeks to increase from 26 weeks to 104 weeks the period during which migrants will be ineligible to claim certain benefits—that is from six months to two years. This legislation is, as Senator Bolkus has said, retrospective in many regards dating back to 1 April 1996. Some of the benefits that would be affected—that is, prior to the amendments being tabled by the government today—include the carers pension, disability wage supplement, widow allowance, sickness allowance, newstart, special benefit, partner allowance, maternity allowance, parenting allowance, child disability allowance, double orphan pension, mobility allowance and youth training allowance. It does not take too studied a view of these aspects of the legislation to realise that many of the people who are affected by this legislation are, of course, women, young people and traditionally disadvantaged people in our community. For that reason, the Democrats will be opposing this bill.

This government is seeking to further its objective of stratifying permanent residence below that of citizens. This is a debate that we had two weeks ago with the disallowance of certain regulations. We saw a recent example of this when Minister Ruddock attempted to alter the sponsorship eligibility in the concessional family category so that only citizens would be able to reunite with their loved ones. Those regulations, and now this legislation, coupled

         with the soon to be debated Immigration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), bring into question the government's protestations about racism in this country.

        These are the words of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Clearly section 10 of this act makes it clear that national or ethnic origin are part of the attributes which constitute racial discrimination and this bill does construct a distinction based upon national or ethnic origin, in the provisions of who is eligible for nominated social security benefits. To distinguish between citizens and permanent residents in this way is, we believe, in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act.

        What distinguishes this debate from that concerning statutory rule 211 is that this legislation is designed to impact upon people after they have already migrated to this country. With the recent increases to application fees and the large sums of money that are required for some categories of migrants to provide assurances of support, including the English language charge—now in the vicinity, I believe, of around $12,000 for some visa classes—this legislation is merely the icing on an economic rationalist cake.

If the minister is so keen to pursue Democrat policies, she should understand that our policy on immigration is fundamentally tied to a paramount regard for the environment.

I hope the government will also support the amendment moved by the opposition. It simply requires the coalition government to affirm its principle in legislation—that is, the principle of non-discrimination in legislation.

         We have before us a litmus test for what is a reflection of the social conscience of this government. Australia's system of social security—and I stress the term `social security'—has a number of distinctive features. Until this proposal, social security payments were available to Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand residents. I would like to quote from the majority report on this bill of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Page 4 of the report states that social security payments:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . function as income support or supplementation. An important feature of Australia's social security system is that threshold eligibility is based on whether the person is a permanent resident at the time that the benefit is claimed. The aged pension is the main exception to the rule that threshold eligibility is triggered by permanent residence. The aged pension requires ten years of permanent residence for threshold eligibility. Citizenship plays no part in Australia's social security system except in relation to eligibility criteria, and applicants will need to comply with these.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Another distinguishing feature of Australia's social security system is that it is non-contributory. It is funded through general revenue and no direct contribution is demanded from an intending recipient. This is in contrast with a contributory system which requires individuals to contribute directly to fund, usually in conjunction with employment or as a feature of the taxation system—
        </para>

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          In contributory systems, the level of benefit will usually relate to the level of contributions. Australia has a single tier formal social-welfare system where benefits are flat rate regardless of previous earnings and payable without prior contribution. This is quite exceptional internationally and Australia and New Zealand are the only two members of the 19 members of the OECD that do not have separate social security taxes. Australia's social security system seeks to provide a welfare safety net to persons who are unable to provide for themselves through other means. Accordingly, the benefits available seek to comprehensively cover all the main contingencies of life that may effect eligible persons.

It is a laudable principle for any nation to uphold. I think we should be screaming from the rooftops about this one, not seeking to cut it back.

Early Christian missionaries such as Paul were itinerants relying on the hospitality of those they visited. This migrant experience became a key metaphor for the life&amp;hyphen;journey of every child of God in both the Old and New Testaments. Thus Christians are described as `aliens' even in their own land, as they focus on that other kingdom beyond . . .

         Let me talk about some of the facts of the case. Let me talk about the harsh effect of the changes upon newly arrived refugees. From 3 July 1996 only Australian citizens can sponsor other family members to live in Australia. This will apply to all family, including spouses and dependent children, no matter what age. There will be no exceptions to this rule. Hence, it will apply to people who come to Australia under the refugee and humanitarian program and also to those who are recognised as refugees from within Australia. It takes a minimum of two years to become eligible to apply for Australian citizenship.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many refugees are separated from their spouses and children when fleeing persecution; their greatest wish after finding safety in Australia is to be reunited with them. However, under the new system they will not be able to sponsor for at least two years. The separation of families, especially parents from their children, in such traumatic circumstances is intolerable. This concern applies to all refugees, whether they have been granted refugee visas before or after arrival in Australia.

         Let me give you a real life story—not an imaginary Wright family story or an imaginary research and development illustration, but a real life story: the story of Ali. He came to Australia as a refugee in April 1996. In his country he had been kept under house arrest prior to UNHCR negotiating his release and resettlement. When fleeing to Australia, he left behind his wife and six-year-old daughter. He had been assured by the Australian embassy that he would be able to sponsor his family to join him after he arrived in Australia. He must now wait over two years before seeing his wife and child again. Is the government ashamed of itself? It jolly well ought to be.

          So we are not simply talking about whether or not this is an overall policy; we are really talking about a policy which is quite discriminatory. There is already a lack of recognition of overseas qualifications. If this situation is compounded by the higher points of the English language, it will particularly disadvantage people from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. Even though the capacity to speak English does increase the economic viability of a migrant, the primary goal of the family reunion program should be to maintain family ties rather than focus specifically on improving Australia's labour pool. This particular appeal is an appeal to the government of course, but it is also an appeal to the Labor Party, who are very half&amp;hyphen;hearted in the amendments that they are proposing.

          The National Council of Churches in Australia is particularly troubled by the manner in which the new changes to the family reunion program and the overall size and composition of the migration program were announced. Information on the different aspects of the migration program and policy changes was not announced in a cohesive manner. This created confusion and anxiety in the wider community, which in turn encouraged racist remarks and xenophobic attitudes from anti&amp;hyphen;migration and anti&amp;hyphen;Asian lobby groups. Community groups would have appreciated being consulted before the changes were made. This would have given the government an opportunity to explain the rationale behind the changes, and it would have allowed input from the communities to be taken into account. But none of that from this government. It seems that successive governments take great pride in the multicultural nature of this country. Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had to defend that very policy this week. But I am afraid his words will ring very hollow when this particular policy, if it is passed, is known in Asian countries. They will compare what he is saying with what his government is doing. They will see the vast difference between the two things.

           Once again the government has failed to effectively  illustrate the positive aspects of immigration to the Australian public. The public needs to be aware of the reasoning behind Australia's migration program in order not to be confused over the issues. Public opinion, as shown by one recent public opinion poll, has been used by the government as justification for the new cutbacks. In other words, when the government wants to it is prepared to say that racism is not on its agenda and that multiculturalism is its policy. But, when it suits the government, the government is prepared to use racist public opinion as justification for its own policy. A misinformed public may send the wrong signals to its leaders, especially if attempts to clear up confusion over the issues have been unsuccessful.

           I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I am very disillusioned by this particular piece of legislation. It really does underline the fundamental failure of this government to understand anything about what it means to have social justice and equity and fairness in this country, particularly for those who are most vulnerable. I hope the government stands convicted by history when we look back and see what we have done to the people in our midst who, indeed, are the most vulnerable.

        We—the Labor members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—reflected on matters such as this in our minority report, which was presented to the parliament in September this year. In the opening comments of that minority report we drew attention to what had been a sustained attack on migrants to Australia and their families by this government in the short period of time that this government had been in office. We drew attention to the fact that the Office of Multicultural Affairs, which was formerly an integral part of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, had been effectively abolished. We noted that the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research had been abolished. Everybody—even those on the government side, I think—recognised the invaluable contribution that those bodies had made to the exercise of government policies and to the community as a whole with high quality research and policy advice on areas affecting new migrants. In our minority report we drew attention to the fact that services had been cut. We drew attention to the fact that resources under the SIP English language programs had been halved for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and were to be abolished next year. We drew attention to cutbacks in labour market programs. Charges to the adult migration education programs are proposed to increase by over 200 per cent. So what we have seen today is not something that is happening in isolation. It is, indeed, as our opening remarks drew attention to, a sustained attack on migrants and their families. What is really bad is that it is happening in an environment which was caused by comments by a member of the other place whose comments remain on the record. They have not been

        I want to come back to the bill, to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and to recognise the presence in the chamber of Senator Ellison, the chair of that committee, and Senator Abetz. They will recall that I expressed my pleasant surprise with the recommendations that the majority of the committee brought into the committee when we were deliberating on the report. Their actions in adopting some of the recommendations given to the committee in the various public hearings that were conducted and the submissions that the committee received during the inquiry are an indication—if one was needed, and I am not sure it is—of the good work that committees can engage in and can undertake on behalf of the parliament.

         Prior to the 1996 election there was a six-month waiting period for the jobsearch allowance, the newstart allowance, the youth training allowance, the parenting allowance, the sickness allowance and the witness allow ance. The government indicated in the election campaign that they would extend the six-month waiting period to two years. But the government have extended it way beyond the six or seven areas where the six-month waiting period applied. They extended it to the carers pension, the child disability allowance, the disability wage supplement, the double orphan allowance, the family payment, the guardian allowance, the health care card and a whole range of other benefits which were never mentioned by the coalition in the election campaign.

It would be hypocritical of me to stand aside from the votes in which I participated in 1992 in relation to this matter, so I will stick with the principled position that we adopted. We will seek to hold, by way of the amendments we intend to move and the way we will vote on government amendments, the government to the promises and commitments that they made at election time.

        I mentioned in passing the shonky figures. In a coalition statement issued before the budget, the now government said they were going to save $616 million as a consequence of extending the six-month waiting period to two years. The committee, in its deliberations

         in June this year, was given different information. We were told, for example, in the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the bill—there are details of this on page 9 of the majority report—that in the year 1996-97 the provisions would save $31.4 million; in 1997-98, $143.5 million; and, in 1998-1999, $185 million. That totals $360.5 million—quite a distance from the $616 million that was promised in the `Meeting our Commitments' statement.

        In conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President, I again draw attention to the minority report that we submitted in September this year. I have not dealt with each and every matter in the minority report; it runs to some 16 pages. I commend it to the parliament. One area that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         was not properly addressed in this speech was how the provisions of this bill, if enacted, will discriminate against individuals. In one of the appendices that we attached to our minority report, we provided information on currency restrictions that various countries impose on their nationals as they leave.

        People leaving the United Kingdom have no restrictions on the amount of currency that they can bring with them. However, the most a person coming from Vietnam can bring with them is $US5,000. All a person can take from the Philippines is 5,000 pesos, which, at the time we were preparing the report, amounted to $A243. Other provisions worth mentioning concern India, the People's Republic of China, South Africa and Iraq. I dare say that, had we more time, we could have looked at a number of other countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Clearly, these provisions are discriminatory. As a nation, we cannot address what the Philippines determine that their nationals should take out of the country, but we do have to be aware that these restrictions are in place and that a migrant coming from the Philippines, China or Vietnam should have the same rights of settlement in Australia as a person coming from the United Kingdom or, indeed, the Republic of Ireland. It is going to be a fairly arduous committee stage debate on this matter. It is something that I look forward to, although I would have preferred that it happen in a different environment than the one that currently exists in our community.

         —The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 was introduced into the Senate in May 1996 as part of the government's commitment to a pre-election policy that new entrants to Australia should provide for their own support during their first two years here. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and other related bills to extend the newly arrived residents waiting period for certain social security payments from six months to two years for migrants who arrived in Australia on or after 1 April this year. It also makes
         <break page="5941" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          amendments to these acts to ensure that these provisions are more workable.

        The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in May and was reported on in September. I am pleased to advise the Senate that the majority of the committee made a number of recommendations which have been taken up by the government and accepted. Before I touch on them, let me deal with a number of concerns that have been mentioned today. One of them relates to racial discrimination. I might say at the outset that the committee relied on the evidence of Professor Ivan Shearer and the Attorney-General's Department to the effect that the bill does not discriminate on the grounds of race or contravene international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Furthermore, concerns were raised in relation to retrospectivity. I am pleased to put to bed any concerns of that sort. The committee noted these and looked at that subject. It stated that, in its view, these provisions were clearly enunciated during the election campaign. Information on the proposed changes to the policy were widely circulated by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The committee noted that the provisions in this bill relating to special benefits are prospective and that new residents who arrive on or after 1 April 1996 will be eligible for special benefits under the current arrangements. Therefore, for those reasons, the committee was of the view that there was no retrospective effect in relation to this bill. This policy achieved a good deal of attention in the run-up to the March election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I mentioned that other recommendations were made by the majority. These related in part to the carers pension, the child disability allowance, the double orphan pension, the innocent illegals category of migrants and interdependent relationships. There was a lot more detail to it than that. I recommend to anyone interested in this area to read the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Suffice it to say that a number of groups gave evidence in relation to these areas of concern. This was taken up
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         by the committee and acted upon by the government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I might also add that the majority of the committee recommended that some guidelines be set down by the secretary to the department in relation to the definition of `family members'. Furthermore, as the two-year waiting period commences on the date of arrival in Australia or the granting of permanent resident status, the committee was of the view that any appeal provision should not unfairly interfere with the rights or situation of any appellant in relation to their status. For this reason, an amendment has been included to provide that if a decision not to grant a visa is overturned, the period will commence on the day it was initially refused. That concern was raised in the course of evidence and has been met by the majority report of the committee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I must also make it clear that this bill does not affect in any way the refugee or humanitarian programs which are currently in place. It does not detract from those in any form whatsoever and I think it is important that it not do so. At the end of the day we have a bill which strikes a balance between allowing for equity in dealing with those who fall within the exceptional categories that I have mentioned in part and the need to allow for responsible control of government expenditure in this area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Substantial savings will accrue on the passing of this bill. That will mean that the huge deficit which this government inherited in March this year can be partly addressed. The government looked not only at financial considerations but also at the matters that I raised earlier—in much more detail than I have enunciated here today—relating to exceptional circumstances, including such areas of concern as the carers pension, just to name one.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, therefore, there is a balance. I reject entirely the proposition that this is a bill which has not looked at these exceptional circumstances. There is a balance between controlling government expenditure and looking at the more human aspects which can touch on the area of immigration in these circumstances.

         The previous government saw fit to impose a six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period. This government in the run up to the election announced that its policy would be that this period would be extended to two years. It was on that basis that it was elected to power. I do not think you can get a clearer mandate than that.

This bill will amend legislation which is itself going to be amended by requests to be moved on behalf of the government.

        Nevertheless, it is legislation that has been put forward and, before it becomes law, will be amended further. It is to be amended partly because of the work of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which is chaired by Senator Ellison, who has just spoken. He himself has said that there was a need to make changes to the proposed amendments because the proposed amendments as they originally stood were too harsh.

        Having looked at the amendments put forward on behalf of the government, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Tambling) to find out before this comes on for debate in the committee stage what proposed division 18 refers to.

        As Senator Ellison and other speakers have said, this is a matter of balancing good government in terms of financial management against good government in terms of looking after people who come and live here. Senator McKiernan, who is not a bleeding heart, but
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         is very wise in this area and has been interested in it for many years, has said that this does not strike the proper balance between good government in terms of economic management and good government in terms of looking after people who come here to live, because, as has already been said, it imposes obligations on people who come here that are not imposed on others. That imposition is the necessity to exist without any assistance from the community at a time when people are most vulnerable—and Senator Brown brought this out.

        If it is the intention of this legislation to save money, then perhaps a better way round would be to give people the support they need when they get here and ask for repayment of that money when they have been able to set themselves up and are in a better position to return the money taken from the community. That is not a new concept by any means. We have HECS where we enable people to study at universities—to give them the skills needed to make this country the sort of country we want it to be—by giving them support when they most need it and we ask those students to pay back the money when they are in a better position to do so. Why that concept is not used in this circumstance I am really unable to see.

        People who get here from overseas, who are brought here in accordance with the law and who come here as lawful migrants are most likely to be trying to find out how the country runs and what the culture of the country is. They are probably trying to get themselves a job, trying to find out how to accommodate to the customs of the place and perhaps trying to skill themselves in English during those first two years. Why, when there are alternatives to this, do we impose upon them the hardship of coping without any support from the community? After all, they are to become our fellows as time goes by. Indeed, as I understand the situation, they become our fellows as soon as they get here.

        What we are doing with this legislation is simply saying, `You people may be in need, you may need disability wage supplements, you may need all sorts of things, but we are not going to give them to you because you are in a particular category,' even though there are some pensions which we say they ought to get, the double orphan's pension for example.

        Why is there this scheme which picks and chooses between those who are in need? If you are in need, you are in need. People recognise that. The government in its original proposals for this bill recognised that. The government members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee understood that. In fact, they made suggestions that this support be extended to a larger category of people than the government had originally suggested. That has been done by the government. The minority said that there were other categories.

        It seems to me extraordinary that we should say there should be choices made between people who are in need, by definition—that is what this is all about—so that some are allowed to get the lifeline and others are not when they will all ultimately become part of this community in which we live. We have got them at their most vulnerable: in the first two years they are here. How do we face them 10 years later when they are great contributors to this society? Do we say to them, `We are a bit sorry about those first two years. That is how things come. We had to make a choice. We had to save a certain amount of money and, unfortunately, your need, at the time desperate, could not be fulfilled'?

         respect of certain categories it is quite small. In relation to the double orphan's pension, for example, `negligible' is the word put beside each of the four financial years after this one. It is probably for that reason that the double orphan's pension has been taken off the list of those to which migrants will not be entitled in the first two years of their coming here.

        I suggest to the government that they look carefully at these categories generally to see if there cannot be at least more added to those that are exempt from this fairly rigorous legislation, which is going to deprive some people who have come here to live as residents and ultimately citizens of this country of assistance to help them through their hard times.

In fact, it is legislation which is designed to ease part of the burden which our economy can no longer bear. Why is it that the economy can no longer bear the burden? It is because of the spendthrift nature of those opposite when they were in power.

For example, newly

In the longitudinal survey of immigration to Australia, it was found that the overall unemployment rate for newly arrived residents was 39 per cent.

        The Labor government clearly came to the conclusion that they could no longer afford that sort of support and, therefore, made the rule 26 weeks. We are putting it out to 104 weeks. But those under the refugee and humanitarian program will not, in any way, be adversely affected by this. These conditions will apply to only those migrants who come here on the basis that they can look after themselves.

         —A couple of weeks ago, the annual report of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation was tabled in the Senate. I was interested in this because, by coincidence, my Perth office is on the same floor of the Exchange Plaza as Austrade and EFIC, as it is known. It seemed to me that EFIC was a fairly obscure government agency but, having read through the report, I would like to put on record that I greatly admire the contribution EFIC is making towards facilitating Australia's export drive to all parts of the world. It is very clear that EFIC is playing a very important role in promoting Australia's export trade internationally, in particular within the European and Asian markets. EFIC is doing an outstanding job in this area.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        According to EFIC's annual report, the corporation supported an incredible $7.5 billion in exports in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, which was an increase of some 20 per cent in the support they had given to Australian exports over the previous year. It shows that the work EFIC is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         doing in financing insurance for Australian exports is really vital to the international economy that Australia seeks to become a part of.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        EFIC support goes mostly to small and medium sized companies. For example, over the last year, as I said, the total value of exports that they supported was $7.5 billion, but that included $2.935 billion to Europe, $2.227 billion to Asia, and $1.173 billion to the Americas—which is, interestingly, made up of $949 million to North America and $224 million to South America—and also includes exports to the Middle East and to Africa. So EFIC's spectrum is very wide indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The kinds of companies that EFIC has supported include financing a German company's support of fast catamaran ferries for routes on the Baltic Sea to and from Sweden as well as other Baltic ports. Most of their focus, however, in terms of new business is in Asia, which is appropriate when one considers the growth of the economies in that area and their importance to Australia in the long run.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Asia accounted for 30 per cent of the total exports financed by EFIC, and South-East Asian buyers were recipients of 49 per cent of new loans signed. Indonesia was the largest borrower of medium- to long-term finance for Australian exports, while Singapore overtook Malaysia as the largest user of EFIC credit insurance in South-East Asia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        EFIC provided financial services to people who wished to export across the whole spectrum of South-East Asia, India, North Asia, China and Japan. Support was given for loans to China for 15 telecommunications and water treatment plants, which amounted to some $83 million in export value to Australia, and four export working capital guarantees were issued for things as diverse as mining machinery, pumps, packaging and brewing machinery—Australia, obviously, being a world leader in the technology of brewing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the case of Japan, credit insurance for exports to Japan increased by some $231 million, covering things such as dairy and machinery products. In addition, seven working capital guarantees were issued covering
        <break page="5947" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         contracts for aerospace equipment, car parts, motor cycles, audio editing equipment and canned beer. It just shows what a wide spectrum of activities EFIC does support, including, as I said, exports to places as diverse as the Middle East, Africa and South America—where three loans were signed for the export of agricultural machinery to Argentina and another loan provided for the provision and installation of telephone switches in the same country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Middle East is a growth area for EFIC with export credit insurance increasing by 45 per cent over the last year, and four export working capital guarantees were issued for Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It is interesting to compare the current record of the Australian merchandise export portfolio to various regions of the world with what it was 20 years ago. The figures reveal the changing pattern of Australia's involvement with the rest of the world and our growing engagement with Asia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1975, the Asian region as a whole accounted for 47.2 per cent of Australian merchandise exports compared with 63 per cent in 1995. Western Europe received 17 per cent of our merchandise exports in 1975, but this is now down to 12.3 per cent. Eastern Europe represented 4.7 per cent in 1975, but in 1995 that was only 0.6 per cent. The North American free trade area accounted for 12.8 per cent of our merchandise exports in 1975, but that is now down to 9.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These relative changes in percentages reflect the growth of Asia, particularly South-East Asia and North Asia, in importance as destinations for Australian exports. They are undoubtedly a measure of the success of Australia's push into the region following the British entry into the Common Market in the early 1970s. They also reflect the spectacular growth of some of the nations and their economies in the Asian region. It is interesting to note that, excluding Japan, the East Asian regional economies have grown by an average of 9.4 per cent since 1990. There is no doubt that this growth signals great opportunities for Australian industry and business.

         In conclusion, I would like to say and put on the record that I greatly admire the import ant contribution that this small office on the same floor as I occupy in Perth is  making to the Australian economy and to our export drive. I would like to put on record the fact that EFIC supports exports to some 155 countries either through insuring the exporter against non-payment by the buyer, which is credit insurance, or through providing finance for capital goods. As I said, I think they are doing a great job. They certainly deserve to be recognised for what they are doing.

         —I want to talk today about the effect that the Howard budget will have on the Western Australian economy. While it is important to note that Western Australians will be affected by changes in a general sense, like citizens in all other states, there are some particularly damaging aspects for Western Australia in this budget. Briefly, I will mention the broad general cuts taking place and then address one or two specific issues of concern.

        Prescriptions, as we know, will increase to $20. A family with three children, when they all get sick together, as is the norm, will face a bill of $60 in one hit for the prescriptions. Dental care promises by Mr Howard in the last election campaign have been broken and waiting lists for our elderly citizens will increase. The elderly will also be faced with a $34 a day charge for nursing homes when they earn more than $50 a week. This will be on top of the $26,000 up-front fee.

        The government's refusal to properly compensate doctors may result in the loss of bulk-billing. The result could be that consultant bills at the doctors will be $10 a visit. On top of this, government supported increases in health insurance premiums will provide no solace in the area of health care. I note reports in newspapers last week which show just how recently the Prime Minister has himself approved health insurance premium increases.

        These changes represent a strong ideological point of view. That view is that the government is bad. The objective then is to remove the government from participation in key sectors of the economy. A message I will repeat throughout this speech is that this view held by the government is wrong. We believe that the government does have a role to play in industry, job creation and service provision.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This retreat from government activity in the economy is best evident in my home state of Western Australia. It is particularly true with regard to the shipping bounties. The federal government slashed these in the budget when other competing nations now have a bounty of around 10 per cent. In a number of European countries the bounties have been increased. Termination of this bounty will affect a group of high growth, export oriented manufacturers. This is exactly the section of the economy we want to encourage, not push out of competitive business by slanting the playing field out of their favour.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This decision has resulted in shipping companies in Fremantle such as Austal Ships being unable to compete on a level playing field with its competitors. Whilst this in itself is harmful for the company involved, it also has disastrous ramifications for the Australian economy. The government will be hampering an industry which, through the assistance of the ships bounty, had a growth rate in production of 200 per cent, a growth in exports of 150 per cent and a growth in employment levels of 50 per cent since its inception.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On top of these figures is the way in which they translate to on&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;ground effects. In coastal areas such as Fremantle, Rockingham and Mandurah the industry may see a slump. The result will be a drop in income for local areas and a possible loss of jobs for many of the local residents. When the issue of suppliers and support staff is factored into those who will lose from the drop in work for Austal Ships and other such companies, the figures begin to grow.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, as if these macro figures were not enough, there is still more. The report which reviewed the government decision to cut the ships bounty is a flawed ideological document. The first surprising figure on which the government has based its decision is the size of the savings by termination of the bounty. The termination of the ships bounty will save the government the total sum of not quite $3 million. When compared to the size of the national economy, this saving is minuscule.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the size of the saving is compared against the damage which will be done to an important and potential growth area which is export oriented, the decision can be described as nothing other than sad. Stupidity also springs to mind. A paltry $3 million saving is not worth the loss in employment and export dollars generated from this industry. The government fails to realise that continued support of this industry can result in it eventually becoming successful enough to survive in a market without the bounty. However, at this stage it requires a small degree of assistance to get to that level.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Additionally, the report uses as its base some rather dodgy economic assertions. Firstly, the report quotes from a submission from the Bureau of Industry Economics. It states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         All export industries are in direct competition with each other, that is, Australia's ship builders, miners, farmers and tourist operators compete with each other to supply the foreign exchange that Australians use to buy imports.
        </para>
        <para>
         This a nonsense argument that all export industries are in competition with each other. They are, in fact, in competition for access to markets with other similar industry operators in that field around the world. The competition is between like markets for access rights. The notion that shipbuilders and farmers are competing for access rights with each other illustrates one of two things by the government—either profound stupidity and no understanding of the international economy or a willingness to use any silly argument to justify its ideological policies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This report that the government relies on is full of such other ridiculous and plain wrong statements and assumptions on which its
         <break page="5949" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          decisions are apparently based. There appears to be no real analysis of the industry assistance programs being terminated and the reasons why this should happen or why they should continue. The Senate should be aware that this is not an isolated incident. The same ridiculous cuts founded on poor analysis of the relevant industry is also occurring with the book bounty, computer bounty and the machine tools and robots bounty.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Commitment to this document illustrates two things about the current government. Firstly, there is an inability to think through issues comprehensively with regard to the national economy—a failure which stems from lack of understanding about the forces that drive the engines of growth in our own economy. The second point it illustrates is that this current government understands little about how competitors in South-East Asia manage their economy and, consequently, do not understand how to make the government and its policies work to the advantage of our own domestic industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The decision by the government to slash the bounty and retreat from government involvement in this sector may increase unemployment in the Western Australian economy and reduce its export contributions to the nation. The Labor Party rejects this approach by government because we believe that the government does have a critical role to play in assisting industry to build on exports and create employment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The concern and attitude towards the government stemming from this decision, however, does not stop there. Austal Ships were rightly aggrieved when the government showed their arrogance and lack of interest in industry policy by granting Austal Ships only a 10-minute hearing after they flew all the way from Perth to Canberra at their own expense to argue their case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The cuts to export oriented markets do not stop there, however. The slashing of the DIFF program has meant that Western Australian companies involved in shipbuilding and construction in other countries has seen their support eroded. The result is a further loss of export dollars and, as a result, employment in Western Australia.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          From this an additional question must be asked. Why is the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, not doing more to save Austal Ships and the local economy? In fact, the role of Mr Court in the whole budget debate needs to be closely examined. It is forecast that the impact of the budget will be felt in early 1997. Coincidentally, the Premier has shifted the Western Australian election from its traditional date of February/March to 14 December of this year. The result will be the state election not coinciding with the initial impact of the budget cuts in Western Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There has been no attempt in Western Australia to diversify the economy from being simply reliant on the resources sector. An export oriented manufacturer such as Austal Ships has been successful at doing this. Their good work is now liable to be destroyed by the actions of the Commonwealth government. The government needs to recognise the role industry policy and support can play in our economy and use it sufficiently to Australia's advantage.

         —I rise tonight to continue my remarks of 16 October regarding the possible health effects of low level radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation. Over the next three weeks, the Standards Australia subcommittee for non&amp;hyphen;ionising radiation will make a decision about a proposal to relax the public exposure standard for radiofrequency microwave radiation by a factor of five—that is, from 200 microwatts per square centimetre to 1,000 microwatts or one milliwatt.

        I suggest to the government that it should, as a matter of some urgency, request the Standards Australia subcommittee to postpone a final decision on these standards until all of the relevant data has been properly assessed. As I understand it, discussion and decision making processes on the standards subcommittee have essentially taken place behind closed doors away from the scrutiny of the general public, from independent scientists and from concerned interest groups who might hold a different view from that of the industry.

         I ask senators to take note that the standards subcommittee is very heavily weighted with industry representation. They include: the Australian Electronics Industry Association, the Australian Radiation Protection Society, the Civil Aviation Authority, departments of industrial relations and employment in New South Wales, departments of defence and transport and communications, the Institution of Radio and Electronics Engineers of Australia, the National Measurement Laboratory of CSIRO, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, Royal Adelaide Hospital and the Wireless Institute of Australia.

         The government is passing its regulatory responsibilities to limit or control emissions of electromagnetic radiation to a body controlled, in this instance, by the very industries which stand to gain from the sales and use of electromagnetic technology. This shift, together with the fact that industry interests ignore warning signs from recent research which points to likely health effects, makes it clear to me that we have an environmental, public and occupational health and planning problem on our hands.

         I think it is also fair to say that consultative processes appear to be playing second fiddle to the economic growth and expansion of the telecommunications industry. I have spoken before about why some scientists are concluding that low power density microwaves could pose serious health problems. The current Australian exposure standard is not a standard that takes low level microwaves into account. The exposure standard is a thermal standard, set up by technical and industrial experts at a time when wireless technology was far less developed than it is now. It is more appropriate as a protection for those exposed to very high or occupational levels of microwave radiation.

         In a few days time a conference in Munich will be convening with international delegates, including Australians, to discuss this problem of athermal microwaves on human health. Professor Goldsmith also has this to say about the issue:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There are strong political and economic reasons for needing there to be no health effect of RF/MW exposure, just as there are strong public health reasons for more accurately portraying the risks. Those of us who intend to speak for public health must be ready for opposition that is nominally, but not truly, scientific.
        </para>
        <para>
         But, to return to the change to the exposure standard, I have been advised that, of non&amp;hyphen;industry members voting, CSIRO is opposed to relaxing the standard, on the basis that the science is inadequate to guarantee human safety and, furthermore, that to date there is no operational reason for the change. There is currently no equipment which needs this massive increase, or any increase.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Former chief medical officer of Telstra, Dr Bruce Hocking, has voted no already to the relaxation of the standard, because of uncertainties arising from his recent survey around the TV towers in Sydney. But I understand that the Australian Radiation Laboratory will vote in favour of it. This is quite an interesting position for a Commonwealth government health and radiation safety body to take and I suggest that it is not unreasonable to question whether this might in fact be a failure to act in the interests of the public.

         The discussion on this standards subcommittee on whether or not to relax the standard has been fraught with uncertainty both here and in New Zealand and the final outcome of that voting is still not certain. But I remind the Senate that people are being told by industry and by government that our electromagnetic radiation emissions are well within the standard.

It is an attitude which the current legislation has fostered. I suggest to you that feelings out there where people live are reaching boiling point. Week after week, my office receives calls from people who are struggling to come to terms with their inability to get answers from an industry which seems only interested in its own very narrow research. I suggest that not only is a review of the present exposure standard due but also the basic structure of the standards subcommittee needs to be examined to make sure that it is a more balanced and representative body.

         I also suggest that it is quite inappropriate for the standard to be relaxed at a time when ongoing research indicates that there may well be serious health effects from accumulated high frequency microwave radiation.

         Biological plausibility is an important guide to judging causality, but is of limited value in assessing exposures that have been studied for a relatively short period . . .

Rather, there is a high level of scientific uncertainty, and the implications for policy making depend largely on where the onus of proof lies: the epidemiological evidence

         newspaper on Friday last, 22 November. Also I will relate those remarks to some others I made in this place in September of this year regarding the Royal Commission into the City of Wanneroo which is proceeding in Western Australia right now.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The article in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        is entitled `Davis criticises MHR'. It starts:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Wanneroo royal commissioner Roger Davis has accused Labor MHR Stephen Smith of acting irresponsibly by using parliamentary privilege to reveal Mr Davis had suppressed evidence by accountant Laurie Fowler and then ordered that no reference be made to the suppression.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Davis is quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am not of course able to identify the reasons which applied in the case of Mr Fowler without
        <break page="5952" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         even further undermining the confidentiality I was seeking to enforce.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        The article also states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In his speech to the House on Monday, Mr Smith said the commission's decision raised very grave concerns for people interested in accountability. Mr Smith described Mr Davis' act of suppressing the suppression order as a "double banger"—and it is also a tongue twister.
       </para>
       <para>
        One can understand why Mr Davis would not want to identify all his reasons for having taken the very unusual step of suppressing the fact that there had been a suppression order. But one would hope that his reasons for issuing that double&amp;hyphen;banger suppression order are not related to the state election which is under way in Western Australia now. One would hope also that Mr Davis is not protecting Premier Richard Court's chief political adviser, Richard Elliott. One would hope, indeed, that that is not the case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to draw a distinction between what is happening in this particular matter with the suppression of Mr Fowler's evidence as opposed to what happened in the commission recently to the suppression of evidence given by the previous commissioner into Wanneroo, Mr Peter Kyle, and the again quite extraordinary actions by the commissioner in lifting that suppression order on the evidence given by Mr Kyle. Again, one would hope sincerely that Mr Davis has not been influenced by fact that there is an election going on in the state of Western Australia at this time and, indeed, by the fact that Mr Kyle happens to be a candidate in that election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the speech I gave some months ago, to which I have referred, I mentioned that Mr Kyle had previously criticised police in Western Australia for going soft on corruption, for not vigorously investigating politicians and for refusing to hand over documents necessary to his inquiry—and this was reported in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        on 11 April 1996. Mr Kyle also had earlier stated in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        newspaper on 17 February that `some of the same police figures alleged to be involved in the Argyle diamonds disappearance also were involved in Wanneroo' and that `people in the drug trade had connections with Wanneroo'.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This royal commission we have proceeding in Western Australia is truly extraordinary and it continues to be extraordinary. Not only are there the matters I have referred to tonight but there are also the actions of the commission and the effects of the commission to date which are of grave concern to the good citizens of Western Australia. One of the casualties of the commission so far has been the intelligence unit of the Ministry for Justice which is involved in the gathering of information about one David King. David King was convicted of corruption and gaoled, and some of his evidence was given to the commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr King was subject to an axe job by the counsel assisting the commission. But of greater concern was that it was said that her attacks had serious implications for the fight against crime and corruption generally because all law enforcement agencies at both state and federal level depend on the information flow. Miss Narelle Johnson was critical of the ministry's intelligence unit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The officer in charge of certain investigations before the commission, Detective McLeod, told the commission that the Police Bureau of Criminal Intelligence had been informed of an association between convicted former mayor of Wanneroo Bradshaw and convicted drug runner Allan Harriman, what had been done about this and about the contacts between Bradshaw and well&amp;hyphen;known criminal John Kizon.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Royal Commissioner, Mr Davis, has decided not to require Harriman to give evidence because his information is outside the terms of reference. It seems to me that terms of reference can be particularly fluid from time to time as, indeed, it would appear that the use of suppression orders have been fluid from time to time, depending on who they are going to impact upon. But the matter of the intelligence unit and the impact of the commission on it is of importance. Previously it was staffed by eight people; it is now only going to be staffed by five people. Its name, of course, is also going to be changed. It is going to be called just the intelligence unit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Part of the role of any intelligence unit is the gathering and collection of intelligence.
         <break page="5953" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Part of the gathering and collection of intelligence occurs in prisons. We have already witnessed the impact of the reduction in staff and, indeed, the impact of the reduction in the gathering of information in the prisons in Western Australia. On one particular weekend—the weekend of 26 and 27 October, just a month ago—a total of 10 prisoners escaped from the Karnet and Wooroloo prison farms. There were five escapes from each of them. A total of 39 escapes have occurred in Western Australia in the financial year to date—that is, from 1 July this year. Intelligence unit staff are now not permitted to go into prisons to gather information from prisoners and/or staff. They are now reliant on information passed to them by security staff within each institution. It is well known that this system of information gathering does not work. Prisons have a history of not passing on information for fear that their prison will be criticised for poor management practices.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The restricted movement of intelligence staff in prisons will lead to the reduction of criminal intelligence being passed to police. This will mean that vital criminal intelligence is not gathered or passed to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. With the reduction in the number of intelligence staff, the intelligence unit will also cease its weekend coverage. It will no longer be able to provide a service to prisons and police during the weekends.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I suppose I too could be criticised by Commissioner Davis for giving out that information, but I suspect that those incarcerated in the prison system in Western Australia will know that their weekends are quite free to plan whatever they care to plan. Of course, when we talk about illicit drugs and the use of illicit substances within the prison system, one really has to be concerned that the intelligence system is not there to detect these things at the moment. The matter of the Wanneroo royal commission is of grave concern, but I suggest that the behaviour of the commissioner—and, indeed, counsel assisting—may indeed be of even graver concern in the long term for Western Australia and for the justice system of Australia.

         Senator O'BRIEN
        </emphasis>
        (Tasmania) (7.56 p.m.) This evening I rise to speak about the sale of Tasrail as part of the Australian National Rail sale which was announced on Sunday by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). I noted the comments that were made by Senator Abetz today in taking note in relation to a criticism of the opposition with regard to questions asked in question time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The issues that have been raised in relation to the statement by the minister regarding the sale are serious issues. One would have thought that the minister would have been keen to have had those issues properly tested by the scrutiny of parliament, and yet the minister announced this most important aspect of the business of the Australian transport industry on a Sunday leading into a week when the House of Representatives was not sitting. I understand we have the opportunity to ask questions of Senator Alston, who is representing the minister in the Senate. However, I do not think that is the desirable course of action; Minister Sharp is the appropriate person to be answering those questions. I think there are some questions that the minister needs to address himself to—and, no doubt, will—when the House of Representatives resumes next Monday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was amazed to hear Senator Abetz, who represents Tasmania, being so fulsome in his praise of the sale of Australian National and the National Rail Corporation given the position of Tasrail, the Tasmanian arm of Australian National. It is equally amazing that the Tasmanian government has abrogated its responsibility to Tasmania on this issue and supports Minister Sharp's plan for the sell&amp;hyphen;off of Tasrail. According to today's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Examiner
        </emphasis>
        newspaper, Tasmania is the only state in which the track—or, as it is more properly known, the permanent way—will most probably not remain in public ownership. There is some question about the land on which the rails lie, but that is not yet resolved. The question of even that aspect of the asset is up in the air.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am advised that Tasrail lost $6.6 million in the last financial year. That compares with
        <break page="5954" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         losses in the 1980s of in excess of $15 million. When you factor those losses into today's dollars, you find that Tasrail's position has improved markedly following the restructure of Tasrail that the former Labor government set about achieving.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand, but have not had fully confirmed, that Tasrail's losses are in part due to the cost of servicing debt. It is interesting to note that the proposal that the minister has put before the public involves the federal government effectively taking upon itself and removing from the rail assets the total debt of $2 billion. If that debt is removed from Tasrail, then I suspect it becomes a profitable concern. However, given the sale is supported by the Tasmanian government, which is a minority government and does not have of its own right the ability to govern, and given that it is obviously the policy of the federal government, one must consider the possible implications for Tasmania of the sale.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is, I suspect, probable that some of the lines and services will close, transferring the cargo carried on those lines to road freight. Every 100,000 tonnes transferred to the road equates to 72 tri&amp;hyphen;axle truck movements per week. That is one way, assuming they go full one way and come back empty to their original loading point. If you consider that in terms of the B double or articulated truck systems, that is 46 truck movements both ways. Again, that assumes that the trucks are fully laden.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Transfer of course will therefore mean more pressure on the roads. Road damage is repaired at the cost of the state. Also, there are dangers and inconveniences caused to road users by the additional use by heavy vehicles of the Tasmanian road system. It is also probable that increased freight charges to rail users will occur, as any buyers seek to recover their purchase costs. That will have an impact upon the Tasmanian economy, but it also may have the impact of forcing further freight onto the road system on the basis of the cost competition between road and rail freight.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at the totality of the picture, you will see that last year Tasrail carried 2,091,000 tonnes of freight. If you convert
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that to tri&amp;hyphen;axle or B double trucks, you find that it is suddenly between 980 and 1,400 additional truck movements per week, again both ways. If you look at what might happen, for example, in the transportation of coal from the Fingal Valley—and anyone in Tasmania who knows the road would be considering in horror the prospect of heavy truck movements carrying coal on that road—you see that there would need to be 80 additional truck movements each way each day to carry the 50 tonnes of coal that is carried out of there per day. In relation to the carriage of cement from Railton to Devonport—this is the most profitable line and it may be the most remote possibility—if it were transferred to a trucking system, it would involve one truck movement for every three minutes of the day.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So at its best, this proposal, this strategy, is a massive risk for Tasmania. If it does not come off, Tasmania will lose its rail services and hundreds of jobs. If it does not come off, there is the prospect of massive damage to the Tasmanian road system at the cost of the Tasmanian government to repair it. In addition, there will be a disincentive to the tourists who travel the state's roads. That is not a good thing for the tourism industry in Tasmania, given the events over the recent year and the fact that Tasmania is looking to rebuild its tourism industry. We are looking at the possibility of further carnage on Tasmanian highways as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The risk being taken in relation to Tasrail, if one separates that from the rest of the package, is unnecessary. Clearly Tasrail is able to be kept in public hands and to operate profitably if the debt burden is removed from it. The Tasmanian government should demand that Tasrail be handed back debt free to be run by the Tasmanian government in the interests of the Tasmanian people. That is an equitable solution. In relation to this sale, there is a case to be made for separating Tasrail from the rest of the rail assets.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Workplace Relations legislation will outlaw discrimination in employment on a number of grounds, including age, membership or non-membership of a union and family responsibilities. Consistent with the principle of non-discrimination, the government intends to repeal compulsory age 65 retirement—an issue where, under Labor, the Commonwealth lagged behind other jurisdictions.
       </para>
       <para>
        All I can say is alleluia to that. I have been campaigning in this chamber for years to see that reform and I welcome the announcement that Mr Reith made in that discussion paper. The days when capable, productive and vastly experienced employees are told to quit merely because they have reached a certain age will soon be a thing of the past. I have been approached in the corridors of this place by a number of people, including public servants, since I brought in my first private member's bill. They have asked me what is happening about this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have said here a number of times, it is not as if we will be overwhelmed by the number of people over age 65 wanting to stay on. I have forgotten what the percentage is, but off the top of my head it will be a very small percentage. I stand to be corrected but about four per cent of public servants are over 64 years of age. There is not going to be a great flood of people wanting to stay on and thus taking jobs from younger people, but a number of people are capable of staying on and wish to do so. How ably people can do that is demonstrated by people in small business working till their middle or late 70s—and even later.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems to me inappropriate that in this day and age we have a retirement age in the Public Service. As I have said, I have campaigned against this inequity for many years. I have introduced two private member's bills—one in 1992 and another in 1995—and all the Labor Party could do was give excuse after excuse about why it was impossible to get rid of age discrimination. Older Australians are justifiably outraged at the existence of age discrimination. As I said, denying people the opportunity of employment based
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         solely on one's age without regard to their ability, qualifications or experience is no less offensive than discrimination on the basis of sex, race or religion.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All too often older Australians are betrayed and stereotyped as being frail, dependent, unwell, incapable of learning new skills, inflexible, unable to accept change, passive and unproductive. Those sorts of views and concepts will be thrown out the window. There is no arbitrary point in life where we can say someone is no longer a productive and worthwhile member of the work force. There is no discriminating age at which one can determine that someone is not capable of being productive in the work force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The abolition of age discrimination has been part of coalition policy since 1988. Labor has dragged its feet on this issue for at least six years. The coalition has made concrete moves to address this, even though it has been in office since only 2 March, but I want to remind people of Labor's history on this matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1990, the Minister for Social Security, Graham Richardson, gave an undertaking to remove age discrimination from all existing federal legislation. That was never done despite an undertaking by a minister. In 1993, Senator Bolkus stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department is working towards the development of a comprehensive Commonwealth age discrimination policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was never done. We saw the resistance the Labor Party showed when time and again I moved amendments in this chamber to enable people serving on boards of statutory authorities to remain doing so after they were 65. One example is the National Maritime Museum. They said they were grateful I moved those amendments because a retired naval officer who was able to make major contributions to the museum was going to have to cease working with them and they wanted to still be able to call on his skills and abilities post age 65.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only way we could overcome this type of situation was, when a bill that related to a statutory authority like the museum or various bodies of that ilk came forward, to systematically put an amendment to allow people aged
        <break page="5956" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         over 65 to serve on the board. Senator Baume and I religiously put that in every time one came up and gradually, bit by bit, we wore away the stone.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But Labor always found some problem—for example, if the person concerned fell over, what would we do about their compensation? There was always some petty excuse. They could not work out a way of overcoming these things. But it so happens that every state legislature except Tasmania has been able to do it. All states except Tasmania have enacted legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age—the most recent being Victoria with the Equal Opportunity Act 1995. It was not a Labor government but a coalition government which enacted that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is disgraceful that the Commonwealth should be second last to enact this legislation and to enact this protection. It is particularly disgraceful that for so long the Commonwealth and the Labor Party tolerated discrimination against its own employees. We have lagged behind the rest of the world in this regard. Labor have ignored the moves that have taken place in many other legislatures around the world. On page 11 of the report of inquiry into complaints of discrimination in employment and occupation, dated 30 August this year, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner said:
       </para>

        I wonder whether Chris Sidoti realised when he wrote that how quickly the government would move.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I call upon the Labor Party, the Greens, the Democrats and the Independents to give their full support to the amendment which will eliminate age discrimination in the Public Service. I hope Senator Barney Cooney's comments in this chamber the other day that people should not be discriminated against on the basis of age and that they should be allowed to work if they are capable of doing so signal a change of mind in the Labor Party.

         —I rise tonight to outline an imaginative proposal by the government to create jobs in regional Australia. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is investigating a proposal to build two new Department of Social Security client service centres. The plan is to build these somewhere in regional Australia to create jobs there. The minister is communicating with state and territory governments to enlist their support and cooperation, so it is outrageous that the ALP government in New South Wales has strenuously rejected the minister's proposals. Chances to win regional jobs for New South Wales have been knocked on the head by the state Labor government. That will put those of us in New South Wales' rural and regional cities at a great disadvantage.

        Minister Newman's proposal had two key elements. The Department of Social Security was going to build one or two hub centres in regional Australia. They were going to be manned by 200 staff to service the telephone inquiries of the department's clients. Of course, with advances in the information superhighway and the roll&amp;hyphen;out of optic fibre around Australia, it really does not matter where you put these sorts of centres. Traditionally we have tended to put these things in the centre of the big cities. With the new technology, this is no longer necessary.

        As the United States examples have shown us, you can often drive the taxpayer's dollar quite a lot further if you put such centres in regional areas, where the land is cheaper and there is often an available, quite willing and skilled labour force—that is certainly the case in my area—to take advantage of such a proposal. To support this arrangement, each state government was asked to indicate the
        <break page="5957" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         level of assistance that they were prepared to put towards such a project by way of grants or other incentives to attract the Department of Social Security to a regional city. It was suggested that this support could be in the form of fitting out premises and free rent periods and could involve staff transport costs and the costs of furnishing and equipment. A bidding process to force such efficiencies and save taxpayers' money was to be undertaken to encourage the state and territory governments to play a constructive role in regional development.

        So what has been the response of the New South Wales ALP government to this imaginative proposal? The Treasurer of that government, Michael Egan, has guaranteed single&amp;hyphen;handedly that another major investment will not be going to New South Wales. Mr Egan is again turning his back on rural and regional Australia, and possible job creation projects in areas such as Newcastle and Maitland are now at risk. Labor, both at the federal and state levels, appears incapable of learning the lesson that people in regions such as the Hunter want support, not sabotage, for investment proposals such as this.

        The DSS proposal would be ideally located in the Hunter region, which has very high youth unemployment and a skilled population that could quite easily fill the 200 positions available. We have sites in the region, such as the better cities Honeysuckle development in Newcastle, and certainly ones in Maitland as an alternative. If the New South Wales ALP government is serious about attracting jobs to the Hunter, it should at least consider Senator Newman's proposal.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Baldwin) and I will not be deterred by Mr Egan's playing politics. We will seek urgent discussions with the Minister for Social Security to ensure that the Hunter region is listed as a possible location for the Department of Social Security's hub service centre. In the meantime, we will continue to expose the ALP as the party that is sabotaging job creation in the Hunter region and other parts of New South Wales.
