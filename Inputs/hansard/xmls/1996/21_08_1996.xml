         —I wish to advise senators that Mr John Brudenall, the Deputy Parliamentary Librarian, retired on 7 August 1996 after 30 years of service to the parliament. I think that only the right honourable member for New England and the Clerk of the House of Representatives can look back on a continuous service record which is longer than Mr Brudenall's. He started when a Liberal coalition government was in power and he has retired when the Liberal coalition is again in power.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He had a commendable and distinguished career in parliamentary service, starting in the acquisitions and cataloguing area of the Old Parliament House when the staff then numbered only a few dozen, and he has retired at a time when the Parliamentary Library is one of the very best such services in the world with a staff of over 200 and a budget of $16 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In many ways John can be regarded as the father of the modern Parliamentary Library, for it was largely at his instigation and against a great deal of institutional resistance that he moved the library from being just a reference library and a reading service into a wider, modern, information technology world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Librarians of course regard books as important, and books are very important to John. He foresaw the coming of the electronic data age and it was under his guidance that the library moved from the card index and now to the Internet. It is without doubt one of the best equipped facilities in the world—as will
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         be attested to by many of us and our staff who have had to seek information in the library in a short span of time.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        John Brudenall will be remembered by his peers as a thoroughly professional librarian and public servant. He was honoured by the Library Association of Australia in 1986 when he was made a fellow of the association for his `contribution to parliamentary librarianship, to education for librarianship and to the library profession'. He was at all times a highly regarded professional in an institution which, more often than not, was not headed by a librarian. His urbanity and measured confidence will be missed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He was perhaps of the `old school' of public servant who believed that his role was to remain in the background and advise, and his record of long and loyal service speaks for itself. We should and do acknowledge the service of Mr Brudenall. On behalf of all senators I wish him and his wife Sue great happiness in retirement and hope that from time to time he will be able to return and see his many friends in this building.

In fact, I am sure that many of us cannot quite imagine coming back to the chamber in a couple of weeks from now and finding that he is not here.

         A man of immense talent and drive, it was a great loss to the Menzies government that his ministerial career was cut short by the very tight election of 1961 when he lost his seat by only a handful of votes. His commitment to the Liberal Party never waned and he went on to serve his party as president of the New South Wales division. He also served as Director of the Australian Ballet Foundation for 10 years from 1979 to 1987.

        He entered federal politics in 1952 when he won the New South Wales seat of Lyne. In his first speech in parliament he spoke of the economic difficulties facing Australia at the time, in particular the need to contain inflation—a subject which is as relevant today as it was then. He also reflected on the pressures borne by the government of the day.

        Phil's long parliamentary career saw him embrace many issues of public concern.

        Philip Lucock was born in 1916 in England. He studied theology at St Andrews Theological Hall in Sydney until the Second World War intervened and he promptly enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force.

        In 1952, the Country Party prevailed on him to contest the seat of Lyne in a by-election following the death of the sitting member, James Eggins. He won the seat and held it for almost 29 years, winning 11 elections along the way, until his retirement in 1980. Despite his successful contesting of Lyne, Philip Lucock maintained his ecclesiastical commitments by conducting dozens of church services each year.

Very often I forget that particular aspect, which should be very important to us. It was very important and much appreciated by me during the long illness of my wife.

        He was very strong on the need for parliamentarians to be accountable to their electorate. As has been said, he was a member of the House of Representatives for 28 years. In order to serve for 28 years he had to be elected no fewer than 12 times. I do not think he would give too many thanks to certain Prime Ministers who were interested in double dissolutions—they will remain unnamed at this stage. It is no wonder he had the very strongly entrenched view that members of parliament should be accountable to their electorate. He certainly was and the electorate of Lyne continued to return Phil Lucock, and justifiably so. I would also like to express my condolences to his children Robert, Ian, Patricia and Alison and to their families.

         Those basic facts go to the way in which this government has behaved in regard to this inquiry and whether or not this government has sought to frustrate the work of this committee. Quite clearly, what we saw from government senators throughout this inquiry was quite a deliberate campaign to undermine and attack witnesses who put points of view different from those of Senator Alston.

         A series of documents were sought by me concerning project Mercury, which you are well aware is a plan, which was instituted by this government after its election, for the removal of one-third of the employees in Telstra. It is a plan by this government, despite its commitments not to engage in the structural separation of Telstra—that is, the carving up of the company—to gut Telstra.

         We asked for documents about a project which had come to my attention, a project which was not denied by the officers of Telstra. Documents were then provided to us on an in-confidence basis—quite extraordinary! Documents that I have been handing out all over the country were given back to us on an in-confidence basis. What an extraordinary proposition that somehow or other this committee can be provided with material on an in-confidence basis—that is, secret; we are not supposed to talk about it—when it is common knowledge and publicly admitted throughout the length and breadth of this country. We are talking about the removal of some 24,000 jobs.

         We want to have a look at those documents since they were delivered to us on Monday.

         What we have is an attempt, I think, by this government to direct Telstra management to carve up that company contrary to this government's election commitments, contrary to the statements made to this parliament, in an attempt to destroy this company, in an attempt to undermine the living standards of one-third of the employees of Telstra and then to somehow or another mislead the committee as to the way in which that is being done.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Officers of Telstra were asked direct questions as to whether or not they had a head count target. They denied it. The documents clearly indicate that they did have a head count target. So there is no doubt in my mind that this government has had a program to undermine Telstra, quite contrary to all that has been said.

         It has been stated that the South Australian government has not responded to the questions that have been put on notice. That is clearly the case. What happened in South Australia is that the government of South Australia, the Liberal government of South Australia, acknowledged the very serious and profound effect that the privatisation of Telstra would have on regional employment in South Australia. Quite extraordinary job losses will occur in South Australia as a result of this government's actions in destroying one of Australia's great public companies. We asked the South Australian government to answer a few basic questions. They have failed to do it. What we are seeing right throughout this country is a campaign by the Liberal Party not to cooperate with this inquiry.

         We come to the third proposition that is involved in this motion; that is, the cuts that have been imposed on this parliament by this government which require at least a week's gap between the preparation of documents and the printing of them—quite an extraordinary proposition, particularly given an inquiry of this complexity with its some 650 submissions. It is a very serious inquiry. There have been quite detailed and serious responses highly complex in nature, and they require the
         <break page="2756" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          committee to analyse them in some detail to make sure we get it right.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What does this government do? It imposes cuts on this parliament so that the documents cannot be printed, so that this chamber is restricted in its capacity to have information. The people of this country are restricted in their capacity to have documents made available as a result of the work of committees of this parliament. The documents from Telstra were delivered to us after the deadlines for those printing requirements—which of course have been imposed as a result of budget cuts by this government—had passed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When it is all seen in context, we understand that your briefing, Senator Kemp, should have been a little more complete. You should have understood that it was Senator Baume who strongly supported this proposition yesterday. He, for one, has made very clear his very grave concern about the way in which Telstra and its senior officers have treated this parliament and the contempt they have shown towards this inquiry by trying to mislead it and cover their tracks by trying to give us documents on an in&amp;hyphen;confidence basis. That is quite an extraordinary proposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is this parliament's right to determine what is and what is not in confidence. Quite clearly, the committee needs to look at the documents that go to the meetings of project Mercury, the target counts that they have identified and their attempts to sell off Visionstream, for instance—a whole series of measures that quite clearly demonstrate that this government's word is not worth the paper it is written on. Of course, they try to cover it up by suggesting that we cannot talk about that in a public way. This committee needs to look at those documents, and I think quite properly so. Senator Baume made it very clear yesterday that that clearly was his view as well, and that is presumably why he seconded this proposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we have is quite clearly a case of gross hypocrisy. This government does not even intend to introduce the legislation until the week beginning 9 September. From what I heard Senator Hill say on TV last night, I think that might be a very optimistic timetable. It is quite clear no attempt has been
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          made here by this government to push an earlier timetable for this legislation. What you have are your documents, your own records, setting down, Senator Kemp, that you do not intend to discuss this legislation until at least that week, and I would suggest it will be perhaps a bit longer than that in terms of possible delays.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What this proposition before the Senate does is allow the committee to do its job properly—quite contrary to the campaign of deliberate frustration that we have had to encounter from this government and from Telstra management. It is very interesting to look at who is actually supporting the privatisation of Telstra. The key supporters are the management of Telstra, who will gain massively in terms of market salaries—huge increases in salaries will come to them—and market analysts, who will enjoy enormous benefits as a result of the privatisation of Telstra. But very few other people in this country support the privatisation of Telstra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I am not surprised in the slightest at the way in which the management have treated this committee. We have seen over many years the way in which they have treated parliamentary committees. This is unfortunate, given that one of the great strengths of Telstra is its public accountability—the capacity of ordinary Australians to know, through this parliament, what is going on inside one of Australia's great companies. It seems to me that you, Senator Kemp, would be better advised to get some better advice because quite clearly you have not got a clue.

All were transacted within 20 minutes. So for Senator Kemp to get up here today and say that he really does not want this vital committee to extend its time by two weeks, which will not actually interfere in the legislative consideration of the subject under consideration, is absolutely demeaning to the position of manager of government business in this place.

You have to lift your game here, Senator Kemp. You actually have to bend with the wind on occasions and pick your fights in this chamber, and this one was not worth picking. This was not worth picking because the offer that has been made to you is that the committee will bring down its report before we get to the substantive debate on the Telstra bill.

Looking at their onerous timetable, I have immense sympathy and admiration for the massive amount of work people have put into this Telstra inquiry, and you should not belittle it, Senator Kemp. It is true—it is on the record—that Telstra itself was late in responding to questions. Had the committee brought a report in and not considered those late answers by Telstra, you would have been the first one to jump to your feet and say that the committee did not take everything into con sideration. This is a reasonable request. I think you should let us get on with it and grant the motion.

The reason these words were carefully drafted was that there was concern that many of the problems the community had were not problems in the bill but were problems not mentioned in the bill. That was why it was necessary to carefully draft the reference so that the concerns about going a new step would be able to be dealt with in the inquiry.

         Added to that was concern for the prospective witnesses to this inquiry. If people wanted to bring in those concerns about what was not mentioned in an inadequate bill, then they would be likely to be abused by government members of the committee. So for many reasons, including the lack of desire to have people face that kind of treatment, the various non-government senators looked carefully at the wording of the inquiry to make sure that the community had the chance to put those views about their concerns to the whole package and issue as widely as they could.

        I rise to speak on the conduct of the committee. I believe the conduct of the government was inappropriate when it used its numbers on the committee to stifle genuine attempts to hear the views of people, particularly in Sydney. The committee was quite direct in that it refused to go to Sydney to hear from residents there. It was of great concern to the Labor Party that there were a number of issues to do with airport noise and environmental concerns in and around Sydney airport. The subject of cross&amp;hyphen;ownership of a second airport in New South Wales was specifically denied to committee members. Offers to go to Perth or Brisbane were all available, but not to Sydney, and this was an attempt by the government—

          occurred in this inquiry. With regard to witnesses, I am going to have to go through this in some sequence. I start by referring to the fact that this was a reference to the legislation committee that came from the Labor Party itself. I believe that the committee cooperated in progressing this report but that the cooperation from the other side of this chamber was not forthcoming, particularly from Senator Conroy.

        I must report that there were at least two occasions when Senator Conroy did not attend when meetings had been called, despite the fact that we went to his office—I went personally and informed his staff that the meeting was on. He did not turn up and we did not have a quorum to discuss any of these matters. I left a message on Senator Collins's answering machine—and I am pleased that he is sitting here—and Senator Collins turned up at that meeting, at which I gave an explanation of where we were at. He accepted and voted for the motion as recorded in the minutes on that matter. The minutes read `that the Committee meet in Canberra or at other venues to be determined by the Chairman on Monday, 5 and Tuesday, 6 August 1996 in order to hold public hearings into the provisions of the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996'.

        The proposal that was put to the government members of that committee by Senator Conroy was that he would like to have meetings in Melbourne, not Sydney. The  proposition that was put from Senator Woodley, also a member of that committee, was that he would like to have meetings in Sydney. The government members—and I in particular—said that in this inquiry and because we were in up weeks it was an opportunity, as Sydney was not in the first tranche, also to have hearings in either Perth or Adelaide or both. That came from us. Because there was no attendance at those meetings and the matter was not progressed, I did say privately to Senator Conroy and Senator Woodley that the situation required a compromise of minds to handle it because a lot of us, as we all know, were involved in other hearings. In my case, it was the industrial relations hearings. No agreement was reached by the time we got to

        It is interesting to look at the words of that motion that I have read out: `that the Committee meet in Canberra or at other venues to be determined by the Chairman'. That was me. At no stage after that meeting did I have a request from anyone else to consider another venue. In fact, if we go a little bit further—and I would need to check this with the secretariat—I believe that we actually heard from everybody who put in a submission and, because of the interest shown, we did not meet on two days; we met on one day.

        There are other matters in terms of amendments which we will deal with when we debate the bill, but we did not have the request for any more meetings. At no stage was there any request to go beyond that motion which I would have considered. I think it is quite out of place for Senator Conroy to make these charges against the government members of the committee because we were more than reasonable in trying to determine where we should go and how we should handle this. We even discussed the possibility at one stage of looking at Brisbane as well. In the final analysis we came down to one hearing, which dealt with the witnesses that were before us. Your request to go to Melbourne was not denied, but you never delivered any individuals from Melbourne who wanted to appear, other than representatives from the Victorian government. There was nobody from Sydney, other than the mayor of Bankstown.

        Senator Conroy, to pick up Senator Ray's words in a debate a little while ago, you have picked the wrong issue to have a fight on. Every opportunity was given to you; you could not agree with the Democrats on the particular position, and it was when Senator Collins came to the meeting that we were able to progress the work of the committee.

This action by the government occurred in the face of their own embarrassing backdown on the issues of cross&amp;hyphen;ownership and the airports in Sydney. They did back down, and they knew they were going to back down because the minister got rolled in cabinet. Senator Crane was doing his best to use his numbers to protect the government's position. No, in the end, we did not pursue a Melbourne hearing—that is correct—but we did not stipulate that it must happen; we simply said that we felt that Sydney and Melbourne may be areas of interest. And we were told that we could not have them and we could not go to Sydney. When Senator Crane wants to stand up and start talking about what private discussions took place he should have a good look at himself.

         The regulations contain a range of 32 fees for the classification activities of the classification board introduced by the former government. They came into effect on 1 January 1996 in conjunction with the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 which represented the Commonwealth government's contribution to the introduction of a virtually national scheme of censorship and classification.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Senate referred the regulations to the committee for inquiry and report after receiving representations from several major industry groups that some of the fees were a 100 per cent increase on the previous fee and had been imposed with only 12 days notice and
         <break page="2762" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          without prior consultation with the industry as had been foreshadowed by government representatives.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee had a public hearing in Sydney on 15 July 1996 at which government and industry representatives were able to put their respective positions on the regulations. The committee was informed that the fee increases represented the first stage of the former government's plans for the introduction of a substantial cost recovery for the classification activities of the Office of Film and Literature Classification.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In recognition that the fees had not been increased for the major classification function in relation to film and videos for some 12 years, the then government had decided that as an interim step it would increase these fees by the CPI increase. A firm of private accountants is currently conducting a study of the Office of Film and Literature Classification with a view to assessing the manner in which it carries out its classification tasks and to determine the appropriate user&amp;hyphen;pay fees.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee has found that the fees contained in the regulations are set at a realistic level for the classification services that the Office of Film and Literature Classification provides and is recommending to the Senate that the regulations not be disallowed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee took particular note that after some six months experience with the new fees, there was no evidence of adverse effects on the industry's operations. It also noted that the fees charged by comparable overseas classification bodies for equivalent services were considerably higher than those in the regulations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee did accept, however, that a number of concerns raised by the industry groups about the operations of the Office of Film and Literature Classification had some validity and it made recommendations to ensure that all elements of the industry are closely consulted in future about the process of introducing user&amp;hyphen;pay within the industry.

         —The bill was introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996 and considered by the Senate on 25 and 26 June 1996. The bill was amended by the Senate. The key amendments by the Senate were to remove provisions which would enable the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an administrator to administer ATSIC's affairs in certain circumstances, reduce the size of ATSIC's regional councils and provide for the appointment of the commission chairman by the minister. The government cannot accept these amendments. As a consequence, the government decided to introduce a new bill in the House of Representatives in identical terms to that introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives last night.

         When ATSIC came into being, a little over six years ago, it was recognised as representing a unique experiment in public administration. Nothing like it had been tried before, in Australia or overseas. A review by ATSIC of the operation of the ATSIC Act was completed in early 1993 and a number of significant recommendations for change were made as a result of that review. Amongst those recommendations were recommendations for a reduction in the number of regional councils and for the Commission Chairman to be elected by the elected zone commissioners, rather than being chosen by the Minister.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The recommendation to reduce the number of regional councils was aimed at increasing management efficiency and enabling better servicing and resourcing of regional councils.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The recommendation to provide for an elected Commission Chairman was based on the notion that this would be consistent with the principles of empowerment, self-determination and self-management which were the basis of ATSIC's establishment. Nevertheless, the commission's report containing this recommendation did acknowledge that the question of appointment of the Commission Chairman was a complex issue. The report expressed that, in many ways, the chairman is the primary link and source of day-to-day advice between the commission and the government. It went on to say that the chairman must be a person in whom the government may have total confidence, at the same time as having the confidence and trust of, and the ability to represent, all members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.

          The former government accepted both of the recommendations for amendment to the ATSIC Act at that time. Consequently, a 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act provided for a reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. The reduction in the number of regional councils took effect for the round of regional council elections conducted on 4 December 1993.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act also included amendments which provided for a fully elected board of 17 ATSIC Commissioners, with the members of that board to elect one of their number to be Commission Chairman. However, these amendments were expressed to be effective from 1 July 1996 and were therefore intended to affect arrangements for the next Board of Commissioners following the next round of regional council elections, due to be held later this year.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Following completion of the 1993 round of ATSIC regional council elections and the subsequent zone elections, an independent panel was convened under section 141 of the ATSIC Act to review ATSIC's boundaries and electoral systems. The review panel conducted consultation meetings in 20 locations throughout the country. Its report to the former minister on its review of electoral systems was completed in March 1995 and was tabled in the House of Representatives on 11 May 1995 and in the Senate on 30 May 1995. One of the recommendations of the review panel was that the size of regional councils be reduced.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Currently the number of members on a regional council is dependent on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of the region and ranges from a low of 10 for regions with an estimated population of less than 1,000 people, to a high of 20 for regions with an estimated population of 10,000 or more. The review panel proposed that the act be amended to provide for regional councils to be comprised of eight members for regions of less than 1,000 people, increasing to a maximum of 12 members for regions with a population exceeding 10,000 people.

          The initiative was seen as one which would facilitate more effective and efficient operations by regional councils. In essence, it was
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           the view of the review panel that the larger a regional council is, beyond an optimum size, the more unwieldy it is and the less effective it is in the performance of its functions. The review panel's report included advice of concerns that:

          administrative expenditure associated with the operation of regional councils (including travelling allowance and fees for members) should be kept to the minimum necessary so that the money available to address community needs can be maximised.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government accepts the recommendation of the review panel to reduce the size of regional councils and the basis for the recommendation. The proposed amendment will contribute to greater efficiency in regional council operations and reduced administrative costs associated with the operation of regional councils. It will also help to ensure that membership on regional councils is gained on the basis of a more appropriate level of community support.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Regarding selection of a Commission Chairman, the government acknowledges the importance of democratic principles in assisting the achievement of greater self-management and independent decision making. However, the government maintains that it must retain an appropriate degree of control and accountability where large amounts of government funds are being administered. This is basically because we operate in a system of Westminster government and there is nothing like ATSIC anywhere else in the Westminster system. In the end it is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who is accountable before the parliament. Selection of a Commission Chairman by government is central to the achievement of this objective.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Currently the Board of Commissioners is comprised of 17 elected commissioners and
          <break page="2765" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           2 commissioners chosen by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The minister is required to appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be Commission Chairman.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The amendment proposed in this bill would have the effect of retaining the current arrangements so that, following the next round of zone elections, the 17 elected commissioners would not elect one of their number to be Commission Chairman. Rather, a further 2 commissioners would be appointed by the minister, who would then appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be Commission Chairman.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another significant area addressed by the bill is the improvement of accountability arrangements for regional councils. In the interest of greater public accountability, the bill includes amendments to make regional council meetings open to the public and to give the public an entitlement to inspect a range of regional council documents.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Under the proposed arrangements, regional council meetings will generally be open to the public but will be able to be closed in certain circumstances, similar to those in which local government meetings can be closed. Such circumstances include where commercial-in-confidence and personal privacy issues are being discussed, and where it is necessary to deal with disruptive conduct. Additionally, the public will have an entitlement to inspect regional council codes of conduct, written procedures for meetings, management plans, written policy documents relating to the payment of expenses and provision of facilities to regional councillors, minutes of meetings (except where the meeting or the minutes are closed in relation to the exceptions I have mentioned) and other documents which would otherwise be accessible under freedom of information legislation.

         <para first-indent="16">
          This bill also allows for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an Administrator to ATSIC or to the Torres Strait Regional Authority in the event that the minister is satisfied that the administration of public money by the ATSIC Board of Commissioners or by the Torres Strait Regional Authority members involves
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           fraud or gross mismanagement. The minister would also be able to appoint an administrator should ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority breach a direction given to it by the minister.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This power will enable the government to oversee the administration of public money by ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority and to act quickly to stop any misuse of taxpayers' money. Of course, I would expect that the appointment of an administrator would be resorted to only in extreme circumstances. In fact, I hope that an administrator will never be necessary.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Once appointed the administrator would assume control of the organisation's property and affairs and perform the powers and functions normally undertaken by ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority as the case may be. The organisation would continue to operate with the administrator making decisions which would otherwise be made by the ATSIC Board of Commissioners or the Torres Strait Islander Regional Authority members. In this way the provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would proceed with minimal disruption while whatever problems identified are examined.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The administrator will be able to conduct reviews and recommend changes to the structure and operations of ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority . This would ensure that the difficulties which led to the appointment of the administrator can be remedied during the administrator's appointment and will not be repeated in the future. In this way, the elected representatives would be in the best possible position to resume control when the appointment of the administrator ends.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the end, this is necessary given as I said before that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is the person under the Westminster system who is responsible to the parliament for the expenditure of public funds even by a body such as ATSIC.

        The government's position, the previous opposition's position, on this legislation in the past was about as disgracefully opportunistic as you could have seen with respect to any kind of rational program for the operation of Australian airports, particularly the operation of Sydney airport. Honourable senators would recall that when we proposed the sale of the airports the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was concerned about the possibility of loss of support in his own seat, blocked the sale. Proposals were introduced into parliament on the pretext of being concerned about the effect of noise on the residents of Sydney, particularly the residents of his own electorate.

         We pointed out at the time, in some detail, the unblushing hypocrisy of that particular decision, considering the number of times people like me—former transport ministers with direct experience of the need to construct, at the earliest possible time, the third runway or second parallel runway at Sydney airport—had been berated by the coalition parties. To then see people who were at the vanguard of that debate protesting about noise at Sydney airport and wanting airport sales deferred until the noise problems could be sorted out we thought was a bit rich, but we did not know at that point what was going to happen with Holsworthy. If you thought that the double standard, duplicity and deceit that was involved with the general public concerned with this issue over the third runway was bad, Holsworthy was a blinder and remains a blinder.

         You would recall that the now Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, presented, as his case for not saying anything about this, the unbelievable—literally unbelievable for those of us who had been transport ministers—story that he was prevented from saying anything about the meeting he had had with the proponents of Holsworthy because it was a commercial&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;confidence arrangement. Of course, as I was well aware, the people who had been pushing this proposal for some time were not concerned in the slightest about any commercial&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;confidentiality with the fact that the proposition was actually around. They had no difficulty with it. So that was the thinnest and the most transparent of the deceits that were committed by the now government—the then opposition—on this particular issue.

         The reason I make those digressive remarks is that I have to confess to Almighty God, and to you here present, that I was not an enthusiastic supporter of the sale of the Federal Airports Corporation and I remain an unenthusiastic supporter of the sale of the FAC. As minister, I was a very enthusiastic proponent of the amalgamation and complete sale of our two airlines. For a period of something in excess of 20 years, those airlines between them had not contributed sufficient dividends to their shareholders to build a decent high school. They were always, understandably, with their hands out for more money from the budget to increase their requirements—legitimate requirements in an expanding, volatile and very difficult aviation market. You really have to like the smell of kerosene to be in the airline business. It is difficult at the best of times to make a quid out of it.

         In terms of good public policy, I was a strong supporter of that decision. It was the correct decision and I supported it. However, I was not at all happy about the situation with the FAC. Senator Tambling, who is in the chamber, would be very well aware of the domestic political reasons why I would not have been happy about the sale of the FAC; that is, the absolutely crucial role that the Federal Airports Corporation played in having the magnificent airport terminals constructed at Alice Springs and Darwin.

         Territorians such as Senator Tambling and I—long&amp;hyphen;term territorians as we both are—can now say, absolutely unblushingly, what an enormous asset both those terminals have proven to be. We knew the old facilities were bad and we protested loud and long that they were. In fact, they were so bad that they were inhibiting the growth of the tourism industry to the Northern Territory. I want to give great credit to the Federal Airports Corporation and to the then minister, then Senator Gareth Evans—and to his senior advisers, whom I got the ear of; in many ways that is far more
         <break page="2768" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The reason that I give this example and am not talking about the ones that are always in the news—Sydney and Melbourne, understandably—is that it is a classic example of the real national benefit that, in my view, the Federal Airports Corporation provided to Australia as one of the, in my view, most successful publicly owned enterprises that we had in Australia. There was, no doubt, a cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation involved in that operation—no question about it; right up front—within that network of quality terminals across the length and breadth of Australia. I felt then, and I still feel now, that there is a national benefit in real terms, particularly for overseas visitors, in having such a national network of high quality airports.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I know I would get no argument from Senator Tambling by saying that prior to the establishment of the FAC we did not have that. We had some reasonable terminals around Australia but in other parts of Australia, where international visitors are visiting in increasing numbers, we had some shocking facilities. The ones in the Northern Territory were abysmal. People used to complain about Darwin. But Darwin was nowhere near as bad as Alice Springs, which was standing room only most of the time and a very busy airport indeed. The Federal Airports Corporation constructed two world&amp;hyphen;class facilities at Darwin and Alice which absolutely transformed the face of Northern Territory tourism. It did it without any impost at all on the budget but by the cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation that goes on inside that network.

It was particularly in respect of those smaller regional airports that I think the FAC did Australia a major national service.

         I am not a person who is silly enough to believe that, by shouting `privatisation' at something, it instantly becomes a more efficient or effective operation. That is not always the case. The Federal Airports Corporation, I think—and the record is there out in public in their annual reports for anyone to see—have done a superb job in constructing a network of world class facilities that are a credit to this country. They have done it off the budget. They have done it by commercially operating within their charter. They have turned around a lot of absolute lemons. It is to their absolute credit and I feel that this should be placed on the record: they had some absolute duds on their books when they first started operations, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President.

         To the great credit and commercial acumen of the people who operate, and continue to operate, inside that organisation, I believe that a superb commercial job has been done by them in bringing in that bottom line; in staying in the black; in servicing their debts in an effective way; and in operating airport terminals around Australia with, at the same time, some of the world's lowest airport charges. And a comparison with other major airports around the world will show that.

         The amendment to the second reading that I have moved in this debate on behalf of the opposition is self-explanatory. I refer honourable senators particularly to paragraph (c) of the amendment, which specifically points out the completely inadequate draft EIS guidelines for the proposed Holsworthy site. The shadow minister for transport, Mr Tanner, has at some length gone into the debate on the stupidity and duplicity of the Holsworthy option, so I will not unnecessarily detain the Senate by going over that ground again.

         But I do want to put this on the record for a second time: I was speechless at the now minister's unbelievable explanation that the only reason he said nothing about Holsworthy—until it was too late for the electorate concerned—was because of some commercial-in-confidence obligations he had. I knew about that proposition when I was transport minister, as Laurie Brereton has said he knew about it when he was transport minister. The proponents had no difficulty in it being known that they wanted to develop that site. Forget the details of the proposal; it was a transparent piece of duplicity by the now government and the present transport minister on that issue.

         You cannot sensibly proceed with this debate until the question of Holsworthy has been absolutely determined. The EIS guidelines are utterly inadequate for Holsworthy.

         I say again in conclusion—other speakers from the opposition will speak for themselves about their own particular parts of the country—the opposition's real concern about what happens at airports around Australia other than Sydney and Melbourne remains as acute as it was when we were in government. That concern, of course, when we were in government is on the public record in terms of the

        The Democrats oppose these bills because they act against the interests of the general public, they act against the long-term benefit of the economy and they remove opportunities for accountability to the public. I am sad that the Labor Party is prepared to support these latest privatisation initiatives. It highlights how much they have been compromised by their record in government. The Labor Party has blazed a trail of privatisation in this country: a clear-felling of a forest of public assets has occurred and most of the one-off cash inflows from these fire sales have already been squandered. We find the Labor Party lining up again to support the coalition from the sidelines, as they even more enthusiastically take up the privatisation torch.

So we will support that second reading amendment because it simply underlines the position we take in opposing the bill as a whole.

        The bill itself contains principles which are meant to underlie the leasing process. These principles include: that airports must be majority owned; that the government will seek diversity of ownership to the maximum extent possible; that there is encouragement towards transparency and benchmark competition between the airports; and that they seek separate ownership of Sydney, including Sydney West, from Melbourne and Brisbane airports. There is also provision for the ownership of airports by individual airlines

        In outline, that is what the bill seeks to do. It simply reinforces the key question which the Democrats continue to ask: why is the privatisation of airports necessary? The answer, of course, is that privatisation is not necessary. Virtually all major airports overseas have been publicly owned and operated. That is a fact. Australians should be asking why we are deviating from this principle. The Democrats would argue that little, if any, micro-economic benefit will flow from the new airports regulatory regime.

        We are told that competition will force down airport usage prices. The reality, in the case of airports, is that scope for competition between Sydney and Melbourne, for example, or between Sydney and Perth airports is very remote.

        It is hard to see how anyone could seriously believe that there could be significant competition between airports in Australia. Just to state it makes obvious how ridiculous such a proposition is. Clearly, people fly to destinations because of location attractions—not just because of the airport. They are not going to fly to Melbourne in preference to Sydney because they like the airport lounge in Melbourne better. They fly to the destination because that is where they want to go. The proposition just leaves me speechless—and that is unusual for me.

         It was not surprising in the HMCA submission that it expressed concerns about the impact of full cost recovery following the leasing of the Hobart airport. A study conducted by the Federal Airports Corporation in 1993 for the Institute of Industry and Economic Research indicated that the application of full cost recovery principles for our local airport would raise landing charges by 194 per cent and cause a devastating blow to the local tourism numbers of between 11,000 and 21,000. That same report indicated that the loss of revenue to the Tasmanian economy would be in the order of $11 million to $22 million. They made the point that this would be totally unacceptable and no doubt lead to a significant increase in unemployment and the loss of many tourism operators.

         The HMCA on behalf of the southern Tasmanian council members made the point that the Hobart airport must continue to operate in the best interests of all users. I understand that there is a proposal being formulated for a joint authority of southern Tasmanian councils who will submit a proposal at some stage in the future—when the second tranche of sales comes up, I believe—to the Commonwealth requesting that they be given a lease over the Hobart airport.

         Senator Tambling indicated that the government would wish to adhere to the tendering process. In situations such as Hobart, where there is a strong community of interest in ensuring local ownership, then these criteria must be acknowledged.

         I recall comments made at the hearing by some of the government's advisers about more communication with community groups—with the likes of the HMCA—about the effect that the sale of, for instance, Hobart and Launceston airports would have. Also noted at the hearing was the apparent success of the ALOP scheme with airports such as Wynyard, Devonport—which Senator Murphy would know of—and Mackay. We were told that that scheme has worked very well, and that was noted.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I also took note of a fact that came out as a result of a question I asked about Hobart's debt. I was told, much to my pleasure, that the Hobart and Launceston airports would be sold debt free, which I think is very significant. As Senator Murphy would know, one of the major reasons Hobart in particular has been showing a trading loss is its indebtedness. If that airport is sold debt free, then its new owners will be more likely to be able to conduct the works of that airport in a profitable manner and therefore not be put in a position of having to increase landing charges and the like to the detriment of tourism and other services.

         The HMCA also raised that some essential capital works need to be carried out before a prospective buyer can be found. I guess the market will determine that further down the track.

I support our committee's wish to draw to the minister's attention the comments made by state, territory and local governments expressing concern about the selection of future airport lessees. Although it could be said that I have a vested interest in relation to Hobart and Launceston airports and their future ownership, I considered the points raised by the councils, and no doubt similar points would be raised by the Launceston Port Authority, for instance; I think they would make the same sorts of comments—that they would far prefer to see local ownership of what we would have to class as regional airports.

I am of the opinion that further discussions would be held with airports such as Hobart and Launceston before those matters are resolved. It would be totally unacceptable for private interests to control airports where it could detrimentally affect the local community.

          Just as an aside, as a former warden of the municipality which controls the Hobart airport and member of the Mayoral Aviation Council, I know that many years ago we voiced concerns about the unsatisfactory situation regarding local government's lack of control over airports around Australia.

I believe there again that they warrant some consideration by the minister. Whilst the committee has raised a number of points of concern, they are not fundamental to the general principle of these bills but perhaps better represent a finetuning which will ensure that our airports are used more effectively on behalf of our local communities.

        I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Bob Collins and particularly that aspect of the amendment which goes to the proposal for Sydney's second airport. This government, in its decision to relist Holsworthy as a potential site for Sydney's second airport, has demonstrated clearly the length it will go to to deceive the people of this country and particularly the people of Sydney. I just want to recount very briefly the sequence of events because, as has been the case for a long time, whenever the coalition has been in government it has approached the situation of dealing with Sydney's airport needs in an underhand, deceitful manner.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We must never forget that it was the coalition, along with its colleagues in the state Liberal government at the time, that so strongly pushed the development of the third runway at Sydney and then turned in the latter stages to attack the Labor government merely for base political purposes—that is, to pander to the legitimate outcry of the many residents affected by aircraft noise in Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is unfortunate that we have airports which clearly create environmental problems, particularly aircraft noise, for communities. Sydney suffers probably more than just about any other city in the world in that respect.

         But this government treats this issue as a political issue. Prior to the election the Leader of the Opposition at the time and now Prime Minister, John Howard, and other shadow spokespersons, including Senator Parer, were firmly on the record—not once, not twice, but dozens of times—as saying that they supported Badgerys Creek, Sydney West airport, as the site for Sydney's second airport. Indeed, John Howard gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, of which I was a member and which looked in detail at
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          this issue last year. He gave evidence on 25 July. I would like to quote what he said on that occasion. He said:

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        What you have to do is to look at the short&amp;hyphen; and medium&amp;hyphen;term problem, which is the unfair noise burden being carried by a limited number of people. That has to be fixed; it is the first and most important thing. Obviously there are then the alternative airport needs. As I understand it, both parties have commitments in relation to Badgerys Creek, although I know that some evidence is put from time to time that Badgerys Creek raises difficulties and that some people argue for alternatives to Badgerys Creek. Certainly I am appearing here as the member for Bennelong, although it is hard to discard other hats. Our parties have a commitment in relation to Badgerys Creek which I reiterate.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        But the short-term problem is the problem that is exercising people's minds very acutely at present, which is the noise burden problem. As far as the longer&amp;hyphen;term problem is concerned, we do need an alternative; there is no doubt about that. We do need additional airport capacity in this city. Some people have put to me that that should ultimately replace Kingsford Smith. It is not an argument that I am adopting. I want to make it clear that I am not adopting that argument. I would not adopt that argument unless I were completely satisfied that it was a realistic and practical option to put. I am not satisfied at present that that exists, so I am not adopting it.

        So the now Prime Minister was then on the record, as the Leader of the Opposition and as the member for Bennelong, as being concerned about the impact of aircraft noise on people in his electorate, as supporting Badgerys Creek and as rejecting the concept of an alternative site as a replacement airport for Kingsford Smith.

        We can recall that when this legislation put up by the then Labor government for the sale of the airports came before the parliament last year the then Leader of the Opposition and the coalition used that legislation to in effect defeat the government's attempt to implement the process of sale by linking it to the reopening of the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. They moved amendments which sought to tie the two issues together to therefore frustrate the government's processes. So it is very relevant, in considering this legislation, to be aware of that history because at the time the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, frustrated legislation similar to this legislation,
        <break page="2777" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         for his own political purposes to get the east&amp;hyphen;west runway open. He went to the election saying, `We will reopen the east&amp;hyphen;west runway, and we support Badgerys Creek'.

        There was never any mention of Holsworthy. Never once were the people of Wattle Grove, Holsworthy, Hammondville or Liverpool—all those people in those surrounding communities, the southern shire—told that what this government had in mind was putting Holsworthy back on the agenda as a site for Sydney's second airport, nor that it was put on the agenda not as simply an overflow site in the way that Badgerys Creek was to be seen as an airport complementary to Sydney, but rather for the potential establishment of Sydney's major airport.

        That was what was announced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, a couple of months ago. He announced, out of the blue, with no warning—not even a warning to the local member, a member of his own Liberal Party—that they were going to put Holsworthy back on the agenda. He announced that the EIS to be conducted into Badgerys Creek, the EIS which had been implemented by the previous Labor government, would now be expanded to include Holsworthy. Most importantly, Holsworthy was to be included on the basis that one of those two sites would have an airport.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This is one of the major problems with the EIS process that now exists with respect to Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy, as Senator Bob Collins has identified in his amendment. The draft EIS guidelines for the proposed Holsworthy site are entirely inadequate. One of the major things missing is the opportunity for consideration of other alternatives such as an airport at neither site.

        Further, when we look at the proposal put up by the Department of Transport and Regional Development with respect to the location and development of the second Sydney airport, it states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposal is to consider the construction and operation of a second major international/domestic airport for Sydney at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy on a site large enough for future expansion of the airport if required.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we have gone from a position where this government when in opposition supported Badgerys Creek, and supported the Labor government proposal that Badgerys Creek would be constructed and run complementary with KSA, to the position we are now in where we will have an EIS into the Badgerys Creek site and the Holsworthy site with the potential that one of those two sites will be a major international and domestic airport, way beyond what was ever envisaged for Sydney West airport—a potential replacement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is why the people of Holsworthy and surrounding areas are so irate. They knew that on at least two previous occasions back in the 1980s that site had been rejected as being totally unsuitable. In fact, in 1985 Holsworthy did not even make it to the short list because it was so unsuitable for various environmental and other reasons. Not only were they not told that Holsworthy was going to be put back on the agenda, but they now know that this proposal to put Holsworthy into the EIS process means that it has the potential for future expansion because, of the two sites, it is the only one that fits the bill. I am not sure, but Holsworthy is probably five to 10 times bigger than Badgerys Creek and, of those two sites, it is the only site that could cope with an expanded airport in the future. On the proposal as it stands, there is clearly an in&amp;hyphen;built bias towards the Holsworthy site. Yet what is being said constantly by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is, `We still prefer Badgerys Creek.'

        Other aspects of the EIS—and I do not wish to go into them today as I will have plenty of opportunities to do so in the future—are
        <break page="2778" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         seriously deficient. Firstly, as I have said, there is an EIS here which is structured so that a choice is made between one of two sites—but one of them has to succeed. That is the whole basis for it; there is no opportunity for both of them to be ruled out.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has been made very clear by the Environment  Protection Agency that, when you have an EIS, you start from the premise that the proposal is being supported, and you then look at its impact to see if you can find ways of ameliorating the impact. When the EIS is drafted, the consultants do not start from a totally objective position—`Well, should we or should we not have an airport on this site?' They start from a position of being told, `Here is a proposal to have an airport; you consider its impact.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Clearly, therefore, there is a bias in the process, as there is in all the EISs that have been undertaken, towards favouring the development of the proposal rather than not. I understand that the statistics are that only in about three out of 100 cases does an EIS ever come out with a recommendation which totally opposes the proposal that is being put up to be examined.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a whole range of other deficiencies. The amount of community involvement that is envisaged in this EIS process for Holsworthy—and I dare say for Badgerys Creek but particularly for Holsworthy, given that it has only recently been put onto the agenda—is nothing short of woeful. The guidelines were issued on 22 July; the people were given approximately four weeks to respond. There was a toll free number that nobody could get through on—I know that, having tried for days—because they were inundated with requests. Many people had not even seen the draft guidelines until maybe a matter of a week or two ago, yet they were due to close on 19 August. How can you possibly have community involvement in an EIS process on a matter as important and as sensitive as this and allow a lousy four weeks for people to obtain the draft guidelines, read them, understand them, dissect them, comment on them and get a submission back to the EPA?

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, what happened was that, because of the terrific organisation in the local community by community leaders, they went out and educated the people and brought to their attention the deficiencies in this proposal—because the EPA did not do it. The EPA had three meetings. I attended one of them, and it was a total disaster. I requested the EPA to hold a meeting in the Sutherland shire and they would not hold one. They said they could not find a hall big enough. If that does not show that there is a need to hold one, I do not know what does.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Last Friday, due to the efforts of the community organisations opposing this airport, some 30,000&amp;hyphen;plus submissions were lodged with the EPA—not due to any great opportunity for the community to respond but due to the massive amount of work put in by community representatives of the South&amp;hyphen;West Sydney Community Alliance.

         There are a whole range of deficiencies in the EIS guidelines. It is said by the minister that the EIS process will be run in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney, of which I was a member. It was a large report presented in this chamber last year, one of the recommendations of which was that there needs to be the most open, transparent EIS process and there needs to be every opportunity for community representatives to be involved in the process right throughout; they need to have access to the technical information that is provided to the consultants and upon which they prepare the EIS. There is none of that in the current guidelines.

         As I have just indicated to you, the people in the community have been treated with utter contempt. First of all, they were deceived. People purchased ex&amp;hyphen;army land to build their houses in places like Wattle Grove. Thousands of people have moved into this area over the past 10 years or so, in the firm belief that there would never be an airport at Holsworthy because it had been rejected. Secondly, they are not told before the election that they are going to get an airport in their backyard but they are told straight after—another broken promise. Then when the EIS

         I could go on, but the point that needs to be reiterated is that this government's policy on airports is an absolute disgrace. You have neglected the interests of the Sydney residents for years and years: you never did anything about addressing the problems of Sydney airport in all those long years when you were in government. Now that you have got back into government again you are putting thousands and thousands of people living in the south&amp;hyphen;west of Sydney—not on the North Shore, not in the Liberal held seats—into a state of utter distress and anguish because of your policy on airport development.

        Also, the only ways that concerns like the maintenance of low cost regional airports or management of social and environmental impacts can be met where the airports are not owned directly by government is through extensive regulation. That is why we have this Airports Bill; it tries to cover all the things people want to ensure happen with airports by specifying them in law as requirements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Nothing here will protect regional airports which have been cross&amp;hyphen;subsidised in the past. The virtually inevitable outcome will be higher costs for rural people—government users such as flying doctors. In fact, a fair bit of the use of regional airports may be by government agencies, and I expect that that will increase as government closes down rural offices of all sorts. Fly&amp;hyphen;in fly&amp;hyphen;out rural services will perhaps have some difficulties. So I expect that it will be government as well as rural people who will pay the cost of this policy. Then again, some airports may just shut down.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Since this is simply a recycled bill from the previous government cleansed of the coalition's own amendment requiring a solution, part solution or proportion of a solution to the airport noise problem, I expect the now opposition will support it, meaning it will pass, in spite of the fact that the Greens will again oppose it. Nevertheless, we will suggest a few amendments in the Airports Bill which I believe work to preserve the intention of the ALP when they put forward the bill last year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendments to the Airports Bill concern parts 5 and 6 which detail the requirements for the master plans, development plans and environmental strategies. I am quite certain, having received various briefings and assurances, that the Labor Party intended these requirements and the requirements for consultation to ensure that private sector managers of airports should behave responsibly and be responsive to the public.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Once the government is no longer the manager of airports, the only way of ensuring responsiveness and accountability is through some mechanism such as these plans and

        At issue is the real people who have to live around the airports, live with the sound of morning rush, evening rush, planes going overhead every few minutes for a period of hours, not being able to speak on a phone without having to stop and wait for the passing of a plane, the roar drowning out the sound of voices.

        Airports have generally had buffer areas around them—areas to keep the houses from being built too closely. Government owned and operated the airports so the buffer zones were also publicly owned and managed. These will go with the airports and present new opportunities for commercial development by the airports' managers. You can put sound&amp;hyphen;proofing over those which means you can basically get these at an ultra&amp;hyphen;bargain price, especially if you have ratted off the neighbours.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Airports will also expand to maybe include hotels and other services for travellers. Planes will get bigger and louder and air traffic heavier. There will be pressure to expand out into the buffer areas. It is important to manage these plans and ensure that the additional burden put on people nearby is acceptable—acceptable to the people affected, not just to some bureaucrat or corporate bean counter who considers a bit of sacrifice by some as essential to growth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problems that have been obvious to people are the ones where somehow or other a person in one house was considered to be affected and the person in the next house was not considered to be affected. Part of our concern that we will be putting in our amendments will deal with the level of noise that is a problem so that the remedy, whether it is by a private operator of an airport, has to be based on the noise effect and not just some

        These buffer areas are also often areas of ecological significance. Airports are usually initially sited on less desirable land, often near water or wetlands. It makes sense to put an airport near water where planes are not taking off over land, over houses. This has meant that in an odd way airports have acted to preserve remnant areas of original bush or wetlands—original landscape.

         —The matter I wish to raise this afternoon is the unfortunate assault on Monday on our nation's Parliament House by extremist elements. A number of fundamental questions and issues arise as a result of what occurred last Monday. Most important—and I trust we all cherish it—is the right to freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate. Unfortunately, the events on Monday will put pressure on the Presiding Officers and other people around this place to try to limit the demonstrations near Parliament House and the right of people to give voice to their feelings and views. It is my hope that the ugly scenes on Monday of this week do not lead to that because I think it is vitally important that the Australian people have the right and freedom to have access to this Parliament House and their representatives.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, that is the other important and fundamental point; that our Parliament House is a symbol of the Australian way of life and our democratic process. Any assault on the Australian Parliament House is, in fact, an attack on our way of life and our democratic process. It is an attack on our freedoms and, as such, I am sure everybody would wish to condemn what occurred last Monday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst we are talking of symbols, can I say it was most disturbing to see a Young Labor flag hoisted upon the coat of arms outside the
        <break page="2781" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         front of this Parliament House. It really was a besmirching of the symbols of this great nation. The fact that protesters, especially of Young Labor, sought to hoist their flag and use the coat of arms for that purpose ought to be deeply regretted by all Australians. I trust that the Australian Labor Party, through their own processes, will be able to find out who was responsible for that and deal with it appropriately.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has been somewhat interesting and at other times somewhat pitiful to observe how some are now running to dissociate themselves from the attack on Parliament House. On the other hand, some such as Bill Kelty tell us that the ACTU rally was a great success. I suppose he is right—it is just a question of definition: what is success? Do you measure it by the number of broken ribs, the number of bruises, the pints of blood that were spilt or the dollars worth of damages occasioned to the Parliament House? I suppose it really is simply a question of definition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To think that this same man, Bill Kelty, was the one who sat ex officio at Labor's cabinet table!

I would have thought that was not necessary because every single Australian who watched the TV news on Monday night saw people with white t&amp;hyphen;shirts and white windcheaters emblazoned with the red lettering of the CFMEU breaking down the doors of Parliament House. I would have thought it to be very easy for them to determine who those people are and take the appropriate action.

If the CFMEU wants to have any credibility in future industrial negotiations or with the Australian people they will need to be seen as responsible trade union citizens of this country. I urge the CFMEU, rather than trying to attack the police as they did and trying to blame the police for starting it, to take some action within their own ranks and expose those involved for the thuggery and damage occasioned on Monday.

        A number of the apologists for what occurred on Monday said, `Look, it was a good peaceful rally but things just somehow got out of hand. We are not sure how or why.' If that is the case I suppose we need to ask ourselves who addressed the rally and what type of language was employed at the rally. I remember when we were discussing the Racial Hatred Bill being lectured and hectored by those opposite in the Labor Party, talking about the need to deal with people who would seek to vilify and make people the object of hatred and who might incite violence as a result of outrageous comments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What did the Labor Party's leader say at the rally? What did he tell the assembled throng? In full view of the TV cameras, so that it was broadcast into every household of this nation, he said, `The Liberal government that hates the workers, hates students, hates Aboriginals and hates women,'—one wonders who is left in the community when one goes through all that list. They were the words of hatred, incitement and vilification that those on the opposite side tried to lecture us about when we were previously discussing legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, `You can't use language like that and then walk away from the consequences.' I think that Mr Beazley is basically a decent bloke. I think that in his heart of hearts he deeply regrets using those words last Monday. Nevertheless, he used them in public and in full view of all Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have then got to ask: if that is your public behaviour then what would you be like in private when the TV cameras are not on you? When one is asking that question of the Leader of the Opposition one should more
        <break page="2782" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         importantly ask the same question of those trade union officials who were battering down the front doors of Parliament House. If that is how they conduct themselves in full view of the TV cameras, can I ask the rhetorical question: how would they behave when negotiating with a small businessman without any other witness present? How would they deal with a worker on the factory floor behind the lockers with no other witness present if that is the sort of behaviour that they are willing to display in full view of the TV cameras of this nation?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Similar questions can unfortunately be asked—and I must say that it pains me to have to say this—of certain elements within the Aboriginal movement. There have been a number of allegations about what has been occurring within Aboriginal communities in Australia. I have heard that dissident Aboriginal groups—and they have spoken to me—do suffer substantially because they are not part of the mainstream culture of Aboriginal leadership and bureaucracy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It would appear that this sort of thuggery is part of the culture for some people within the Australian Labor Party and it would be fair to say that some have come to live with it. The honourable member for Sydney, Mr Peter Baldwin, is a living example of that sort of behaviour. He still bears the scars of physical attacks for his views he held within the Australian Labor Party and for which he has suffered greatly.

        What occurred last Monday was nothing but an horrendous assault on the institutions of our democracy and an horrendous assault on our freedoms.

        The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Liberal government have been in power for not even six months and they are trying to turn on a turn like this. Basically, the Australian people will be repulsed by what occurred. The trade union leadership did itself and its cause a great disservice. For pure political purposes and as a supporter of the government's industrial relations thrust, I suppose I can say that it was pleasing to see that it was so counterproductive.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        More important than the short&amp;hyphen;term political gain that somebody sought to achieve from that demonstration is the potential damage that was done to the very institutions of this nation—and, in particular, I talk about the symbol of our parliamentary democracy, the symbol of freedom, which is this Parliament House—and the denigration and besmirching of our coat of arms for very cheap political purposes by some extreme elements within the young Labor movement.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Having seen some of the people who were affected by Monday's events and having seen the damage in the Parliament House gift shop and elsewhere, I felt moved to put on record my views and my feelings and to urge all Australians and all CFMEU and ACTU members to write to their trade union organisations and say, `Sure demonstrate, sure engage in freedom of speech, but when you organise rallies and things of this nature make sure that you run them in an appropriate way so that people do not come along with the sorts of things they came along with to this rally which would clearly indicate that some of the activities that were undertaken were in fact premeditated.' Just because the mood changes it does not mean that crowbars, battering rams or paint all of sudden materialise out of thin air. Those things do not just appear. They were there at the very beginning.

          About one year ago, we saw the largest mobilisation of Australians against nuclear weapons and their testing that we have really seen in a decade. Australians of all political persuasions marched together to send a message to the French and the Chinese governments that nuclear testing was not on as far as Australians are concerned and that, as peace loving people who care for our planet, we would not tolerate the threat that nuclear testing posed to nuclear non&amp;hyphen;proliferation agreements, nor the threat it posed to the people and the environment where tests took place.

         Thousands of nuclear weapons remain in the stockpiles around the world. These weapons are not just gathering dust, they remain on alert. They are ready to fire at any time. Each of these weapons has many times the destructive capabilities of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki half a century ago. These weapons do not act as a deterrent; they endanger life on this planet. Nuclear weapons are too dangerous and too destructive to use in conventional warfare.

        The report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons sets out a number of clear steps which can be taken immediately—today—to begin the process of elimination of nuclear weapons. The first step, of course, is an unequivocal commitment from the nuclear weapons states to the goal of a nuclear weapons free world and a commitment to start work immediately on the steps necessary to achieve that goal. These immediate steps include: taking nuclear forces off alert; removing warheads from delivery vehicles; ending deployment of non&amp;hyphen;strategic nuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; initiating negotiations to further reduce United States and Russian nuclear arsenals; and getting agreement among the nuclear weapon states of reciprocal `no first use' undertakings and of a `non&amp;hyphen;use' undertaking by them in relation to non&amp;hyphen;nuclear weapon states.

        The end of the bipolar confrontation has not removed the danger of nuclear catastrophe. In some respects the risk of use by accident or miscalculation has increased. Political upheaval or the weakening of state authority in a nuclear weapon state could cripple existing systems for ensuring the safe handling and control of nuclear weapons and weapons material, increasing the odds of a calamity. The same fate could befall other states or sub-state groups with a less developed nuclear weapon capability or those that seek to develop such a capability in the future.

        Nuclear weapons have long been understood to be too destructive and non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory to secure discrete objectives on the battlefield. The destructiveness of nuclear weapons is so great that they have no military utility against a comparably equipped opponent, other than the belief that they deter that opponent from using nuclear weapons. Possession of nuclear weapons has not prevented wars, in various regions, which directly or indirectly involve the major powers. They were deemed unsuitable for use even when those powers suffered humiliating military setbacks.

        No nuclear weapon state has been or is prepared to declare as a matter of national policy that it would respond to the use of chemical or biological weapons with nuclear weapons.

The response to any violation should be a multilateral one.

        The first requirement is for the five nuclear weapon states to commit themselves unequivocally to the elimination of nuclear weapons and agree to start work immediately on the practical steps and negotiations required for its achievement.

This commitment would change instantly the tenor of debate, the thrust of war planning, and the timing or indeed the necessity for modernisation programs. It would transform the nuclear weapons paradigm from the indefinite management of a world fraught with the twin risks of the use of nuclear weapons and further proliferation, to one of nuclear weapons elimination.

        The problem of nuclear proliferation is inextricably linked to the continued possession of nuclear weapons by a handful of states. A world environment where proliferation is under control will facilitate the disarmament process and movement toward final elimination, and vice versa. The emergence of any new nuclear weapon state during the elimination process would seriously jeopardise the process of eliminating nuclear weapons. Action is needed to ensure effective non-proliferation controls on civil and military nuclear activities, and to press for universal acceptance of non-proliferation obligations.

        Effective verification is critical to the achievement and maintenance of a nuclear weapon free world. Before states agree to eliminate nuclear weapons they will require a high level of confidence that verification arrangements would detect promptly any attempt to cheat the disarmament process whether through retention or acquisition of clandestine weapons, weapons components, means of weapons production or undeclared stocks of fissile material. Formal legal undertakings should be accompanied by corresponding legal arrangements for verification. To maintain security in a post-nuclear weapon world the verification system must provide a high level of assurance as to the continued peaceful, non-explosive use of a state's nuclear activity. A political judgement will be needed on whether the levels of assurance possible from the verification regime are sufficient. All existing arms control and disarmament agreements have required political judgements of this nature because no verification system provides absolute certainty.

        A key element of non-proliferation arrangements for a nuclear weapon free world will be a highly developed capacity to detect undeclared nuclear activity at both declared and undeclared sites.

        The Commission considered carefully the merits of setting out a precise timeframe for the elimination of nuclear weapons, but elected not to do so. However, this does not imply that it accepts the extended timelines imposed by such current constraints as limited warhead dismantlement facilities. Those constraints could be relieved by political decisions and the allocation of resources required to advance dismantlement. In addition, another limiting factor may prove to be establishing the necessary confidence in the verification regime which would be required to take the final step to complete elimination. In this context, the Canberra Commission remains convinced of the basic importance of agreed targets and guidelines which would drive the process inexorably toward the ultimate objective of final elimination, at the earliest possible time.

         —I conclude by saying that the report of the Canberra Commission is a cause for great optimism. The 17 members of the Commission are distinguished in their fields. They represent a number of different disciplines—they have scientific, military, diplomatic or political backgrounds. At least four of them were involved with the development of nuclear weapons or were responsible for a decision to use them—they literally had their fingers on the button. These leaders from around the world, brought together by an initiative of the Labor government, have said, `Yes it is possible, we can have a world free of the threat of nuclear holocaust.' Maj Britt Theorin told the Evatt Foundation meeting that, `It will happen during my grandchildren's lifetime, during my children's lifetime or even during my lifetime. It is absolutely possible to get rid of all nuclear weapons in my lifetime.'

         —I acknowledge, Senator Schacht, that sleep was at a premium if you followed it properly, although most of the events were between eight and 12 in the morning. I found the ABC radio coverage of this quite faultless. It was always up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date, it covered a wide range of sports, it featured in&amp;hyphen;depth analysis and, whilst it catered to a degree for chauvinism that the Australian audience would expect, it also gave full acknowledgment to the sporting efforts by athletes around the world. Whether they came, as a 5,000&amp;hyphen;metre runner did, from Burundi or whether it was Hong Kong winning its first gold medal at sailing, it was all covered on the ABC.

        I want to pay tribute to a few of the individuals involved in the coverage. Tracey Holmes was the anchor person and did a splendid job. Most of us who are familiar with her performance on
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sports Grandstand
        </emphasis>
        on Saturdays and Sundays have come to expect high standards from her because she has helped turn that program into an absolute must, especially in summer. Her interviews are always in&amp;hyphen;depth, she is articulate and a reasonable degree of humour is always injected into any of her interviews. She did very well. She was able to do well not because she is a person with or without natural ability but because she knows her sport—all sorts of sport—and she knows it back to front. She
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         was able to bring that experience to her anchoring of the ABC coverage of the Olympics and make it a really meaningful thing.

        I also thought Gerry Collins and Norman May did well in the swimming coverage. I know at times Norman May has attracted criticism. But now he has become a specialist commentator. He knew all the swimming form from around the world and was able to bring it to us and give us an excellent assessment of people's prospects in each race. Tim Lane did an excellent job at the athletics, covering a wide range of events. Of course, Tim Lane is also a versatile all&amp;hyphen;rounder—an excellent football commentator, a very good cricket commentator; in fact, he can turn his hand to almost any sport. We also had Neville Oliver at the rowing—one of his specialities. Again, I found his descriptions—sometimes I listened to the radio while watching the event on television—enormously insightful and enormously accurate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also have to mention a Western Australian, George Grljusich, who covered the equestrian events. It should be noted that, in 1992, George Grljusich brought live to Australian audiences coverage of two gold medals that television missed. At the equestrian in 1992, George Grljusich not only described Matt Ryan winning an individual gold medal, but also described the Australian three&amp;hyphen;day team winning the team medal at the same time. It is interesting that, even on the television broadcast an hour and a half later in 1992, the commentators had not really realised that Australia had won the team gold medal. But George Grljusich had calculated the odds and I will never forget his description—every time the leading New Zealander hit a rail, George was able to calculate how many more rails he had to hit to put Australia in a gold medal winning position.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He starred again at Atlanta. On the second day, the day of the endurance event, the computers went down but George Grljusich was able to tell us over radio exactly where we stood in the teams event and how many penalties the three continuing riders had attracted. Gillian Rolton had fallen, although she still was willing to continue if necessary. George had calculated to two decimal points
        <break page="2789" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the penalties the three leading Australian riders had attracted and where they stood on the table, when everyone else seemed to have no idea at all. So George Grljusich at two Olympic Games has proved his depth on equestrian matters and has given an excellent coverage to Australia.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I suppose we should also acknowledge that George Grljusich, with Benny Pike, attracted quite a cult following at the boxing. I cannot recall their actually ever describing a fight, but nevertheless they provided entertainment in abundance. In particular I can remember Benny Pike remonstrating with someone behind who had a ghetto&amp;hyphen;blaster on. I have never heard anyone turn loud music off so quickly as when Benny had a word to him off microphone.

        I have to make a political point here, though. The reason the ABC has been able to give such a great coverage is that it has had the funds to do it and it has the widespread experience of describing sporting events. If the ABC funding is cut by $210 million over the next four years, and if the Mansfield inquiry recommends, as it is expected to, that the ABC cuts back on its radio sports coverage, Australia will never ever again be able to mount the sort of coverage that we saw at the Atlanta Olympics. And for the host nation, I think that would be a major tragedy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It does not matter if in four years time the government throws $10 million, $15 million or 20 million dollars to the ABC and asks it to do the Olympics on radio. If you have lost all that expertise from your sporting departments around the country you will not be able to provide the necessary commentators to be able to make the sorts of accurate and considered descriptions of events that we have so far been so lucky to have. This point should be made in respect of maintaining funding to the ABC sports departments.

        It is terribly fashionable to profess concern about symphony orchestras, and I am concerned about those, or to profess concern about the rotten current affairs programs the ABC often runs—
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Four Corners
        </emphasis>
        last Monday night was a classic example of a distorted program. I have been a critic of the ABC over the years. But the fact is that no commercial
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         radio network or station could get near the standards and integrity of ABC sporting broadcast. We do not want to be elitist and just be concerned about the top end of the market. These are the bread&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;butter programs of the ABC that a majority of Australians like. It is not to say, in pushing that line, that we should ignore the minority groups who have other tastes in Australia, which the ABC also adequately caters for. But make no mistake, if the funding cuts go ahead, sport and sports broadcasting will be the first victim and, as such, its value will be greatly diminished.

        While I am on my feet, I might make some comments on the Channel 7 coverage of the Atlantic Olympics. I found their performance at Atlanta a vast improvement on that at Barcelona. Some of the lessons learnt at Barcelona were applied very well in Channel 7's coverage. Everyone complained about Channel 7's coverage because they ran commercials. Frankly, that just goes with the territory. If you have to spend multiple tens of millions of dollars to win the rights to Olympics, you must expect that there will be adverts coming on and off during the time. But they were able, on this occasion, to get a lot more events live to air and had a lot more flexibility switching between venues than they showed at Barcelona.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was also a greater acknowledgment by Channel 7—not complete; they were not perfect—that some events were off tape and not live to air. But I think they actually carried every Australian gold medal winning performance live to air. They carried every Olympic swimming final. They also carried a majority of the athletics finals, apart from maybe on the last day when the Australian basketball match was being played contemporaneously with those athletics events. They also managed to give an excellent coverage to the men's marathon and, I have to say, in terms of critique, an inadequate coverage of the women's marathon event. But on the whole, I think Channel 7 showed that they were an improving broadcaster of the Olympics. Let me pay tribute to some of those who covered it.

       <break page="2790" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         Bruce McAvaney's coverage of the athletics was absolutely superb. There have been many accolades delivered to Bruce McAvaney over the years. He does know his athletics probably better than any other commentator in the world. He knows where all the key individuals come from. He has that nice blend of Australian patriotism and an acknowledgment of superior efforts by athletes from around the globe. He brought much to that commentary.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was interesting also that Channel 7 was able to get interviews with the key athletes within three or four minutes of the events concluding—the Michael Johnsons and all the rest of them. A lot of it, I think, was due to Bruce McAvaney's reputation. Bruce McAvaney has been probably the best sports broadcaster in Australia in the last couple of decades, and certainly the best athletics broadcaster. The only tragedy was that these responsibilities probably deprived him of anchoring a lot of the sports coverage that we all would have benefited from.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must also pay tribute to Denis Commeti for his very accurate calling of events in the swimming pool. He also had a realistic blend of analysis as to Australia's prospects and was assisted ably by Neil Brooks. Peter Landy, who is not necessarily my favourite broadcaster for football reasons, brought great credit to himself in respect of one area in which he has expertise, and that is his description of rowing events. He knows it back to front. He was very good at picking where the Australians were in the field, their chances of improvement or whether they would drop off the place. Peter Landy did an excellent job.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I also commend Sandy Roberts for his efforts. He was thrown in at the deep end in several sports, and again showed the sort of experience that enabled him to cover them competently. Pat Welch did very well on the track.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I must say that one of the things that bind these sporting broadcasts together is the anchor person. Most of these did very well. If I have one criticism of the Channel 7 performance, it was the anchor person between midnight and 2 a.m., although I must concede that counting up the mistakes she made did keep me awake. You usually got to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          15, 20, 25 bloopers, inanities or misread cue cards in that two hours. Whilst I am not a great fan of David Fordham, wasn't I relieved every night when he came on at 2 a.m.! The classic point here is that there is no use putting a newsreader who can just read cue cards into a position where you are switching from venue to venue.

         I do not know if you, Madam Acting Deputy President, know that she got totally wrong the names of the two great female rowers who won on the first night. She acknowledged that two different rowers had won the gold medal! Channel 7 needs to make sure that commentators with sports backgrounds anchor these events. This will relieve the sorts of absolutely elementary blunders that we saw in that particular coverage.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On the whole, I think Channel 7 has improved its coverage of the Olympics. The ratings show that they got outstanding ratings right throughout the Olympic Games, and I hope that when they go on to cover Sydney they will improve yet again. They face challenges in Sydney where we will have teams in every team event, which we normally do not do. They are going to have to give a lot of consideration—I know my colleague Senator Schacht has been thinking about this too—to how they will be able to get enough events live to air. It may well be that some arrangement will have to be made to try to maximise that. Sports such as women's soccer and men's volleyball deserve some airplay during the Sydney Olympics. But quite clearly they are going to have to prioritise and give concentration to the athletics track, the swimming pool and the velodrome, where the majority of peak audiences will be. But that challenge is in front of them. If Channel 7 continue to improve at the rate they have since Barcelona through to Atlanta, we are in for a real treat.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to conclude my comments by reiterating how good the ABC radio coverage of the Olympics was and the fact that that has now been put in jeopardy by the funding arrangements that this government has put in place. It will be an easy mark for those highbrow people who tend to run the ABC
         <break page="2791" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         I can tell you now that there will be a rebellion all round Australia, not only in cities, but in regional areas that rely on the ABC for such a component of the broadcasting service. When you think of the ABC you cannot but think of their test cricket coverage, their Sheffield Shield coverage, their range of coverage from women's netball right through to all the sports that deserve at least some mention and coverage. I hope that when Mr Mansfield does his review of the ABC charter, he does not take the weak road and simply recommend that most of these sporting programs be butchered.

        But as I raise the matter of Western Australia and Mr George Grljusich, I want to bring the Senate back to my home state of Western Australia and, in fact, to my home city of Wanneroo. Many people around Australia will have heard about Wanneroo, particularly in recent years, because of the corruption that has been to the forefront, unfortunately, among some councillors within the City of Wanneroo.

        There is now currently a royal commission of inquiry into the city of Wanneroo, and I want to address the manner in which the Western Australian government has handled the allegations of corruption in the Wanneroo council. It is causing deep concern about the administration of justice in my home state.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Former Wanneroo councillor David King was convicted and gaoled in 1994 for taking bribes. Following his trial, he tried to blow the whistle on the widespread corruption that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         had existed for years within the council. Since that time, what have we seen? Have we seen a government dealing with these serious allegations? Have we seen them being dealt with in a manner which shows that the government is committed to eliminating corruption? Unfortunately not. We have seen an attempt at whitewash and cover&amp;hyphen;up. The Western Australian government had to be dragged by public pressure into re&amp;hyphen;establishing the former government's Cahill inquiry into the Wanneroo City Council. Then it had to be further dragged kicking and screaming into setting up the royal commission which is currently on.

        But what then? The honest people back in Perth and in Western Australia would have hoped that the rottenness that is there amongst some people within Wanneroo would have been finally opened up and, therefore, eradicated. But this has not happened. Why not? Because the corruption that is endemic there among the leading individuals in Wanneroo goes right to the heart of the Liberal Party. King detailed all this in the statement he made to the justice ministry and to the Director of Public Prosecutions in late 1994. The statement was forwarded to the Western Australian police force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Should King have been listened to? Indeed, he was listened to, at least by the courts. He had convinced the jury that the former Wanneroo mayor, Wayne Bradshaw, was corrupt. Bradshaw is now in prison. King's statement had convinced the magistrate that another local developer, Ted Hodgkinson, has a case to answer on bribery charges. Hodgkinson is currently awaiting trial. So what has happened with all these allegations? We really do not know because the police department in Western Australia has wound up the investigations with 17 lines of inquiry apparently still left open. Why did it do that?

        The honest people of Western Australia would hope that the current royal commission would answer some of these questions. Has that happened? Indeed, it has not. What has happened instead is that King and the other whistleblowers, such as the former Director&amp;hyphen;General of the Ministry of Justice, David Grant, and his officers, have been viciously attacked by the royal commission for involving themselves in this. This has been done using some of the very police officers, including Deputy Police Commissioner Les Ayton—who retires later this week—and his internal affairs unit which are the subject of disciplinary action. The Ministry of Justice officers are also facing charges laid by Grant.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Counsel Assisting the Royal Commission, Ms Narelle Johnson, has been strongly critical of the role of the justice ministry's intelligence unit even being involved at all in gathering this information from King, who was then being held in prison by the ministry, and passing it on to the Director&amp;hyphen;General and then to the Director of Public Prosecutions. She described that as information gathering `at large' and dangerous. Her attack has serious implications for the fight against crime and corruption not only in Western Australia but generally throughout Australia, because all law enforcement agencies, at both federal and state levels, depend upon this type of information flow.

        King in particular was subjected to what a Queen's Counsel has described as forensic axe&amp;hyphen;work. The result is not only that doubts have been thrown over King's broad allegations but that the mates of the Liberal Party, Bradshaw and Hodgkinson included, who are waiting for their appeal and trial, suddenly find that the main witness against their particular matters has been discredited. In the Queen's Counsel's opinion the royal commission was in contempt of court in doing this and the royal commissioner, who intentionally allowed this to happen, should immediately

        And what has the royal commission done about the police investigations into Wanneroo which have been prematurely wound up? Nothing. It has conveniently decided that looking at the police investigations into Wanneroo is outside its terms of reference. Kyle predicted this when Roger Davis replaced him as chairman of the inquiry. The result was that Police Commissioner Falconer was not even asked when giving evidence why the investigation was wound up.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The royal commissioner made one exception in his ruling about police investigations. He allowed the examination in detail of the investigation of former police officer Wayde Smith. The not so surprising result was that counsel assisting says that Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and current Minister for Family and Children's Services, has been greatly maligned by the suggestions that she had been heard on tape discussing a bribe. And how did she come to that conclusion? Because the police officer in charge of the investigation, Detective McLeod, said so.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This is the head of the internal affairs unit recently criticised by the Chairman of the Western Australian Legislative Council Committee into the Police Force as being a failure in fighting corruption and more interested in concealing corruption than exposing it. It is the officers from this unit, along with the Deputy Police Commissioner, who are being disciplined over Argyle Diamonds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is the same officer who admitted in evidence that he had actively campaigned for Mrs Edwardes before the previous election. He also admitted that he had erased all the tapes and all the transcripts of the tapes, even though the Kyle inquiry had been re&amp;hyphen;established. Even the counsel assisting, who had carried out the attack on King, was forced to concede that that had been both `odd' and `unwise', but she said that she did not want to read anything into it more than that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        But there is more that is of concern in the police approach to Wanneroo. McLeod told the commission that he had been informed by
        <break page="2793" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         former Wanneroo Councillor Sybil Roberts that she had been visited by uniformed police warning her to stop giving Bradshaw trouble. By his own admission, McLeod made no efforts of his own to follow this up, even though it was the exact role of his unit.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He also told the commission that the Police Bureau of Criminal Intelligence had been informed of an association between Bradshaw and convicted drug runner Allan Harriman. What had been done about this, or about contacts between Bradshaw and well&amp;hyphen;known criminal identity John Kizon? The royal commission has decided not to require Harriman to give evidence because his information is outside the terms of reference. Sounds familiar?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But there are other serious concerns being raised about the process of the royal commission. The Queen's Counsel's opinion has claimed that the commission is operating in an apparently biased way, saying that a reasonable member of the public could think it is being conducted as a `whitewash'. It is doing this by its aggressive discrediting of whistleblower David King. It is doing this by characterising the Ministry of Justice criminal intelligence gathering role in a way which will prevent the pursuit of corruption. It is doing this by the acceptance of the evidence of politically aligned and disciplined police officers like Ayton and McLeod and by accepting the evidence of those in the ministry whose mates have been charged with criminal offences or who are facing disciplinary offences themselves, against the whistleblowers who laid the charges. It has been done by `artificial' and `unreal' interpretation of the evidence presented, in the opinion of the Queen's Counsel.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The honest and fair people of Western Australia must be concerned—and, indeed, are very concerned—about this. We have a state government which has resisted investigating Wanneroo council as long as it could, because it knew that not only its mates but also its politicians were involved. We have senior police officers, some of whom are being disciplined themselves, who are politically connected to the government and who are carrying out the first stage of investigations
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and then destroying the evidence after another inquiry has been set up, which then winds up the second stage when investigating officers still have 17 lines of inquiry remaining open.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Then we have an apparently biased royal commission which is shooting the whistleblowers, and in a way that helps the government's mates in their upcoming court cases. In doing this it is in contempt of court, but nothing is done about it. It is a whitewash, pure and simple, and the whistleblowers are being shot to achieve it.

        In June of this year, the former Director&amp;hyphen;General of the Ministry of Justice, David Grant, approached the federal Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department with his concerns about the lack of action by the Western Australian authorities regarding Wanneroo. He was told that these were not federal issues, except for one matter. This was raised with Attorney&amp;hyphen;General Williams who referred it to the Australian Securities Commission.

        Where does this government stand on corruption? Is it going to do something about it or will it just protect its mates in the west? Whichever way you look at this entire Wanneroo saga, it is clear that there has been massive corruption and that corruption is being covered up to protect the interests of Richard Court and his government as it comes up to an election early next year. Now it seems the Howard government may be playing a role in this, and it is the whistleblowers and the honest people of Western Australia who want a decent system of justice who are suffering.

         —I just want to say a few words following on from the remarks made by my colleague Senator Ray about the media coverage of the recent Olympic Games. I do
         <break page="2794" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          so as shadow minister for communication. First of all I want to endorse the very measured remarks that Senator Ray made about the quality of the coverage, both by ABC radio and by Channel 7. I, like Senator Ray and a lot of Australians, spent far too many hours—into the early hours, and even the late morning hours—sitting in front of a television set watching the Olympic Games.

        Some people might say that this really is going over the top a bit. But when the rest of the world is willing to compete with each other on the sporting field, and get the joy, the success and the pride in their own country's performance that come from it, one can say, `It is much better for people to compete on the sporting field than as in past centuries when often they would be competing on the battlefield for national glory.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I noticed, a week or so after the Olympic Games had concluded, the SBS, on a Sunday morning, ran programs from Poland, Italy and Greece. Each of those programs did a summary of the achievements of their own sports people and what they had achieved at the Olympic Games. It was covered with exactly the same level of pride as that of Australians who watched and heard our athletes perform. Once again, it shows the enormous positive power the Olympics has as a pre&amp;hyphen;eminent international event.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Like Senator Ray, I believe there will be a threat to the ABC's future as a broad based national broadcaster if the government goes through with these dreadful funding cuts, which will be $210 million over the next four years. If it is true that a thousand people will be retrenched from the ABC, I understand that the ABC will have to borrow the redundancy money from the Department of Finance and then repay it over the next couple of years. I am told that those thousand redundancy packages could approach $50 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That would have to go on top of the $210 million to be cut so we might be looking at a $250 million cut to the ABC's funding over the next four years. There is no doubt that that would wreck the structure of the ABC. It would mean that the institutional experience and skill of all of those people who were mentioned by Senator Ray in being able to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         give such an excellent coverage would, in large measure, disappear. That is one reason why I call on all Australians, no matter where they live, no matter which party they support or belong to, to put a submission to the Mansfield inquiry—people have until the end of this month to put in a submission—demanding that the broad charter of the ABC be left untouched so that the excellent coverage that was achieved in Atlanta by ABC radio staff can be available in an even bigger and better way for Australia's great moment when we have the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, I endorse the remarks made by Senator Ray that Channel 7's coverage was a considerable improvement on Barcelona. Senator Ray touched on the issue that, because of the scope of the Olympic Games and the large number of individual sports, it is almost impossible for one channel to provide live coverage of every event. Events are held each day, many of them simultaneously at different venues around the Olympic site. But, nevertheless, there was an improvement by Channel 7 and we got better coverage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think in the case of some of their commentators—some of whom were selected because of their reputation in the media generally, but not in sports—they stumbled a bit trying to explain the technicalities of some of the sports that they were covering. I think Channel 7 has to have a further look at making sure that the person commentating, even on delayed broadcast, knows the rules of the sport being covered, knows the intricacies of it and the background to it. With some of the team sports that are now being covered, the rules are quite technical. Because the sport may not be well known in Australia, we need a specialist who understands it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The major issue I wish to raise for Channel 7 for its coverage of the Sydney Olympics is that of team sports. As Senator Ray said, because we are the host country, we have automatic entry to every team sport in the Olympic games, even team sports such as handball, which got very little coverage because there is very little interest or participation in it in Australia. We can also enter men's and women's soccer, men's and
        <break page="2795" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         women's volleyball, men's and women's beach volleyball, women's softball, men's and women's hockey. There are also, of course, men's and women's tennis. Australia will automatically enter all of those sports without having to go through qualification. No matter how Channel 7 tries to juggle it, I suspect it will find it very difficult to give coverage to all of those sports, even when we are playing for a gold medal or a medal of some sort, let alone all those we participate in.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think Channel 7 is going to have to look at negotiating appropriately and it should make arrangements for some of these team sports to be covered by another station. For example, I am sure it could reach an agreement that men's and women's soccer could be covered by SBS.

All I can say, Senator, is that there will always be someone missing out if you only have one station, and maybe there is a chance that Channel 7 ought to have a look at making some of those arrangements. For example, I would draw your attention, Senator Wood, to the fact that in the men's soccer tournament, Nigeria beat Brazil in an absolutely pulsating, exciting match that was world class.

          say, `We have an interest in synchronised swimming. We want to watch it.' You may not have that taste. I may not have that taste. But that is the problem. So I think that is an area where there are some issues that Channel 7, as the host broadcaster for the Olympic Games, which is covering it for all Australians because of the extreme interest, is obviously going to have to discuss with the Olympic Committee. I hope it can do that sensibly.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have to say that I hope we do not have a repeat of the arguments about other television stations getting news coverage and being able to interview athletes. Without apportioning blame on this, I really think the arguments between networks over whether people should be able to be interviewed on other networks, and so on, ought to be able to be resolved amicably between all networks, particularly for the Sydney Olympic Games.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Others have made the point, and I make it too, that the Australian athletes at the Sydney Olympics will be funded overwhelmingly through programs supported by Australian taxpayers. There is a community interest there for news services, and so on, that ought to be looked at, and that issue has to be amicably settled.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Overall, I think Channel 7 has an enormous task ahead of it. I am sure they will be able to meet that challenge. But I think they could look at a couple of these ideas that I and Senator Ray have raised about further improvement, particularly how to cover all the team sports at the same time, which I think will be very difficult. They should also look at how to cover those major team sports even when Australia is not participating as there will be people wanting to see adequate coverage of that top quality sport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will also say in conclusion that the real issue here is that we have this threat to the future structure of the ABC—the cuts to the ABC—which could really affect the radio broadcast it will give of the Sydney Olympics. That is why the Labor Party in opposition will strongly oppose the cuts to the ABC that the government has outlined in the last few weeks.

        Australian families were worse off under Labor. That was the point. They suffered from the consequences of the recession that we did not have to have, the Labor Party induced recession. But they suffered beyond the recession as well. It is for that reason that we said before the last election that we would deliver benefits to Australian families, particularly to lower to middle level Australian families. I am pleased that we have been able to deliver that promise in full, notwithstanding the fact that we also have had to face up to a deficit of somewhere between $8,000 million and $10,000 million, which we had been assured by Labor—this Labor Party that claims to tell the truth—did not exist.

        We announced last night, in contrast to Labor's failure, our family tax initiative which will direct an additional $1 billion a year to almost two million Australian families with children. These initiatives will provide families with a greater array of choices and genuine opportunities. They recognise the contribution of families as integral to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society—something that the Labor Party would not understand.

        The majority of Australian families with dependent children will benefit. They will receive a $1,000 increase in their tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold for each dependent child. One&amp;hyphen;income families will receive a further $2,500 increase in their tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold if they have a child under five. This is an excellent initiative that this new Howard government has been able to deliver, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances that we have inherited. It is not surprising that it is already being applauded by Australian families who finally have a government that understands their needs and is prepared to deliver the benefits to which they are entitled.

There is already substantial public benefit, and there is a private benefit at the same time. Labor recognised that when it introduced the HECS system.

        To maintain equity, however, students do not need to pay any money back at all until they start earning an income. So the payment back comes when you start getting the benefit of the higher education that you have received. That is a very important equity and access point of the HECS system which we are retaining. We think Labor did the right thing when it introduced HECS. It acknowledged the private benefit that students get, asked them to make a contribution on that basis and did not ask them to pay it back until they started earning an income.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to recognise that Labor's actual record on equity and access in higher education is not really that good. The expansion in participation in higher education since 1989 is not in itself proof of increased equity. It might be a larger system, but it is not necessarily a more equitable one. It is very important to understand that survey data tells us that households with the top 20 per cent of incomes enjoy 38 per cent of the benefits of higher education. So the top 20 per cent get 38 per cent of higher education. These households have an average income of $84,000. They get the big slice of the cake.

         By contrast, the bottom 20 per cent of households, with an average income of $7,800 a year, enjoy only seven per cent of the benefit of higher education. In other words, higher education remains largely a middle&amp;hyphen;class preserve. The very real key to improved access for lower economic backgrounds comes from increasing opportunities in pri mary and secondary schools and getting those students more prepared for higher education.

        So doctors and lawyers and people who are in the box seat for the rest of their lives will be asked to pay more. Teachers and nurses, who do not get the same benefits, will be kept on the lowest level. In the same way that the Wran committee recommended that engineering and science students be paid on a middle level, we will be doing this as well. It is not equitable to ask the same of a teacher, who has a low cost course and a lower income, as you ask of a doctor, who has a high cost course and a high income. That inequity was recognised by Neville Wran and we will remove it.

Under the new independent Austudy arrangements, students now will be deemed to be dependent on their parents until they are 25. That means a substantial loss of benefits in a number of cases. But when it comes to the provision of benefits under the new family tax initiative, students will be deemed to be dependent on their parents only to the age of 18.

Austudy is both an income supplement and an educational incentive. It is quite unique in that respect. It is a combination of those things. Similarly, you would expect there to be differences between Austudy, perhaps, and unemployment rates. So I think, with respect, you are comparing not oranges and lemons but oranges and pears in that respect.

        We have had no explanation in question time today from any minister in this government who could explain the nature of the betrayal, who could explain what constitutes the difference between a core promise and a non&amp;hyphen;core promise. But Australians know what it is: a non&amp;hyphen;core promise is a commitment given by Mr Howard bare&amp;hyphen;facedly before the election that he has absolutely no intention ever of keeping. That is what a non&amp;hyphen;core promise is: a promise that is rotten to the core. Mr Howard has been exposed for deceiving, betraying and lying to the Australian people in the election campaign. I believe that all Australians were deceived by Mr Howard, and Mr Howard and his government stand condemned for the budget delivered here yesterday.

        This, Mr Deputy President, was the basis on which we did our figures. Were we entitled to rely on what the Labor finance minister of this country assured us? I would have thought we were, reinforced by ministers in the Senate, particularly, I recall, Senator Cook—`The budget will be in surplus.' So the figures were done on that basis.

        Despite having to face up to that unexpected $8,000 million deficit and largely remedy it in the course of the next couple of budgets, we will get to surplus during the course of this parliament—an historic achievement.

It has given tax cuts of $200 a child for middle income earners, tax incentives to encourage private health insurance, a 15 per cent surcharge on superannuation contributions for high income earners—

        That is a Labor government in which most of those opposite participated, mostly during the Prime Minister Keating years. For the first time—let me emphasise that—the budget papers provide an historical run of deficit figures, adjusted for the fiddles. The story they tell us is of 20 years of poor budgets, but none to match the Keating years. You talk about responsibility yet your frontbench hasn't got a clue. We have a shadow minister for health who doesn't even know how to spell the word. We have shadow ministers who cannot even understand the difference between taxes and other measures.

The only reason those aspirations could not be fulfilled was that those opposite misled the Australian people. Their leader said to the Australian people that there was an underlying surplus in the budget. There was something `lying' about the budget, and that was the Minister for Finance, because we all know that we had to make up a $10 billion shortfall.

I indicated in the Senate on 27 June that the government would cooperate to the maximum extent possible with this order, consistent with our executive obligations. Such an approach is consistent with the government's strong commitment to open and accountable government. It is in this spirit that I table a large number of documents today. The Department of Finance has identified these documents as being all those covered by Senator Faulkner's motion.

Unfortunately, as I explained to the Senate last session, the government has been unable to meet the time constraints placed upon it for the production of documents.

        I just reiterate that for the Senate and for those listening on the broadcast: `Oh look, I've made it clear—I'm not going to break any promises.' That was Mr Howard's ironclad assertion before the election that no election promises would be broken.

        What happened in last night's budget—and, I might say, in the lead-up to the budget—was that many of the commitments given by the government were broken when they were either leaked or announced ahead of the budget papers last night. This is what Australians have to ask and what anyone who has any dealings with Mr Howard and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in future has to ask when they are discussing an issue and reaching an agreement with Mr Howard and Mr Costello: `You've made a commitment; you've made a promise; but is it a core promise or is it a non-core promise?' Since the election we have had the emergence of two categories of promises: the promises you keep, the core promises; and the promises that you ditch, the non-core promises. There are core promises and non-core promises from a non-core Prime Minister, I might say, a non-core Treasurer and a non-core Liberal Party.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As for the National Party, they did not even rate in the core promises. They spent all their time fighting the commitment on the diesel fuel rebate and were not able to deliver any dollars to the bush—not one single dollar. It is about time the National Party stopped being the doormat. I see Senator McGauran here. I say to Senator McGauran, through you, Mr Deputy President: I hope you are listening to people out in the bush in regional Australia, because a lot of people in the rural and regional sector are concerned at the way the National Party has rolled over at the breaking of promises by the Liberal Party and are concerned at the way the Liberal Party has captured the National Party and treated them as a doormat.

I remember the commitment he gave on industrial relations policy. He gave an absolute guarantee that not one Australian worker would be worse off—that is a debate we will have at another time—but the evidence is to the contrary.

         There are some other issues. We have identified at least 27 major broken promises in this budget, or promises not in this budget—issues, policies, promises that should have been delivered on. I started to mention a few of them when we were taking note of answers to questions. Let us just take the child&amp;hyphen;care area as an example. The promise was made to maintain the non-means testing of the child-care cash rebate. The budget reduces the level of rebates for families with incomes above the family tax initiative threshold from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. That is a clear breaking of an election promise.

         A clear election promise was to maintain the system of child-care assistance. But the budget caps access to child-care assistance at 50 hours per week per child.

         We had the pre-emptive announcement, or the pre pre-emptive announcement, by Senator Vanstone on education when she was wining and dining with the vice-chancellors. Then we got the pre-emptive announcement last week. It is clear that Senator Vanstone was all too unclear when she engaged in a heavy bout of socialising at that dinner with the vice-chancellors. But she was deadly serious about the proposed cuts to higher education. Where was this outlined in the Liberal party policy document?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another area is foreign aid. The promise was made to make cuts to business subsidies in the aid program. The budget contains further cuts in the aid program over and above the DIFF abolition, saving $70 million, $78 million, $78 million and $80 million over a four-year period.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another promise was to maintain the real value of pension benefits and entitlements. We have had the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. I mentioned that earlier. Some people in the Liberal Party,

The Liberal Party apparently thinks it can be disposed of like some throwaway false teeth. That is another false promise.

There are budget cuts of $577 million, $961 million, $137 million and $183 million over a four-year period. One of the interesting aspects of this is, if you read it in the context of the budget speech delivered by Treasurer Costello and the budget statements, it is clear that unemployment is going to remain above eight per cent for at least the next two years.

        When the coalition took office in March, the economy had just entered its fifth year of economic growth. The economy had been growing slowly after the recession Labor said we had to have. That recession had devastated the lives of millions of Australians. In fact, it was in Labor's recession that the official

       <para first-indent="16">
        Even though the economy was just growing in March, a couple of other statistics were absolutely ripping along. Government revenue had grown by 30 per cent over four years. This was the result of Labor's tax feast in the 1993 budget. But even with this economic growth and this magnitude of revenue growth, Labor still could not balance the books. So for the past four years Australians have seen their public assets sold off to pay for the daily expenses of government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and many more—nearly $9 billion worth of assets—were sold or put up for sale. But even that was not enough to bring in a balanced budget so Labor stopped investing in the public infrastructure. Capital outlays by the Commonwealth government declined by 135 per cent between 1992-93 and the last financial year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Still the budget was locked into deficit. How locked? Just look at the underlying deficit outcomes for the past four years—$14.5 thousand million, $13.6 thousand million, $11.6 thousand million and $10.3 thousand million. With Labor, the Commonwealth budget and Australian taxpayers were certainly going very quickly into debt. Labor's record on debt is absolutely outstanding if that is what you regard high debt.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In June 1991 the Commonwealth owed $34,000 million. The next year it had grown to $45,000 million. Just two months ago it had risen to $106,000 million. Most significantly, the increased debt has to be serviced. Interest on public debt has to be paid. In 1991-92, interest paid on behalf of the Commonwealth was $3.9 billion. Last year, it had increased to $8.5 thousand million and this year, as a result of their debt of $106 billion, the interest payment will total $9.3 thousand million. This means the Commonwealth will be spending this year more on debt in interest than it does on public order and safety and about the same as it does on defence and education.

        What we can do and what this government will do is stabilise the debt by running surpluses in the budget.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When all honourable senators consider this budget, they must think carefully about the consequences of increasing the budget deficit. Every cutback that is rejected or revenue measure refused will mean a bigger deficit, greater debt, more interest payments, greater instability in the economy, uncertainty and, ultimately, more volatile interest rates for the community. This is not a threat; this is the reality of what happens.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, all senators must weigh up the value of expenditures and the merit of revenue measures, but they must also decide whether it is better to retain the failure of the past or to take a chance with hope for the future. As to those who say that debt does not matter, I ask this question: if the level of debt does not matter, why do all Australians and every government around the world think that it does?

        Last year the government's debt was equal to 80 per cent of the government's budget and around 25 per cent of our GDP. Would it matter if that were doubled to 50 per cent of GDP? Of course it would. Can you imagine a government debt of $250,000 million, an interim bill per annum of, say, $25 billion? Would it matter? Of course it would matter. Our economy would be wrecked and useless. Republic or not, selling bananas would be our country's only activity.

        The first Costello budget will give this country and its people, now and into the future, pride and hope. There comes a time when every nation must move on from failure and disappointment. Now is that time. Now offers that chance, and no amount of hypocritical finger waving must be allowed to prevent our nation moving on.

        In this matter of public importance the Labor opposition and anyone who supports them demonstrate that they are out of touch with the aspirations of average Australians.

         —I rise today on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the matter of public importance before us today. Last night this government, when it handed down its first budget, broke a plethora of election promises but there is one area, which Senator Sherry referred to, in which there is a litany of broken promises: higher education. A range of areas were targeted last night. Young people, students and the unemployed will bear the brunt of this budget, as the coalition broke its election commitments to Triple J, to the ABC, to labour market program funding and, of course, to higher education.

        Senator Gibson, there has been a swift reaction. There has been a swift reaction on behalf of the community, community groups, lobby groups and those people who are victimised, poorer and disadvantaged in our society because of this budget. And they have got good reason to complain. Today we should review some of the promises that were made by the coalition government during the election campaign.

        For a start, the coalition promised to at least maintain operating grants to universities, and what have we got? Over the next four years operating grants to universities will be cut by over $623 million. What a broken promise. That absolutely flies in the face of its election commitments. In fact, the coalition states in its `A fair go for students' package that the HECS repayment threshold will not drop below average weekly earnings. What is a drop from around $28,000 per annum down to $20,800 per annum? It is a sizeable drop.

        I like the comments Senator Vanstone made in the chamber today that this somehow will not disadvantage lower income families when in actual fact a one-income family of two who are repaying their HECS debt will be doing so at 88 per cent of the poverty line. So you are hitting hardest those people in our community who are from lower socioeconomic groups, despite your purported commitment to access and equity in higher education. I have yet to see any evidence in this budget that supports those people who have been traditionally disadvantaged in the higher education sector.

        Senator Vanstone talked about lower socioeconomic groups not increasing their participation rate in higher education. That is true.

        That reminds me of another promise—that you would not introduce up&amp;hyphen;front, full cost fees for undergraduate places. What have you done? You have allowed up to 25 per cent of university courses to be charged full cost, up&amp;hyphen;front fees. We are assuming that is what the cost will be, because you have not actually put a cap on that. You have not put a maximum amount, you have put a minimum amount that people have to pay; so who knows what prices young people and students are going to be subject to.

        As for Austudy, again the promise was that it would be maintained at real levels. What happened? The government has introduced tighter eligibility criteria, the government has removed it for certain homeless students and the government has removed it for certain single students who are sharing accommodation. I have just discovered—and I wish the minister were here because I would like an answer to this—that in order to assess a student's eligibility for Austudy they will be assessed at the day they enrol for a course. So, if you are 24 years and nine months old and you are applying for a degree in, say, medicine and you are not eligible because the independent rate age has been increased to 25, even when you are studying at the age of 30 you are still ineligible because you are assessed from the time that you enrol.

There is no statistic to say what that figure will be. And the reason? Because the government does not believe in its heart of hearts that there will be in fact a reduction in unemployment in this country. In the budget speech there is an assertion that unemployment may in fact go up, but there is no figure, there is no forecast and there is no estimate.

Business confidence will be shattered by the budget cuts that have reduced consumer purchasing power as consumers have to foot higher bills for pharmaceuticals, taxes and charges levied on them by the states because of the actions taken by this federal government over state revenues as well. So the impact is, in a very low level of consumer confidence and business outlook for the future, to contract the Australian economy.

         But how does this government say it will save the Australian economy? It points to high demand in the international economy—that is, `The rest of the world is doing all right; we will do worse but, if we trade with the rest of the world, we will lift our economy up by its bootstraps'—as this government infers in its budget documentation. How does it propose to do that? It slashed $500 million out of export promotion programs and it slashed $346 million out of manufacturing industry, so the two areas where you would expect to see some help to take advantage of buoyant international economic conditions for the Australian domestic economy—export and manufacturing—are gone.

         We hope to connect with the international economy. I will tell you what we will do, Mr Acting Deputy President: we will connect all right—we will connect in the traditional areas of mining and agriculture, and maybe we will sell a few places to tourists. Once again Australia will revert to being a mine and a farm and a tourist destination, but we will not be a highly skilled manufacturing economy creating smart jobs for intelligent, well&amp;hyphen;trained Australians, offering high pay and remuneration for the future. And we will not make the bridge into the international economy, either. You can sell so much iron ore and coal, and you can sell so much wheat and wool, but you cannot buy back the elaborately transformed and sophisticated manufactured goods that you need by just doing that; you have to export manufactured goods as well. This budget is deceitful because it undermines our ability to do that and, in domestic economic terms, it is a contractionary budget.

I remind the Senate that Bill Kelty has not retracted his comments that he believed it was one of the most successful demonstrations ever held in Canberra.

        It is a privilege to be in government. But when the Labor Party had that privilege nothing greater symbolised their attitude towards breaking promises than the key 1993 budget.

        As all here are aware, the tragedy in Port Arthur in April prompted historic decisions in relation to firearms in this country. On 10 May and 17 July the Australasian Police Ministers' Council agreed on nationwide gun control measures.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All governments in this country are agreed that possession of firearms is not a right but a conditional privilege. The new measures will include effective nationwide registration of all firearms, the need for applicants for firearms licences to establish a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm and uniform basic licence requirements. Personal protection will not be regarded as a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A significant element of the measures is the amnesty and compensation scheme for owners of self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump-action shotguns. Such guns are to be the subject of nationwide restrictions. There will be limited access to certain categories of self-loading rifles and shotguns and pump-action shotguns for primary producers and exemptions for military, police and occupational shooters licensed for a specific purpose such as extermination of feral animals. The scheme will require gun owners to hand in firearms falling within the restricted categories during the nationwide amnesty period in return for fair and proper compensation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth agreed to meet fully the direct cost of the compensation-for-surrender scheme, funds for which have been raised by a one-off increase in the Medicare levy for the income year 1996-97. This increase is already in effect and it remains only to permit the monies raised to be paid to the states and territories to assist them in achieving the full implementation of the new nationwide gun control measures overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the Australian people. A very large total cost is involved. It is estimated that the increase in the Medicare levy will raise around $500 million. This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the problem of gun control.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill allows the Attorney-General to authorise payments by way of financial assistance to the states and territories for the purpose of providing compensation to firearms owners and dealers. It also allows the Attorney-General to authorise payments to the states and territories and by the Commonwealth for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and for implementation of the new nationwide licensing and registration schemes. The bill appropriates monies from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for these purposes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Payments for reimbursement of compensation paid for surrendered firearms are limited to those surrendered during the national amnesty period of 10 May this year to 30 September next year, or such shorter period as the Attorney-General determines if any jurisdiction decides on a shorter amnesty. Gun dealers will also be able to claim for loss of business associated with surrender of stock

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Swift action is essential if we are to have really effective nationwide firearms laws. The Commonwealth has already demonstrated its commitment by acting quickly to amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to complement the resolutions of the Australasian Police Ministers' Council and by increasing the Medicare levy. Now it is time to take the next step to support the states and territories in their endeavours to achieve effective controls.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Simple and short though it is, this bill is of major importance in the implementation of the national firearms program. It provides support to the states and territories, will enable the compensation-for-surrender scheme to go ahead and, I hope, encourage owners of banned firearms to come forward and surrender them.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is, therefore, extremely important that the bill be passed through the Parliament as quickly as possible. The government acknowledged this by introducing it in the House of Representatives on the first day of sittings. We have had multi-partisan support right from the beginning for the new nationwide firearms laws. That has been invaluable in achieving community consensus. In the House of Representatives, the opposition gave its continued support to the measures being taken and the bill was passed the day after it was introduced. I ask all of you here in this place also to continue to support the proposed nationwide measures being taken and pass this bill quickly. In this way we will help to encourage the speedy surrender of these firearms and ensure greater protection from violence for the whole Australian community. Let us all act together to make this country a safer place.

        This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to implement the government's election commitment to expand substantially the benefits available under the Defence Homeowner Scheme. The bill also makes corrections to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982.

        The government recognises that the dedicated service of Defence men and women is a critical element in maintaining Australia's national security.

        The Defence Homeowner Scheme is established by the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act. It is designed to meet the requirements of both the Defence Force and individual members. It offers an interest rate subsidy on home loans which is related to length of service, with the benefit being enhanced for members who provide operational service.

        The characteristics of Defence Force service—such as regular postings to different locations—make home ownership a particular challenge for our Service personnel. The Homeowner Scheme assists them to meet that challenge.

        The remaining amendments made by the bill relate to references in the Defence Force Discipline Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Defence Force Discipline Act provides a code for the investigation and prosecution of service offences committed by members of the Defence Force. The act itself specifies some offences directly related to Defence Force service and deals with other more general offences (such as aggravated assault and burglary) by adopting the criminal law applying in the Jervis Bay Territory. The law applying in the Jervis Bay Territory is essentially the law of the Australian Capital Territory, which has included the New South Wales Crimes Act, as amended by laws of the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1992, Australian Capital Territory legislation changed the status of the Crimes Act in force in the Australian Capital Territory (and which is therefore applied to the Jervis Bay Territory) from an act of New South Wales to an act of the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current references in the Defence Force Discipline Act to the Crimes Act of New South Wales in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory therefore need to be replaced by references to the Crimes Act of the Australian Capital Territory in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory. Failure to make the change could put at risk prosecutions based on Defence Force Discipline Act provisions adopting Crimes Act offences.

I have had a very wide experience of life which has included travelling extensively and living and working in four countries on three continents. So I feel qualified to compare Australia with other countries. Every country is unique and worthwhile in its own way. But Australia, more than most, has such a rich and varied environment. It has such sweep and space, such grandeur and mystery. It has space for the soul and laughter, for achievement and contentment.

         As a WA senator I must touch on my state. Unfortunately, despite its many virtues and strengths, in my view it is still a state tainted by maladministration and it is still consistently failing to sufficiently and satisfactorily address community needs and expectations.

         I want to make some brief remarks on constitutional matters arising out of extensive work I did for WA's Commission on Government. I am one of those who sets great store by our social contract—our constitution. The Australian constitution gained its legitimacy by being designed by Australians and by being convincingly approved by the people by referendum. In contrast, the Western Australian constitution is an act of the United Kingdom, reinforced by subsequent legislation in WA. It has never been accorded popular and democratic approval through a convincing referendum process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In WA we have an incomplete and fragmented set of precedents and documents that provide something of a constitutional framework. Certainly, there is no single, holistic and cohesive constitutional document. It does not exist, although the state is trying to write up a summary document.

          As a result of the democratic process, the sovereignty of the Australian people has been established as the fundamental underpinning of the Australian constitution. The sovereignty of the people might be implicit in the WA state constitution, but it is certainly not its fundamental basis. In its origin the WA state constitution was not founded on the consent of the Western Australian people. WA Aboriginals might well regard the WA constitu tion as alien and offensive. It is still non&amp;hyphen;inclusive. Under this existing constitution WA Aboriginals suffered appallingly and the most basic of human rights were violated.

         The current system of government in WA has its roots in imperialism and colonialism, in constitutional monarchy and executive dominance. The WA state constitution reflects this historical milieu. The original Australians, the Aboriginal people, had no place nor say in its making, neither did Australian women, by and large. Many Western Australians advocate change and major improvements to our systems of government. They deserve to get it.

         I want to touch briefly on secrecy in WA, but these remarks are also apposite to government elsewhere. Again, this has had much focus by the Commission on Government in WA.

Secrecy does not have equal weight with openness.

Secondly, by enshrining in legislation that where there is doubt the bias is always to fall on the side of public interest, accountability, exposure and access. Thirdly, repealing all secrecy provisions in the 100&amp;hyphen;plus WA acts identified as having them, and only if necessary reconstituting them as exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act.

I am now a member of a profession which is characterised at its worst as opportunist, cynical, manipulative, self&amp;hyphen;serving, dishonest and not to be trusted. I do not like that much. I doubt that any of us do. It may not be true, but that perception is out there and I think it is important to conduct politics in a way that lessens and not increases that perception.

         I believe that the greatest task for your government is to start to restore the faith of the people in government. In my view, that is an impossible and insurmountable task if we go on as we have been. I will be making my own effort to maintain the high ideals of politics. I have already met senators who give you great faith in their humanity and decency, regardless of their political persuasion. No doubt I will also meet the other kind.

         People who do know better do abuse our trust. However, priests who defile children, lawyers who launder cash and politicians who lie have not yet, thankfully, destroyed our faith in our ideals. Ideals transcend humanity's failings.

The role of politicians still is to resolve the tensions of society, to make the present better and the future safe and fulfilling.

         The governments that have governed my state and the country over the past 20 years have followed broadly similar policies. Yet the people tell me our society has deteriorated—fractured communities, aggressive citizens, unsafe streets, fewer and more insecure jobs and greater stress. Rural and regional Australia sometimes scream with the pain of it all. It must surely be time for governments to say, `Hang on. Have we got this right? Has the economic and political speak been right? Is there a better way?' I know that no&amp;hyphen;one comes to this place wanting to make things worse—of course not. But have the right choices been made, even in good faith?

         A fundamental premise is that the government is there to look after the little guy. It is sometimes a little difficult to remember the little guy when it is always the big, the articulate and the moneyed breathing in your face. It is not good enough to talk small business but act and crony with big; to talk individual choice but to exploit the individual; to talk community and family but to leave each of us to our own devices. These little guys feel there is a massive attempt to transfer expenditure on services from the government to the individual, from the community to the person—toll roads, health, education, phones and television—and becoming a society which says, `You've got to make it on your own; there's no&amp;hyphen;one out there for you.'

         —When I was interrupted, I was speaking of buffer zones around airports. As an accident, a by-product of planning that occurred before ecological values were considered, the establishment of airport buffers was fortuitous. But we should not pretend that these areas can still be considered worthless bush or scrub. We no longer live in an era where natural vegetation is considered simply an impediment to development. Clearing land is no longer seen as a goal in itself.

        Today, these remnant areas are often the only surviving examples of the original ecology of the urban areas, the only remnant habitat of sometimes dozens of species that
        <break page="2839" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         have disappeared under concrete and lawn. Little areas caught between canals, within the fences of explosive reserves or around airports are often the only sites where various species are located: species of native grasses, bushes, wildflowers and trees once common in our urban areas. These buffer zones may be the only places they can now be found. Worms, lizards and all sorts of fauna are also found there, often uniquely, since their habitat has otherwise vanished. It could be fungi; it could be all those things that are not exactly warm, fuzzy animals; but they are important. Biologists are still discovering species in these urban pockets of natural land—species they never knew existed and which are now almost gone from the earth.

        I do not believe it was the intention of the previous government to simply forget these things: these fellow creatures that share our earth, these small remnants of what the biotic bounty of our cities once was. I sincerely hope it is not the intention of the current government to see these things as expendable, to be thrown away without consideration to put up yet another hotel or a parking lot, or to allow some company to make a few more dollars.

        I quote from the local newspaper in Western Australia in relation to airport developments: `Let's not let a tortoise get in the way of development.' I will be putting a few amendments that I think will at least ensure that these elements are considered so that there will be input into planning from those who care about these things and from those who know. I would like to point out that, as in Perth, it is often not the experts who know; it is often the local naturalists, the keen amateurs and the biology students who spend their spare hours over a period of years in these buffer zones, in the wetlands and along the riverbanks.

        The experts of the EPA are often far too busy to focus on such things. They do not have the time. Knowing an ecology is, in many respects, a labour of love. Knowledge of the principles of biological interaction cannot substitute for being close to the earth, a certain plot of earth, for learning its cycles and seasons and for becoming familiar with
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the life there. It is the same as the fact that knowing sociology or psychology cannot substitute for personal knowledge of the people of a community or of your own family. It is important that the plans which will affect our environment involve consultation with the people who do know the specifics of the earth in a place as well as consultation with experts.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our amendments are fairly simple. The master plans and development plans currently include a requirement to note projected impacts of noise and to consider and note all potential environmental impacts. We would amend the requirements so that these impacts are not just noted but that the proponents would have to include a strategy to address these impacts. It is not enough to simply note that these things are likely to happen—that is, that we will ruin the wetlands. Accountability demands management plans.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The noise issue is particularly important. With the environmental impacts, these are, to some extent, covered in the environmental strategy. But in the environmental strategy in division 3, concerning what may be regulated in terms of environmental standards, the phrase in 124(1)(b) that `the emission of noise generated at airport sites (other than noise generated by aircraft in flight)' creates an implication that environmental management involves only the site of the airport, at least in regard to noise and possibly in regard to other things.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The major issue regarding noise is about residents and about `noise generated by aircraft in flight'. If this is not to be considered in the environmental strategy, then it must be considered in the context of the master plan and development plans. In fact, it is to be considered in the current bill, but there are no provisions for plans about how to manage or address the problem. Also, as noted below, there are no penalties for contravention of the environmental strategy, while there are requirements under section 76 for bringing a problem with achieving objectives of the master plan to the attention of the minister, and penalties for failing to do so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The lack of a requirement for plans for management of noise is a serious omission. It
        <break page="2840" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         is particularly serious considering that previously the government response to a government owned and operated airport has been to try to insulate residential houses under the flight path to reduce the noise exposure inside the houses. Such a plan cost millions of dollars and the results were far from satisfactory, with the government arguing that they would insulate the bedrooms but not living spaces such as kitchens and dining rooms. What is supposed to happen in future? If a private manager makes decisions or changes that result in unacceptable levels of noise, who decides what is to be done? Who will pay? Will government subsidise the airport lessees? Will residents simply be sacrificed? There is really no provision in the current bill for dealing with this at all.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Among other things, we seek to alter the environmental regulations section to allow regulations regarding noise from airborne aircraft. The regulations are optional; they may be drafted. A regulation in relation to aircraft noise may be nothing other than a regulation requiring that the forecast required for the master and land use plans must include profiles for noise impact broken down by time and neighbourhood.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are also concerned that there can be alterations to land use that do not fit under the definition of a major development, yet which create a substantial environmental impact. For example, part of a minor development may include drainage that affects water levels in a significant wetland. The development may cost less than $10 million and so not require a change to the land use plan nor a change to the master plan or environmental strategy, yet it will have a clear impact.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Both the master plan and environmental strategy are to be replaced every five years but may just continue in operation beyond the five&amp;hyphen;year period if a replacement is not approved. Under section 122(2), contravention of the environmental plan is not an offence. Under 122(3), it does not affect the validity of an agreement though it may be grounds for an injunction. The only place which might require an examination of the new project is under state law or under the development plan. This is why we have included a new
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         category stating that a development proposal having substantive impact on the environment is as much a major development as an extension of a runway. I do not believe it is the intention of parliament that a development having a significant environmental impact should be free of scrutiny just because the cause of the impact was not monetarily expensive.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will also seek to clarify the situation with regard to federal environmental regulations and state or territory regulations. Initially we were told that the Airports Bill guaranteed a high degree of environmental accountability. We were told that airports would not be exempted from state and territory environmental law but that, where state law was too lenient or exceptions were made by state legislature, the federal government could put even more stringent regulations in place. The fairly explicit impression I got was that this was to be a system of double safeguards, that airports would be under both state or territory and federal environmental regulations and would have to comply with the most stringent requirements. I am fairly confident that this was the ALP's intention—they may tell me otherwise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The proposed law does not say that. It says that airports must abide by both state or territory and federal regulations but that federal regulations take precedence in a conflict and further that federal regulations may exempt airports from state or territory law. We have amendments to change this and bring the law in line with what I believe was the original intention of the ALP—and what I hope is the intention of the coalition—that the most stringent measures at either government level should be applied in the protection of the environment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, the regulations themselves should, I believe, be able to include regulation of impact on habitat and biota. I remind senators that no regulations need be made, and so this simply creates an option to regulate these environmental impacts. The current legislation says that regulations can only deal with pollution, noise and waste, and only at the airport site, yet these are not the only environmental impacts that are likely.
       </para>
       <break page="2841" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also believe that, like the plans and strategies, regulations should be made with consultation. It is important to get the input from various sources about what regulations may be appropriate and about any potential problems with regulations. Given the importance of regulations, it also seems an important element of accountability that they should be tabled in parliament as disallowable instruments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said initially, I think it was the intention of the ALP that stringent regulation for environmental protection should apply and that the regulatory regime and development plans for the airports should involve broad consultation. I hope the coalition would agree. If the people are to lose some input, then it is important that they do not lose all input into the impacts of airport development.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think my amendments strengthen this accountability and responsiveness without unduly compromising the companies that will probably run airports. I wish that this bill not be passed, and I will vote against it. But since it is likely to be carried by the opposition and the government, it should be in a form as responsible and responsive as possible.

        What I want to do is review the operation of the Federal Airports Corporation in the six to eight years it has been in existence, as its existence is clearly now drawing to a close, and to highlight the very great conceptual failures that led the Labor government to set up both the Federal Airports Corporation and what was the Civil Aviation Authority before it got broken up further under the guise or the concept of GBEs, government business enterprises.

         A GBE is a very fine sounding title, but in practice, administratively, it has been one of the great failures of Australian public admin istration. At the end of the day it has been a failure simply because there was no accountability or negligible accountability built into the system. It is all very well to talk about having discrete bodies, government business enterprises, but they did have great power—and, in the case of the FAC, it had both power and economic power—and they really did not have to account for the exercise of that power to anyone at all. In the case of both the FAC and the CAA they were monopoly powers.

        They were set up to be self&amp;hyphen;regulating authorities. The concept was generally based on the belief of user pays, which was quite fashionable in the Labor government, particularly in its earlier years. It is a fair enough proposition in a very broad sense to talk about user pays and about not being a burden on the rest of society, but in the case of these two authorities—the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was then, and the Federal Airports Corporation—there is a demonstrable public interest and a public benefit from those authorities.

        You cannot attribute the entire cost of an airport or of the regulation of the airways services to the passengers or to the freight that is carried by the airlines.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The other great problem with the user&amp;hyphen;pays concept in this dimension is that the user literally had no control over the expenditure. There is no requirement on the people providing the service to provide it in the most efficient and, therefore, the most economic form.

        The belief was that, if the government business enterprises were set up, they could be self&amp;hyphen;funding. Not only would that lower taxation to the community at large, which of course never happened, but also there was the belief that, because they were called business enterprises, they would be run more efficiently than when they were departments of state and that thereby costs would be made lower to the users—namely, the industry.

         have gone up as a consequence of the introduction of the CAA and the Federal Airports Corporation in 1986, when the legislation was passed by the then transport minister Gareth Evans. The regrettable point is that it does not matter what happens from now on, those high costs are now built into the aviation industry. It will be impossible to get them back to a more equitable figure.

        In the case of the Federal Airports Corporation, it was argued that, in the light of experience overseas, particularly the experience in Europe and the United Kingdom, privatisation of airports had been a great commercial success for the authorities that were administering them. That was perfectly true, but there are some significant differences between the European or the United Kingdom experience and Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        First of all, in places like Belgium, Holland and London there is great pressure on land. Land is a very scarce resource. If you have a huge area tied up for an airport which has only runways and hangars on it, you are wasting a valuable resource. Given the high population densities around there, it was quite an attractive proposition commercially to develop the land that was not being used for aviation purposes but which was required in any case to enclose runways and hangars for commercial services. That yielded a great benefit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That argument is not quite transferable to Australia. As someone who has had a long involvement with the aviation industry, I agree that there is a lot of waste land and a waste of resource in all the airports we have in Australia. If we can use that profitably to reduce the costs and the overheads of the airports, I am more than happy to do that. But you have to remember that airports have certain characteristics. They are there for aircraft to operate on and off. They do have a lot of noise associated with them, regrettably. You do need a certain amount of space for aircraft to land and take off. Those requirements for the operation of aircraft must have primacy over any other commercial development which takes place on the airfield site.

        The trouble started with the Federal Airports Corporation right at the outset, because
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the Labor Party in their usual style were quite dishonest when it came to finance. All the airports in Australia had been paid for by the Australian taxpayers—some of them going back to the 1930s and possibly earlier in one or two other occasions. Not only were they paid for by the taxpayer but their value had been depreciated.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Instead of gifting them to the Federal Airports Corporation, which would have been the correct thing for them to do, they valued them at top dollar at the time as prime development land, transferred that notional value across to the FAC and said, `We will loan you the money to buy these facilities. Furthermore, we require you to pay a high rate of dividend as a return for the nominal value that we have placed on those airports.' So the FAC got off to a very bad start and, in many ways, a totally unrealistic load was placed on them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In that sense the management plan was quite wrong. The effect of that has been to build this huge multiplier effect into the overheads of airports, which impacts on Australia's competitiveness internationally. I will give an example of this.

        For many years I have been operating out of Archerfield, the secondary airport in Brisbane. When the old Department of Civil Aviation operated the airfields that the DCA owned in Australia, there was a small planning staff in Canberra. I do not how many were in it—maybe half a dozen or a dozen engineers who understood the requirements of airfield civil engineering and air traffic control. They planned what was required for the whole of Australia. All the airports around the country were each manned by probably two or three groundsmen, with two groundsmen for most of the secondary airports. They were people who mowed the grass. Development works, like sealing runways and construction, went out to contractors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As soon as the FAC was set up not only did we have a huge expansion—dozens more people moved into the central planning authority, with very high salaries for the senior personnel—but we got these huge teams on every airport they control in Australia. Archerfield has maybe 10 or 12 people—
        <break page="2843" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         all with very high executive salaries, all with fine titles, such as business manager, development manager, engineering manager, promotions manager and so on. I presume all of them are getting at least $60,000 to $80,000 a year and have new cars with mobile phones and radios. That is an overhead that secondary airports simply cannot bear.

        When you take on the FAC about the fact they are losing money on these airports, they say that they are losing $500,000 or $1 million on X, Y and Z and the only airports they are really making money out of are the primary airports at Brisbane, Sydney and Tullamarine. The reason they are losing money on the others is that they are carrying these absurd overheads that simply cannot be supported.

        I declare a personal interest because I am a tenant of the FAC. I have had the unfortunate experience of having to deal with them since they have been in power. I do say quite seriously that they have abused the monopoly powers that were granted to them. Aircraft can be operated only from airfields. They cannot be operated from industrial land, residential land or anything like that. If you live in a capital city, you are obliged to operate from the secondary airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The FAC have abused their monopolistic power by being quite unable or unprepared to negotiate on any reasonable terms with their tenants. I originally signed a contract with the old Department of Civil Aviation for a hangar that a group of us had built. That was fairly represented in a lease agreement that took 10 pages. It represented the interests of the tenant and the landlord.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When that lease expired, we were given a 50&amp;hyphen;page lease agreement from the FAC. Every page of that document was marked and overprinted with the slogan `For discussion purposes only'. When we came to discuss this 50&amp;hyphen;page document, which listed every conceivable event and incident which could befall the FAC and protected them and gave no rights to the tenant at all, we met a brick wall. We were told, `It's non-negotiable. You sign or else.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The real sticking point of course was the rent. The rent went up very many times. A
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         tenant simply has no negotiating power with a monopoly landlord who is behaving in this manner. The rental rate was several times that of comparable industrial land over the street. The industrial land over the street is worthless to us. We cannot operate there. We have to operate off the airport. Arguably, we ought to pay a lower rate than that for comparable industrial land rather than pay two or three times the rate for commercial land on the perimeter of the airports.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the end of the day we are in a position where we just have to give in to the FAC. They very clearly have abused their position and the monopoly powers they have over their tenants. They take one tenant aside and say in private that someone else is paying a certain rate for the rental of a certain property—this is usually someone who has a burning desire to get onto the airfield and knows nothing about the history of it—and, having signed up that person, they then use that as a lever against everyone else with the proviso that, if you do not sign the lease, you take your hangar and return the land to its original condition or they seize your hangar.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They are legally entitled to do that, but it is a pretty draconian way to go about it. It overlooks the fact that some tenants who are on those airports came there under a totally different regime when they dealt with the Department of Civil Aviation. You simply cannot pull down a hangar, dig up six inches of concrete and go.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The way the FAC has gone about this has led to a great flight of people from the secondary airports. That is socially undesirable because the community must have a resource that is an airport. If you do have a designated airport, you can control noise, you can define your approach and departure paths, and you can have a degree of environmental control, which is impossible if people are operating out of a whole lot of small airports.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other very important point is that it aggregates pilots, maintenance people and aircraft in the one site, which makes oversight and regulation of them very much easier. It becomes very difficult for the regulatory authority if they have to chase after tiny backyard airports all over the place to try to
        <break page="2844" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         find out who is up to speed on their maintenance and what operating practices might be. So there are very real social benefits in setting up these secondary airports around the capital areas and running them in an economically efficient way.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have gotten to the position now where all governments see that the name of the game is to maximise the profits from the sale of the airports. So we have the FAC embarking on an even more rabid rental rise program. Everyone would have seen in the last two to three weeks that Qantas and Ansett had refused to even discuss with the FAC the 13 per cent plus rise that it was trying to put onto their lease agreements. The name of the game is to build incomes up as high as they can for the airports so that the government can maximise the sale price of the airports. The other side of that is that you are building in costs to the industry which are going to be permanent. It neglects the original concept, which was to provide a lowering of cost to industry—not to increase them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The difficulty with all of this is that there simply is no accountability. There is no way you could bring the FAC to account; they were a law unto themselves. The minister has minimal control legally over them and any complaints are met with a deaf ear. I think it is very undesirable in society to have a group with monopoly power—let alone monopoly economic power—which is not accountable effectively to shareholders, only its own board of directors. That has been the great problem with the FAC. Hopefully, though, they will ride off into the pages of history in the next year or two.

        But we are still left with the business of what happens to the CAA. It is time we had a look at the CAA, which has now been split into the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority, CASA, Airservices Australia—looking after the air traffic control procedures—and BASI, which is a bit of an outrider unit and does not quite fit into the category of the other two. I think that Airservices Australia in some way can be privatised. It is very difficult to get competition into the provision of air traffic control services, and I do not wish to take the time of the Senate tonight going into that

        There is a very cogent argument for CASA to be returned as a department of state to this parliament under the control of a minister. CASA really is a regulatory authority and therefore is a policeman. I do not see police forces being privatised or run as government business enterprises. Their role is to ensure the safe navigation of aircraft and the safe operation of aircraft in Australia. They exist to form regulations and see that those regulations are applied. Their role is very similar to a police force and I think the concept of them staying as a government business enterprise is no longer tenable.

        I do not expect my own government to fall over and accept this proposition straightaway, but I do think we have to seriously look at that.

        I hope those few words have not impeded the passage of the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 and the Airports Bill 1996, because in general they provide worthwhile amendments to the proposed sale. I hope different authorities buy the two major airports in Brisbane and in Melbourne, because in the interest of competition within the states we ought to have a competitive game running between all the major airports.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point is that it is highly desirable that in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne the primary airport and the secondary airport are linked together and operated together—that the purchaser of the primary airport should also buy the secondary airport so that one can support the other, because there is a very genuine need to have cooperation between those two.

        I would like to clear up a point with regard to the altercation which unfortunately occurred this morning between Senator Conroy and me; I do not believe it should have done, nonetheless it did. I want to put on the record the situation which exists as far as Sydney is concerned and our going or not going up there. We had one submission from New South Wales which was in on time, which was from the Bankstown City Council. They came to Canberra and appeared. We had a second submission from the Sutherland council. It was a late submission and they asked whether or not we would take it into consideration. They were the two submissions we had from New South Wales. We did not get a submission from the New South Wales government.

        Another point I want to clear up so that the matter is absolutely clear is that, in relation to Melbourne, this morning I may have inadvertently led people to believe that the representative of the Victorian government wanted to appear but did not appear. I want to make it absolutely clear that, while the Victorian government put in a submission, they expressly said that they did not wish to appear before the committee.

        In dealing with this legislation before us, I am going to deal with the inquiries we had and the response to some matters, because some very important matters were raised during those hearings and it is important that I refer to them briefly in the time I have. The first point I wish to make—and it is very important in terms of the committee hearing—is that prior to the hearing the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee received, through a letter to me as chairman of that committee, the additional amendments that the minister had. So the witnesses who were there were familiar with them and able to deal with them in a formal manner. I am pleased to say that the recommendation from the committee reads:

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee recommends that the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 be agreed to subject to amendments notified to the Committee by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.
        </para>
        <para>
         So we agreed on those aspects of it. I also note that at the end of that hearing Senator Conroy congratulated the committee for adopting what he called the amendments from the opposition in the other place. But they were more than amendments from the opposition in the other place. Whilst I acknowledge that they were moved there, they were positions also put by a number in the community including—I am not 100 per cent certain about this—the Victorian and New South Wales governments about the situation that existed. I see Senator Conroy is nodding about them both.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We dealt with other important matters and we heard from every witness who wished to appear before us. Other than the submissions that I have mentioned, there was one other but the witness did not wish to appear. So we did not get a large response in terms of people wishing to give evidence either through submissions without appearing or by appearing. But the important thing about this inquiry was that the submissions went straight to the point. They were very important and the committee took on board the aspects raised.

         Another recommendation was:

         I think it is fair to say that the Western Australian government, the South Australian government, the Bankstown Council and the conglomerate of councils from Tasmania all put that aspect to the committee and I am pleased to say that the minister has taken that recommendation on board. It demonstrates quite clearly the value of the hearings.

          process. They were concerned that it was not clearly spelt out, although they did not really criticise the communications to this point. They were concerned about the future, the leasing program and what was occurring. We put that recommendation to the minister and, once again, the minister has accepted it and is prepared to implement that in a practical way. We as a committee will obviously be interested in the outcome and will continue to monitor it. I am sure that those councils and the state, territory and local governments will all remind us, as time goes by, if it is not implemented, but I have no doubt from the discussions that I have had with the minister's office that it will be implemented and that that is the intention.

There was a proposal, which nearly saw the light of day, to build a shopping centre at the airport. It would have been operating in competition with the various businesses around the airport but under a totally different set of trading rules which, as I understand it, would have severely disadvantaged those shops and shopping centres outside of the airport. It did not proceed because of the community outrage. We were also given other examples of real concern. The minister has recognised this as a problem and once again he has been quite happy to make sure that there is consistency in what occurs with non&amp;hyphen;aeronautical activity on both sides of the fence, if you like.

With regard to the question of selling the remaining FAC airports, there has always been, I think, a fairly diverse view within the Australian Labor Party about the sale or leasing of airports. They are a very

        One thing that has always bothered me with regard to the FAC has been its investment strategy in so far as it has a very clear focus on the large airports and somewhat of a much lesser focus on what to do with the regional airports. I say that again in relation to my own state in particular. If I were of a view to support the leasing or the sale of those public assets, it would be on the basis that I thought that our airports in Tasmania could do much better under local ownership.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That brings me to this question of the local ownership. When we were in government, two community groups were set up, once the decision had been taken to lease the FAC airports. There was a concern about people in Tasmania not wanting those airports to fall under the control of private ownership—and for very good reason. So we in government agreed to a study taking place to allow the community to ascertain whether the local ownership or the local leasing of the airports by the local authorities would be or could be successful and whether or not the financial capacity of those airports would be such as to not be a financial drain on the community. In government we provided some $200,000 for that study to proceed. Mind you, I would have to say, the people that did the study, in my view, did not do a very good job and, in some respects, I think the money that was used was somewhat sadly wasted because we did have to proceed to get some further analysis done of exactly what the capacity of the airports might be.

And even more important than other benchmarks against which you are entitled to judge us, in three years time you will be entitled to judge us according to the benchmark of whether or not we have honoured commitments made to people and to the Australian nation before the 2nd of March because unless that stream of trust, that element of confidence, can be restored, then the whole respect of the community for the political process and for the process of government is going to further disintegrate.

        The community itself will not have the capacity to raise the necessary finance either to buy an airport or to compete against some other major bidders. In this legislation the government proposes allowing the clustering of airports so that somebody will be able to buy Melbourne airport and Hobart and Launceston airports. We propose an amendment to that which I hope the government members in this Senate from Tasmania will support.

An organisation did a survey of the Tasmanian experience which indicated there was a net economic benefit after three years to the government in the use of labour market programs, even though some of them were not as successful as others. No way will MATS work in my state.

         The sale of public assets imposes a heavy responsibility on the parliament. I have stood here on numerous occasions to oppose the privatisation of public monopolies. The reason for that is that I believe it is unfair to the public to have a situation where the privatised corporation is able to make money at the expense of those who rely on the services of that monopoly; in other words, the ability of such an organisation to make whatever money it likes.

        We are indeed trustees of the people's property and we are answerable to the people in the states who have put us here to use this property wisely. There are arguments that the private management of assets such as airports
        <break page="2850" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         may improve operational efficiency. However, it is important to remember, as I have pointed out previously in the Senate, that airports are in fact strategic natural monopolies. It is important that we do not sell off natural monopolies to anyone who is then left free to charge whatever the market will bear. To do that would be to legislate for a new breed of robber barons.

        Obviously, to give away natural monopolies with no system of regulation or control of pricing is the equivalent of tax farming—it is selling a licence to tax the travelling public for a lump sum fee. It is just like Tudor or Stewart Kings raising revenue by selling patents of monopoly or the French monarchy letting out tax farming contracts before the revolution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indirect taxes levied through the abuse of monopoly rights are among the worst of all taxes. More than once I have pointed out that there is an inherent conflict between the economic efficiency arguments for putting airports under private management and the revenue maximisation objectives of selling to the highest bidder.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I was pleased when the original objective of selling airports outright was abandoned in favour of a leasing system. At least that is something, although I am cautious about that. Actually I am inclined to vote against this particular measure for a number of reasons, which I will give later. At least it is better now that it is a leasing system. A leasing system allows the Commonwealth to impose by contract, as a condition of the lease, the incorporation of a regulatory and pricing oversight regime which can in theory at least limit abuse of monopoly power.

        I would like the government to consider what I say with respect to this matter.

        Given the figures that have been touted in the financial press as to the value of some of the airports—and it does appear that Tullamarine, for example, will be a real bottler—I am concerned that some bidders may be proceeding on the assumption that they will be allowed to charge the airlines and the travelling public what the market will bear. I would like to see any such notion firmly disabused.

However, others in this chamber seem to be more relaxed about this particular difficulty. Unless, therefore, there is support for pressing this question, I do not intend to delay the chamber by further discussing this matter, but I simply note that, for one, I find it unsatisfactory that a trustee of public assets could be expected to dispose of them without full information as to what they are worth. In principle, I think it is wrong, but I can do no more than state my view and hope that the parliamentary secretary responds.

In the current regime those airports are cross&amp;hyphen;subsidised by the FAC. I think, taking all things into consideration, Hobart is run at a loss of about half a million dollars a year. Obviously, the second tranche will affect that airport. I realise that the immediate matter relates to the first tranche, but we are dealing with a bill which has principles which will apply to the second tranche. That is one of the major reasons I am concerned about this particular measure.

It is obvious that the government and the opposition jointly are going to support the bill irrespective of what happens.

         Let me put it this way: if this particular measure results in a situation whereby the Launceston and Hobart airports are sold to the highest bidder, and that bidder then exploits the situation of Tasmanians and charges passenger and freight rates on the basis of what the market will bear, that is totally inappropriate, particularly in a situation of a state like Tasmania, which relies very heavily on travel across Bass Strait by air—whether it be business travel or private travel by people seeing their relations on the mainland, perhaps visiting sick relations, going to funerals or whatever.

Those witnesses put forward the belief of the Hobart Metropolitan Councils Association that the Commonwealth, in granting to a regionally representative group the lease over the Hobart airport, should ensure that the airport is transferred debt free, at no cost and with the provision of a one-off capital grant for essential maintenance and upgrading, under a similar form of ownership to the ALOP—that is, the aerodrome local ownership plan—and to a lessee which has no ownership interests in any other airport. The latter matter, of course, has been dealt with by the government.

         I was interested to see the responses or indications that were given by one of the representatives of the department before that hearing in respect of these matters. But they were only indications. Obviously, given the clauses in the bill, they could be no more than indications. I would like those indications to be set firm in concrete. In answer to a question of mine, the department did agree that the current ALOP arrangements in various airports, including those in Burnie and Devonport, were working quite well; in other words, the community organisations that operate those particular airports are going well and are managing those airports very well.

         What is important in Australia is both who manages these particular assets and how they manage them. It is clear that they are being managed well under the ALOP system. It is also important that they are provided with essential public services at the least possible cost, and that the travelling public are provided with these. It is particularly important in our state, given the Bass Strait situation, that the travelling public should be provided with the services at the least possible cost and not be exposed to the risk of monopoly gouging. No senator representing any state, certainly not an island state, can possibly accept any bill which exposes his or her constituents to the threat of commercial extortion on the grounds of geographical disadvantage.

         issue. Whilst many of his remarks could be commented on as being rather lukewarm and parochial, he did address the issue of how the government will deal with the sale of regional airports. The government has a philosophical commitment to an open tender process for the sale of airports. Anything less will raise the spectre of special deals for special groups. There will be no WA Inc. under this government.

        At the same time, we are obviously not unaware of the issues related to local ownership and we favour that as a matter of principle. How this will be put into practice is yet to be determined, but I can say that Alice Springs, Launceston and Hobart airports are the kinds of airport leases for which the government will want to consider how to ensure that the sale processes give life to that particular principle. Like Senator Collins, I would also acknowledge the development of Northern Territory airports by the Federal Airports Corporation but I would point out that the Howard government is a forward&amp;hyphen;looking government, not retrospective and not debt driven like the ALP.

        Senator Woodley decided to oppose the bills, and we regret that. His contribution in the debate here, by really regurgitating the comments of Senator Kernot, makes him into rather a pussycat of Senator Kernot and rather reflects the policies of 1950s Soviet Union. But Senator Woodley made a couple of points which are wrong and cannot go unanswered. With regard to competition between airports, we are, of course, going to do all we can to encourage competition. But that will in a direct sense only occur at the margin.

        I rise to speak on this report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australia&amp;hyphen;European Union trade and investment towards 2000
        </emphasis>
        for three reasons. Firstly, I would like to congratulate Ian Forsyth and Alex Brooking, the two DFAT officers who were principally responsible for the compilation of this report, and to acknowledge the work of Don Cuddihy and Geoffrey Leach, the major contributors to this report. I have worked with these officers previously and I must say Australia is flattered to have such competent officers as these. This is indeed a piece of valuable work that they have provided.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, I wish to take issue with the contention made by Minister Downer and Minister Fischer who are the joint authors of the foreword of this report. The contention is that somehow we have given less public attention to the needs of Australia&amp;hyphen;European Union trade over the last decade. I think it is acknowledged by the joint authors that yes, of course—and rightly—our interests in Asia have predominated in that period, but I do not think Australia has left Europe on the backburner over that period of time either.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As evidence, I cite the meeting between former Prime Minister Thatcher and former Prime Minister Hawke, setting up a joint relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom on trade, and the meeting between me as former Minister for Trade and the President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, from the UK side in following on that initiative. Many Australian companies see Britain as a jumping-off point for trade in Europe. There have been two-way trade delegations embracing France, Germany and Italy. Indeed, during the Uruguay Round negotiations a lot of attention was paid to the Australia&amp;hyphen;Europe relationship, albeit with agriculture overshadowing the entire debate as rightly it should.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My third and most important reason for rising today to speak on this report is that yesterday in the House of Representatives we had a budget brought down which undermines the very efficacy of this report and renders many of the recommendations of this report completely obsolete. This report is, of course,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         about how we promote trade and investment between Australia and Europe.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principal agency that the Commonwealth government retains for that work is Austrade. Austrade had its trade promotion budget cut yesterday by $100 million over three years. That is not a vote of confidence in Austrade's ability to capture the many and varied gains possible in Europe for Australian companies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But, more than that, the export market development grants scheme was cut by $340 million over four years in yesterday's budget. The chances for small and large Australian companies wanting to get into Europe to access export market development grants and use that support for market entry are vastly diminished. That is hardly a vote of confidence in Australian and European trade, or trade between Australia and any other country or bloc in the world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The international trade enhancement scheme, the ITE scheme, was cut by $120 million over four years—a total cut in support for Australian industry getting into foreign markets of $560 million over four years. That is not a vote of confidence by this government in market opportunity for Australian industry in Europe or anywhere else.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But, importantly, this report refers to Australia as an investment destination for European capital, and cites one of the key attractors of that investment as being our research and development regime. That is mentioned at some length on page 18 of this report. Might I say that the changes to R&amp;D, the reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, the ending of syndication, will undermine a lot of the R&amp;D that creates valuable products in this country. Australia will no longer be able to take its place in this trade, which will reduce its attractiveness accordingly. The investment promotion campaign, which has attracted so many regional headquarters, is abolished. European headquarters have come to Australia, in part, because of that campaign.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a valuable report. It makes valuable recommendations and suggestions about how we can improve our trade relationship with Europe, but the budget undermines everything
        <break page="2855" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that this report stands for. I think Ministers Downer and Fischer, who have prefaced this report with such encouraging remarks, should take responsibility and try to change those budget settings to give Australian exporters a chance in what is an important market and try to turn back the situation where we stop exporting commodities only, or in the majority, and start exporting more elaborately transformed manufactures. Rather than buy back all of the elaborately transformed manufactures from Europe, we should send some in their direction as well.

        This report, which has just been tabled, deals with various projects, both road and rail, developing around Australia to improve Australia's land transport infrastructure. Most of this infrastructure, particularly in rail, came from the One Nation project, which then Prime Minister Keating announced in early 1992. Road projects also received One Nation money.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The present government, when in opposition, and many economic commentators, used to keep saying that Australia could not afford the One Nation program. But I want to point out that the money invested at that time during the recession not only created employment but also significantly improved the land transport infrastructure of Australia. For example, in my home state of South Australia, the connection of Adelaide to the standard gauge railway is something we had been asking for for generations, but it was the Paul Keating One Nation statement that provided the money. Nobody criticises that project.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that in Melbourne the western ring&amp;hyphen;road is funded overwhelming by One Nation money, yet I notice that when various sections of it were opened, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, was quick to claim credit for some of the new phases of that significant infrastructure improvement for Victoria.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I draw the attention of the Senate and the public to this report because it outlines the commitment of the previous governments, the Hawke and the Keating governments, to improve the infrastructure of Australia. In the budget announced last night, we note the removal of funds for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway, which was a commitment we made in government, and the removal of money for the so-called black spots program. When we look at the aggregate cuts to state funding, this new federal budget has reduced money for roads in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reduction in road funding is a step backwards by the coalition government. I suspect that in the months ahead, as this parliament, and the Senate in particular through the estimates committees, has a chance to examine the actual expenditure on roads outlined in this budget, the people of regional and rural Australia will certainly see that they have been sold a pup in the development of roads and rail in Australia, but particularly roads.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This will be a major issue on which the opposition will campaign and expose the deceit of the new government in claiming that they have provided extra money for road development in Australia when, through their own budget process and the reduction of road funding to the states, they have significantly reduced road development in this country, which of course is an economic cost to the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Good infrastructure in roads and rail means that our productive industries can get their goods to port for export and industries can reduce their distribution costs accordingly. Also by improving and building better highways in Australia, we can reduce the awful road toll that Australia has suffered for so many years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend this report because it shows what the previous government had done to improve the land transport infrastructure of Australia. Unfortunately, the new government, in the budget announced last night, has gone a long way to reduce that infrastructure expenditure for some mad reason which is beyond us in the opposition.

That association has concerns about a mobile phone base station which is going to be located some 76 metres from the school boundary. It has forwarded a petition with in excess of 1,000 signatures to the House of Assembly, and tomorrow a petition with some 894 signatures will be presented on my behalf drawing the government's attention to that association's concerns.

        Of particular concern is the health risk associated with electromagnetic radiation. I might say, pardon the pun, that not enough energy has been put into this research. I am pleased to say that the government has established a committee of officials to examine electromagnetic energy and to advise on the adequacy of health exposure standards, compliance procedures, and national and international research findings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The committee includes representatives from the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Department of Health and Family Services, the Spectrum Management Agency, Austel, the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the CSIRO. This committee must also consult and provide information to the public.

         By remaining informed across the broad range of electromagnetic energy public health issues, the government ensures that it actions in this area are based on the best available national and international advice. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, in this particular case and in other cases there is widespread concern about the health impacts of EME, electromagnetic energy. Research from around the world has indicated that there could be problems, especially for children. Even our own CSIRO has published a report stating that research on biological effects and develop ment of safety standards always lags many years behind technological development.

        I believe that, before Telstra sites mobile phone base stations near our schools, more research needs to be done. The Australian standards need to be proved to be rigid enough to protect our children from exposure to radiofrequency energy. I urge the government to continue to fund this committee so that its important work can be done and that, one day, it could undertake or commission research specific to EME in Australia. I also urge the government to ensure that Telstra is unable to site these towers close to schools in the interim. Other less dangerous areas need to be found.

        In conclusion, I have written to the minister voicing the concerns of Loris Watchorn, who is a member of the mobile phone base station committee that was set up by the Lenah Valley School Association, which is so concerned about these problems. I hope that his answer will be forthcoming in the near future.

         —I rise to speak tonight on the issue of foreign aid announced in the budget last night. During the 13 years of the previous government and during the nearly 10 years I have been here Senator Hill has made consistent criticism, including when he was the coalition foreign affairs spokesman for many years in this place and in the wider community, about the Labor Party never being able to meet the 0.7 per cent of GDP for foreign aid, which was the United Nations standard for what developed countries should provide in overseas aid, or even being able to meet the Labor Party conference decision of a few years ago of four per cent of GDP by the latter part of this decade.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is true that we were never able to meet that figure. I think at one stage we got around 0.35 per cent. We were consistently berated by Senator Hill and by the now Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in the last year or so that we had failed to meet that United Nations obligation or even our own national conference commitment.
       </para>
       <break page="2857" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have to say that the coalition made good hay when the sun shined criticising us on that and going out to the aid groups in the community, which are widespread. There are well over 50 overseas aid organisations operating in Australia, raising their money themselves, getting money from the federal government through the aid budget and spending it efficiently overseas to help those people who are in less fortunate positions than Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last year Mr Downer made a commitment to aid agencies that he would abolish the DIFF program because it was not proper overseas aid. Some of the aid agencies responded that this would be a good move. I suspect that they were expecting that if DIFF were abolished the money would be transferred to either bilateral or multilateral aid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What happened on budget night was a disgraceful performance in view of all the words said in opposition by the spokespersons of the coalition. As a result of the cutbacks this year, Australia's overseas aid budget will be only 0.29 per cent of GDP, a drop of I think over 0.3 per cent in one budget. I cannot recollect it ever getting that low at any time we were in office for 13 years. I do not think the overseas target of the Malcolm Fraser coalition government, which was in office for seven years, was ever under 0.3 per cent of GDP. But Mr Howard and Mr Costello, in their first budget, have delivered massive cuts to overseas aid and dropped it below 0.3 per cent for the first time in anyone's memory.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a disgraceful performance. It is one that does this country no credit. It adds further to the bumbling incompetence of the foreign minister, who, in the short four to five months as minister, has become an international embarrassment to us. The handling of the cessation of the DIFF scheme alone has done more damage than any number of other episodes in Australia's recent foreign affairs relationships with countries in our region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee which dealt with the cessation of DIFF, representative after representative from the business community—who by no means could be called radical supporters of the Labor

          Party—gave awful examples of how our reputation overseas has been damaged by the foreign minister cancelling the DIFF program without any consultation with countries in the region, with whom we are supposed to have excellent relations. It will take a long time for us to recover from that.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Overall in this budget there is a 10 per cent reduction—straight down—in overseas aid. There has not been an evening out of outlays over the next few years—just a straight reduction of 10 per cent. Funding for population control as part of our aid money to the United Nations apparently has been abolished. This is an extraordinary cut to our overseas aid. It does no good to the reputation of Australia—a very large continent that is blessed with having a small population compared with countries to our north and other regions of the world where overpopulation, overcrowding, is the major social and economic issue they face.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are walking away from the modest funding we used to provide for population control programs—programs that were in no way coercive. They were developmental programs, educational programs, particularly to encourage women in poor circumstances, women who lack education, how they can control their own fertility so that they can make rational choices about the number of children they should bear.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There have been cutbacks to organisations that are associated with the trade union movement. In the mid-1980s the trade union movement in Australia accepted responsibility by establishing an aid program whereby they would provide some money. It was not as much as they would have liked, I suspect, but they made the principal commitment to fund overseas aid programs, particularly in the training area. That has all been abolished—I think because the coalition has some ideological view that the money involving the trade union is somehow perverted or being misused.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have seen the trade union training programs in such countries as Cambodia and Vietnam. On previous visits to those countries I have seen the beneficiaries—those who have had the training provided by those programs, such as learning English, trade training and so
         <break page="2858" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          on. These were excellent programs run by excellent young Australians and were funded in part by the trade union movement and by the overseas aid budget.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Not only in the multilateral aid area have substantial funding cuts been made but we also see them in the bilateral arrangements we have had. Countries such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines and India have all had massive reductions in the aid being provided to them. I do not know how Mr Downer, when he next meets with Asian countries, will explain the background to these massive cuts. I do not think those countries will take too kindly to the political expression that we had to fill a black hole in the budget. When they look at the size of our economy, the prosperity of our country, the fact that we have a First World economy with growth and a well trained and educated population and see that we do not suffer the appalling poverty that their countries do, they will consider our excuse that there was a black hole in the budget to be very weak indeed. We all know that with none of these cuts that deficit would have almost disappeared over the next three years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Downer will have an appalling problem trying to explain the background to these cuts. In view of his very awkward performance—that is the best way I can describe it, although `appalling' is a more apt way to describe it—in his first five months in the job, no-one could have any confidence that Mr Downer can explain to these countries the reasons for these savage cuts coming on top of the cessation of the DIFF program. Australia's reputation will be besmirched because we will be seen as becoming increasingly selfish and introverted in our relations with these countries.

         With these cuts we are saying that we are not concerned about what happens regarding development in Asia, that they are on their own even though we have the advantage of a decent standard of living and a First World economy—a stronger economy, an economy that in aggregate is still greater in size than most of the combined economies of South-East Asia. They will find it very difficult to see the justification for these very significant cuts, which run into over hundreds of millions

         My final comment is that I think at the last election some overseas aid agencies from Australia fell for the line by Mr Downer that basically there would not be any cuts. He would cut DIFF, but he left open the issue of money from that funding cut being transferred to direct aid. Every one of those overseas aid agencies was duded in the budget last night. It is to the eternal shame of the coalition that they have made these awful cuts to our overseas aid budget.

        The reason I have seen fit to speak on this issue tonight is that I very much see that this budget is not in accord with the general principle that our elderly, the older people in our community, not only are entitled to a particular regard but also should be looked after, particularly those people who, through maybe a difficult life or poor planning or some unanticipated event, find themselves in a situation where financially or personally they are unable to care for themselves.

        To some extent I was excited in my view or it became more obvious to me in the debate today in question time and from some of the statements made during question time. In relation to a very straightforward and I thought honest question from Senator Woodley, I was very concerned that the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services in the Senate, Senator Newman, seemed to be unable to give us some fairly essential information that is obviously of some great interest not only to the members of this chamber and those in the other place but also to a vast majority of elderly people and the families that care very much for them.

         I am sure everyone is aware that HACC services are the provision of care within people's homes. HACC provides for the frail, the elderly and what might be described as the young disabled. It has been a program that has had its ups and downs. Despite all of that, it has provided a great deal of benefit to the individuals who have been assisted and who have been able in some circumstances to remain independent and to enjoy the lifestyle of an independent resident, but at the same time have the support necessary from the community services to allow them to remain at home where otherwise they might not be able to.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This care can cover a range of things—from personal hygiene to maybe help with medication or the organisation of lifestyle to deal with a particular medical problem. It also has, by a happy coincidence, a financial benefit for the community at large in that it is obviously much more efficient to have someone at home still maintaining an independent lifestyle than to have them slotted into a hostel or a nursing home and having to rely entirely on the public purse. So, all round, it is a program that people derive a great deal of benefit from and something that I have been a big supporter of.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having a brief look through Budget Paper No. 1, page 3&amp;hyphen;109, what distresses me in relation to HACC is a fairly brief line item, as they all are, which says, `Increase user charging in the Home and Community Care Programme.' If you have a look at that, you see that in this first year it is a saving of $4 million, next year it is a saving of $12.7 million and in the third year it is a saving of $19.6 million. When you look at the bare figures like that, it does not seem to mean a lot. But when you translate that into a number of people who for many years have relied on HACC to help support them you see that there are going to be a lot of elderly people in particular out there who will not be provided with the support that I think they are entitled to. That is a very sad part of the budget.

         In relation to the deceit of elderly people, that is not where the bad news ends. Nursing homes have taken a bit of a beating, as it were, as well. There are a couple of fees that are pretty up&amp;hyphen;front that have been introduced in the budget. One is the nursing home entry fees. Any reference to the nursing home entry fees is pretty scarce. I have spoken to a number of people in the industry and they are unclear about how that exactly is going to operate. In fact, even though they have sought further detail from the Minister for Health and Family Services, Michael Wooldridge, they have been unable to get the information they need to make an assessment about how it will operate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Essentially what has been said is that, on a means tested basis, people will be charged entry when they go into a nursing home. If you extrapolate the average cost of an entry fee into hostels, you find that it is $26,000. Obviously the average figure paid as an entry fee into hostels does not necessarily translate into what is payable on entry to a nursing home. But, being the most comparable situation, it is probably reasonable to assume that $26,000, which is the average amount payable in hostels, is not so far from what might on average be payable in nursing homes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The greatest concern is that $26,000 is the average fee that might be payable. In fact, the scope of the policies allows for as high as $88,000 to be payable. That is the limit. That is the greatest amount that anyone can pay. But a lot of people out there—

          —A lot of elderly people and a lot of people who care about them and look after them, their families, might think that $88,000 is a bit steep. Certainly I share that view. The sad thing about it is that not only is this entry fee now going to be charged, but also at the same time the loan moneys that are provided for capital works in nursing homes has been abolished. So the
          <break page="2860" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           contribution that the federal government has made to date towards providing funds for capital construction in nursing homes is at the same time being taken away. Again that is a very sad thing for the elderly in our community and I am sure the people in the coalition who care about the elderly will have something to say about it.

         That means that, because the entry fee is also means tested, those nursing homes that take on a lot of people in lower income groups and are not able to claim the entry fee will also be missing what has been traditionally provided through loans, which is a source of funds for capital works. That will skew the whole system so that nursing homes will be encouraged to take on people who are capable of paying high entry fees in order to continue with their capital works. Again it means that the elderly in our community who are not well off, who through some accident of their life or circumstances cannot look after themselves financially, will find it more difficult to find a place as they become more physically frail.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not the end of the bad news in this budget for the elderly. Nursing home fees will be $34 per day, $12,000 a year—another initiative of this budget that does not care about the elderly. That fee is payable for anyone who goes beyond the pension-free area, which I understand is pension plus approximately $30, but I have to say that from the material that has been provided by the minister, it is not exactly clear.

         How have the elderly been treated in terms of health? Not very well either. Again, the less well off are those who suffer the most. The dental health care program was introduced by the federal government to top up state funding. We had an appalling situation where people were waiting 24 months, two years, to get dental treatment; that is pensioners, those people that we should be look looking after and people on health cards. If you have difficulty with your teeth, it is not much help if you are waiting 24 months. The solution in those circumstances was that teeth were not being saved. It took too much time, was too complicated if people had difficulty with their teeth. You could not perform
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          complicated procedures that were going to save those teeth; you pulled them out. Teeth were extracted. It is very difficult to believe—

        I want to speak tonight on a couple of topics. The first is on a matter that you yourself raised this morning; that is, the going from this place of Mr Alan Platt, who has been in charge of this chamber for over a decade now. He represents, I think, all the best that there is about this place, about the people who make the place run, who make the functioning of the Senate and of the House of Representatives and of the place generally of the high standard that it is. I think it is proper that we recognise him.

          up&amp;hyphen;front payment, which is rebatable under certain rules—a certain amount comes back to the individual or to their estate—when you go into a hostel, depending on your means, and you do not when you go into a nursing home. Many institutions would tell me that they could not see the logic in it and that that was one way that we could address it: that people would share that cost and that people going into nursing homes would be assessed.

         Senator Neal perpetuated the furphy that has been going around in the last 24 hours—she did not actually say it but she almost implied it, and I listened carefully—that people will be charged $26,000. They will not be charged on average $26,000. I think—and stand to be corrected; Senator Knowles will correct me if I am not right—that 30 per cent of people make no ingoing payment to hostels now. And it will not change for nursing homes. If a person does not have the money, they will not be charged an ingoing payment and they will pay 87.5 per cent of the pension. There will be very strict rules about the number of people who are financially disadvantaged, which each nursing home and hostel will be required to take.

         But we have to find funds from somewhere and if the current generation of older, able people does not contribute, we will leave a debt problem for the next generation when the baby boomers come on stream for nursing home care. We might all think it will not happen to us, but it will be my age group in 20 years time who will need to have that in place. We need to get it right now, and that is what we are doing.

         Senator Neal also spoke about HACC. I do not know how she reads the budget papers but, for the benefit of those people listening tonight, the facts are that HACC funding will rise by approximately six per cent—I think, $28 million. Senator Neal claimed that Senator Newman did not answer the question. If she had listened carefully she would have heard Senator Newman say that she thought that Senator Woodley had asked a question about aged care but in fact had asked about HACC. When she realised that, she then answered that there will be a six per cent increase.

          Tomorrow I will look at what Senator Neal said to make sure she did not actually mislead the Senate. When I have done that, I will come back into the chamber. I want to put on the record that there will be a six per cent increase in home and community care funding for older people and for people with disabilities et cetera, who require some care to maintain themselves at home—maybe Meals on Wheels or having a bar put in beside the shower so they can get in and out of the bath and those sorts of facilities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In her answer to a question, Senator Newman pointed out that HACC has grown like Topsy and there is some inequity in the way different states treat the delivery of HACC. I think all senators in this chamber would agree that it should not depend on whether you live in Queensland, Tasmania or Victoria as to whether you get an equal share of the HACC funding, and that you should be treated in the same way.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Minister Moylan is therefore ensuring that the policy will be fair and that HACC clients will be treated consistently across Australia. I should have thought that that was something the Australian Labor Party would have welcomed, but they did nothing when HACC was in a mess with people falling between stools. The minister is increasing funding and trying to address some of the inequities in the HACC system. But Senator Neal disregards that and goes on as if it is all doom and gloom.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Senator Neal did not tell those people who are listening that the pension has now been indexed at 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. That indexation is now built into forward estimates, which has never happened before. But the government has made that commitment so that older Australians do not have to worry about their pension being indexed. She did not add that the older Australians who are self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees, many of whom are on fixed superannuation and who have been living in genteel poverty under Labor, are the sorts of people that Labor claimed they looked after; but they are the sorts of people who deserted them in the election because Labor lost sight of them.

           Over and over again many of those older people have come to me and said, `It seems unfair to us that we are treated differently from pensioners on the same income with regard to tax&amp;hyphen;free thresholds.' That has been addressed: those people on the same income as pensioners will have a tax break in that their tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold will rise. We did not hear about that.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Another issue which has concerned people in the aged care industry is respite care. We did not hear Senator Neal say that there will be an increase in funding for respite care. Nor did we hear her say that never, in the 13 years of Labor, was there an acknowledgment of an increased cost in caring for people with dementia in nursing homes and hostels. That will be factored into a new funding regime which will take into account the fact that people with dementia need more care than ambulant, frail, older people. An enormous leap forward for the aged care sector. Senator Neal omitted to tell the good news about the budget.

       The Minister for Veterans' Affairs acknowledges the findings of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences in the United States.

       2) There are differences between the legislative requirements governing the provision of veterans benefits in USA and Australia.

       This project would involve the acquisition of Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft. It is currently planned that an initial design stage of the project would commence by about 1997 and that the last aircraft would enter operational service by about 2003. If agreed, the acquisition of these aircraft would enhance Australia's air defence by providing microwave radar coverage for effective detection, identification and tracking of air targets, and close control of interceptors/fighters, complementing the Jindalee Operational Radar Network, which will have an effective broad area surveillance capability but not the same quality of tracking and control information.

       This project would involve the acquisition of Offshore Patrol Combatants (OPCs) to replace the current fleet of Fremantle Class Patrol Boats. It is currently planned that the acquisition process would commence in about 1997 and that it would conclude with the commissioning of the last vessel in about 2006. If agreed, acquisition of OPCs would provide coastal surveillance, patrol and response within Australian waters. Being larger than the Fremantles that they would replace, OPCs would have better seakeeping thereby making them a more effective patrol vessel.

       This project would involve the acquisition of helicopters for surveillance, reconnaissance, troop movement and fire support for the Army. The capability would consist of either a common platform or a mix of utility and armed reconnaissance helicopters. It is currently planned that preliminary definition studies would commence in about 1997 and that the final aircraft would enter operational service in about 2006. If agreed, the acquisition of this capability would provide enhanced mobility for ground troops, aerial reconnaissance, and highly flexible fire support and engagement of targets in widely dispersed and remote locations, thereby enhancing our ability to interdict hostile forces on Australian territory.

       This project would involve the acquisition of a ground based Air Defence Weapon System to replace the aging Rapier system. It is currently planned that procurement would commence in about 2000 and that the project would be completed by about 2004.

It is currently planned that the first major upgrade would commence in about 1997 and that the last upgraded aircraft would return to operational service by about 2003. F/A&amp;hyphen;18 aircraft play a key role in maintaining the ADF's capability to intercept and defeat hostile aircraft and missiles.

      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) I am aware of a debate in the United States (US) Senate on 4 August 1995 concerning an amount of US$50 million authorised for preparation for hydronuclear testing in the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 fiscal year Defense Authorisation Bill. In the event, however, these funds were not called on by the US Administration following its declaration of support on 11 August 1995 for a zero&amp;hyphen;threshold Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The US has explicitly stated that its support for a "true zero&amp;hyphen;yield" CTBT precludes the conducting of hydronuclear tests.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       However, it is worth clarifying, for the purpose of answering the honourable senator's questions, that the types of activities which the United States has foreshadowed for its Nevada test site are known as hydrodynamic or subcritical experiments. Unlike hydronuclear tests, such experiments do not produce a nuclear explosive yield and are consistent with a zero&amp;hyphen;yield CTBT.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       (2) (a) Australia, as a non&amp;hyphen;nuclear weapon state, does not have access to the details of nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship techniques.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Hydronuclear, hydrodynamic, subcritical and `virtual' (I take this to be a reference to computer

        simulation) procedures could each contribute to ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons as well as to making minor modifications to existing weapon systems. It is my understanding, however, that none of these would enable the development of new generations of nuclear weapon systems. Hydronuclear tests will be banned under a CTBT.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       (b) Because hydronuclear tests produce some (usually very small) nuclear explosive yield, any party to a CTBT would be in violation if they conducted such a test. The other types of procedures referred to above would be consistent with a true zero&amp;hyphen;yield CTBT.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       (3) No. The Australian Government recognises that, in conducting subcritical experiments, the US is not acting inconsistently with its commitment—which we have welcomed—to the earliest conclusion of a true zero&amp;hyphen;yield CTBT. The Government will continue to work with the US and others on a practical and realistic approach to nuclear disarmament.
