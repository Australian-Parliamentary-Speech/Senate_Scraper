         The facts of the matter are this. Irrespective of privatisation, there is already legislation in place—which will not alter if and when the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill goes through—that imposes and maintains the universal service obligations. That ensures that, to the extent that services to rural and remote areas are uneconomic, the cost is borne by all of the carriers. In other words, they contribute to a universal service levy, and they will pay pro rata on their revenue—currently, it is on market share.

         Let there be no misunderstanding. Those arrangements will continue to apply irrespective of privatisation—just as they do in America, which has always had privately owned carriers. Indeed, at the conference of APEC telecommunications ministers last week, one of the three major agenda items was how they could extend the concept of universal service obligations.

        Labor's rampant bankcard spending spree was bad enough. Then they tried to hide the bill. Now they are trying to add another $18 billion over the next four years to that bankcard bill which, on their leaving office, was no less than $100 billion. That is not a bill that the coalition government wanted to have to pay. Labor's bill should never have

        The effect of Labor's proposals would be to increase interest rates above what they otherwise would be. We know that Australians want and need lower interest rates. Lower interest rates are good for home buyers and they are good for small business. They also mean more investment, more growth and more jobs and hope for the unemployed—the thousands upon thousands of people ignored so terribly by Labor in government. So the opposition's sabotage does threaten Australia with higher interest rates.

        Since the budget, home fixed loan rates have fallen. For example, the Commonwealth Bank has cut its three&amp;hyphen;year fixed loan rate from 9.5 to 8.7 per cent and other banks have followed suit. This budget is a very fair budget and it is a very responsible budget. It is an honest budget. It is a budget of integrity and we have no intention of letting the opposition sabotage it.

I refer to the government's budget decision to force people over 55 to use up their superannuation savings before qualifying for a social security payment. The minister is reported as saying that groups such as superannuants should not be allowed to raid the public purse. Is it not true that the group who will lose most from this change in policy will be those people receiving a disability support pension? Will the minister confirm that in the next financial year the government will, by virtue of this change, save over $40 million from disability support pensioners? Is this not a false economy as the government will eventually be required to pay these people higher levels of age pension? Is it the minister's view that these disabled people have up until now been one of the groups raiding the public purse?

         —I thank Senator Woodley for his question. The situation is, in regard to the new measure proposed in the budget for the over 55s, that there has been an enormous scare campaign run around Australia. I am not suggesting particularly that Senator Woodley is responsible for this, but some members of the opposition have had their fingers all over it. It concerns me very much that people are being frightened in a very cruel way—in a similar way, in fact, to what happened before the budget was released.

        Senator Woodley is particularly concerned about the implications of the new measures for disability support pensioners. No matter who you are, whatever allowance or pension you are on, you are not going to be expected by the government to waste away your capital. That seems to me something which, in all the reporting of this issue, has not been clearly spelled out.

         We have said that in this, as in other areas, as a matter of principle, people who have assets should be expected to make use of them before they call on the taxpayer for support. Most Australians do not believe that to be unfair. If somebody is over 55 and has been out of the work force for nine months, then we should look to including their superannuation entitlements in the means test, as has happened with the age pensioners. That has been the case with anybody over 65. As Daryl Dixon has pointed out, there has been essentially an anomaly for some time. Financial advisers have been telling people what to do. Some people on various entitlements have had quite substantial assets in superannuation but have not had to have them counted for means test purposes.

        We should be able to say to young Australians that into their hands we have put a land of opportunity, a land where they can get appropriate training, a land where they can expect to get a job—not any job but a good job; a real job—and a land where they can make a career choice on what they want to be, not simply on the basis of where they think they can get a job. That is the reason that we are committed to getting the budget back into the black.

        Those on the opposite side—the big spenders over there—thought that they could just spend, spend, spend, put it all on the bankcard, because they are not the people who would have to pay the debt. They wanted to saddle young Australians with a massive debt. They wanted to rob young Australians of the future opportunities that they deserve.

        The last five years of Labor government were characterised by a dependency on debt and deficit. General government debt increased from $17 billion in 1990 to $96 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. The previous government's short&amp;hyphen;term spending spree was a very cruel hoax played out on young Australians.

        If there had not been an adjustment—if we do not get the adjustments we need in this budget—general government debt would have increased to $120 billion by the year 2000, an increase of over 600 per cent in just on 10 years. Senators opposite do not like to hear this, because they understand that it is the future generations of young Australians who will be landed with this debt—not the people over there but future generations of young Australians.

        So, yes, it is true that into their hands we do put a land of great opportunity. But, sadly, the former government put on their shoulders a very heavy burden—a burden of enormous government debt, a burden of fiscal irresponsibility and a burden of high unemployment. That is what senators opposite, when they were in government, did for young Australians. They created this problem. And for young Australians, we are prepared to fix it.

         This year's budget requires 7.5 per cent of all outlays to meet the debt that was accumulated by Labor. In dollar terms, that is $10 billion—$10 billion going to pay interest that could have gone into other things. This government is prepared to make the tough decisions to ensure that our young Australians have a very positive future to look forward to. We will not walk away from the responsibility and we will not rack up debt like the previous government did. Our strategy will reduce the underlying deficit by about $7.2 billion over two years to balance the budget over the term of this parliament. In fact, senators opposite—the previous government, in fact—go further. They actually oppose $19 billion worth of proposals over four years.

        Senator West, you may not appreciate this: do you know that only 15 per cent of Australians get the opportunity to go into higher education? The remaining 85 per cent are not unhappy about contributing to the bill. Of course they are not. But they do think it is fair enough that the 15 per cent of Australians who have had that chance, and continue to have it, make a higher contribution. Fortunately, that percentage is changing. As you probably do know, 25 per cent of school leavers now get an opportunity to go into higher education. But let me remind you, Senator West, that they are the lucky ones. They get a degree—an internationally portable document recognising their skills.

        Madam President, as you may understand, kids who do not get that chance and opportunity, the remaining 75 per cent, do not get an internationally portable document recognising their skills. They do not end up with half the unemployment rate that others end up with. They are not the upper, middle and high income earners of tomorrow, as university students are. It is not unreasonable to ask university students when they start earning—not before—to pay back more quickly; to start paying back when they earn $20,700; to pay back a movie ticket a week.

The trend to find a better balance—paying the costs of maintaining in particular, in this instance, conservation values—between the specific users of the parks and the community as a whole is taking place not only throughout Australian state and federal governments but also internationally.

        We made a decision in the lead-up to this budget that there ought to be a better balance in relation to that proportion paid by the users of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Therefore, we proposed an extra $5 fee on the users to be collected in the way that the previous Labor government had set down and enacted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question was: what information base did we take that decision on. We took it upon the information base provided by the authorities. We obviously made our own assessment as to what might be the consequences of that and we decided that, in the circumstances, it was reasonable. You will be aware that a $6 fee upon users of the Great Barrier Reef is considerably less than the fee that we charge users of several other of our major national parks.

          have been described as very emotive claims of sexual abuse—I am not saying you are making that claim, Senator Harradine—regarding her situation but those claims have, in turn, been refuted by Ms Xhang herself. Ms Marion Le, who is Ms Xhang's migration agent, claims in her press release dated 29 August that Ms Xhang has been subjected to abuse while in the care of the department at its detention centres in Western Australia and at Villawood.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I am advised that Ms Xhang recently met with a departmental officer and, in the presence of Ms Le, Ms Xhang denied the allegations of abuse. Indeed, on the contrary, Ms Xhang stated that she had had no problems with the staff or officers at the detention centres in Western Australia or at Villawood. Ms Le also claims that Ms Xhang's treatment has been `disgraceful and would not be tolerated for an animal'. In fact, Ms Xhang's accommodation arrangements and care have, I am advised, been very carefully considered by the department to take account of her particular circumstances. She has received constant and ongoing medical attention, including access to a range of specialist nurses who have provided, at times, 24&amp;hyphen;hour care, and also social welfare.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to the point made in Ms Le's press release, it appears that some of those claims are not correct. I understand she has now pursued the various review processes available to her, but I will get you a fuller report on that and come back to you as soon as possible.

       <para first-indent="16">
        More generally, in relation to claims of sexual abuse that have been made from time to time in similar circumstances, I am advised no claims of sexual abuse have been substantiated. Any incidents of physical abuse are dealt with by management or are reported to the police. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs takes its duty of care to detainees very seriously, especially in the case of unaccompanied women and minors. All detainees have access to centre management, and nursing and welfare staff at all times. Interpreters are always available and all unaccompanied minors are given special attention and care. Where possible, alternative

       <para first-indent="16">
        In the case of adults and within the constraints of a detention environment, the department does not interfere in matters involving choice of life preferences, unless those choices contravene Australian law. Through you, Madam President, to Senator Harradine, I will follow up on the final question as to where the review process lies with Ms Xhang, but it does appear that Ms Le's press release on this is sadly astray.

This matter is most important for the Senate, that is to say, the human rights of individuals. I believe what Senator Short has said is the departmental patter. Madam President, what I want to know is, following Senator Short's response, does he think it is appropriate to lock up, in isolation, a 16&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old girl with 61 men? If he does think that, I would like to see him justify it. She was locked up with 61 men along with six other women and young girls.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to a question without notice asked by Senator Woodley today, relating to the eligibility of people over 55 years old to receive social security payments.

       <para>
        I refer to the answer given to me this afternoon by Senator Newman. The information she gave was useful but there were a number of questions which I think were far more pertinent, which she did not answer. I believe that, in giving the answer, particularly in relationship to a couple of questions that I asked yesterday, the answer I received today must have some doubt cast over it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the questions that I asked was: would the minister confirm that, in the next financial year, the government will save over $40 million from disability support pensioners? I really have difficulty reconciling the answer that Senator Newman gave that the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         reason the government is pursuing this issue is that those who are seeking advice of financial advisers are then able to rearrange their affairs to unjustly get themselves a pension. I have the information that, in terms of disability support pensioners, this is not the situation. In fact, many of these will be caught perhaps unintentionally by the government's action and will suffer greatly from this measure.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, the other problem in this whole issue that the government needs to address is the problem of the disincentive that this will be for people to put money away for their retirement. It seems to me that the government is trying to have it two ways. It is trying to protect, as it says, the public purse but, in fact, what it will do is make worse the problem we have at the moment of trying to enable people to fund their own retirement. The government can have it one way or it can have it the other, but it cannot have it both ways.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other reason that I have problems with Senator Newman's answer is that yesterday she said she did not know whether or not 600,000 people were suffering as a result of the measure I referred to yesterday. In fact, those were the figures given in the budget papers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With regard to the other issue I raised about pensioners who were unable to access the five per cent pension deeming accounts with banks, I checked with all the major banks and discovered that the National Bank and Westpac do limit the offer of five per cent interest to age pensioners. The Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of Queensland are a little more expansive, and it is only the ANZ which offers five per cent to all low income accounts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think the real problem that people are having with the government's actions in this regard is that, whether intentionally or not, the government is penalising people who have very little ability to cope with the extra burden which the government is placing upon them through its actions.

         (3.16 p.m.)—Senator Woodley addressed two questions rather than the one he asked me today. I have arranged for a very detailed answer to the question he asked me yesterday. He will find when he receives it that, with regard to the assessment he made about the number of banks providing low level accounts with deeming arrangements, the number is greater than he thought. It is correct that there are some financial institutions which are not providing them to people in receipt of allowances. In fact, that is their rule; it is not the rule of the government. The government expects them to provide it to pensioners and those in receipt of allowances.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Turning to the question of superannuation and disability support pensioners, which he referred to in his question today, I think it is important to quickly go over some of the things I mentioned in my answer. Superannuation assets are to be treated just like any other financial investment for those who are over 55 but below age pension age. Once people turn 55 and retire, they can access their superannuation in most cases and we can protect those who cannot access their superannuation. People will only be affected once they have been in receipt of a benefit for at least nine months. There will be little effect on those with small amounts of super. If you are a pensioner couple with your own home, $78,000 in super and no other financial assets, your pension will not be affected. A single disability support pensioner could have up to $45,000 in total financial investments, including super, and still not be affected.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said in my answer, Jenny Macklin, on Friday, 30 August, put out a press release suggesting that the average amount held in a super account is $38,000. Therefore, most people will not be affected. For those with larger superannuation assets who are affected, the income they generate from their superannuation will more than compensate for the loss of allowance and pension, because their super capital will continue to grow. That is something which has not been well understood. They are not being required to waste away their capital. They are expected to make use of what income is available to them before they take on the totality of a pension
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         or an allowance. Therefore, just like any other asset in the assets test, they have to look at what they are potentially in receipt of and then their entitlement is determined on that basis. But that does not mean they are eating into their capital.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is a shame, but I understand the complexity of this issue. It may well be that that has been Senator Woodley's problem. I have got one other example here: for a pensioner couple with $56,000 in superannuation, a house valued at $200,000, other assets of $50,000, and $20,000 in the bank producing interest, there is no reduction in pension.

Of course, prior to this budget super assets held by people over the age of 55 who lost their jobs or who could not work because of sickness or disability were exempt from the income and assets test on social security payments. This encouraged those people to preserve their super—usually, of course, super in small amounts. They could preserve their super until they reached pension age. That was the situation. They got the most out of their superannuation and maximised their income once they reached retiring age.

They would also need more than $176,000 in assets, other than their home, to be affected under the assets test.

        It would seem to me that many people out in the community would say, `I think that is reasonable. If they have that level of assets, maybe they should be contributing in some way to their own support and not be calling on the taxpayer.' If you go across the country and look at all the demands that are being placed on taxpayers' funds, we have to agree that we have to take a fair share.

        We have tried to protect those on low incomes and to actually look at those who have in fact had a tax benefit through the superannuation scheme. It is a fair system. To have the Labor people on the other side saying that people will have to deplete all their superannuation is a nonsense. It is a furphy. It is misleading the Australian public and scaring older people, which I find despicable.

         —The underlying issue in this whole debate is that the Labor Party and the Democrats still cannot grapple with the fact that this budget has been so overwhelmingly accepted by the Australian people. That is the thing that disappoints them; that is the thing that really gets to them. It narks them.
        </para>

       <para first-indent="16">
        So what do they do? They try to pick on very small bits and pieces in the budget, misrepresent them to the electorate, set up a straw man to knock it down. That is what the Labor Party and the Democrats have set out to do because Mr Costello and our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) put together an excellent budget which has got the overwhelming support of the Australian people.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Sure, it inflicts some substantial cuts. Why does it have to inflict those substantial cuts? Because of the overspending of the previous government. We were left with a legacy that has to be cleaned up and the Australian people understand that. They accept that we were left with a mess and that we have taken on the responsibility of cleaning up that mess.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is for that reason that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Evans, admitted in one of those rare insights he gives into himself that he was suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome. The reason is that he is trying to scare people about the budget and he is failing; they are not listening to him. And why aren't they listening to him? Because they did not listen to him and his party before the last federal election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         And why don't the people of Australia listen to the Australian Labor Party? I don't have to quote myself. I can quote Gary Gray, the federal secretary, who came down with a report, ably assisted by Senator Sue Mackay. What did they say about the Labor Party? `When we promised something, the people of Australia would not believe us. We had broken so many promises that basically we were on the nose and, no matter what we said, the people of Australia would not believe us.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, instead of changing their attitude to policy and government actions, they are continuing the same old line. `We will misrepresent, we will say that black is white, we will try anything to regain government.' They have not learnt the simple lesson: the people of Australia want some integrity back in the political debate. It is not good enough simply to say, `We will accept all the good things in a budget, but we will try to block some of those harsher things.' The people of Australia have seen the broad picture. They realise that we were left with a mess and that it needs to be fixed up. We have committed ourselves to cleaning up that mess.

         That is why the Labor Party are having problems gaining some relevancy within the Australian body politic today. By nitpicking at our excellent budget, a budget which has been so overwhelmingly received, they will ensure that they remain in opposition. It is somewhat ironic that I should be speaking against the Labor Party in this brief debate because, quite frankly, the more they and the Democrats, and anybody else who cares to join them, nitpick on this budget, it will ensure that those people who do so will remain in opposition and we will remain the government. The bottom line is: this budget has been an excellent budget well received by the Australian people. I am sure it will be supported ultimately by this place but, if not, ultimately by the people of Australia.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator West today, relating to comments made by Senator Vanstone on student reaction to changes in funding for higher education.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) indicated that she felt that the changes to education would produce a better system of higher education in this country. The reality is that what she has been saying outside this place is that those who complain about these changes are the `ugly face of self-interest'. She defined the students who were protesting as `little brutes squealing like stuck pigs'.

       <break page="3128" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality of all this is that the minister is introducing a new system of distribution for higher education which allocates university places according to wealth rather than merit. That is the impact of the changes that this government is proposing to force through this Senate. That is the impact of their changes which have seen in excess of $500 million taken away from student assistance. In terms of Austudy and in terms of changes to the HECS scheme we have seen money coming out to the tune of $241 million. In terms of the operating grants to universities, quite massive changes are occurring in those universities, which sees a fundamental shift in the way in which education is allocated in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Massive equity problems are being introduced by this government as a consequence of their action. What we are seeing, in effect, is a new regime being placed on this country in terms of higher education which would see wealthy students effectively being able to purchase their tertiary qualifications. What that does for equity and the long-term economic position of this country, where we see the `rich and thick' being able to secure their place at university on the basis of their wealth rather than their ability, to my mind is truly appalling.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are seeing a whole range of measures being taken, allegedly on the basis of equity, whereby the minister says that she will reduce the number of places available for students in this country on the basis of government funding and will replace them by allowing people with money to buy an education.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What those changes have meant in the case of Victoria is some 4,090 fewer places in my state alone in this budget. They will be made up under this proposal to allow for people to maintain their place in a university by buying a place. That is the effect of the changes that she is seeking to introduce to this parliament—to allow Australians undertaking award courses to buy a place at a university. This is an appalling change which reflects this government's basic philosophy—if you have money, you get on and if you are well connected, you get on.

          We are basically moving away from a situation where all Australians should have the right to enjoy the benefits of an education system to a situation where the rights will be restricted to those who essentially can afford them. That is a change which this country can well do without and it is a change which I trust this Senate will have a lot to say about and will prevent this government from proceeding with.

All Australian males unnecessarily must suffer the pain and discomfort, (and the price) which both would be alleviated if Rocaltrol was available to males.

        It is urgent that Australia should condemn the United States' offensive against Iraq on 4 and 5 September on the basis of its unilateral action of violence without the support of the UN or even regional allies.

Catherine Job asked what sort of time frame was being looked at, and said, `So we are looking at months, a year, three years, a whole term before your policies do what you say they will do and start pulling unemployment down?' What does Amanda Vanstone say? She says, `Well, I don't really think there is much benefit for anybody, especially for the unemployed.' Is she nominating one month, two months, six months, 12 months or 18 months? How wrong can she be? If you are unemployed, you want to know when your job prospects are going to increase. But, for Amanda Vanstone, she does not care. There is not much benefit for anybody.

        She does not care about when the unemployment rate is going to go down or about how much it will go down by. When asked, `Is it going to get better, Senator, before it gets worse?', she said, `That is another futile question, with the greatest of respect.' It goes on.

        This is one of the reasons why we have raised this matter of public importance today. Another one is that, despite presiding over a budget that will increase unemployment, despite bringing forward estimates that will mean much higher unemployment than would have occurred in our economy, this minister's response, this government's response, is to not cater for unemployment, to not try to accommodate it, to not try to train or re&amp;hyphen;skill the people involved, but to massively cut back on critical programs and to massively cut back on the structures—the CES or otherwise—that are so critical for people seeking employment. This is a government with no new ideas but with old prejudices, and that is what has driven their agenda in this case.

        A commitment in this area has to be of two basic characteristics, and that was a commitment that was shown by the previous federal government. Our concern for the jobless was, and continues to be, a genuine commitment. There needs to be the commitment, and we allocated significant energy and resources to the problem. And we did get results: over 700,000 new jobs in three years, which was something that the coalition said that we could never do, and real improvements in the rate of long&amp;hyphen;term unemployment—a cut by some 35 per cent over three years of Working Nation. In fact, unemployment over that three&amp;hyphen;year period of Working Nation went down from 11.7 per cent to 8.1 per cent—well towards achieving our target of five per cent by the year 2000.

        There are two fundamentals in tackling unemployment. You have to have a goal and you have to have a genuine commitment, and this government has neither. Why not? Because the government is not concerned. It is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of secondary importance to them. It is of secondary importance to the extent that Peter Costello wanted to write it out of the Reserve Bank charter. The unemployed in this budget are being treated in the same way as the Aboriginal people, the elderly, migrants and all others who have been targeted by a malicious budget of this sort. Unemployment is of no real concern to the government.

        There is one central and disturbing reason for the government not setting targets and not showing a degree of concern. As was evidenced quite clearly in question time today, Senator Vanstone has indicated that some of the distortions that she has been putting out in the media in recent days have been not well based.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The big, fundamental situation was that Senator Vanstone has tried to portray unemployment as being about 8.5 per cent or thereabouts under the previous government's policies and strategies. But it was quite clear from the question and the answer today that she had been advised, on taking office, that unemployment was to go down to five per cent during the course of the next few years up to the year 2000.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Vanstone herself has also acknowledged that unemployment is more likely to rise than decrease. What sort of government is it which comes in with a commitment to reduce unemployment but, within just weeks of taking office, sheds that very fundamental and poor promise? Are the unemployed not of a core concern to you, Senator Vanstone? Are the unemployed not of a core concern to the government? It is quite clear that they are not.

She said that, really, she was not concerned about that. She was concerned about getting competition.

        The government, in its approach—as I say, serial slashing in this area—has seen fit to do away with the programs because they have a conservative approach to unemployment. First of all, it is not a major concern—not a core concern. Secondly, it is going to have to happen if we are going to get other aspects like inflation right. And, thirdly, the government has no role in supporting those who may be the victims of their policies.

The poor will always be with us.' That is the sort of disregard this minister is showing to this particular sector. The minister has no real understanding of the economic issues. That is matched by no real commitment in terms of training and employment programs and matched by no real sensitivity to those who are the victims, and will be the victims, of her disregard and neglect in this area. No wonder she is increasingly being called the Marie Antoinette of this government.

         —I am somewhat amazed that Senator Bolkus would have the sheer front to bring on a matter such as this, particularly when I look and see the previous government's record on unemployment. We must understand that the people opposite were in government for some 13 years. I think Senator Bolkus was there for all of those years. For a good many of them he was a minister and, therefore, bears some

        The government of the day came into office on 2 March when the policies of people opposite were roundly rejected as not being effective. It is important to recognise the record of the previous government, now opposition. In 1990-91 we had an unemployment rate of 8.3 per cent. Then there is the consequence of their policies. In the following financial year, it went up to 10.3 per cent and then it went up to 11. Then it came down to 10.5 per cent and then down to 8.9 and then down to 8.5, which is basically where we are at this point.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So people opposite are complaining about us turning away from the unemployed when their record shows that at the commencement of this decade unemployment was around 8.3 per cent. In most of the years that they were in government subsequent to that, they pushed the unemployment rate up by their ineffectiveness and have only managed in the last two financial years to bring it down to what it now is. To somehow expect that in six months the damage done by 13 years of fiscal irresponsibility could be undone is, of course, sheer lunacy. But what Senator Bolkus complains of is our preparedness to tackle this problem, to tackle it in a different way from that which Labor would have done. The old `Spend, spend, spend. Shove it on the Bankcard. Don't worry. Let the younger generation pay for it later' is not the approach we take.

        There is at the moment some further weakening in the labour market, and that further weakening started about 12 months before the coalition was elected. The trend employment—not the seasonally adjusted month&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;month business that jumps up and down all over the place—began to falter in April 1995. Employment grew by 4.6 per cent in the 12 months up to April 1995, but it only grew by 1.2 per cent in the 12 months after April 1995. That, of course, demonstrates the point I am making—that a further softening in the labour market was clearly evident in the previous 12 months.

For a long time Democrats have expressed concerns about the unfunded nature of the former government's Working Nation program.

Unfortunately, the former government did not appropriately fund those labour market programs, just as the government is now seeking to slash them terribly.

Slashing the new enterprise initiative scheme by 17 per cent makes no sense. Why would you cut a program committed to creating real jobs which has consistently produced positive outcomes of close to 82 per cent? I think that means that 82 per cent of people have found unsubsidised employment after they have been through the new enterprise incentive scheme. Why is Senator Vanstone advocating that the worst parts of Working Nation should go when, in actual fact, they are taking both the best and the worst bits out?

        By December 1995, 13 years later, unemployment was at 8.1 per cent. The Hawke and Keating Labor governments had encouraged the community of this country to create an extra two million jobs. Two million more Australians had jobs created for them in those 13 years than had occurred under the previous government. We had an aim to continue this work, to reduce unemployment to a level of five per cent by the end of the century. We were prepared to work on the program. We were prepared to set targets, to be concerned and to care for our fellow Australian human beings who were less fortunate than us in not being able to get a job.

It will not do anything for the community structure of this very important community.

They provide people with real jobs, they provide people with real training and they provide community services. Most of these programs involve people actually contributing something back to the community, not just being off the streets, doing constructive work and having jobs. It involves the actual building of services and facilities for communities, so that there was a very major value not just to the individuals who had been unemployed but to the community as well. So everybody was winning.

         Despite all their rhetoric while in opposition, when you actually look at the budget—the first chance to judge what the coalition has to offer about unemployment and assist ing people into jobs and out of the poverty traps and other problems associated with unemployment—you find a couple of lines that are couched within the general economic overview of the budget papers and the budget speech.

There is no strategy for dealing with what the budget papers and the government admit—that is, the possibility of an already significant unemployment problem rising.

All this in the context of taking $4 billion out of the economy this year and $7.5 billion out of the economy next year. On their own growth projections, unemployment will not fall.

If you do not satisfy the assessment that you are able to benefit, then you are on your own. You are still going to have to meet more stringent activity tests, but the government is going to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         make a decision about whether or not you are worthy of assistance at all. My figures show that, of the 160,000 long-term unemployed in Western Australia, there are funds to assist only about 72,000 of them. So the government is saying to large numbers of unemployed people that they cannot be assisted, and that is a disgrace.

I listened to Senator Chris Evans with some amazement, because I know the reality of what the Labor government did when it was in office. Certainly, it did set targets. It set a target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. Well, everyone knows that is not achievable. It is fine to set targets, but you are just never going to achieve them. You will never achieve them, so what is the point of setting them. You are just fooling people.

        Working Nation was a failure. It was supposed to make people job ready. It gave the unemployed some training but, because the fundamentals of your economy were wrong, you could never actually provide them with jobs.

        I reckon that is a pretty good description of 13 years of Labor government—not the Liberal government. Look at the unemployment rate you left this country with. After each recession, it ratcheted up to another level. Since 1983 the record of the previous
        <break page="3150" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Labor government was rising levels of overall unemployment, rising levels of youth unemployment and rising levels of long-term unemployment. That is the bottom line. That is the thing you have to judge the previous Labor government on.

        What did the Labor government actually achieve at the end of the day? With all that money, with all those programs and with all those targets, what did they do at the end of the day? What they did was leave a larger pool of unemployment. The greatest tragedy of all is that in that pool was youth unemployment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1986, we had 25 per cent youth unemployment. What was it when the Labor government went out of power? Youth unemployment finished at 29 per cent—an absolute national disgrace. Long-term unemployment increased to a third of all people unemployed and, in regional Australia, the unemployment rate for some youth was rising as high as 50 per cent. That is the legacy of the last Labor government.

        In 1994, the government came up with this brilliant new system for fixing this, and it was called Working Nation. What a joke! What an insult to the unemployed people in Australia to call that program Working Nation. It should have been called `Not Working Nation'. The program that was set up to make people job ready created a lot of red tape and it did not link training to real jobs. So, like many other Labor programs, it failed. All it did was churn the job queue. It left a very large pool of hidden unemployed by redefining people out of the employment system.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If you take into account the hidden unemployed in this country—the people who are getting only a few hours work but would like to work full time—the unemployment figure of 8&amp;half; per cent could more or less be doubled. There are figures around that show that, when this Labor government left power, the unemployment rate was closer to 18 per cent. Then, of course, we had the people who had given up totally on getting a job and were not seeking work at all. If you want to look at the real unemployment rate as a legacy of the previous government, 20 per cent is much closer to the mark.

         The previous government had a lot to show in terms of what they were doing in this area. They had a marvellous program in Working Nation! It sounded good. In 1995-96 they were going to spend $850 million on it. That sounded terrific, too. But, of course, they spent most of that money on three of the worst performing programs of the lot, and one of them was new work opportunities. For every job that was created and actually lasted some time, the government spent $100,000. What a terrible waste of public money. What a terrible thing to do to these people. They were churned through what were largely useless programs that were not producing jobs at the end of the day.

         The approach of this government is to get the economic settings right so that we do get real jobs created in our economy. This is done by balancing the budget. We have made huge strides in this budget to bring that about. The confidence that is coming back into the economy because of that is already obvious. The most obvious sign is the lowering of interest rates. That puts real money back into people's pockets and actually creates spending, which actually goes on to create jobs. Lower interest rates also release business investment, which then goes on to create further real jobs.

         The private sector is the engine room of growth. You could solve unemployment in this economy very easily if every small business in the country puts on one more person. There are 900,000 small businesses in Australia, and that is about our level of unemployment. If they would each put on one more we would solve the problem. How do you get them to put on one more? You give them greater incentives through the economy. We are doing that through such things as balancing the budget, getting interest rates down and getting rid of rules that the Labor government brought in, like the so-called unfair dismissal laws that stop small businesses employing people.

         —I rise also to speak in support of Senator Bolkus's proposition regarding this government's abrogation of responsibility to the unemployed in this country. Last month I was privileged to be officiating at a graduation of the ACT's first construction industry jobtrain course for the long-term unemployed. It was run by the Construction Industry Training and Employment Association and it was funded by DEETYA. The trainees were aged from 22 to 38, some having been unemployed for a period longer than two years. They are the people that this government has abandoned. They are the ones that this government has given up on.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This program was a major step in getting these people back into the work force. The jobtrain program is aimed at the future building and construction workers here in the ACT. Four of those trainees from that program already have a job and three of them are getting a job next week. Is that what I see as people being churned through, Senator Tierney? I notice he has now left the chamber. Is that the useless program that he is describing, where we have seen a transition with these people going through a program and getting a job at the end of it? Seven employers have been prepared to give these people jobs. We are talking about real jobs in the private sector in small business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This program has now been abandoned. It has been abolished by this government and those opportunities will no longer exist. Unfortunately, at the time of conducting this presentation to the graduates of this jobtrain program, I alluded to the fact that I was fearful that this government would unfund and abandon this program. We have seen that occur through this budget. To me that is not a relaxed and comfortable approach. It is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         certainly not relaxed and comfortable for the many workers who may have benefited from that program. They will now not have the opportunity to even give it a go and get a look in at getting a job in building and construction.

       <para first-indent="16">
        John Howard and this budget have absolutely ripped the guts out of this program. By his actions he is denying the opportunity for people to get off the dole and back into the work force. The message that this government is sending is that they do not care. This is after an election campaign where we saw `jobs, jobs, jobs' written all over the coalition's election slogans, banners and so forth. Do you think we can have too many jobs in sight in Canberra? Not only has this private sector program that was creating real jobs in in small business gone, but we have seen the cuts impact hugely upon our local community here. We have seen it impact to the point where thousands upon thousands of people are losing their jobs.

        The labour market programs that I have been describing, like the one that CITEA was running, keep unemployed people employable. When the jobs become available these programs make sure that the people are there to fit into them. No-one can deny that 80 per cent of long-term unemployed people who have been employed came through a program funded through Working Nation.

        According to Senator Vanstone, labour market programs like this one are a waste of money.

        It is a debate that is going to rage, I think, as we go into the next century. It is a debate about taking back into consideration the idea that we are not people apart, that we were cradled by the wild planet, that our bodies and minds are a creation of the wild planet, not the concrete and plastic conurbations in which more and more of the human citizenry of this planet live in artificial circumstances as we move to the end of this century.

        So, the rise of the Greens. It began with the world's first Greens party, the United Tasmania Group, which grew out of the battle to save Lake Pedder in Tasmania and which had its first get together, an overflow meeting in the town hall of Hobart, in March 1972. At that period through spontaneous combustion, if you like—because this human mentality around the planet tends to reach a similar conclusion, given enough time, through the sheer dint of commonsense—other Greens parties were formed in other nations and by the early 1980s there were Greens parties in most parts of Europe.

In Europe the Greens share the balance of power and have a number of ministries, including, I understand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Finland. There are numerous Greens in other Scandinavian parliaments.

If ever you see people in a place that needs the Greens it is Taiwan where 22 million people in a burgeoning economy are squeezed into an island less than half the size of Tasmania, where 14 dams are on the slate, where the fourth nuclear power station has just been voted down in the parliament, where gangsters run the rubbish dispersal system and thousands of citizens are out in the suburbs trying to stop landfills being dug up in their particular area under threat of arrest and imprisonment.

Four Greens in the Tasmanian parliament, led by the indomitable Christine Milne, hold the balance of power with a Liberal government in place which, by the way, in recent months, because of that Greens presence, has kept some very important promises, including sheltering education from budget cuts, increasing the number of teachers by 135 and giving a greater allocation to the free enterprise small business incubators, the local enterprise initiatives, in the state—an initiative of the Greens in 1989, which has created nearly 1,000 jobs and which deserves the tiny amount of public funding which sees those jobs created in the state which has the country's worst unemployment situation.

       This motion is intended to disallow a provision, a regulation which will have the effect of seriously disadvantaging those people with a dependent spouse who may have budgeted over a considerable time on the basis of the previous regulations. In effect, these regulations are retrospective. There are no transitional provisions to take account of those circumstances that I have just mentioned.

       For example, take retrenched workers. You can have a situation with retrenched workers where the worker has a dependent spouse and two or three children. The worker has budgeted for the family and is doing the right thing trying to get further education so that he or she can get a job. That worker could be up to $50 a fortnight worse off as a result of these regulations. That is why I am attempting to disallow these regulations.

       I would like to refer to a couple of things that might be of interest to the Senate. The history of this goes back some time. It goes back to December last year when the Austudy regulations came in. It goes back to where I received a letter from Mr Piers Allbrook from Hobart, who is one of my constituents. I was rather concerned about the situation, as was described by him. Of course, he is only one constituent, but there will be many others in a similar situation. I will read that letter to the Senate. It states:

       These changes will have a profound negative effect upon my, and a number of other, families income. In the dying stages of the Keating government a bill was introduced to abolish the spouse allowance for AUSTUDY recipients. This amendment did not receive the assent of the Senate and therefore is still legally, though not in practice, available to eligible applicants. It was claimed that it would be replaced by the Parenting allowance administered by the Department of Social Security.

       The major variation is that Parenting Allowance under the DSS is only available to parents with children under the age of 16. The AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse Allowance is also available to recipients of AUSTUDY with a dependent child who is aged 16&amp;hyphen;21 and who qualifies for AUSTUDY or VCES as a dependent student (ie. on the basis of the income of the student parent). There are also numerous other changes relating to the way in which income is assessed. The most pertinent of these is that AUSTUDY calculates income on the basis of taxable income, the DSS does not.

       I was made redundant and, to retrain, I enrolled at the University of Tasmania at the start of 1995.

August 1996 and from that time DSS Parenting Allowance will not be available to my wife. Should the AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse Allowance be maintained or the conditions governing DSS Parenting Allowance be extended to apply to dependent child who is aged 16&amp;hyphen;21 and who qualifies for AUSTUDY or VCES as a dependent student, our family will remain as a viable economic unit until I finish my degree.

       I responded to that particular letter. I will not go into that, but I did. I just want to refer to some of the things that I did say. I mentioned these matters in the Senate.

There is a considerable amount of material which I hope to have sorted out by the time this debate finishes.

       The point I am making is that, if this is not disallowed, we will have had the situation whereby persons will have made a decision in all good faith, based on the fact that they would be entitled to a dependent spouse allowance. Because of that situation and because it was by regulation deleted, we have a situation where these people have been seriously disadvantaged by what is, in effect, I believe, retrospective regulation.

        —The opposition will be supporting Senator Harradine's motion on Austudy regulations today. We do so because upon reflection this regulation is, in our view, not an appropriate means at this time. As I understand the situation, the parliament rose last year, having failed to consider measures contained in legislation that would have had the effect of changing arrangements, whereby the Student and Youth Assistance Act would mean that Abstudy and Austudy would be changed and a new scheme called parenting allowance would be introduced.

       Then, strangely enough, three days later the department produces regulations to the effect of securing those changes without the agreement of the parliament. While that is an issue that one may raise in terms of legality—there is no doubt that that is a legal act—it is a question of whether or not it is proper act in seeking to secure changes such as these.

        I too have come across cases whereby married students with dependent children who were relying upon allowances paid under Austudy and Abstudy found that, unilaterally, those changes occurred as a result of these regulations as of 1 January this year. That might not seem much to a lot of people but the net effect of that, according to the correspondence that I have, is that there may well be a loss of benefits of some $65.35 per fortnight. For people who are on very low incomes, that is a large amount of money.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand that in correspondence from Mary Lovett to students it is stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The abolition of AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse Allowance (DSA) from 1 January was part of a package of measures to rationalise largely identical spouse benefits and payments with a similar purpose and to reduce financial dependency between partners by providing financial entitlements directly to the spouse rather than to the student as the notional breadwinner. Spouses now need to apply to the Department of Social Security for assistance in their own right.
       </para>
       <para>
        You can see how those sorts of regulations will be interpreted under this government, where you will see up to 180,000 persons removed from the social security benefits list.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems to me that there is a need to have another look at this. As I understand it, it was said that there were supposed to be identical spouse benefits. When you actually examine the detail, it suggests that the loss of $65.35 per fortnight is not identical. It is quite clear from examination of the detail that the moneys payable under this new allowance, and under the way these regulations have been interpreted, is a loss of benefits to people normally entitled to benefits. I could go into some detail on those matters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In essence, what occurred under the living allowance was equal to the dependent spouse allowance unless one took the option of a $7,000 Commonwealth Bank supplementary loan, which would reduce the living allowance by $3,500 I am informed. Without that supplementary option, both the living allowance and the dependent spouse allowance for 1996 would have been some $7,351 respectively. Under these changes, the amount payable for the parenting allowance by DSS is $280 per fortnight which is equal to a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         lesser amount than that paid for under the old dependent spouse allowance which it replaced.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not just a question of being $280 less, because if you look into this further you actually see that some old allowances were incorporated within that one allowance and they have now been removed. I am advised by the correspondence that I understand was sent to the minister—and the minister would be aware—that you get a situation where married students already used to receive the $62.80 as parenting allowance and the only difference between the $62.80 and the maximum possible amount of $280.20, which should be seen to replace Austudy's previous dependent spouse allowance, is an increase in the parenting allowance of some $217.40 per fortnight. For a calender year, this equals $5,652.40 which you will notice is $1,698.96 or some $65.35 per fortnight short of the Austudy dependent spouse allowance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For a mature age student with school children, that means a loss of some considerable amount of money. I believe that students who have entered courses on the basis of allowances and on the basis of a benefit being payable to those persons ought to be able to complete those courses with those benefits intact. If they are eligible at one point and they remain eligible under that criterion, you should not have a circumstance where the rules are changed half way through a course. That is essentially what is occurring here. Therefore we have, as Senator Harradine has indicated, a clear case of the retrospective application of these regulations.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Departmental officers are explaining to students who complain about this that there is a streamlining of certain duplications between the various departments that operate—that is, the departments of DEETYA and Social Security—which, I am told, has resulted in inevitable reductions for some. The whole purpose of this scheme was to provide an identical basis for allowances which is not occurring.

         It seems that people who are living on tight budgets, and who have been living on tight budgets for some time while they were studying, cannot afford to lose $65 per fort night. Senator Harradine has indicated the cases that he is aware of and I have put cases that I am aware of as well.

        The department has acknowledged that these are disallowable instruments. What I find odd is that they sought to provide these changes in this manner and that legislation was not introduced into this parliament when the government returned to this parliament with its legislative list. I find it a little odd why they have relied on regulation of these circumstances, and it seems to me that there needs to be further explanation on those matters.

        The cases that we have before us suggest to me that there is an opportunity here for the Senate to correct the actions that the department has taken at a time when the parliament itself had failed to pass a bill which contemplated the abolition of the dependent spouse allowance. It is an appropriate occasion for the parliament to actually uphold this disallowance motion, and I suggest the government reconsider its position in that light.

        —On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I too rise to commit our support to the disallowance motion that has been moved by Senator Harradine. We have expressed, on occasions in this place, our concerns about the abolition of the DSA—the dependent spouse allowance. I also understand that there are procedural questions that need to be addressed, and I think Senator Carr has outlined some of those. Certainly, the measure that has been put forward by Senator Harradine—the transitional arrangement that he has proposed—is quite acceptable to us and will ensure that students, especially those currently studying under the previous arrangements, will not have the financial rug pulled from under them.

       We acknowledge that some students have been hit or slugged with about $1,700 less income as a result of the abolition of the DSA and that is of considerable concern to us. That has been reflected in a number of letters and

       I think it is important that this chamber not only notes how sad it is that Austudy arrangements, or income support, for students in this country are so inadequate, but also looks further at the poverty cycle which we threaten to trap students and, in particular, student&amp;hyphen;parents in as a result of changes such as this.

       Of course, it is worth noting that Austudy at its current level, at the independent rate, is about 68 per cent of the poverty line, and that is the top amount of Austudy that you can receive. I think the average student on Austudy receives around 38 per cent of the poverty line benefits. Clearly it is a system that has been in need of reform for a long time. I am glad that the ALP opposition now see fit to support the disallowance and I acknowledge the continued support of the Greens for Senator Harradine's motion.

       But let me turn to the speech made by Senator Carr because I think there are couple of things there that, most importantly, need to be clarified. What needs to be clarified, of course, is his, I think, very demeaning and insulting attack on the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs—as if somehow there is bureaucrat down in Times Square who simply decides that a regulation will be put forward, that somehow this regulation is all the fault of the bureaucrats and had nothing to do with members opposite. Well, the regulation that I have in front of me was signed by Ross Free and taken off to Executive Council by somebody and approved by Bill Hayden, the then Governor&amp;hyphen;General, on 12 December 1995. That is the first point that needs to be made.

       To present these regulations, as the Labor Party would like to present them, as being the fault of some bureaucrat—as though a bureaucrat with malice has sought to go behind the Parliament's back and make a regulation—is, in fact, a disgraceful speech to make. It is disgraceful to suggest that regulations put forward by your own party, that you approved of, that you must have gone along with in some caucus debate somewhere, that your own ministers put forward as part of a package—I understand the former government announced as part of the family's package in the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 budget that it would abolish DSA—are the fault of some bureaucrat.

       If Senator Carr had got up and said `Our government thought this was a good idea but, for a variety of reasons, we have now reconsidered', if he had not gratuitously got stuck into the bureaucrats, I would have some respect for this position—not much, but some. But since he chose to do this by basically saying that this was something that the bureaucrats strangely did a few days after Parliament got up, I think is a very sad reflection on Senator Carr and his views of the bureaucrats in Canberra. I certainly do not think those views are held by all the Labor Party. Perhaps, Senator Carr, if you had had the opportunity to be a minister, you would not have those views of the bureaucrats either. Certainly the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, a Labor minister who introduced these regulations, would not have had those views.

       Let me turn to the former government's reasoning for adopting this position. Perhaps, before I do that, I will make another point very clear—I know Senator Harradine understands the point and I think Senator Stott Despoja probably does, and the Greens, I am sure do. I see you flinch, Senator. I did not mean to say `I think you do' in a way that was meant to be taken by you as disparaging. I just simply do not know, with your limited time here, whether you did appreciate this point. The point is this: that the dependent spouse allowance was not being sought to be disposed of by regulation as a backdoor method of cheating Parliament.

       That was not what the previous minister was trying to do.

This was a 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Labor budget measure.

        —Senator Collins interjects that he has gone. Presumably, all of Labor's views have gone, too, and you have got nothing left. One might wonder whether all your views have gone out the window.

        It is important to understand that the dependent spouse allowance was created by regulation. It was sought by the previous minister to be disposed of by regulation, which is the appropriate way to do it. Let me make it unequivocally clear that neither the bureaucrats nor the previous minister were seeking to go behind anybody's back. If Labor wants to walk away, which they clearly do, from a budget commitment they made in the previous budget for some political opportunism now, let them do that, but let them not blame the bureaucrats and let them not suggest that their own minister was somehow trying to deceive parliament; that parliament had had an opportunity to do this and it had not completed that opportunity; that the bill had not passed and therefore parliament had not approved this measure. Everybody who was here at the time would have understood that this allowance was created by regulation and therefore should be got rid of by regulation, if you want to make that policy decision. That needs to be made abundantly clear.

        The legislation did not make the grade, no doubt because of the previous government's incapacity to manage its agenda, and that is a difficult task. Nonetheless, the bill did not make the grade. Let me canvass, to be sure that people understand after Senator Carr's disgracefully misleading speech, what was in that bill. That bill did not seek to remove the dependent spouse allowance. What it sought to do was remove a mere reference to it. The allowance was not created by that legislation and therefore did not need to be removed by that legislation. That legislation had a mere passing reference in it to that allowance. It was that passing reference, to tidy up legislation, that was being sought to be removed at the last session. So it did not make any difference whether that bill was passed or not, at least with respect to the dependent spouse allowance.

       <para first-indent="16">
        All that the reference in that legislation did was tidy the legislation up, to save it referring to something that would no longer have existed. I hope that has made the position abundantly clear—that this allowance was not created by legislation, it did not need to be

         removed by legislation. It was in fact a regulatory measure.

        The situation as it stood was that the student on Austudy would get about $270, the dependent spouse would get $270 and, because of the way that a social security regulation was worded, would also be able to get a basic parenting allowance of about $65. The previous government indicated it was never its intention that a dependent spouse would be able to get both of those payments. What it sought to do was to clean the matter up and ensure that that could not be done. If these regulations are not passed, we will revert to the situation where the dependent spouse can get the dependent spouse allowance and part of the parenting allowance, which it was never the previous government's intention they would have.

        I have one disagreement with Senator Harradine's proposition that he chose to make; that is, I do not see this as a retrospective regulation. It affects people who have already embarked upon a particular course but it does not go back and take money from people who already had it. It does not take away something they already had. It simply says you would not have it in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I understand your position, you are saying that you think once someone had embarked upon a particular course of study, they are entitled to assume that the payments would remain the same for the period of that study and that if you change a regulation during that period, you are retrospectively affecting them. I am simply putting the case to you that I have a different view, if you are affecting their payments in the future, but if you are wanting to affect payments in the past, I would regard that as retrospective. That is the only point on which I disagree with you.

        I can see the writing on the wall for these regulations. We agreed with the government at the time, now the opposition. We find ourselves standing alone with respect to this. I respect the view that Senator Harradine offers. He has always had that view. As for Senator Carr and his disgraceful attack on the bureaucracy, to pretend that somehow this was some backdoor move they were seeking

        I do not look forward to the day when the coalition is out of government and Labor is back in government, but if that ever happens in my time here, I certainly wish you well, Senator Carr. I wish you a ministry so that the bureaucrats who you have defamed today have the opportunity to serve you well.

          The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996, as did the earlier bill, seeks to make a range of changes to ATSIC. The most significant changes include: a reduction in the size of regional councils; continuing the practice of the chairperson of ATSIC being appointed by the minister; improved accountability arrangements for regional councils; and the provision to appoint an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC under certain circumstances.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Greens (WA) objected to the earlier bill because of the lack of consultation. The bill was to be forced through before the ATSIC elections, which greatly influenced those elections. Some of the changes, particularly those two regarding representation and the reduced numbers of regional councillors, require more time for consultation and do not necessarily represent the views of indigenous communities, even if the ATSIC board supports them.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I know that former Senator Chamarette was very concerned during the native title committee hearings. It was apparent during the proceedings of that committee that these policy changes had been made in the form of cabinet decisions which were then imposed. The minister was then left with a very difficult position of having to justify those policy changes before he had even become totally familiar with his own portfolio.

         <para first-indent="16">
          This government should not again make the common mistake of making policy changes without taking the views of marginalised or disenfranchised indigenous communities into consideration. We do have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in this place. Therefore, we have no excuse for not having the most wide-ranging consultation before policy changes of such magnitude are contemplated by this parliament. Whatever decisions were made this morning, how many people outside this place were involved in that decision making?

          I will now deal with the Greens' objections to some of the measures in this bill. The first is the continuation of the minister's role in choosing the chairperson of ATSIC. This was to have been a power which lapsed with the

           1993 elections. It was continued then, as honourable senators would know, largely because of representations made to Senator Kernot. The Greens (WA) opposed the extension then, and we most certainly oppose this further extension.

          It is a sad indictment of the conduct of relations between government and the indigenous people of this country that ATSIC is not trusted to choose its own chairperson. This measure should be opposed by every honourable senator who upholds the policy of self-determination in whatever form that person might choose to define such a concept.

          The changes to schedules relating to numbers of regional councils are problematic. Certainly, we have received numerous submissions from regional councils and regional councillors who do not agree with reducing the numbers of regional councillors. Many argue that reducing the number of councillors will also reduce the effectiveness of the representation they are able to offer and reduce the effectiveness of regional council decision making.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The statistical tables used in this bill also fail to take into consideration the geographical factors involved. For example, there might be what looks to be a very favourable ratio of councillors to members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in certain areas, such as in the remote areas of Western Australia. However, they are largely mythological in their benefit because of the enormous amount of ground that has to be covered for those people to get together, without much funding to do so. In some cases it is utterly impossible. As far as we are concerned, we cannot support those kinds of statistics and arguments.

          Proposed changes subsumed in the general rhetoric of accountability have also been coming from the government. In another context, we have seen the confusion, not to say chaos, which the government has managed to bring about in the indigenous community by its so-called accountability measures. I have repeatedly said that bureaucratic accountability is not the problem; it is about accountability in the communities to the people in terms of service delivery. If you
          <break page="3167" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           want to concern yourself about that, you should go back to the communities and ask them about that. We cannot change from the top without going back to those people and saying, `If you have problems with the structure of ATSIC, what are they? How can we go about dealing with those so that we can provide those services that we know you need?' Everybody in this chamber at some stage has made some comment about services to remote and regional Aboriginal communities and, indeed, to urban Aboriginal people.

          Adding layer upon layer of bureaucratic accountability measures does not necessarily increase the overall accountability and effectiveness of service delivery to Aboriginal communities. One of the answers may be to improve training so that Aboriginal people are made aware of the bureaucratic hoops they have to jump through instead of adding more hoops and an expensive super auditor costing $700,000. That $700,000 could be far better spent on ATSIC programs.

          I suppose we should not be surprised if we find draconian measures under the accountability banner heading. Accountability has come to mean only one thing in the lexicon of government: it means axing programs and appointments where a breach of some funding schedule is never hinted at. Where, by the way, is the accountability of those state and local government bodies which, in fact, should be required to give services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities? Where have we heard the argument from this government about their accountability?

          Unfortunately, the horrific budget changes have occurred under the mantra of accountability—$400 million in cuts to ATSIC, which the Senate may not be able to prevent from happening. The accountability diatribe is an excuse to take away Aboriginal people's livelihoods and attack the basis of ATSIC, which is self-management and self&amp;hyphen;determination, through taking away people's resources for a range of crucial activities.

They want you to know that health has not been quarantined as a result of these budget cuts and slashes. The reason it has not been quarantined—they give an example from their own work—is that there seems to be very little understanding of what actually happens in Aboriginal communities. For instance, the women's councils have taken on the role that governments will not or cannot provide—that is, to look after their aged, look after their disabled population, look after children, look after nutrition  and look after those people who are not dealt with in any way by any services which should be provided by state, local or Commonwealth government.

When old people somehow or other find themselves in an old peoples home—it is considered by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be somewhat of a shame to be cut off from your family—they are the ones who visit them and talk to them. They are the ones who take appropriate food to them. When people are disabled because of diet, alcohol problems, petrol sniffing or a range of other issues which are prevalent in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there are women in that community who work a network to look after them when nobody else will.

          These women have asked me to say that health has not been quarantined. These programs are being cut without any understanding in order to consider what is supposedly a problem with ATSIC. Yes, there are problems with ATSIC but, instead of dealing with problems, you are cutting off the ability of communities to work out some means of solving their problems. We are also mindful that some Aboriginal communities have already suffered pre&amp;hyphen;budget cuts from their ATSIC grants of up to 30 per cent. This has hit remote and isolated communities the

          We are also aware that CDEP—the community development employment program—has not been quarantined from cuts as was originally announced. The capital component of this program will be cut and this is the main reason for Aboriginal support and usage of the program: that is, that they have some control over what is going to happen in their community. It is not just somebody's make&amp;hyphen;work scheme or work for the dole which, of course, is discriminatory. It is working because there is some control within the communities and the communities are making their decisions. It was giving something tangible back to the community, but it has just been taken away. To work for the dole is not incentive in itself to participate in the program.

         It will be recalled that on 25 September 1995 the previous government agreed to provide up to $300,000 in ex gratia payments to forest industry businesses under the scheme to be administered by the department of primary industry. The agreement by the previous government to change the eligibility criteria in December 1995—something which, I might add, I fully supported—is producing more generous assessment outcomes, which have resulted in the $300,000 allocation being exceeded by $638,000.

        That report—as I say, it is a wonder it has not been tabled yet—indicates that the actual fiscal assistance or subsidies to Australian resource extraction industries barring mining, and not actually mentioning pastoralism specifically, works out at $5.6 billion per year. I would say this is a conservative estimate. It was a government report. The environmental subsidies—that is, the damage to the environment, water resources and other environmental subsidies which the community in the future ends up paying—were estimated to be in excess of $8&amp;half; billion. I would say that is also conservative in some respects and, as I said, it did not include mining, apart from energy. I am grateful to Senator Abetz for pointing out this particular report. Yes, I will have a look at it and read it later.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The taxpayers of Australia, despite what is said about level playing fields, do pay a whopping amount of money every year to subsidise resource extraction in Australia and often it is said that we have no other choice: we have to have slash and burn budgets. I would say that governments in Australia are paying something like $5.6 billion a year in subsidies to resource extraction, including

        If those industries require subsidy then people ought to know about that and then we should make better decisions so that we do not come out and make nonsense statements like, `We have to slash and burn basic social infrastructure because there is no other choice.' There are choices. They are being made all the time. The choices are that resource extraction industries are much more important to give welfare to than people who are actually using it effectively to maintain the basic social infrastructure of Australia.

        There is plenty of information which says that the level of investment in resource extraction is actually creating less employment per unit of investment. It is jobless growth that is created by such types of increased investment. Basically, the real growth that is occurring may be occurring in totally different sectors which do not seem to get the same level of support that the resource extraction industries get.

        Employment has gone down in many areas including, and perhaps specifically, timber industries or those industries which turn old-growth forests into little chips and send them overseas to make glossy paper.

I am sure you will hear from us in the future, giving more details once we have had the chance to have a look at the fine print. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        Funding for the Broad Arrow Cafe is very important, and the tragedy was very significant for Tasmania. But the other aspect of this report, as Senator Abetz has said, relates to forestry.

        I thought it important to draw the Senate's attention to government report No. 4, tabled today, which deals with determinations under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. It is worth noting that in light of recent changes we will see cuts to operating grants and other expenditure on higher education institutions in this country—we will see something like a $623 million cut over the next three years—so many of the worthwhile projects that are funded under these determinations will not be funded in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I refer to the booklet showing some of the reasons for determinations. They include:
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         higher education staff development fund; program grants for financial assistance to higher education institutions for operating grants generally, but specifically in relation to teaching, funding and research projects, as well as ensuring that the Australian National University and the University of Canberra are reimbursed for money paid to Comcare. A whole range of charges and programs will be undermined as a result of cuts to operating grants over the next four years.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In this chamber today, I noticed that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), in making reference to higher education cuts, claimed that they were `nicks' to the system. But I think that when you look at it in the context of these determinations, you will see that we have taken a razor&amp;hyphen;gang approach to the funding of higher education in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Interestingly enough, in this report there are no determinations that I have been able to see under section 25(a) that reimburse university student organisations which may lose funds as a result of state interference. I mean by that, of course, the misnomer `voluntary student unionism', which some conservative state governments seem to find quite a good thing. It involves interfering with student unions and their day-to-day organisations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important for the Senate to put on record that we see the Higher Education Funding Act as playing a role in ensuring that those institutions that have their day-to-day activities interfered with by a state government, because it wants to emasculate those vital services that student unions provide, are compensated directly by the Commonwealth government. This is to ensure that their facilities and representative functions are not hampered or hindered by the interference of a state government—whether it is the Victorian government or the Western Australian government, or any other state government that has decided to interfere in the activities and actions of student organisations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand that that is a matter that we will debate at some stage in greater depth. It is worth noting that the determinations as contained in this document today reveal that
        <break page="3173" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         student organisations have not been compensated. This measure is not going to be a flagrant waste of taxpayers' money, as some Liberals would have us believe. I also note the increased dependency on overseas students to make up the shortfall in operating grants and other associated expenditure and costs for universities.

On that note, I think we should acknowledge that the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act and its various determinations ensure that we have moderately accessible and moderately publicly funded higher education institutions in this country. Some of the measures that we have seen introduced lately will impact upon that, so it may be a very different document that we will be dealing with next year.

        It is also worth noting that the only target equity group that has not increased its participation rate in higher education over the past few years is those people that Senator Vanstone referred to today in the chamber, that is, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Unfortunately, Senator Vanstone has not come up with the best way of addressing or facilitating that particular problem. In fact, she seeks to compound it.
       </para>

        She will increase those obstacles, those barriers and those fees and charges so that people from poorer backgrounds cannot enter higher education, and the 15 per cent that she referred to today in question time will remain an elite and minor 15 per cent. In fact, the other 75 per cent will not be able to access higher education. I hope we do not see a vastly reduced determinations report next year.

        That the Senate take note of the document.

        I am pleased indeed to see this matter before the Senate. Australia of course is already a party to the SOLAS convention, that is, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. The 1988 protocol to which this document relates is, among other things, designed to harmonise the requirements of the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the related load line conventions, both of which are designed to protect shipping and of course, importantly, the people that sail on those ships.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason I have risen to comment briefly on this paper is that I want to commend the continuing work of the officers of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in advancing the role that Australia is playing, and has played, in bringing again and again to the attention of the international maritime organisation the growing concern in Australia and around the world at the entirely unsatisfactory nature, still, of international shipping. The reason that I do want to comment briefly on this is that, sadly, as recent statistical evidence has shown, this problem appears to be getting worse, not better.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has been known for some time now that there is a major problem in world shipping with large bulk carriers in terms of their unseaworthiness. Disturbingly, large numbers of these ships sink without trace at sea, often with the loss of life of all on board. The conditions on board some of these ships are disgraceful in terms of the living conditions of the crew, the payments to crew, the officers on board ships and the intimidation by the companies that operate the ships.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sadly, this is a matter in which we are all indirectly involved. As an island continent we rely utterly on our shipping services. Only three or four per cent of the cargoes carried
        <break page="3174" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in and out of Australia are carried in Australian shipping. Well over 90 per cent are carried by international shipping, and AMSA has the responsibility, on behalf of the government, to examine this shipping.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In recent evidence before a Senate committee, I was disturbed to hear—as a former shipping minister I have a close interest in this—evidence from AMSA that the number of ship detentions and defects that have been noted on board ships that are trading with Australia and bringing the freight that we use to Australia is growing. These detentions in fact have significantly increased in recent times. It is conventions such as the one that we are discussing now that provide for the condition of equipment and so on on board these ships that are absolutely vital to the safety of the crew on board.

        I want to speak of two other matters in the chamber tonight, but neither of them is quite as jocular as the ones I have just mentioned. My attention was drawn to a photograph in an article on page 8 of the

         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        newspaper today. It was a photograph of a person carrying a banner saying `No more asbestos', and the headline of the story is `Groups vow pollution action'. It features a photograph of the Mirrabooka Action Group spokesman, Hugh Cahill, outside the Atlas tip in Mirrabooka in Western Australia, which is just around the corner from my electorate office—the electorate office with the broken windows. The article states:

        Mr Foss, the minister, refused to comment. I do not know what can be read into the fact that he refuses to comment.

        My attention was drawn to that article because it was my intention tonight to speak about a very dear friend of mine who died, unfortunately, as a result of asbestosis. He died of mesothelioma in July of this year. Brian Fraser—who was described in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Manufacturing Worker
        </emphasis>
        newspaper as a `working class warrior'—was only 52 years of age when he died.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Brian and I shared a number of things in common. Both of us were born in 1944. We were both migrants to this country. He actually came from Belfast, where he worked in the shipyards and where he served his time as a boilermaker. He finished his shift and sometimes described himself as a `snowman', such was the pollution that came off the asbestos that was used in the shipbuilding in that place. That pollution did its deed with him, and his life was prematurely ended in July. I have only just found out about his actual death, as I was overseas at the time that he did die.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I met Brian in late February of this year during the election campaign. He was quite fit, well, hale and hearty. Perhaps, like me, he was a little bit overweight, but I think that is something to do with our age. We shared some memories of the old times. As I said, we had a lot of things in common: both of us were migrants to this country; both of us were members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the AMWU, or the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, as it is called now; and both of us served at the time as education officers for our respective states. In that union we were trailblazers in the field in the area of trade union education, not only within the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         AMWU but within the trade union movement in Australia. He and I used to take great pride in the fact that, of the six education officers that the union chose to employ, they had to go to Ireland to get at least two of us.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the same year that I came into this place, Brian went on to become the national organiser with the AMWU and was later to become the national president of the organisation. I met him in February. He was then reasonably fit for a 51-year-old—in good health, generally speaking.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        After I found out he had been diagnosed as having mesothelioma, I spoke to him in June where I could, even over the telephone, discern that he had some difficulty in breathing. He told me of the great shock it was to him to have been diagnosed in that manner with that illness because he himself, having been active in the occupational health and safety field within the union, knew that it was a terminal disease, that he was going to meet his end. He prepared himself and prepared his family for that. I just greatly regret the fact that I was not there at his funeral to share the sorrow of his wife, Eleanor, and daughters Michelle, Karen and Deborah. I want to conclude by quoting from that same newspaper article. It states:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        A message from ACTU Secretary Bill Kelty at Brian's funeral described him as "a big man, fiercely loyal to his union and its members. He was big in all senses of the word, large in spirit, voice and tenacity."

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Kelty said Fraser was "a warrior for the workers and the working class—prepared to stand up for their rights, protect their interests and promote their welfare."
       </para>
       <para>
        The AMWU has gone on to name a week—Asbestos and Chemical Eradication Week—in memory of Brian Fraser. I hope that we are successful in that and that no more human beings of the calibre of Brian Fraser are taken from this life by that dreadful disease and that dreadful contamination that we suffer.

        These are fine and noble sentiments, are they not? In an exchange between Jim Middleton and Senator Alston on March 2, Middleton said:

       <para>
        Senator Alston's reply to that was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Absolutely.
       </para>
       <para>
        Middleton went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Even if you discover on Monday the budget's bottom line is much worse that the government's been saying?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Alston replied to that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Oh yes. I think John Howard's made it very plain that we want to maintain—honour—all our commitments and the ABC is a very important part of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        These were all pre&amp;hyphen;election promises from the coalition. Less than six months later we saw Senator Alston, now minister for the ABC, fearlessly take back all those promises by announcing a $55 million cut to the ABC's 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget and the establishment of the Mansfield review into the management functions of the ABC, against all of their pre&amp;hyphen;election promises.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        More and more I fear we are moving into the twilight zone with this government. Ten per cent or $55 million sounds eerily like one of their 1993 Fightback policies—surprise, surprise! Fightback contained a 10 per cent or $50 million cut to the ABC. The budget has since seen a cutting of $209 million over the next four years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In a betrayal of voters' trust, Fightback policies have been resurfacing at every turn. Whether it is differential HECS, cuts to the public sector or cuts to labour market programs, it all comes straight from the 1993 Fightback policies. The government seems to be caught in a time warp. On 3 March this year, Senator Alston did not wake up to find himself transported back to 1993. It is now 1996. Australians rejected those Fightback policies and, as a result, the coalition was
        <break page="3178" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         forced to reinvent itself with a new package of policies and a new set of promises.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Back in 1993, those policies were rejected in the context of what I am talking about. Australians believe in the ABC and support the ABC. It is not surprising that rallies calling to save the ABC attract tens of thousands of people. The ABC feeds the spirit of Australians. It is an essential part of our culture and to cut that funding is, in a sense, to have some of our dignity stripped away.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ABC has been instrumental in developing and sustaining our cultural identity for decades that extend beyond my lifetime. I believe the ABC is one of Australia's most important cultural institutions. It is not only a trendsetter but also a trail blazer. It is only through the predominance of quality ABC Australian drama that the commercial stations have taken the course of making quality commercial Australian drama now available around the world. Science programs like
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Towards 2000
        </emphasis>
        were ABC originals. They were so good that they got cut in this government's budget. Consumer programs and Australian made comedies started on the ABC. We have opera and concert simulcasts. Triple J unearths Australian music in regional areas, giving young bands a fair go and an opportunity to extend themselves. That would never have happened on commercial radio; now it will not happen on Triple J.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Who but the ABC reports on the height of the Darling River and cattle and sheep prices? It keeps regional Australia connected with their urban counterparts, with their businesses and with their environment. The ABC sets the standards and the rest follow. Without a well&amp;hyphen;funded national broadcaster, the quality of Australian production will fall, leaving all broadcasting in Australia in an unhealthy situation. In 1993 when the coalition first raised the prospect of cutting 10 per cent off the ABC's budget, ABC management was claiming that it would see the sacking of at least 1,500 people, a reduction in Australian content, closure of state&amp;hyphen;based production, cuts to transmission hours, cessation of specialist programs like the rural, religious, science and arts programs and the abolition of some regional services to Australia.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Like every other part of the public service, the ABC has been undergoing efficiency and productivity restructuring. About 80 per cent of the ABC's budget is spent on buying and making radio and television programs. So a cut of $209 million over four years will affect programming as well as personnel. But the government has not just cut the ABC's budget; it has established yet another inquiry into its role and functions to redefine and reposition the ABC for the 21st century. This comes from the very same man—now the minister—who last year chaired a Senate inquiry which found the ABC's basic structure to be quite sound and worthy of its then levels of funding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is the real intention of the government? Is it motivated by economic indicators or blatant ideology? Will John Howard go down in history as the man who killed off Big Ted, put
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         six foot under, put the Bananas in the dole queue with the dole diary for a partner and applied the gag to some of the ABC's political commentary and current affairs reporting?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Mansfield review is the government's attempt to dictate changes to ABC management and programming. What is at stake? Where is the independence? We cannot allow this review to marginalise the ABC, providing only specialised programs for a small section of the community. That would be its death knell. We want quality and excellence in production, not just B&amp;hyphen;grade re&amp;hyphen;runs from our public broadcaster. The efforts of commercial broadcasting to educate, inform and even entertain will always be contingent upon their reliance on sponsorship and advertising. Surveys have shown that 80 per cent of Australians tune in to the ABC at some time. Of course, it is not the only radio and TV that we watch, but independent broadcasting is all about providing choice to all Australians. And it is that choice that we need to defend.
