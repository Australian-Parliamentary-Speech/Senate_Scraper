       Importantly, the Commonwealth and Queensland have agreed to develop and implement a regional management plan for the Hinchinbrook area.

       The agreement on the development of a regional plan for the Hinchinbrook area is a major achievement. Commonwealth involvement in the regional planning process gives it the capacity to address in an integrated manner the full range of developments that could impact on world heritage values. The Commonwealth will be in a position to implement a comprehensive management regime designed to protect world heritage values in the region, and so prevent conflicts over land use rather than responding in an ad hoc and belated fashion in the way the previous government did.

       I wish to emphasise the Commonwealth's commitment to the regional planning process. We understand Queensland share our commitment to this process. The Commonwealth, however, has particular responsibility for protection of world heritage values. Accordingly, if for any reason the regional planning process does not deliver the required protection for world heritage values then I will use all powers available to me to protect world heritage values in the Hinchinbrook area, including those values in the Hinchinbrook Channel and on Hinchinbrook Island.

        The current dilemma facing the Federal Government over the protection of our native forests, and providing a secure future for the timber industry and its workers, has a solution.

        There is no doubt that there will be a detrimental impact on jobs in some rural communities, although jobs will be created in others. However, this must be seen in the context of the thousands of jobs which have disappeared in the industry due to over clearing and mechanisation and the ones which will be lost if the industry becomes more unsustainable. Timber industry workers who lose their jobs from phasing out native forest logging should be given an opportunity to move to jobs created in towns relying on plantations. They will also find new opportunities in value added processing, management of Reserves, and ecotourism.

        â€”The motion relates to the sale of King Island Dairy's property on King Island to a company known as Transequity. There are three very important points to be made as to why the motion ought to be carried and why there ought to be a proper investigation of the matters. Despite the fact that there have been some inquiries and investigations on the matter, they have been of a desktop nature and not of a thorough nature, and there have been no, or very limited, interviews with the people involved in either of the companies or, indeed, with the government of the day.

       King Island Dairy Products had a loan of near to $1 million from the Tasmanian government through the Tasmanian Development Authority, and the government took the decision in 1986 to place the company in the hands of receivers. It is very interesting that, despite an outstanding debt of almost $1 million, the government took the decision, and directed the receivers, to sell the property, which as at 12 September 1986 was valued at almost $1.7 million by the receiver managers.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I have a document, which I might seek to table later, signed by the receiver managers, and it gives the estimated value of the property as being $1.692 million. That was just three weeks before the property was sold. It provided a net return to the Tasmanian government of some $86,000.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There are some very serious matters relating to this issue. The property was sold for $300,000; it was valued at $1.692 just three weeks before the receivers sold it. It was subsequently sold, less than 29 months later, for $5 million. Transequity would be very pleased with the profit received from that sale. I do not think that there would have been many property sales around that time.

There needs to be a proper investigation. I hope that the motion is carried, and I hope we will see the Treasurer direct the ASC to conduct a proper investigation. In fact, I would like very much to see an independent investigation so that it is properly and thoroughly investigated, for no other reason than to provide the Kirk family with some form of proper justice.

       I do not intend to speak for much longer now than I would have earlier on in the proceedings but I do understand the need for senators to participate in this debate. The opposition opposes these regulations because we feel these regulations are not regulations in the interests of good government, nor are they in the interest of allowing full parliamentary scrutiny of a very important area of public policy.
      </para>

       The effect of regulations 233 and 238 would be to remove the list of benefits which are currently covered by assurances of support from the regulations and therefore allow the minister to specify them by notice in the
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Gazette
       </emphasis>
       . In essence, they are the regulations we are concerned about. We are concerned about them because the regulations would remove from parliamentary scrutiny any aspect of ministerial decision making in terms
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        of what is covered under assurances of support.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The remaining regulations for us are innocuous and we do not have any problem with them. But we do have a problem with the principle that says, `We'll take away parliamentary scrutiny from what is covered by an assurance of support and allow a minister at his or her own discretion to make that decision.' We are concerned because the regulations as proposed by the government would allow the government to add any benefit, entitlement or payment to the list of assurances of support at will. That is the crunch of this particular issue. The consequence of allowing the regulations proposed by the government would be, for instance, parliamentary scrutiny of legislation that we are currently debating in respect of the Department of Social Security two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period for migrants could very well be undermined.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       While the assurances of support do not remove a person's entitlement to social security, they do give the Department of Social Security the power to recover an equivalent amount from the person who signed the assurance. For instance, removing the schedule of benefits from the regulations and allowing the minister to add new benefits by notice in the
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Gazette
       </emphasis>
       will provide the government with an opportunity to get around the difficulties it currently faces in the Senate in getting approval for the Department of Social Security two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The minister, for instance, would be able to gazette all those entitlements or benefits covered by assurances and support. He could then proceed to make an assurance of support compulsory for all family reunion therefore effectively achieving much of what is intended by the bill without the need for the bill to pass through the Senate. That is one particular instance of these regulations allowing a minister the capacity to subvert, to avoid, the scrutiny of parliament. It is for that reason that we think these regulations need to be opposed.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Essentially, the principle is: if something is going to be covered, if some benefit is going to be made available, if some benefit is going
       <break page="3216" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        to be taken back, then there needs to be parliamentary scrutiny of it. Departmental scrutiny of ministerial decision making is not sufficient to cover this situation.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       You can go on, for instance, applying your mind to what sort of legislative scrutiny can be avoided if the government has its way and gets these regulations through. For instance, although all refugee and humanitarian categories are currently exempt from the two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period legislation, they would be caught in the compulsory assurance provision and the Department of Social Security would also have the power to recover such payments from people coming in here under refugee and humanitarian categories unless there was some further exemptions provided for, and those exemptions have not been provided for.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The basic principle is clear. I anticipate there will be some support for the opposition's position in opposing these regulations. The basic principle is: if a benefit is to be granted, if a benefit is to be withdrawn, if a benefit is to be denied, then let the parliament have some capacity to scrutinise government decision making here. Don't do it through the backdoor. Don't allow the minister in the absence of parliamentary scrutiny to be able to make such decisions.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is a bad principle that the government wants to follow here. I am sure Senator Short will probably come up with some precedence in respect of this but so be it. In this particular circumstance where we do have some very actively debated issues before the parliament to come in with regulations like this, regulations which would subvert legislation which has been scrutinised by the Senate at the moment, is for us a very bad approach to take. For those reasons, I have moved this motion to disallow regulations Nos 7 and 8 of the migration regulations as contained in statutory rules 1996 No. 75 and made under the Migration Act 1958.

       The motion is based upon a misguided view of the opposition that the government has some sort of secret agenda in this area. Frankly, I find it extremely disappointing and hypocritical that someone like Senator Bolkus, who as a former minister for immigration should be expected to have some idea of administration in this area, cannot either understand the issue or alternatively he just wants to stop the Senate from getting on to important issues.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I hope Senator Bolkus will listen to this because, while I, naturally, differed from him on some issues when he was minister for immigration and I was the shadow minister, I think I can say with some pride that the then opposition worked to cooperate in this key area of national policy and administration. I know that the same constructive and responsible approach was taken by the present minister, Mr Ruddock, when he was the shadow minister. We worked to ensure bipartisanship. We understood that in this area the government of the day had a right and responsibility to govern. Whilst we properly acted to scrutinise decisions, our approach was positive. How things seemed to have changed in the last six short months since Labor went into opposition.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The regulations that the opposition has taken such exception to are, quite simply, routine, machinery provisions. They are nothing more and nothing less. They relate to the assurance of support scheme. An assurance of support is a legal commitment by the assurer to repay the Australian government certain welfare benefits if paid to the migrant during the migrant's first two years in Australia. The allowances and benefits in question are established under social security legislation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As Senator Bolkus should know, from time to time the names of allowances or benefits change or new ones are added and so on. The regulation in question is merely designed to simplify cross&amp;hyphen;referencing between social
       <break page="3217" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        security legislation and the migration legislation schemeâ€”nothing more, nothing less. There is no hidden agenda in this whatsoever. Instead of the migration regulations needing to be amended every time the names of relevant social security allowances change, the regulations provide for the change to be recognised by gazette notice. It is very simple. I cannot see what the opposition's problem is with that idea.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The reality of that situation is that the regulations Labor bequeathed us contained all the relevant social security legislation allowances bar one new one. That was the mature age allowance. The suggestion that the gazettal notice system could be used by stealth to introduce a whole raft of additional allowances for the purpose of the AOS scheme is just nonsense.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The opposition was, after all, in government when the current Migration Act was substantially revised in 1989 and 1994 and when the present migration regulations were made in 1994. When in government, they clearly understood the need from time to time for simplicity in administration. The use of gazette notices is sanctioned in no less than 14 sections of the act and on 68 occasions in the regulations.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We on this side understand the need for the detail to be provided in complex legislation by mechanisms such as gazette notice and I am sure, really, that the opposition does as well. Indeed, the previous government, the now opposition, thought that issues as important as placing limits on the number of visas to be issued in particular classes each year, as important as setting the pass marks for migrants to qualify for entry or even specifying foreign currency levels of application fees, were appropriate for notification by way of gazette notice. We agreed because we understood the need for quick and efficient means of administering complex issues. It seems that the experience of the last 13 years has now been washed away by Labor now in opposition.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The opposition is suggesting that the regulation is some devious way of the government achieving the measures contained in the legislation proposing a two-year waiting

        period for social security benefits. We, of course, remain committed to that legislation, which was clearly explained before the election. But the reality is that the AOS scheme has been with us for many years. It will need to continue to exist for persons who arrive before the two-year waiting period legislation comes into effect. The need for AOSs, which require an explicit acknowledgment by the assurer of their responsibilities to provide support for the new migrant, will be addressed in due course.

       The issue we are dealing with at the moment has nothing to do with policy at all. It is, as I said, a routine, machinery provision. It is one that the previous government, now in opposition, adopted on various occasions in the past. We supported them in the interests of administrative efficiency. It is very regrettable, I must say, that Labor has now changed its attitude on this for what can only be hypocritical, cynical reasons. I really cannot understand any rationale for it. For that reason, we are strongly opposed to the disallowance motion.

The minister would have us believe that it is in fact a way of bringing in some kind of administrative efficiencyâ€”a way, I guess, in future that regulatory amendments may be attended to through ministerial discretion, by the stroke of an administrative pen.

        â€”I also support this disallowance motion. I do not believe the minister ought to be able to have unfettered rights as far as these regulations are concerned. The parliament has been able to vet such regulations in the past. I am sure that many people in the ethnic community will be hoping that the move by the government to be able to change the rules to make things harder does not succeed. So I agree with the earlier speakers on this side of the chamber and will be supporting Senator Bolkus's motion.

         â€”At close of play last night I was expressing my deep concern about the ATSIC bill's timing, about the bill's intent and about how changes had been altered yesterday without any consultation with those people who are mightily affected by the
         <break page="3219" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          changes that are occurring. I was expressing my concern about changing the paradigms of an election. Today, in fact, is the last day for nominations. I believe nominations close at 5 p.m.

        The nature of the election would be such thatâ€”and I am hoping that Minister Herron will clarify this in the committee stageâ€”those people involved in nominating for an election would have had some information given to them about the nature of the council and the organisation for which they were nominating. It would be very interesting for the minister to clarify exactly what information would have been given to people about the nature of the organisation for which they were nominating, whether this information referred to the structure of ATSIC in anticipation of a change in legislation or whether this information related to the structure of the organisation as it exists. In fact, the legislation had not changed at the time the nominations opened.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, in fact, that would be a very odd situation. I cannot imagine that in an Australian government election the electoral boundaries or the numbers of elected representatives would be changed after people had lodged their nominations. In  fact, that would be changing the rules after nominations had closed. I would think that would be a very odd situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the committee stage I will be keen to ask the minister questions such as: if this bill were to be shoved through now in order to change the nature of what people are electing in the ATSIC elections, what will be the cost of an ATSIC election and what might it cost either ATSIC or the Australian public to redo the election if there is a significant challenge to the election?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I mentioned last night as my time ran out that one of the significant changes in this bill was the government's proposal to give the minister power to appoint an administrator. I know that is part of yesterday morning's deal, but I would like to point out very carefully that, if the deal had not been brokered, the bill obviously still would not have gone anywhere and, in fact, we still would not have had an administrator in the bill and in legislation.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what have we gained? We will have put through a bill which has detrimental impacts, I believe, on self-determination. So what, in fact, has been gained by brokering the deal? That administrator still would not have been in existence because there was no legislation to allow that administrator to be in existence. What have we actually gained?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The appointment of an administrator would mean that the commission would not meet; that the commissioners would not be paid, whether or not they were in any way involved in the matters which led to the appointment of the administrator; and that any delegated powers of the commission may be revoked, thus possibly leading to downstream functions being stopped and so on. That smacked of the most blatant paternalism imaginable. Where else would we find such a power? It is certainly not okay to put such powers in the ATSIC Act because you can easily sell the idea in the community under the accountability mantra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is what is happening at the moment. We are turning our back on self&amp;hyphen;determination. We still, obviously, have to see what happens in the bill. There was information about what was part of yesterday's deal but, if the deal had not happened, we would not still have had an administrator, because the bill had not gone anywhere. I believe the original bill got taken off the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Notice Paper
         </emphasis>
         in the House of Representatives. We did not have a bill; we did not have an administrator. Therefore, what have we gained except some other parts where we are moving further away from Aboriginal self&amp;hyphen;determination? We are all responsible if we have been part of that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must acknowledge that the minister has said he did not envisage these powers of appointing an administrator being used. But I think the whole principle of inserting them in the first place was coercive, threatening and an insult to the organisation. That is why we did not and do not support it.
        </para>

         In summary, we do not support the measures that are introduced by this bill. The Greens (WA) cannot support the bill in its present form.

The point in relation to changes is that the Greens are changing the goalposts because this bill was introduced. It has always been the government's intentionâ€”and it was understood at the electionâ€”that that would be the parameter in which the election would be held. The government has not changed its position. The Greens have changed their position but the government has not. There is no implication for the election in that regard.

         â€”I foreshadowed some questions during my second reading contribution. I think this might be an appropriate time to ask them. I have a couple of general questions. Can the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) advise the chamber exactly what kind of information was provided to those people who were nominating for the current ATSIC elections as to what was the basis of the organisation for which they were nominating. Is there any document available to senators which will provide us with information about exactly what people understood it was they were nominating for?

         It would be very hard for anyone to imagine they could pre&amp;hyphen;empt the decisions of the Senate. Perhaps the minister could advise me on what basis any information was distributed to prospective nominees for positions in ATSIC elections. Perhaps there was some foreshadowing. I do not know; I have not seen any documentation of any changes. Did people have an understanding that they were nominating for an organisation as it existed, that is, as it was based in legislation, and which has not changed in legislation? Were changes foreshadowed which pre&amp;hyphen;empted the Senate's decisions, in which case what changes were foreshadowed? Does this mean that any amendments to that which might have occurred as a result of yesterday's deals were or were not foreshadowed in any foreshad owed changes? On what basis might any foreshadowed changes have been notified?

        What did people think they were nominating for? What did those people nominating for the ATSIC elections believe they were nominating for? What was the basis of that belief? Can the minister provide any documentation to this chamber as to what nominees were advised they were nominating for? What would be the structure and basis of their organisation? It is my belief that the nature of people's nominations may have been affected by what they thought the nature of the organisation was. The size of the groups, the nature of the administration and so on may well affect people's desire or lack of desire to nominate for any organisation.

        As I mentioned in my second reading contribution, it would be very odd indeed if, in an Australian election, electoral boundaries or numbers of senators, for instance, were changed after nominations were closed. I would think that would be considered to be very odd and there would be a fair chance that there might be a High Court challenge of some sort if such an election were to take place, there having been changes after nominations were closed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Can the minister also provide me with information about the expected cost of the current ATSIC elections. Who bears that cost and who might be required to bear that cost if there were a successful High Court challenge based on the actions of the Senate today?

         â€”There has been no change. The government signalled its intention when the bill was originally introduced on 25 June. There has been no information distributed because the election date was announced prior to that. No information has been distributed. It is consequent to the passage of this bill. So anybody nominating would be aware of what the parameters were. The cost of the election, as I understand it, will be in the vicinity of $900,000 and that includes research that has gone into it. It is conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and the cost is borne by ATSIC.

         <break page="3223" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        That would mean there are changes to the bill. The bill was announced and it was assumed it would pass in whatever formâ€”and who knows what kind of form would come out of the Senate in the normal democratic process. There are a number of changes to the bill. There are changes that the government is making. There are changes that, obviously, the Greens would like to make. I cannot speak for other parties here; perhaps they are all very happy with everything that is going on. But it is strange to assume in any event that any of these changes will not occur, that there might not be an amendment to the bill which would change eligibility criteria and the nature of the organisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No matter what is said here, the nature of the organisation will change once this bill gets royal assent. That was not there. Before the bill got royal assent, it did not exist in legislation. It will exist if the bill goes through to royal assent. It did not exist before that time. So the actual organisation will have changed no matter what was in a bill that did not go anywhereâ€”it went to the House of Representatives and did not go anywhere after the Senate changed it.

        The reality is we are dealing with changes to a bill. We are dealing with a process in the Senate.

        I am challenging you on this: is this not a strange and odd thing, are there not changes that were not in legislation yesterday and could this process by which the Senate is meant to debate a bill in fact result in a number of changes whether you have announced them or not?

That was under item 28â€”the disqualification of directors, et cetera, who are consultants. I assured her that if I learned there was any problem with that in respect of the possibility of a legal challenge, then I would be happy to withdraw it. I asked ATSIC to give further consideration to the implications of the amendment proposed to paragraph 102 (1)(c), item 28, of the ATSIC Act. I can confirm that it is possible, in theory, that the election of a person who is a director, has a controlling interest in a body corporate or is a consultant to the commission or TSRA, might be challenged by an unsuccessful candidate. Although the situation is probably unlikely to eventuate, the government is prepared to withdraw the proposed amendment to paragraph 102 of the bill to obviate that. Given that that is withdrawn, ATSIC does not envisage any possible legal challenge in any way if the bill is passed with that amendment removed.

Is the minister telling the committee that an individual or an entity would not be able to challenge the election itself, that there are no circumstances under which the election could be found to be invalidated?

          its budget to pay for the election. The point that Senator Brown, with respect, is making is that this is in a situation where the ATSIC budget has already been seriously reduced. In real terms for the ATSIC commissioners it is not an across-the-board reduction of 11 per cent, as serious as that is, because the government has effectively removed two-thirds of the entire budget of ATSIC from the decision making of its commissioners.

In real terms, however, ATSIC is but a shell of its former self. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs has rightly welcomed the government's agreement to withdraw what we found profoundly objectionable, that is, the appointment of an administrator to replace the entire board. But it should be noted in respect of the point that Senator Brown is making that effectively two-thirds of the organisation's entire budget has already been removed from the purview of the board of ATSIC. Therefore, in terms of real decision making and independence of that decision making, the majority of it has already been removed from the organisation by the government.

        The point Senator Brown is making is that therefore ATSIC, the board of commissioners, effectively is only taking decisions in respect of one-third of its budget, and that is having to do the dirty work of handing out cuts of in excess of 30 per cent across the board to those areas where it is still left with any discretion.

It would be of enormous assistance, Senator Margetts, if you could tell the committee directlyâ€”I understand the point you are makingâ€”what parts of the written advice that have already been circulated to Aboriginal people who may participate in this election would cause, in your view, a potential problem should this bill be passed by the Senate.

         â€”It has. This is the existing act I am talking about. So nothing has changed in nominations, opening and closure of rolls, the period of election, the date of election, or the number of commissioners.

         â€”I am getting to that next. What the new bill is proposing to do is not implement what was about to happen, which was the election of the chair of ATSIC, and maintain the appointment. So that is a change. When we get down to the other provisions of this existing bill, when we get down to the number of regional councils, the number of regional councillors and wards,
         <break page="3232" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that is where I think we need some clarification. Division 4â€”Regional Council elections, clause 100 states:

        So what we are looking at is: have people been disadvantaged in any way to this point in the process? In the next month to come, if the rules, the numbers of regional councillors, are clarified by the Australian Electoral Commission, is this likely to invalidate the election in any way? That to me is the only issue from that entire list over which there is a question.

        The Greens (WA) certainly have a severe problem with amendments 2 and 3, which allow the minister to appoint councillors. If there is nothing in the bill which sets out the basis of this appointment then, theoretically, the minister can decide how that will happen. Whether or not he chooses to do it by the next on the list or any other means certainly leaves a rather odd situation in terms of self-determination, if that is in indeed what ATSIC is meant to be about. So we would strongly oppose that.

        Amendment 1 and schedule 3 bring in elections for the chair after 1999. If the status quo remains without any amendments, these current elections will have an elected chair. People will note that my amendment No. 7 would bring elections up in 1996. By putting all these amendments together, it would make it a little difficult, I think. I could still put my amendment later, but it would make it difficult for me to run my amendment No. 7.

         â€”It just might be useful to explain why this amendment has eventuated. When we debated this last time and we talked about a reduction in the number of regional councillors, the recommendation to do that came from a review conducted by ATSIC. So we are not bypassing ATSIC consideration of this matter.

        In the Senate committee hearing, several regional councillors said, `We understand why we want this to happen, but it has a problem in that, because of the distribution of population in each ward, there will be some pockets of communities who are small in number who may be unrepresented.' At the time, as I recall, the Senate said, `We can appreciate the principle of the reduction in number and we take ATSIC's advice on board, but we are still uneasy about this lack of representation in certain areas.' This proposal is meant to address that.

        What I think is missing from it is the finer detail, which would be: are you going to look at the list of nominees, those who put themselves up for election to the council, as a starting point, or are you going to take the advice of the regional council of that whole area, or are you going to simply ask the board of commissioners to talk to you?

        The reason for my moving this amendment is that there is power under this bill for the minister to give general directions to the commission. I do understand there are some restrictions on that, but I believe that we should have some ability for the community, most particularly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, to have some input when such decisions are made. That input should mean that such decisions could be disallowable, that those concerns can be brought to the parliament via the Senate by way of a disallowable instrument.

         â€”It is the appropriate comparison, I think, Senator Kernot, because the amounts of public money involved are very similar. This report was tabled in the parliament only a very short time ago. It makes very interesting reading. As the former primary industries minister, it was a scheme that I had some passing interest in although it was administered by the Customs Service. This Audit Office report reveals that this schemeâ€”as supportable, in my opinion, as it isâ€”is losing, conservatively, something like $40 million a year in rip-offs and rorts. The report itself makes the point that this is a conservative figure.

        The government itself has placed a far higher figure on it. They expect to get savingsâ€”as they are referred toâ€”of $400 million from this scheme over the next four years in fixing the rorts. That is in the budget papers. The government clearly agrees with the audit office that the $30 million to $40 million figure is indeed a conservative figure.

        The minister admitted to a Senate committee that part of the reason for the issuing of that directionâ€”freezing ATSIC's fundsâ€”was because of statements made by people like Pauline Hanson and the publicity on the

        program about the Redfern Legal Aid Service, which I can tell you I will be happy to come down on like a tonne of bricks at the appropriate opportunity in the Senate as much as anyone will be. That was the basis for freezing the entire funds of ATSIC, an Aboriginal organisation. This audit report identifies $40 million in rorts from the scheme. The government itself has put the figure in the budget papers at $100 million that they expect to get back in eliminating those rorts.

        Would anyone have seriously suggested, on the basis of this report which was tabled in the Senate recently, that the minister responsible for customs would have issued a direction to the administrators of this scheme freezing every single disbursement to every Australian farmer and minerâ€”the recipients of this benefitâ€”as a result of these rorts which far outweigh anything that ATSIC, on its worst day, has ever been accused of doing? Of course, they did not. As I said

        In cabinet that dayâ€”and I have no doubt that it was not in the submission which the minister took to cabinetâ€”the government took this outrageous decision which caused the most horrendous dislocation to employment programs, to the provision of water supplies and sewage services in tiny Aboriginal communities all across Australia with horrendous health problems and forced the minister, at the end of the day, into the ignominious position in the Senate of rescinding his original direction and issuing a new one which completely negated the first.

        You may object, Minister, but I do not think it is an invalid comparison to make in the chamber, and I might give it a passing reference again in the appropriate amendment that is to be moved by me shortly. The way in which miners and primary producers were treated by this government, and the way in which the Aboriginal people of Australia were treated by this government on exactly the same grounds, stands in stark contrast.

         â€”Yes, but it is not a matter of who is more rationalâ€”the Senate or the ministerâ€”in relation to ATSIC, although I take your point. One does wonder from time to time with the debates we have had in here over the past three or four years. The way we held the minister to account last time was via a censure motion. I think this is a better mechanism for providing for permanent debate. You cannot always rely on the suspension of standing orders to bring on a censure debate in order to make the points that we are able to make in debate. We saw what happened as a result of the issuing of that general direction. It came out of the blue. That is why I think that Senator Margetts's amendment is a safeguard to say, `Don't let it happen that way again. Yes, they will go ahead and issue general directions, perhaps,

         â€”They were, as Senator Kernot mentions, worn as badges of honour. They were ignored. Some people say those mechanisms have no guarantees of working. If there were an automatic ability for a debate on disallowance, then the Senate would be able to vote, not for us to have a say but for time to enable communities which would be affected by what might be arbitrary ministerial decisions based on political expediencyâ€”and we have seen some evidence of thatâ€”to have a say through their elected representatives. We have seen scapegoating to a horrible extent as a result of the budget and pre&amp;hyphen;budget decisions. Were scapegoating to occur via ministerial edict, then that mechanism would be necessary to allow the people most affected to have a say. That is the importance of this measure and that is why I was hoping the Labor Party would support it. Obviously, it was a vain hope.

        The amendments all relate to removing references to prison penalties within the act and substitution of the appropriate penalty units. These are the same amendments moved by my former colleague Christabel Chamarette in relation to this same bill in June this year. There is no diminution in the range of discretion that is given, but there is a principle being applied. As many senators would be well aware, this is consistent with the campaign that my former colleague con
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         ducted in relation to social security and other bills.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason that I am moving this amendment is to apply the principle that prison should be a penalty of last resort and that our commitment to that principle should not be simply nominal. In particular, I believe we have a case in point that the offences here are serious ones. There is no question about that. The question as to what is the most appropriate penalty can be answered with almost complete certainty that prison should not be used as a first resort, which is what is implied, and that has been stated in this way in the act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It should be up to the court to determine the appropriate penalties. To have penalty units means there is a range of sanctions and penalties the court can apply. We should be particularly concerned about this when discussing ATSIC bills because recommendation No. 92 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody strongly urges that imprisonment be applied only as a penalty of last resort.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe we need to have a much stronger response in the area of Aboriginal over&amp;hyphen;representation in prison. We need to look at the way in which prison is used in a coercive or threatening way if we are going to keep putting it through as a deterrent effect, and criminologists know that that is not the case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe it would be beneficial to remove the reference to imprisonment and put the penalty unit's equivalent in support of that principle, that we should not act by implying prison has some kind of magic value by being mentioned in the act. We should certainly be supporting the idea that the penalty should fit the crime and the offence and that it should be left up to the appropriate court determination. That is why I urge the Senate to support these amendments.

        With respect to amendment 3, we agree that is not a problemâ€”penalty units rather than imprisonment. Committee members would recall that, effectively, we defined this the last time this was debated when there was some confusion about whether penalty units could in fact be interpreted as prison terms. That was quite definitively ruled out. So the effect of the Greens amendments 4 and 5 is to remove any imprisonment option, which we do not think is appropriate.

        However, in respect of schedule 1, item 50, page 27, and schedule 1, item 52, page 28â€”and I apologise to the committee for this late notice, but the paper is being prepared nowâ€”we will be moving our own amendments which would add to the existing provisions which only provide an imprisonment penalty. They will be in respect of Greens amendment 4 to add the option of 100 penalty units in schedule 1, item 50, page 27 and amendment 5 to add 10 penalty units in schedule 1, item 52, page 28.

        I apologise to the committee for this oversight, but these are in fact the same amendments that we moved in the House of Representatives to these provisions. It is not, with respect, too difficult to understand. As I say, we are supporting three of these Green amendments, but the problem with amendments 4 and 5 is that we do believe an option of imprisonment or penalty units is desirable in this case.

        If I could just explain the gravity of the offence we are talking about. I am quite happy to go to the principal act if you want me to, but that is just wasting time. We are talking about a fine of $10,000 with 100 penalty units. It is a fairly serious offence. We think it is appropriate for a court to have the option of imprisonment as well, either/or, which is why the Greens amendments are not acceptable to us. For anyone who does not understand it, 100 penalty units is a $10,000 fine.

        These amendments all relate to the removal of the appointment of a commission administrator and a Torres Strait administrator. I think that I have adequately canvassed why we find this to be iniquitous. The government has agreed to these amendments. As far as the opposition is concerned, they were the most offensive of the proposed changes to ATSIC and were non-negotiable in respect of any of the compromises that have been reached, not for the accommodation of the government but for the good management of ATSIC. This one was utterly non-negotiable. I am pleased that the government has agreed to support it.

        I canvass again that I believe that any reasonable personâ€”I have no doubt that this will be the view of historyâ€”who actually bothers to examine the record of this entire affair will agree that the entire package of proposals together, including special audit, freezing of funds and appointment of an administrator, was an absolutely inexcusable over&amp;hyphen;reaction, probably poll driven, by the government in respect of an  Aboriginal organisation. It was taken uniquely in respect of that organisation and not even contemplated in respect of any other organisation dispersing similar funds and having, I would respectfully suggest on the basis of audit advice, far greater problems than ATSIC has on its worst day.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There will always be problems with the accountability and disbursement of moneys in the order of $1 billion. But it should be pointed out once again that a reasonable person should also examine the breakup of
        <break page="3247" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that $1 billion. The minister referred to it in debate again today. It is $1 billion of public money. Fully one-third of that $1 billion goes to paying wages under CDEP. These are payments in respect of Aboriginal people who uniquely in Australia have elected to work for their social security benefits, something they do not have to do. To their enormous credit, entire communities do this.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Frankly, I think it would be very difficult to find any other isolated communities in Australia where you would get consensus on this issue to the extent you can in an Aboriginal community. Entire communities, for the community benefit, have agreed to forgo their legal entitlements under Australian law to collect unemployment benefits, which would in any case have to be dispersed by the government, and have elected to engage in community development employment programs for the benefit of the community. That is one-third of ATSIC's budget.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An additional one&amp;hyphen;third of the budget is taken up simply with the provision of essential services such as sewerage supplies and water supplies. These are services which every other isolated community in Australiaâ€”and there are many of themâ€”take for granted, Aboriginal or non&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal. That is two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the billion dollar ATSIC budget. As I have said before in respect of the quarantine that has now been imposed on that budget, it effectively removes two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the ATSIC budget from the operations of its commission. In that sense, it effectively makes something of a shell of the organisation. I have said before, and it deserves repeating at least once more, that it effectively imposes on the commission the dirty work of imposing horrifically large cuts on the remaining one&amp;hyphen;third of the ATSIC budget where they all fall: that is, on those programs that are absolutely essential in terms of the cultural enrichment and preservation of Aboriginal society, language and art, legal aid services and all the rest of it in Australia. It is horrendous, as far as the opposition is concerned, as is the government's entire performance on this issue.

         I am pleased that at least the government has agreed to remove this obnoxious provi sion. The reason I want to make that point is that, as significant a result as this is for ATSIC and for the Aboriginal people that it serves, it is a long way from being a satisfactory result as far as the opposition is concerned because of the entire shabby way in which the Aboriginal community of Australia and ATSIC have been treated in this matter.

         â€”The Democrats support these amendments. The government claimed from the beginning that we needed this extra layer of accountability and we have disagreed with them from the beginning. I remember the original debate which set up the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. We imposed layer upon layer of accountability on that commissionâ€”required in the main by the opposition of the dayâ€”so we have a high degree of accountability on regional councils and on the regional councillors who make up the council. We have a high degree of accountability on the board of ATSIC and on the individual commissioners who comprise the board of ATSIC.

         I have always believed that this extra level that does not applyâ€”this need for a special administrator which is not a requirement of any other comparable entity in this countryâ€”was done for the wrong reason. Senator Collins has canvassed his view of what may or may not have happened in a particular cabinet meeting and what the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) went in with and came out with. I think it is not an exaggeration to say that much of this was done in a knee&amp;hyphen;jerk way because of misconception about public con cern over Aboriginal organisational accountability in general.

        I am delighted that, as part of the cross&amp;hyphen;party consultation that has happened on the particular bill that we are discussing, the government has been willing to withdraw this proposal. It is this proposal, on top of the general direction, which led to that wider and misinformed public debateâ€”characterised by the maiden speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last nightâ€”and this climate of misinformation about Aboriginal advantage in this country. I really regret the context of this decision which said we needed to have a special administrator appointed. The context was that out there we have Aboriginal communities and organisations who cannot handle money or who are crooks or who are bludging off the Australian taxpayer and, therefore, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has to have the right to bring in, over and above everything that we have set in place, yet another layer called the special administrator. It was ill conceived, it was politically motivated and it was the wrong thing to do. I am delighted that you are withdrawing it, and I commend you.

        There needs to be, in my opinion and in the opinion of a number of people I have spoken to recently, a way of finding out from those people most affected what is working and what is not working. It would seem to me to require an independent, properly funded review that can take time to go into communities and allow communities to speak for themselves, to enable the traditional operations of decision making, especially in groups that do not necessarily get represented in all decisions that are made through the current system of ATSIC operation, such as women's groups, to take place. It would seem to me to be at least a two-phase process; firstly, to work out how to put such an inquiry together and, secondly, to provide sufficient resources and time for such a process to take place.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is my intention as a result of the debate so far not to put an amendment at this stage because that would be pre-empting what communities want and how they might want such an inquiry or review to take place. It is my intention to contact as many groups as I can in the near future to get their ideas about how such an inquiry might take place. If we are serious as a Senate in dealing with the issues of provision of services in allowing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to move towards a greater level of self-determination, then making decisions from the top is simply compounding the problem.

        I know that there are no simple answers to this but I do know that we have to spend a lot of time working out how we can go back and ask communities how they think they can have a say in how this process might be improved. It is the disempowerment that seems to be having a very great effect at the moment. As has been described to me in one particular instance, a small amount of money is provided to a group of ATSIC commissioners and they are told, `You must make a decision about where this small amount of money goes to.' So they talk, information is given, there are arguments from different groups, there is extra information and finally, through all of that process, a decision is
        <break page="3250" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         made. Then the minister can say, `No.' That seems to be not recognised in its level of disempowerment. Many decisions are being made at the moment. A lot of them are about land issues. The disbursement of funds, the level of community participation and decision making and the level of self-determination are all very important decisions.

        It seems to me that, if governments decide or even if we as a Senate decide how things should be done, we are forgetting that we should be doing our best to allow some process of real self&amp;hyphen;determination. As I say, it is my intention to write to groups, individuals and any interested people to find out what their ideas would be about how such a process could start, how it might be put together and how it might be effective in getting ideas about how this whole process could work better. There is no doubt that there are problems but it is my contention that we should be serious about finding out how we can make it better and not simply slash and burn from above to get some cheap political capital. That is the most distressing part of this whole venture today.

         â€”I would like to respond to some of those comments because I do not think we should let them stand without saying what ATSIC does. Someone has to say what ATSIC does: ATSIC reviews. It does not sit back and think everything is working perfectly. It is required to review regularly. You may have a disagreement about the success of the manner in which it communicates with its communities. Many communities are critical of that and the lack of balance in the two&amp;hyphen;way process. I think that is a legitimate concern.

        In structural terms, I do not think it is necessary to keep saying that we have to have another review and another review. In my view, the systemic failure is this: we have hugely insufficient funds to redress the disadvantage of indigenous people in this country. The previous government, this government and a proportion of the Australian population support the kind of ceiling that is on funding for this matter. While ever that decision is there in terms of the level of resourcing, it then requires, through the regional council process, Aboriginal communities to bid against each other in the most odious way for a very small pool of funds, and so many of them are disappointed time after time. This leads to division within communities and between communities, and that is a problem. It is the structure that causes that to happen, and the lack of adequate resources exacerbates it. That is the problem.

        Unless this Senate can appropriate so many more hundreds of millions of dollars for indigenous matters, I do not think a review can address what Senator Margetts's concerns encapsulate.

What I said was that, if the communities are concerned about the way ATSIC is operating, their concerns will not assuaged by a review by ATSIC. In the end, we must be willing to set up some process by which the communities feel that they are being brought into the process. As I say, this is not an easy thing to do. I admit that. But I am hearing from the communities that an electoral review, an ATSIC review or even a Senate review is not meeting those needs of the community to be

It is a comment on what I believe needs to be done for the future to make sure that ATSIC actually achieves its potential, if it is capable of doing so.

        program an item was screened concerning the John Bertrand America's Cup research and development syndicate. The allegation was made that taxpayers had paid millions of dollars for a yacht race and that somehow I, who at the time was minister in charge of the industry portfolio, had participated in a cover&amp;hyphen;up of this matter. I have been misrepresented previously on this matter and to my certain knowledge so has Mr Bertrand, and he may well take his own action.

       <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
        For my explanation I will give the facts of the matter. No cover&amp;hyphen;up of any sort occurred. It is true that there was some controversy in the tax concession committee of the Industry Research and Development Board, the committee that approves syndication, and that related to the nature of the reports the syndicate had given and the timing of the arrival of those reports. It was sorted out when Price Waterhouse was appointed by the Bertrand syndicate to take care of that business for it. It then complied. The tax concession committee voted to grant recognition to the Bertrand syndicate and registered it as a proper syndi cate, and the Industry Research and Development Board endorsed that decision.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As to my role in this, I had none. The reason is quite obvious. The IR&amp;D board and the tax concession committee are statutorily independent of the government and therefore of the minister. I had no role in directing their determination of any of the affairs before them. That is their obligation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The parallel situation is that of the Treasurer and the tax commissioner. The Treasurer cannot direct the tax commissioner in the conduct of his collection of tax. In a parallel situation, at that time I could notâ€”and absolutely rightly, in my viewâ€”direct this board to take action which could confer a monetary reward on a particular company. And I did not. If I had doneâ€”the implication of last night's program was that I should haveâ€”I would have acted improperly and ought to have been dealt with accordingly.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       A further allegation in this program was that I had received a letter from the board asking me to act, and that has been repeated on a number of occasions. The fact is that I did not. The fact is that some members of the tax concession panel wrote to me asking me to take sides in an issue that the panel were dealing with. As I have said before, this is a statutorily independent body and it is entirely inappropriate for a minister to do that. And I did not do that.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The committee itself never wrote to me on this matter, and the committee itself, as I have said, fully endorsed the syndicate as an appropriate syndicate. Not only did they do that, but the tax commissioner, who in matters of taxation has the final say and does not delegate his powers, also granted the concession to this body.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       A further misrepresentation concerns remarks by me that I had appointed former Commissioner of Taxation and distinguished Australian ambassador to the OECD, Mr Trevor Boucher, to chair the tax concession committee, which I had done, and Mr Boucher's resignation. The nature of the last report was to infer that he had resigned in relation to the matters that were the subject of the reportâ€”i.e. the syndicate. I am advised that Mr Boucher resigned because this
       <break page="3252" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        government cancelled syndication, thus removing the task that he had to do. He had no purpose in fulfilling that position, and he resigned for that reason.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       A further implication is that public servant Mr Alan Evans had to be shifted as a consequence of this. I am advised that the correct circumstance was that, as a consequence of a change of government, a change of structure within the department flowing from the appointment of a new secretary to the department and a downsizing of staff numbers in the department meant a transfer of some officers. That was the reason for Mr Evans's change of occupation within the department.

By any measure, the Australian performance at the Atlanta Paralympic Games was an awe&amp;hyphen;inspiring success. It even elicited superlatives from the most jaded of sports writers, and no doubt pride from many, if not all, Australians as they were enthralled and watched the enormous achievements of those people.

        The score line of 42 gold, 37 silver and 27 bronze medalsâ€”the largest medal haul per capita of any nation in the worldâ€”cemented our status as the premier paralympic sporting nation. Medal tallies are not really a good measure of success, and they are a poor measure of the achievement of these athletes, because each one of them has overcome life&amp;hyphen;transforming disabilities to do what they did.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         For many of them, simply learning to cope with the disabilities that they have either had from birth or have acquired through fate has been a challenge and an achievement in itself. Just overcoming the challenges of the activities of daily living is an heroic achievement on their part.

        <para first-indent="16">
         To transcend their disabilities and go further, to become athletes of international renown, is truly an awe&amp;hyphen;inspiring feat. Our paralympians, through their performance at Atlanta, remind us of the possibilities that arise when we challenge the limitations we face in life rather than living down to them. For many of us who complain about an ache here or a pain there or that something is pretty tough, we see what tough really is when we look at what they have achieved. They also remind us that we ought to judge people by what they can do rather than by what we think they can't do.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also want to comment on the behaviour of the paralympian athletes. Their achievements also remind us of the ethics of sporting activity. In these days when we all too frequently see in other areas of sport bad sportsmanshipâ€”we see violence, we see drug taking, we see complaintsâ€”it is worth noting that the Australian contingent at the Paralympics had no dope positives, no arrests for poor behaviour and no accusations of poor sportsmanship. We did not hear any of those sorts of comments coming out of the Paralympics that we had coming out of the Olympics themselves or other sporting activities even within our own country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the contrary, the newspaper reports commented on our athletes' friendliness, their cooperative attitude, even in the face of some very difficult organisational mishaps. So we should commend the paralympians not only on their performance as representatives of our nation but also on their performance in demonstrating the ethics of sport and what good sportsmanship is about. I think we can say that few countries have ever been so ably or well represented.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Paralympics have become truly an international event. To put our athletes' performances in perspective, we should consider some facts about the scope of the
         <break page="3253" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Paralympic games. The Paralympic games were the world's second largest sporting event. They were bigger than the World Series, the Super Bowl and the World Cup in terms of scope, number of participants and events. Over 110 nations were represented by some 3,500 athletes with disabilities.

         Australia was represented by 162 athletes, competing in track and field, swimming, cycling, basketball, rugby, shooting, goalball, lawn bowls, equestrian, powerlifting, tennis and judo, to name some of them. The competitors were elite athletes with physical, visual or mental impairments, representing four international federationsâ€”the blind, paraplegics and quadriplegics, people with cerebral palsy, amputees and others. In this context, the achievements of individual athletes stand out even more profoundly.

         By including some of them I will leave some of them out, and for that I am sorry. But as a Victorian I have particular pride in the achievements of our wheelchair racersâ€”John Lindsay and Lachlan Jones. Born with spina bifida, John Lindsay, the `wheelchair whiz', set a new world record in the 100 metres. To understand the magnitude of his achievements it is worth reflecting on a report in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald

         on 23 August, which states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         When John Lindsay first started racing the 100 metres, it was in a standard day chair and it took him two minutes to cover the distance. On Wednesday 21 August, the Victorian did it in 15.22 second, and won a Paralympic Gold medal.

        <para>
         His words on that day, when asked about his gruelling training regime and its inherent risks, were simple and profoundâ€”he said, `You get hurt, you get up, you go on.' Maybe former Senator Gareth Evans ought to take a lesson out of his bookâ€”you get hurt, you get up, you go on. He is suffering from a bit of relevance deprivation syndrome. Victorian Lachlan Jones, who has cerebral palsy, also set a world record in winning his race in the prestigious men's 100 metre wheelchair sprint.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another highlight of the games was the achievements of Perth athlete Kingsley Bugarin. Bugarin, a visually impaired veteran of three Paralympics, had never won a medal
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in his chosen sport of swimming. He smashed the 12&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old record of the USA's John Morgan in the men's individual medley B2 by 1.5 seconds, improving his own personal best by an incredible seven seconds. We saw parts of seconds being shaved off in the Olympics but here we see seven seconds slashed off his record. I think that ought to be noted.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another memorable event was the win of Queenslander Brian Harvey, who has cerebral palsy, in the men's javelin. After his gold medal winning throw of 34.7 metres, Harvey was apparently disappointed with his performance. He said, `It's not good enough. It's never good enough.' That is another message that maybe we, as politicians in this place, ought to take. The message they have given us is: when you get hurt, you get up, you go on and when you have achieved you say, `It's not good enough. It's never good enough.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Harvey's comments illustrate that the ideal of striving towards one's personal best is not an anachronism confined to manipulative advertising, as we have seen in some of the advertisements lately; it is alive and well in the paralympian teamâ€”striving to do one's best. After the commercialism of the Atlanta Olympics, I for one found it refreshing to hear that ideals of sportsmanship and achievement are still espoused by Australian athletes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Paralympics are a rallying point for the thousands of Australians with disabilities. Each individual achievement becomes a focus for thousands of other individual achievements. No doubt for many young people with disabilities the sorts of role models they saw in our paralympians will spur them on and give them encouragement to achieve. Hopefully each individual paralympic achievement sparks another person coping with the disability to reach beyond their limitations and to pursue a dream of representing their country in international competition.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I could go on about the achievements of Atlantaâ€”the achievements of the Australian team co&amp;hyphen;captain Priya Cooper, the games' most prolific medallist, winning six gold medals, a silver and bronze in the pool, or Gemma Dashwood collapsing on the pool deck after winning a silver medal in her first event. But I guess one of the finest moments

          occurred when the paralympians returned home and they were going through the streets of Sydney in the ticker tape parade.

I would like to congratulate our paralympians once again on their achievements. Like all of us, I look forward to watching them once again surpass all their goals and expectations in Sydney 2000. I am sure they will do us proud.

         â€”This afternoon I want to return to Wanneroo, which is a great place to live, and raise a matter that I raised some three weeks ago at the same time in this chamber. At that time I predicted that the pending royal commission interim report into the city of Wanneroo would be a whitewash. I take no joy in saying that my predictions were entirely accurate. Indeed, the commission report itself has a white cover on it.

        Mr McLeod helped Mrs Edwardes with an election campaign which he recalls was in "the early eighties", around 1984. Some members handed out How to Vote cards but, as a police officer, Mr McLeod said he restricted himself to driving elderly voters to the polling booth.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was very sloppy for the commissioner to record words and dates such as that. Mrs Edwardes stood first for the seat of Kingsley in the year 1988. She was elected to the parliament of Western Australia in early 1989, not the early 1980s, and most certainly and most decidedly not in 1984.

        It is interesting to note that, even though Detective McLeod worked for her campaign and was investigating one of her colleagues, a member of parliament and a councillor in the city of Wanneroo, Royal Commissioner Davis dismisses it in the findings that he has brought down.

        It must be kept in mind that the investigation was not into the conduct or activities of Mr and Mrs Edwardes. The target of the investigation was Mr Smith.

        In summary, Mr McLeod said he decided in June 1991 to erase the tapes and destroy the transcripts and monitoring sheets for three reasons. First, because there was nothing on the tapes of an evidentiary value; secondly, to comply with the Listening Devices Act; and thirdly, because some of the material on the tapes and in the transcripts was, in his opinion, politically sensitive. Mr McLeod explained that "nothing of an evidentiary nature" meant to him nothing of a criminal nature. There is no doubt that evidence of the commission of an offence is all that should have been of interest to Mr McLeod. As to the second explanation, it is questionable that the tapes and transcripts should have been destroyed before the operation was terminated in October 1991.

        In relation to the report, I also want to raise another extremely disturbing aspect. As I indicated earlier, I spoke in this place on 21 August on the matter of Wanneroo. My colleague Senator Ellison, a Liberal senator from Western Australia, came in on the adjournment speech on 22 August 1996. He refuted some of the things that I had been reported to have said in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        that same day, 22 August. The matter that I want to highlight and express grave concern about is this quote from Senator Ellison. He said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are those in Western Australia who are simply not happy with the interim report of the royal commission which cleared Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever.

       <para>
        I ask the Senate to take note of the dates. It was 22 August 1996 when Senator Ellison sat in this place and made that statement. I am quoting directly from the print which comes from the computer, and which is available here in Parliament House.

        The interim report of the royal commission into the City of Wanneroo was actually given to the Governor of Western Australia, and it was reported in all our media, because of that, on Friday, 30 August 1996. The report did not actually become public until it was tabled in the Western Australian state parliament on Tuesday, 3 September. I made the assertion
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that the corruption that has occurredâ€”and that, hopefully, has been stamped out now in Wanneroo because there have been many investigations into itâ€”reached right to the top of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I hope that what Senator Ellison said, in his admission to the chamber on 22 August 1996, is not an indication that it has reached right to this place, because it brings the whole matter of law and order in my state of Western Australiaâ€”indeed, throughout Australiaâ€”into complete and utter disrepute when a royal commission's findings could reach the hands of a member of parliament who is not directly connected with the royal commission.

         â€”Last Wednesday, one of Australia's most important export industries released details of a comprehensive study it had commissioned into how it can ensure its future sustainability. The sugar industry was presented with a detailed environmental audit of its operations aimed at ensuring cane farming is not only economically viable, but also environmentally sustainable. It set out to establish a benchmark of environmental performance for use in evaluating the effect of future farming practices.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At present the industry's economic viability is not a real concern. It has grown over the last 130 years to a point where it is now the nation's second most valuable agricultural crop, generating $2 billion of income each year. The industry is particularly valuable in my state of Queensland, where 95 per cent of the country's entire supplies are produced. Indeed, my home town of Ayr is virtually slap&amp;hyphen;bang in the middle of the Burdekin canegrowing region, which accounts for 36 per cent of the state's sugar crop.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Although, as these impressive figures show, the industry is building on its economic success, its peak representative bodyâ€”Canegrowersâ€”recognises that the industry must be ecologically sustainable. For this reason it commissioned an independent consultant, Gutteridge Haskins &amp; Davey, to perform this environmental audit. The audit was conducted over four months of field work. The double pronged project involved interviews with 180 industry stakeholders and the performance of 130 farm audits right along the 2,100 kilometres of the canegrowing coast of Queensland.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The audit was carried out at complete arm's length from the industry and from any pressure groups that might have been around, and in accordance with the strictest international standards. It looked at sensitive issues which need to be addressed to ensure the industry's
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         longevity. These included air emissions, land and water management, dangerous goods and chemical usage, and fertiliser management.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There were some general findings which the consultants believe should be seriously considered by the industry. A major need was found to exist for both greater industry education of stakeholders and consultation with them. Whilst the results are obviously the bottom line, the perception of the sugar industry's environmental achievements is sadly lacking, with more than 60 per cent of the stakeholders interviewed considering growers' environmental measures in need of improvement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report also found that a concerted education program was needed to show farmers the benefits of adopting green practices. This would promote strategies designed to improve their individual crops without impacting on the wider off&amp;hyphen;farm environment. The audit team found that, in general, growers would willingly do the right thing, but often did not due to lack of appropriate information.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Airborne emissions from industry practices were extensively evaluated by the report, with one of the single largest concerns raised during stakeholder interviews being that of cane firing. The seasonal burn&amp;hyphen;offs are not only visible but also emotive, with many peopleâ€”particularly those residing near farming landsâ€”being concerned about the environmental effects of the practice and the subsequent black ash, or `snow' as it is called up our way, that firing introduces. I know that my wife and I, and other people like us who hang out the washing, are always concerned about that snow during the crushing season, although that is a pretty minor aspect of it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But, partly in response to community pressures, growers have commenced action to reduce this problem by switching to green cane harvesting in many parts of Queensland. Since 1982, the percentage of the Queensland crop harvested green has increased by two per cent to over 40 per cent. In North Queensland as many as 83 per cent of farmers cut their cane green. The report raises the possibility that in future all of Queensland's 6,300 cane farmers might harvest their entire crops in this fashion.
       </para>
       <break page="3258" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, coming from the Burdekin, as I do, I know that, in spite of the best intentions of the industry, there are special factors that exist in some regions, particularly the Burdekin, which will preclude this. One of the hurdles is that in the Burdekin particularly, which is very flat and dry and in which, as a result, irrigation is used extensively for the crops, the foliage or trash that would be produced by green harvesting would lie in irrigation drains and would block water supply to large areas of cane. A second hurdle is caused by the sheer size of the cane crop in the Burdekin district, which is amongst the largest and the heaviest in the world. The machines used to harvest green cane are not able to do so as efficiently with the heavy crops in the Burdekin as with the smaller crops in some other areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, recently, there were some reports about Weil's disease, from rats in the cane, which has surfaced because some of the cane crops are not being fired. That is something that really has to be looked at. Canegrowers are being encouraged to look at that and also to review aerial spraying techniques, which concern communities in canegrowing areas. These days, only a few districts practise aerial spraying. The damage that used to occur in years gone by to townsfolk and to their vegetable and fruit gardens is not quite as much in evidence. There have been a lot of advances made in that area in the past few years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The consultants also reviewed a number of concerns relating to management of farming lands, a key one being the continued expansion of farming lands. While expansion is currently economically beneficial, the audit confirmed that the desire to grow must be tempered by a balance with careful and responsible use of land. Interviews showed that conservationists believed that the government was not doing this and that it was too eager to expand beyond sustainable limits. The Queensland coalition government has announced a moratorium on expansion of one of the state's key sugar areasâ€”the Burdekin River irrigation area. This shows that the current state government has a responsible approach to ensuring sustainable farming. It
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          is an approach that could be looked at by other governments.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might say that, in last night's Queensland state budget, another $23 million was provided for capital works in water in the Burdekin River irrigation area to complete some capital works that need to be done. I should also mention that I am just a fraction concerned about the approach of the previous government to the expansion of cane lands in the upper Burdekin area. To my way of thinking, it did not allow sufficient corridors and reserves for animals. That was something that the Burdekin Shire Council, more than a decade ago, when I was actually on the Burdekin Shire Council, asked the government to consider in its expansion of sugar lands. I am a little bit disappointed that there does not seem to have been enough attention paid to that particular matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Soil erosion and expansion on to marginal lands that are not entirely suitable for canegrowing were also tagged by the audit as potential industry problems. The consultants recommended that growers maintain a property management plan and information detailing ongoing soil changes on their properties. At present this is largely not being done.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The management of water and waste water in canegrowing activities was also causing some concern for industry stakeholders. Around 65 per cent of growers use some form of irrigation, and the consultants believed that the potential for water related environmental damage was a concern. The most significant problem appeared to be the effect of farm discharge on off&amp;hyphen;farm waterways and associated land areas, including erosion and nutrient loading. At present there is a lack of solid data to quantify the suspected detrimental effects that unchecked emissions may have on waterways. The consultants recommended the industry establish a monitoring system of water quality in waterways and creeks to counter the negative perceptions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Farmers' use of hazardous goods and chemicals was also tagged as an area in this environmental report. In this regard, however, the report showed that growers have displayed sound practices which minimise environmental risks. A decreasing amount of chemical
         <break page="3259" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          solutions is being used to control pests and diseases, and growers' knowledge of their application, management and storage was found to be excellent. I know, from my conversations and from living in a canegrowing community, that farmers have for many years had a very high appreciation of the dangers of uncontrolled use of chemicals in fertiliser and in pest control. The audit team found that there was no suggestion of excessive rates of fertiliser being used. Again, I know a lot of canegrowers are trying to grow their crops using natural enhancements to canegrowing rather than the application of chemical fertilisers. Past farming practices may not have had widespread approval, but the audit did highlight that the industry was heading in the right direction.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I should stress that the audit report is simply that at this stage. At the time of the launch last Wednesday, the industry had not had the opportunity to go through the report in any detail or to challenge some of its findings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were some findings which did seem, at face value, to be of some concern. For example, the report said that acid soils comprised nine per cent of canegrowing land. That statement was a surprise to me. It was also a surprise to many of the canegrowers at the launch. Those findings were challenged on the spot. Of course, it is now up to the industry to look at that report, to comment on it and to move from that point.

         The Queensland Canegrowers Council has given an undertaking to seriously evaluate the recommendations raised in the audit.

         I should say, as an aside, that it is disappointing that, at the time that the industry is doing such good work in its own backyard, the union movementâ€”with typical disregard for the industry and all the people who are supported by it: growers, millers, the communities and the contractorsâ€”decided a couple of days ago to go out on strike tomorrow over

         â€”I rise by way of personal explanation in relation to a matter that Senator McKiernan raised a short time ago in the chamber. He referred to a speech I made in the Senate on 22 August this year, wherein I mentioned the interim report of the royal commission in Western Australia, which had not yet been delivered. At the time, I said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are those in Western Australia who simply are not happy with the interim report of the royal commission which cleared Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, that was a slip of the tongue, a mistake made by me. When one looks at the context in which it was said, one can readily see that that was so. I had been talking about an address that counsel had been making to the commissioner and the fact that the counsel assisting the commissioner, and the commissioner himself, were not able to defend any comments made about them because the matter was still continuing. Indeed, what I meant to have said, or should have said, at that stage was that there were those in Western Australia who simply would not be happy with an interim report of the royal commission which `would clear' Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is indeed a long bow to draw to imply that I had any knowledge of what the commission's finding was going to be. If there is any implication to that effect, I reject it out of hand. That implication, indeed, would be to imply that the royal commissioner had collaborated with me, which is totally untrue. It would imply that there was, indeed, some corruption on the part of the commission and myself, which I reject entirely. If a slip of the tongue is the best that the opposition has to hang its hat on in this matter, then I am indeed sorry for them.

         I am grateful to Senator McKiernan for giving me notice of the fact that he was going to make mention of me in this matter. I must say that I refute entirely his comments. One only has to look at the press in Western Australia to see that Cheryl Edwardes and her husband were cleared. The public of Western Australia believe that, and it was a matter that the state government was indeed confident in. It called the royal commission. The Premier has stated on a number of occasions that he was confident that Cheryl Edwardes and her husband would be cleared, and it was a confidence which I myself always shared with the Premier.

         That was the situation, Madam Acting Deputy President. There was nothing more or less to it than that. To imply anything further as a result of some slip of the tongue is indeed stretching things too far, and I reject any implication whatsoever that there was any collaboration or collusion between the royal commission and myself in this matter or that I had any knowledge of what was to come. I may have been confident as to the outcomeâ€”as I have indeed been in a good many cases that I have observed and been a party toâ€”but I have also been not too confident on some cases which I have been a party to and have observed in the past. But the evidence in this case was indeed strong. As eloquently put by Narelle Johnson, the counsel assisting the royal commission, the evidence was undeniably there which led to the clearing of Mr and Mrs Edwardes.

         â€”The government's decision in the budget to impose a 15 per cent surcharge on contributions for higher income earners has been universally accepted and welcomed as making the superannuation system much more fair and equitable. I think even Senator Sherry accepts that point. It is something that Labor, throughout its years in government, steadfastly refused to do. Indeed, the inequities and excessive concessionality in the system for higher income earners were two of the major flaws of the previous government's system.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So far as the administration arrangements for the 15 per cent surcharge are concerned, Senator Sherry is broadly correct in terms of the mechanics, but they are still being finalised. The government is having discussions with the superannuation funds and with other interested parties and will be doing all we can to ensure that the administrative costs are minimised.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have deliberately chosen the course that we have so far as administration is concerned so that we will be imposing no additional burden whatsoever on contributors or employers. It is trueâ€”we have acknowledged it up front from day oneâ€”that there will be some administrative costs imposed on the funds and there will be also additional work imposed on the Australian Taxation Office. We have resourced the Taxation Office to take account of that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The additional administrative costs and activities will vary from one fund to another, but I can assure the Senate that much of the wild, speculative rumour running around about how much additional burden will be imposed on the superannuation funds in their administration is just thatâ€”rumour. It is speculative, it is unsubstantiated and you will find that many of the funds are in fact supportive of the arrangements because, as the government moves further down the superannuation route in terms of co-contribution and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        We are making the situation more efficient. We are going to minimise the administration costs. We are negotiating and discussing that with the funds. I have held two seminars in the last week with major players in the industry. There is, I think, a growing understanding of the situation and a growing understanding of the fact that not only is the arrangement fair and equitable and produces, therefore, highly desirable benefits in the superannuation system but also at the end of the day we will have a more administratively efficient superannuation system.

        Of course, as you are aware, the surcharge applies to employer contributions and, for an unfunded scheme, there are no such contributions to apply the tax to. Therefore, in the interests of equity for all superannuants and superannuant contributors, there will have to be arrangements made that will apply fairly and equitably to people, whether they are members of funded or unfunded schemes. The actuarial committee is examining and reporting on that at the moment.

        The provision for the return of HECS revenue to universitiesâ€”something the previous government was never prepared to doâ€”for overenrolled students will, of course, provide further opportunities. I note that one university has already announced that it expects it will have a 10 per cent overenrolment next year. A 10 per cent overenrolment across the sector would mean an additional 36,000 places. Universities would receive an additional $90 million in HECS contributions for those placesâ€”something, I remind you, Madam President, the previous government was never prepared to do. When universities overenrolled, the previous government took HECS from the students and kept the HECS itself instead of giving it to the universities.

        This government's commitment to expanding opportunities for participation in education is absolutely unequivocal. The only reduction in government funded places that the government is seeking is in course work postgraduate degrees. It is important to understand that this reduction takes place against massive expansion in the last decade, particularly in the last five years. Since 1985, course work masters degrees have expanded by 200 per cent. Research masters degrees have doubled over 10 years. PhD places have doubled over the past four years and increased by 175 per cent since 1985. Government funding for

        The reductions in government funding for course work degrees will achieve a more appropriate balance between the public and private funding. Much of the expansion in higher education under Labor was in postgraduate education, giving people from generally privileged backgrounds second and third degrees. What senators opposite do not want to hear is that between 1989 and 1992â€”wait for this, because you probably do not know itâ€”the number of people undertaking first degrees actually fell from 102,000 to 93,000. In other words, the previous government was happy to see the opportunities for new graduates to fall and to put those places into people getting their second and third degrees. We think it is more equitable to increase the places for undergraduate students.

        The implication in the senator's question is that, if there is any move out of superannuation, that will have a detrimental effect on national savings. That, of course, is a false assumption because it depends entirely on where the funds might go and the uses to which they would be put. There is no earthly reason to expect that they would be put to less savings and more consumption than would otherwise be the case.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So far as any move away is concerned, and it is highly questionable to what extent that will happen, the funds could go into other forms of savings. If there is a repackaging of salary packages, that will not necessarily have a negative impact on the revenue because if, as the senator suggests, there is more into the FBT area, then there is a higher FBT take by the Commonwealth. So the assumptions on which the senator's question is based are inaccurate and false.

Clearly, this is not sophisticated enough for the invisible dangers which have emerged in recent years and to which I have referred.

The Meat Industry Council project 2 that you referred to is the pilot study of company delivered meat inspection operating under an AQIS approved comprehensive plant HACCP quality assurance, with continuous AQIS validation. It is being conducted at five Australian export abattoirs.

        The objectives of the pilot study are to integrate HACCPQA with traditional inspection and provide an overall quality and scientific culture and approach to the Australian meat industry. This will enhance our meat safety with a better preventative strategy against invisible contaminants. It also provides a structured operational framework to ensure better process control and traceability of product. The pilot study willâ€”

         â€”I thank Senator O'Brien for his question, which gives me an opportunity to remind the Senate of the enormous benefit that the government gave small business in this budget by its decision to provide exemption from capital gains tax for the rollover of a small business into another like business. It is something that has been very much in the minds of small business for many years. They have suffered unnecessary and very costly deprivation in terms of cash flow and funds availability because of the application under the previous Labor government of the capital gains tax without exemption on rollover. It is a decision in the budget that has been very widely welcomed by the small business community and by anyone interested in the growth of the Australian economy, the growth of employment, jobs and all the other things that flow from a healthier economy, social as well as economic. So I thank you for that opportunity.

        With regard to the particular issue that you have raised, it is correct that the capital gains tax relief applies in relation to assets rather than shares, but because the small business person will benefit from the capital gains tax relief in relation to the sale of assetsâ€”if that is what they do, to roll over into another like businessâ€”there will be an indirect benefit which will flow through to the owner of the company, if that is the way that they are so structured. The technical as distinct from the end impact will vary depending on whether the small business is incorporated or unincorporated. But in both casesâ€”in one case more directly and in the other more indirectlyâ€”both will benefit.

         â€”I would like to thank Senator Boswell very much for that question. It is interesting that we have been in government for six months now and the first question we have had from the opposition relating to small business came from a new senator today. He was silly enough to ask a question on the minutiae of capital gains tax when it was his government that brought in capital gains tax.

        The Labor government never recognised or had any understanding whatsoever of the small business sector. It did not recognise that there are 800,000 small business people out there who create real jobs. You went out of your way over a long period of time to make it difficult for those people to create those jobs. We all know the reasonâ€”because the industrial arm of the Labor Party does not like small business; they are traditionally non-union employees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What this government is doing after 13 years of devastation by the Labor government of the past is attacking the budget deficit. By doing that, the government will ensure a downward pressure on interest rates. This is vital for small business, which borrows some $46 billion from the Australian banks. The previous government's irresponsible fiscal policy, to which Senator Boswell referred, crippled many small businesses and, in the process, created high unemployment, particularly among young people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have kept our election commitment to reduce the provisional uplift factor. This will inject $180 million into the small business sector, which they will then use to reinvest. We have kept our election commitment to allow small business to defer the capital gains tax arising from the sale of their business to a like business or to use it to fund retirement. Again, you never understood all that; it was beyond you. You did not understand that small business people build up their businesses for their own retirement funds. The previous government refused to do this.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have stopped the contentious tax law No. 5 which was introduced by the previous government. It would have changed the status of subcontractors, creating not only a nightmare for small business but yet another union type push to make contractors employees rather than contractors. The roping in of the industrial side became the roping in of the fiscal side. We have raised the threshold for fringe benefits tax exemptions to ease the compliance burden for small business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I could give the chamber many more examples of the benefits of the budget that we bring to small business. One of the most important ones is the industrial relations reform. You were so out of touch in government. If you had had your ears and eyes half open you would have realised that the greatest disincentive to employment by the small business sector was the unfair dismissal clause in the Industrial Relations Act.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, former Senator Gareth Evans, is now, as he says, suffering from relevance depravation syndrome. Now he knows how small business felt over the 13 disastrous years of Labor government.

I am advised that the program was announced as a $278 million, four-year program for health card holders and their adult dependants in the 1993 budget and commenced in most states in January 1994. Four-year agreements were signed with states subject to appropriation. That will have come to an end at the end of this financial year. We are finishing it six months early.

         â€”There has been a degree of misunderstanding promulgated largely by the Labor Party with respect to this government's proposals on labour market assistance for the unemployed. It might be of interest to some to understand that over the next four years the government will spend $5.4 billion on labour market program assistance. I am asked by Senator Abetz to compare that with labour market expenditure by the previous government. In the equivalent number of years up until 1993-94, that is, in the pre-Working Nation years, the previous government spent $4.9 billion in real terms, that is, in prices that are constant. In the four years prior to Working Nation the previous
         <break page="3273" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        It is important to clarify some of these points. Only yesterday, when I indicated that we were spending $1.6 billion next year, Senator West interjected: `That is over four years.' Some members opposite seem to think that that expenditure is over four years when it is just next year's expenditure. In 1990-91, when unemployment was at 8.3 per cent, about the same level as it is now, labour market spending by the previous government in today's prices was only $640 million. That is, the last time unemployment was at around this level the previous government spent half the amount that we are planning to spend next year in today's prices. In 1992-93, when unemployment was at 11 per cent, labour market expenditure by the previous government was only $40 million more than will be spent this year. That is when unemployment was at the all-time high of 11 per cent under the previous Labor government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Last year, when unemployment was at around 8.5 per cent, labour market spending was $2.2 billion. That is an important point to note because it highlights the fact that Labor, under its Working Nation programâ€”which did not workâ€”was wasting labour market expenditure money. The proof of that is that last year, when unemployment was about 8.5 per cent, they spent $2.2 million, and unemployment is still at about 8.5 per cent. That only serves to highlight the ineffectiveness of the Working Nation program. It is important to note that in the last financial year, the previous government spent, I think, $860 million on the three least effective programs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you and I, Madam President, were to go to low income taxpayers through to high income taxpayers and say: `Would you like us to spend $860 million of your money on the three least effective programs we can find?', the answer would be: `No, we do not want you to do that.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In summary, we are spending more in real prices in the four years post&amp;hyphen;Working Nation than the previous government spent in the four years prior to Working Nation. We are spending double the amount of money in real prices that they spent in 1990-91, when
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         unemployment was at around the same level. The figures only demonstrate how much money they spent in order to promote themselves without creating real jobs and real opportunities for Australians.

        On Monday, during Question Time in the Senate, Senator Woodley asked me a question without notice concerning the budget measure to apply a deeming rate of 5 per cent to the first $2000 (and $4000 for a couple) held in deposits or cash.

        Pensioners whose only source of private income is from financial investments can only be affected by this proposal if they have total financial investments of more than $45,000 ($78,000 for couples) and they are receiving less than 5% on some of their deposits.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Pensioners with total deposits with financial institutions of less than $2,000 cannot be affected by this measure unless they have significant amounts of other income or assets. If a pensioner has relatively few assets and small levels of private income, he or she will continue to receive the full pension because of the general income test "free areas". These free areas allow pensioners to have assessed income of up to $49 a week ($86 a week for couples) without any effect on their pension.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The estimate that 600,000 persons in receipt of a pension paid by the Department of Social Security will be affected by this proposal was based upon records of pensioner investments and the interest rates paid on them as at 1 December 1995. All of these pensioners have relatively high levels of
        <break page="3274" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         income and assets. The average loss in pension was estimated at around 50 cents per fortnight. The maximum possible pension loss is $2 a fortnight. This was then used to make assumptions on a possible impact on allowance recipients.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, Social Security recipients who could be affected by the proposal could reinvest their low interest savings to earn more interest at the deeming rates, thereby increasing their total income. Some of those affected will already have done this.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this regard I am advised that nearly all of the deeming accounts offered by financial institutions (including those offered by the four major banks) pay interest at least equal to the deeming rates if the balance is over $2,000. Pensioners with total deposit savings of over $2,000 could therefore easily reinvest their low interest savings to obtain the deeming rate. Deeming accounts are at call and are easily accessible. Some deeming accounts pay the deeming rate of 5% even if the balance is below $2,000. Our information indicates that Westpac, the Bank of Melbourne, Challenge Bank and some building societies and credit unions offer this facility.

         â€”Perhaps you should acknowledge, Senator Short, where this new tax measure was in your election commitment, because it makes no mention of it. In fact, you went to great pains and efforts before the last election, as I am sure you have been told by people who are affected by this new measure, to say that you would not be introducing any new surcharges, any new charges or any new taxes. This is a direct breaking of that commitment that you gave before the election.

        But putting aside that issue, where we raise our concerns is with the way in which you propose to collect this new surcharge, because the effect of this new surcharge and the administrative arrangements that you have announced to date is that the superannuation funds will have to establish effectively de facto miniature tax offices within the funds themselves in order to collect this new surcharge.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the fascinating things about this issueâ€”and Senator Short went very, very close to misleading the Senate on this matter when he talked about funds welcoming the administrative arrangementsâ€”is that I have not yet met or had any submission from any superannuation fund that has welcomed the proposed administrative arrangements of this new surcharge. There has not been one fund. In fact, to the contrary. There have been many funds who have complained bitterly about the administrative complexity involved in the collection of this new 15 per cent surchargeâ€”and not only that issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point of the question in question time related to the cost of the administration of this new surcharge being passed on to all people in superannuation. All of the 15 million superannuation accounts will have to pay a part of the administrative cost of this new surcharge that is supposed to apply only to people earning more than $70,000. Senator
        <break page="3277" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Short did not acknowledge, in response to my question, that there will be some people who earn less than $70,000 who will be affected by this new surcharge. Looking at the puzzled face of Senator Short, that is people who do not provide their tax file number or may not know that they have to provide it. I see you are nodding in agreement.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So there will be a range of people who earn less than $70,000, who will have to be taxed this new 15 per cent surcharge in addition to the other 15 per cent in, 15 per cent out. They will be granted a refund, but the complexity of doing that, returning money to members' accounts, will be very, very difficult and very, very costly.

The question outlined the complete administrative nightmare that this initiative by the government will create.

        Senator Short said that this administrative nightmare, as described by Senator Sherry, was broadly correct. What he could not do, of course, was explain how this new tax that the government has introduced, despite its election commitments to the contrary, would be implemented. This tax was introduced on 20 August this year. It is already in operation. We are not talking about government plans; we are talking about a tax that the government has introduced.

         espouse the rhetoric of attacking the rich and protecting the poor. But the reality of this measure is that the superannuation funds will have to meet the huge cost of administering this program. In doing so, the cost will be spread among all the fund members. So all 15 million accounts will have to be assessed, and the costs associated with that process will be spread among all working men and women who are paying into superannuation. Senator Short either does not know that or refuses to admit it. It is a cost on all people contributing to superannuation.

We are doing the job for the people, getting the economy back on track.

It is an absolute monstrous lie and a monstrous distortion of the truth to suggest that RSAs are going to be simply provided by the banks. He knows that absolutely.

         What we have done in this budget in relation to superannuationâ€”and, indeed, to many other thingsâ€”is to introduce an element of fairness into the system which Labor, in 13 years, had not the courage nor the willingness to do. This attempted attack on administrationâ€”and it has fallen sickeningly short of any sort of attackâ€”is all about the fact that you are worried about your mates in the union movement that you propped up and protected for 13 years. You gave them a special privileged position which will no longer continue. There is also a considerable amount of detail contained in the budget papers in relation to the proposals.

         We are also consulting widely. We have an actuarial committee set up to advise on many of these matters. Of course, the legislation has still to be drafted and introduced after we have had the consultation. The difference between us and the opposition is that we believe in consultation. We believe in having legislation which is framed in the best possible way after the best consultation you can get. Labor is absolutely opposed to consultation, and that is why they are so concerned about the situation at the moment. There is much detail already there. The remaining detail, of course, will be contained in the legislation when it is introduced over the coming weeks and months.

        Some four weeks ago it was my privilege to lead a representative group of Vietnam veterans to Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. This visit was part of the Australia Remembers Vietnam 1962-

         1973 commemorative program. It was but one of several activities held last month to mark Vietnam Veteran's Dayâ€”August 18. That is the day that we recall Australia's involvement in the Vietnam conflict and the courage, commitment and sacrifice of the 59,000 Australians who had a role to play in it. In particular it is a time to remember the 508 Australians who, in the course of the Vietnam conflict, gave their lives in the service of their country.

        It was particularly significant in commemorating our involvement in Vietnam, that we were able to take a representative group of Vietnam veterans, back to Vietnam. It enabled the veterans to confront and understand many of the memories that have been with them and their families for the last thirty years. It was an opportunity for them to see the beauty of the country and the warmth of the people, when mostly they could only remember the ugliness and the horror of war. And now those who were part of the delegation have the opportunity to share that experienceâ€”a profoundly healing oneâ€”with their families, friends and fellow veterans.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was an honour and a privilege for me to be in the company of thirty such fine Australians. Their remarkable good humour, support for one another and pride in their country was a true highlight of the visit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I would like to report to Members of the House some of the significant events of the visit and then outline what I believe are the major benefits that will come to all Australians as a result of this visit. It was an experience which deserves to be shared.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, may I express my appreciation to my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Alexander Downer. His personal efforts and representations to the Vietnamese government were critical to the visit's success. I would also like to record my thanks to Australia's Ambassador to Vietnam, Her Excellency, Ms Sue Boyd, and the staff of the Australian Embassy in Hanoi and the Australian Consulate-General in Ho Chi Minh City. Without their unflagging efforts, the visit would not have been the outstanding success, that ultimately, it was.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I must also say how much the Australian Government has appreciated the assistance and cooperation of the Government of Vietnam and the Peoples Committees in the provinces we visited, in making the tour program possible. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam more than twenty years ago, the relationship between our two countries has continued to grow in strength. We value this relationship very much and I am sure that visits such as these can only add to that strength. I understand that the Vietnamese Government were very satisfied with the way in which the veterans' visit proceeded.

        We are grateful, too, to the High Commissioners of Malaysia and Singapore and their staff, for the assistance they provided to the delegation while we were visiting those countries. The assistance provided by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore was also very much appreciated by the members of the delegation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The visit program, which began on 11 August, involved 27 Vietnam Veterans, 2 widows and a descendant of a serviceman killed in Vietnam. These thirty people were randomly selected to represent the more than 59,000 Australians who served in Vietnam. All three arms of the services were represented as well as philanthropic organisations and official entertainers who had served in Vietnam. All States and the two territories of Australia were represented in the group. The Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Member for Cunningham, was also part of the delegation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first major commemorative activity of the tour was a ceremony at the Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia. It is here that 24 Australian servicemen killed in Vietnam are buried, including Major Peter Badcoe VC, whose widow, Mrs Denise Clark, was one of the veteran party.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the prologue in the order of service noted: "The graves here have not been kept separate from others in the cemetery. They have not been put to one side as though they did not belong, but neither have they been held up as heroes. Though it is called a military cemetery, it is very much a community cemetery. There are children here, and wives. There are young soldiers and older ones. In one way, this is as it should be. Our veterans, taken by circumstance and duty from us, have in death been returned to the wider community".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In a moving and, for some, a very emotional ceremony we recalled the sacrifice made by all those Australians who died in Vietnam. The Australian serviceman or woman draws on a proud tradition stretching back nearly 100 years. The hallmarks across the years have been dedication, a pride in their work, a seriousness of purpose and a sense of achievement. In Vietnam that tradition was carried on.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore our second commemorative service recalled all who had served in Vietnam. After the laying of wreaths, we moved a short distance to the Kranji Military Cemetery where the first Australian serviceman to be killed in action in Vietnam is buried. Warrant Officer Kevin Conway was a member of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He was killed in July 1964 when the Special Forces outpost of Nam Dong was attacked by enemy forces.

        As we arrived in Vietnam and throughout the duration of the visit, we were greeted with genuine warmth and friendship. From the Vice-Minister for Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, Mr Nguyen Van Quang to the Vice President of the Ho Chi Minh City War Veterans Association, Major General Nguyen Van Si, right through to the humblest of the village folk, the welcome was always the sameâ€”warm and friendly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During my calls on Vice Minister Quang and Major General Si I was able to stress that this visit by the delegation of veterans demonstrated the sincerity of Australia's commitment to Vietnam. They stressed that the Australian level of commitment was reciprocated.

        At the Dong Nai museum in Bien Hoa, we were privileged to see the original Long Tan Cross, erected by Australians after the battle of Long Tan, which was fought on 18 August 1966. In that battle, D Company of 6RAR, held off a numerically superior enemy force. Eighteen Australians lost their lives in the battle.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Possibly the most poignant moments of the visit came when the group reached the Long Tan battlefield itself. In August 1966, when the battle raged, it was a rubber plantation. Today the area is a cornfield. Nevertheless, the Long Tan Cross site is still preserved in the middle of the field. A replica of the original cross has been made and erected in the original location. The site itself is in good repair and clearly regarded with respect as there is an undisturbed area around the site which has not been ploughed up. It is obvious that the villagers of Long Tan care for the site which means so much to Australians.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The cross itself is believed to be located at the point were Jim Richmond, another member of our party, was found, wounded, the day after the battle of Long Tan.

        On August 18, Vietnam Veteran's Day, we were joined by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the Honourable Tim Fischer, for a ceremony at Nui Dat. This would be the first time an Australian government group would hold a commemorative ceremony in Vietnam.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Deputy Prime Minister's address highlighted the cost to both sides in the war. He said: "Inevitably, of course, we remember the heroism of our friends and comrades. But we also acknowledge the courage of those Vietnamese against whom we fought. In the years since the war, many of us have come to know our former opponents as friends and so it is natural that, at a service such as this, we honour the Vietnamese fallen."
       </para>

        The veterans then joined the Deputy Prime Minister and many local officials and veterans for the unveiling of a plaque by Mr Fischer at the site of the Ba Ria Australian Vietnam Veterans' Recon

        This centre will provide the necessary facilities to care for many of the district's less fortunate children. Funding for the project comes from AVVRG members themselves with a contribution from the Australian Government. Australian companies in Vietnam have also been able to contribute to this project through the provision of building materials. This project is an important one, giving as it does, hope to those children in the Ba Ria Vung Tau province who will use its facilities. In any country, Vietnam as well as Australia, children are the future, and anything that we can do to ensure that they are given every opportunity to develop their potential as good citizens and leaders of the community should be encouraged.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        But for me one of the important benefits of this visit program was the linkages that were made with many who once were enemy. Time and time again, from officials, from retired Vietnamese army officers who had once fought against Australians, came the message: "It is time to put the past behind us, build links for the future, but never forget those who suffered and died."
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is the message that I have conveyed to Australian ex-service organisations, most recently at the RSL's National Congress held last week in Tweed Heads.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the orphanage site, for example, the now retired Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Van Kiem, former commanding officer of D445 battalion which fought against the Australian forces at Long Tan, chatted enthusiastically with our veterans. We also met with Colonel Nguyen Thanh Hong, the former operations officer of 5 VC Division and the planner of the Battle of Long Tan. Colonel Hong has been quite ill, and it speaks volumes, I think, that he made such a determined effort to meet with us.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For some of those veterans or family members who went on this revisit program there were, I am sure, moments of deep, and perhaps painful, reflection. For some it may have meant a stepping away from the past, a closing of a chapter in their lives. For others, it was confirmation that our two countries can put aside the past, and work together as regional neighbours.

        These thirty veterans, were ambassadors for all Australians and particularly for the 59,000 who served in Vietnam. The significance of our involvement in Vietnam should not be understated.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        But despite the hope and promise we all share for the future, we can not and must not, forget the personal price that many Australians paid in serving their country. It was a turbulent time in our nation's history and tragically many of our veterans and their families felt the impact of that turbulence during their service and on their return home.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The comments of one of the veterans at the Welcome Home reception hosted at Sydney airport by my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, crystallised for me, the healing value of visits such as these. After the first commemorative ceremony, the memories and the emotion were too much, he said. He thought he couldn't go on. After the second ceremony in Singapore, again he thought, this is too much, I can't go on. After the visit to Long Tan, he knew it would be hard, but he wanted to go on. The healing had begun. Now he would like to take his family on a return visit.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would not be out of place I believe, if I were to paraphrase part of what I said at the ceremony at Kranji. "To each of you who served in Vietnam, we say thank you. We know that for some the cost was high. For some it was their very lives; for others it was a hurt and suffering that even the passage of time has not yet healed. But we recognise and value your experiences and we shall endeavour to ensure that all Australians today and in the future know and remember, as well."

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australians generally take a great deal of interest in Vietnam. Yet, even so, the relationship between Vietnam and Australia is a lot closer than some people realise. The twinning of Vung Tau and the Australian city of Parramatta is but one example of the increasing friendship between our two countries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many of our large companies have set up offices there to work together with Vietnamese partners to develop important business and trade links. Indeed, the visits by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and by the Veterans group will, I am sure, not only further strengthen the already very strong relationship between our two countries, but assist in furthering opportunities for Vietnam and Australia to cooperate in a range of fields. There are a myriad of opportunities available to Australian companies. The proud and responsible way in which our veterans have represented Australia during and since their involvement in the Vietnam conflict has played a significant role in developing the strong relationship that exists today between the two countries.

        The cost estimate was $104 million. I am happy to say that about half of the cost will be borne by the British taxpayers.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course, being newly developed technology, the Committee adopted a cautious approach, and recommended that before full&amp;hyphen;scale in situ vitrification commences, smaller scale trials should be undertaken to provide assurances that encapsulation and mixing meets prescribes standards. This has now been successfully undertaken.

        The report gives well&amp;hyphen;deserved credit to the untiring efforts of two former members of the Committeeâ€”Ray Braithwaite and Ben Humphreys, who, throughout the past year, and previous years, continued to question sponsors and designers about mechanisms designed to deter collusive tendering, and guarantee the payment of subcontractors.

        On the question of collusive tenderingâ€”otherwise known as anti&amp;hyphen;competitive conduct, we know that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found evidence of it in the Brisbane concrete market and has imposed heavy fines.

        These amendments relate to the development plans. Development plans are required where there is a major development project. Major developments include a few straight forward developments like new runways or runway extensions or a new terminal or terminal extension. Most of the other developments need to be projects involving the expenditure of over $10 million or such higher amount as is prescribed. My amendments would add a requirement for submission for a plan if a development is likely to have a significant environmental or ecological impact or if it affected a site noted as evironmentally significant in the environmental strategy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You can imagine that many communities might be concerned that the changes that could occur in plans that do not have to be submitted as a plan may well have major environmental impacts but may not be anywhere near $10 million in dollar amounts. Currently, there is no need to bring such new developments to the attention of the minister or the department although the lessee might have to indicate how they had managed the impact in a subsequent environmental strategy if the impact was on site. But there are cases
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         where the impact is not on site, so currently the impact might be ignored or not even noted.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The requirement for a development plan occurs whenever there is a major development. I have fears that the definition of `major development' is too large. I believe there may be significant impacts to the community or the environment in less costly developments, and I believe there is scope for a company to do a sequence of developments of, say, $9 million each and so avoid this requirement altogether. You can imagine the sort of development by stealth, and that could be any number of different kinds of developments in terms of buildings and so on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I cannot try to fix everything in this bill, but putting this amendment will ensure that, where there is a significant environmental impact that is likely from a project, the lessee should prepare a development plan. For example, if there is an ecologically significant wetland on the airport siteâ€”as there is in Perthâ€”or if there is one nearby and a development project includes elements that would either result in increased or decreased run-off, there is a potential to either lower the water table having a big effect on water quality and species balance or to result in the run-off of pollutants leading to toxic or eutrophic effects.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It could be a cheap development, say, establishing a heavily fertilised lawn, a parking lot or a drainage system to take water away from the area. I believe it is the responsibility of operators of an airport to be accountable for such developments. The master plan or environmental strategy are for a five&amp;hyphen;year period and may continue longer without revision, while a development plan must be submitted whenever there is a significant development. I think the level of development considered major or significant is too big. It allows many developments which may be environmentally significant to impact on the community without federal scrutiny and, therefore, without community scrutiny. Nonetheless, such major plans should, where they clearly note an environmental or noise impact, include an explanation of how these will be addressed, since they will not need to make

        The development plan is required for every major development, whether or not it is included in the master plan. We are particularly concerned with the way new developments are likely to affect the environment. Increasing environmental protection was the major outcome of the amendments we have already proposed to this section, in particular the need to include a development plan wherever there is a significant environmental impact, regardless of the cost of the project. I have also called for lessees to state their management plans, as well as the likely impact on their development plans. I now draw your attention to the fact that section 122 says that non&amp;hyphen;compliance with the environmental strategy is not an offence. However, under section 81 it is an offence to do a development without a development plan,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         or not in compliance with a development plan, and the draft development plan is open to public comment.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our amendments assure that there are penalties for non&amp;hyphen;compliance with the environmental management aspects of the development plan but, in our assessment, those penalties are very light. We are talking about a plan costing, for instance, over $10 million and very large corporations that are lessees. The current penalties are only $25,000. We propose penalties more in line with the consumer protection portion of the Trade Practices Act. Typically, they are $40,000 for individuals and $200,000 for companies. We propose that the level of penalties for non&amp;hyphen;compliance with development plans for airports should be consistent with part V of the Trade Practices Act, that is, dealing with consumer protection. We are saying that, if it is not an offence, there should at least be a realistic penalty for non&amp;hyphen;compliance.

        Mr Chairman, as I just pointed out to you, amendment (3) is technically deficient. Therefore, it is suggested that the you delete the words following `400 penalty units'. The reason for this is that section 4B of the Crimes Act will automatically apply the higher penalty in respect of bodies corporate which constitute a wider class of entities than companies to which the amendment refers.

        The major shortfall of the regulations themselves is twofold. They only cover the on&amp;hyphen;site impact of pollution waste and noise impact other than from aircraft in flight. They do not cover the general impact of activity on habitat and biota. So if you are looking at the effect of a particular strategy, we have included biota or habitat, natural or heritage values and sites of significance to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The current wording does not consider the impact of general activity, as I said, and does not consider the impact of all activities or activities that affect off&amp;hyphen;site environments. The lessees do need to consider such general and off&amp;hyphen;site impacts in their strategy, but government cannot draft regulations on those areas. The fact that the restriction is specific also casts doubt on the necessity of the lessee considering such impacts, since there is no explicit requirement to consider them. The requirements of the strategy also do not explicitly refer to noise impacts, so the regulations may cast doubt on their inclusion, particularly because noise was explicitly included in requirements for what must be included in the master plan and development plan.

       <para first-indent="16">
        My amendments to clause 107 would include biota, habitat and these other issues in the strategy. Clause 118 indicates that the minister must consider the noise impact. My amendment to this clause adds the need for the minister to consider impact on biota and habitat, natural or heritage values and sites of significance to indigenous people.

        Clause 125 switches from prevention or minimisation of impacts to monitoring, remedying or rectifying impacts. My amendments also extend these regulations to biota and habitat, heritage and significance for indigenous people, in the same way. Whilst it might be considered that there are powers under other acts which might allow such things to occur, if the bill specifies that `the minister may make regulations on the following', it could well be argued by companies involved that regulations falling outside that in relation to airports may fall outside the purview, or it might not be a natural way of thinking by the relevant minister in terms of what is required to regulate the activity in and around airportsâ€”especially, as I said, the fact that many FAC airports around Australia include a buffer zone. Many of those buffer zones, by historical accident, include some very important areas of remnant urban bushland or even rural bushland. So it is important that there is at least the means by which this is considered to be part of what a minister can do in helping to look after the area held under a lease.

        This amendment removes the capacity of the Commonwealth to exempt airport lessees from state and territory environmental law. Commonwealth exemptions have been a problem in the past, as they are currently. We need look no further than the exemptions currently given to Telstra and Optus on stringing overhead cables or putting up towers to see this. We need look no further than the level of community concern about the proposals in the future to provide further amnesties for that to happen. The community has many concerns about this, especially as it is going further and further into the private sector.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we wanted to look further, some of the Defence exemptions are truly worth noting. There is no good reason to exempt an airport lessee from state environmental law. The government claims that maybe the states would use an ability to set higher environmental standards than the Commonwealth does for airports to hold the Commonwealth to ransom or somehow gain a huge power. But this is something different. You are not asking for the power to ensure that the states do not make incredibly strict environmental law; you are demanding the right to exempt the airport lessees from ordinary state and territory environmental law. This is odious. I consider it is a potentially disastrous situation, based on past performance in relation to the power to exempt companies from state environmental law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As more and more of the effects of competition policy bite, I think the community will be watching very carefully to see whether or not exemptions are passed to the private sector, whether or not the Commonwealth is really going to be able to look after the community concerns, and whether or not the normal laws of environment and planning will apply.

        It would also limit the ability of the Commonwealth to clearly identify state law which does not apply to the setting of standards, monitoring and remedying breaches of environmental standards. Once again, it is a change which will promote confusion and uncertainty. The government is seeking the opposite outcome, of course. We want certainty. We want clarity.

         â€”I am pleased to see that Senator Margetts acknowledges the commonsense of the vote. This amendment would cause great harm. It would certainly create uncertainty as to whether the Commonwealth or state controls and standards applied to particular environmental matters on airports. It would purport to require any state law which provided a more stringent standard to apply to the extent that it is capable of operating concurrently with this division of the bill.

        So Senator Margetts's amendment would have the Commonwealth set down an appropriate standard to apply on a consistent national basis to all major airports, which would then not apply in any location where a state government developed a higher standard whether the standard was appropriate to the continuing operation of the airport or not.

        People employed by the Commonwealth to ensure compliance with the Commonwealth standard would do their work one day and then find that state inspectors were at the airport the next to enforce another standard and put them out of work. A person would be operating on the airport in accordance with the law one day and prosecuted the next by a different regime. I would suggest that, most likely, no-one would know what was going on, including Senator Margetts.

        The Airports Bill cannot be seen, in my opinion, as a good bill, regardless of the improvements that have been made. There is still far too much scope for abuse, high charges and, with a compliant minister or government, a lack of rigour in responding to environmental impact and ensuring they are avoided or properly managed.

        We believe that there may be scope for a responsible minister to assure a decent outcome, but there is little or no scope for either the parliament, state or territory government, local government or the community to actually affect the outcome of the approval process or how the breaches of plans are handled. Yet the minister has significant powers. She or he can override state and territory environmental law. They can exempt lessees from state and territory environmental law. As we have seen, that is what they wish to do and continue to do. A local government gets no look in at all. The minister can approve any project, no matter how bad the impact or how poor that management plan. They can choose to ignore breaches of law or the agreements a company makes.

        In terms of breaches of the environmental strategy, as I noted before, it is not an offence not to comply. An injunction can be sought under part 15, but only by a minister. The only recourse for the public, including state or local government, is the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That is bounded by conditions that make ministerial decisions unquestionable. They include the issuance or non-issuance of an injunction, which is the measure to be taken for non-compliance with the environmental strategy. I believe that the public, state or territory government, local government, community or environmental groups, indigenous people and so on need the right to object to what has been done. It is not right to allow untrammelled executive power.

        Especially with environmental damage, it is difficult to approve a personal loss in regard to loss of environmental quality and even more difficult when that loss is something as abstract as the basic right of a wetlands or species to exist.

        On the other hand, there are more and more opportunities for corporations to use their economic power through the legal system. We see corporations suing citizens who dare to complain about their waste being dumped into rivers. We see the current government about to reinstate measures against secondary boycotts that can and will be used against environmental and community groups organising boycotts for community reasons. We see people being stripped of their power even to take an issue to court, while those with substantial funds can take actions against individuals and voluntary community groups. This is not appropriate. It is not fair and we do not believe it is right that our amendment would allow anyone to take up a breach of this act or the EP act.

        I wish to establish here the fact that anyone should be able to take legal action on breach of environmental law. That is particularly important in regard to the environment. Taking legal action against the government and lessee will not be a small thing. It will be a major challenge, probably costly and time consuming and I doubt very much whether anyone would take such an action casually or mischievously. It is also a challenge that is unlikely to be taken without a reasonable chance of winning against a great imbalance of economic and political power.

Again, this measure would be consistent with the consumer protection measures of the Trade Practices Act. I think it is a reasonably good model to use in terms of the impact of a private sector operator on the community and things a community or sectors of the community value.

        This is an inclusive measure. It allows anyone to initiate legal action if they believe there is a breach of the airports act or the environment protection act. It is not open-ended and requires an accuser to prove their case. Court action does not automatically stop a development, although the courts may issue an injunction if they believe there is a case to answer and such an injunction is justified. As with any legal challenge, an unsuccessful challenge is costly in many respects. We do not believe challenges would be made lightly.

        This amendment would provide the community and other levels of government with some opportunity for redress if a minister chooses to overlook breaches of the act. That is all it does.

The proposed amendments seek to override judicial rulings of standing by removing any limitations on who can bring proceedings under the bill and the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Normally, to bring an action for judicial review against a decision, a person must be aggrieved by that decision. The courts have taken a liberal view of persons aggrieved by a decision but have not cast the net so widely as to include every member of the public.

It is not in the interests of the wider community, and therefore the amendment ought not to be supported.

But I must say that that would be, in my view, significantly outweighed by enacting a law here that would simply overturn the question of standing which, of course, is a matter routinely addressed by judicial bodies around Australia. This may well be a matter clarified in the negative by the Acts Interpretation Act or some other act, but I was curious about the reference to any person being able to take this course of action as to whether that person would necessarily even need to be a citizen of Australia.

         â€”By way of explanation, I think it is necessary to say that over time,  and in very quick time, we are seeing that environmental legislation of many kindsâ€”whether it be state or federal legislation or even local ordinancesâ€”is being overridden by the very fast march of competition policy. We see that competition policy has an overarching impact. When bodies, including Commonwealth bodies, are privatised, then much of what happens ends up in corporate law. The interests of the minor shareholders tend to override the interests of the community. It is hard to see any means by which public interest in any true sense of the word is actually being protected. In the past we had people going out from Australiaâ€”certainly from Western Australiaâ€”and saying, `We've got the world's best environmental legislation.' But if there is no way to enforce that environmental legislation, it is hardly worth the paper it is written on.

        More and more the community are feeling that they ought to have some means of saying to government and government bodiesâ€”in this case we still have some government connection to the land in the federal airportsâ€”`If you've got these rules we should be able to require you to at least stick to them.' It seems that the environment tends to be given a short straw. Corporate laws can be enforced. As I say, the interests of minority shareholders can be enforced. Over time we will see Australian competition and consumer protection taking over regulatory functions more and more, so public interest will very much get a back seatâ€”if any seat at all. It seems to me that, if we do not start providing this minimal protection, the environment and other human values will not get a guernsey at all.

         If this is the wrong way to put this, I look forward to the future and to perhaps being able to work with the opposition and the government to see how this might be placed in legislation so that this protection is given and that eventually we see that such things as the environment are not just things that can be overridden by every other law. If consumer protection is such that a person can have a grievance and the world has not fallen apart by persons being granted such standing, then perhaps we ought to think of similar models for the environment. As I said, if this particular model that I have suggested does not work, I would be very happy to work with either of the parties who are represented here today to see what will work.

I will look forward to the future and seeing other proposals coming up. We will, of course, be looking at other models which we will be glad to present in the future for your combined scrutiny.

         â€”Depending on others who do have some intervention rules along the way. It is important to recognise that this has been a very significant debate. Of course, the legislation was subjected to very appropriate Senate committee hearings where it received wide and very thorough investigation. It is indeed a pity, I think, that Senator Margetts did not take the opportunity to canvass through that committee many of the issues that she subsequently pursued in the chamber in the committee stages in so much detail in making sure that it was considered at that time in the Senate committee. It would certainly have saved a lot of time here in the chamber.

        The government is continuing to work towards the leasing of the first airports this financial year. My colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) announced on 3 September that the tender process for the sale of leases of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports will commence shortly. The government is, therefore, keen for the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996

         to be passed by the Senate to enable the leasing of airports to proceed. Advertisements calling for the registration of expressions of interest in these airports are expected to be published in national and international newspapers within the next fortnight.

        The beginning of the airports tender process is another important step in the government's privatisation program. The tender process will be open and is expected to be highly competitive. The Minister for Finance also announced that leasing of Adelaide airport will be deferred pending the completion of a feasibility study into an integrated passenger terminal at Adelaide airport. It is envisaged that this will be completed in early 1997, after which the timing of the sale of Adelaide airport will be revisited.

        The government recognises that airports are vitally important to the communities and regions which they serve. The government believes that leasing of the major airports will deliver significant benefits to airport users and industry and will enable airports to continue to develop to meet future requirements. The government expects that leasing of the airports will promote efficient airport operations in the interests of transport, tourism and trade. It should also encourage economic development of airports in ways which are responsive to the needs of users and the regions which they serve. The government will encourage airport operators to develop a partnership approach to airport operation and development. This will provide opportunities for participation by airport users as well as state and local governments, local communities and the private sector.

        The cross-ownership provisions and the sales processes will establish an appropriate diversity of ownership of federal airports at the outset. Airport ownership will also be subject to ongoing scrutiny under normal trade practices controls. Of course, the airports will also be subject to restrictions on foreign and airline ownership. The government will welcome outcomes which promote the development of an export oriented Australian airport infrastructure and services industry.

         The government has made every effort to address fully the matters that interested parties, including many senators, have raised on the airport bills.

         I would like to emphasise, as I did in the Senate committee hearings, that the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 are very sound pieces of legislation. They have been developed over a lengthy period with the benefit of wide consultations with interested parties. They represent a considered balance between the need to have regard to the reasonable commercial interests of private airport lessees and the need to protect airport users and the community. The regulatory framework contained in the Airports Bill contains substantial protection of the public interest.

         Before I conclude I would like to emphasise briefly the environmental protections included in the bill. These include requirements for airport operators to develop and implement approved environment strategies. The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 will also apply. As well, the existing Commonwealth legislation, like the Endangered Species Act 1992 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act, will continue to apply at the leased airports.

         As senators may be aware, the government has consulted with relevant parties on airport pricing over the past few weeks and will enter shortly into consultations on the regulations to be made under the Airports Bill on matters such as airport environment and building controls. The government recognises the interests of the states and territories in these matters and will consult closely with them. I certainly commend the bills to the Senate.

        It is unfortunate that many people in Australia still are not aware of the fact that these issues will affect them. It is not just about Sydney. It is about any FAC airport in Australia. The issues can be dealt with by the privatisation of airports. They can be dealt with by regulation. I do not think the aspects of public benefit and so on are properly protected. Nothing that has occurred with this legislation, even the improvements to the legislation, has made me feel that I should be supporting this bill to privatise Federal Airports Corporation airports.

        I have never felt that creating a private monopoly is more efficient than continuing with a public monopoly. Anyone who lives in Perth would realise that there is not a great deal of choice when you want to fly to London other than Perth airport. You might be able to go from Broome but you will not go very far in terms of Europe or other places in the world. So basically somebody will be pocketing the profits rather than putting the profits back into the public entity. I fail to see how in the end we will all benefit.

        But that is beside the point. There are some other issues I would like to canvass. They include some of the issues I have talked about in terms of the biota surrounding airports. It has been brought to my attention that part of the problem that has been perceived by communities is a lack of environmental management. Recently I was escorted around Perth airport by representatives from the Federal Airports Corporation. I asked some questions with regard to oil seepage that I had been advised of in an area in a marshalling yard just outside the airport. The environmental officer for the Federal Airports Corporation indicated that he had no knowledge of this.

         It occurred to me to wonder who was responsible for environmental management of buffer zones. If it was not the Federal Airports Corporation, perhaps it was the federal government, but who would be their representative on the spot to actually manage that land? You cannot expect the management to take place by people who are not there, and a day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day management or yearly management seems to be lacking in these areas. Even if there are community volunteers to assist in the management of remnant bushland or buffer zones or wetlands, they need some assistance at least to have their costs reimbursed.

         Senator Campbell, at the beginning of the debate, mentioned that he recognised that Perth airport bushland was one of those areas which, although it is considered to be a significant area of remnant bushland, is in bad need of management. Even putting a fence around a piece of remnant bushland is no guarantee that that area will be managed. I would like some sort of guidance from the minister as to who is responsible for management of buffer zones, remnant bushland and wetlands, for instance, around airports and what guarantees we have that those areas will actually be managed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If I was cynical, I might say that sometimes, when there is pressure for development, it might be easy for the lessee simply to allow an area of remnant bushland to degrade. For instance, you could allow off&amp;hyphen;road vehicles or fires or rubbish dumping and, within a short time, you could argue that the area no longer needed care or saving or protection. What duty of care is there of lessees and, if it is not the lessees who have that duty of care, whose is it?

Clearly, there is no constitutional requirement for it to be done because it is Commonwealth territory and it will remain as Commonwealth territory. What I am trying to get from the ministerâ€”and I apologise if I cannot make it clear enough for himâ€”is that, whilst there is no obligation because of the constitution and because it is Commonwealth territory, I want the government to guarantee right here and now whether that land will be regarded as not Commonwealth land for the purposes of state taxes and charges and local government taxes and charges.

We had the situation in Melbourne in relation to the Tullamarine airport, for instance, where the Bulla shire at one end of the airport was receiving $20,000 or $30,000 in lieu of rates.

It  is appropriate, however, to single out one person who offered me the opportunity to work in the trade union movement many years ago. That man was Jim Maher, a former national president of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. He also held a number of senior and influential positions in the Australian community.

        In 1981 he offered me the opportunity to assume senior office in the SDA in Western Australia at a relatively young age. He guaranteed no successâ€”simply offered a vision of the likely growth of that state and said that a job needed to be done. He offered me the chance to participate in the building of an organisation from the ground up and to be part of the dynamic growth of service industry unions in the Australian economy. As later events were to demonstrate, that was no mean offer. I thank him wholeheartedly for his support and help over the intervening period and wish him and his wife, Fran, well in their retirement.

         In my own case, I studied law at the University of Adelaide and graduated in 1981.

Those interests were, and are: law, economics, politics and history. Indeed, I took the opportunity to pursue some postgraduate study in economics and public policy in the United States in the years 1993 and 1994. If I had my time over, even with the benefit of 15 years hindsight, I would make the same decision again without reservation.

         My family background is typical of many people who grew up in the outer suburbs of our major cities. My parents had few assets and many demands which did not shrink as their family grew to six children. Occasionally I read press or newspaper stories of the golden days of the 1950s and 1960s. Australia was apparently a land of milk and honey. I grew up in that period and have no memory of that fabled land.

         In this context, the policy initiative of the current government in providing tax assistance to single&amp;hyphen;income families with dependent children is an interesting development. It seems to suggest a heightened role for the states in the provision of assistance to families and is something worthy of further study. This is because the form of the payment reflects economic recognition of the partner in a single&amp;hyphen;income family with primary responsibility for dependent children. Personally I have no quarrel with this new direction. However, I do not think it should be at the expense of other family support programs.

         The second theme I briefly wish to address is the absolute need for our economy to grow and expand in future years. A lot of the reform initiated by the former Labor government in the period 1983 to 1991 will bear rich fruit in the next few years. I suspect the productivity growth alone will surprise a lot of commentators. If those policy prescriptions had been maintained, Australians might not continue to be satisfied with achieving the modest growth outcomes of western European or Anglo-Saxon economies but might start to understand that our country has the potential to match the economic outcomes consistently

         The years in a private sector union left me with an appreciation of the dynamics of that sector in our economy. I am not aware of any superior system to that of our mixed economy. That necessarily means a continuing role for government. Generally, the mechanics of price allocation as a determinant of outcomes is satisfactory. There needs to be good reason for government intervention in the marketplace, and in no way do I advocate a return to the dreary days of yesterday's economy. My earlier comments on my own upbringing bear witness to my attitude concerning the sad state of affairs that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s.

         However, the market is not God and government has a role to play, not only in mitigating the harm occasioned by efficiency but also in stimulating industries which show clear potential for national competitive advantage in the future.

         The World Bank has indeed done that study and, in 1993, concluded that the ongoing growth of east Asian economies was due to the use of both fundamentals and interventionist policies by government. By fundamentals, the World Bank said that macro-economic management was unusually good in providing a framework for private investment. It was a focus on policies that, first, encouraged high levels of savings; second, provided education policies that equipped students with the ability to enter industry; and, third, provided agricultural policies that stressed productivityâ€”all contributed to sustained high levels of growth.

         The issue of industry policy and industry development is out of favour at the moment. Instead, the government has an alternative strategy of debt reduction, balanced budgets, transparent accounting and minimal social programs. If those policies are successful in giving us full employment, low inflation, low interest rates, a balanced current account and high growth, I will be flabbergasted and delighted. I have no doubt that on their own those policies are inadequate to give the Australian economy a period of sustained economic growth of above three per cent per annum. In the final analysis, those policies will result in massive unemployment and the undoing of this government.

         There is nothing inherently wrong with balanced budgets, reducing borrowings to a minimum or even transparent accounting. In most circumstances, they are desirable options.

          Australia is a vast and varied country with great differences between the regions, some of which, while having great economic potential, have low populations.

I was pleased that the High Court of Australia, in rejecting the recent Western Australian ALP challenge to the electoral boundaries in Western Australia, held that the concept of regional representation was implicitly recognised in the constitution as a feature of the Australian system of government, which, needless to say, in the federal sphere is provided by the Senate.

         I would like to say a little about general practice medicine, which is undergoing something of a crisis of identity at the moment. As a recent ANU survey showed, many GPs are disillusioned and frustrated. As things have evolved over the last 25 years, the status and scope of work performed by GPs have diminished. The income of GPs has fallen, both in absolute and relative terms to that of their specialist colleagues, so that today many GPs, especially in the metropolitan areas, are genuinely struggling to meet the cost of providing the equipment necessary to enable them to give good service. Although reassuring noises are constantly made about general practice medicine remaining the cornerstone of Australian medicine, the contemporary role of the GP has never been satisfactorily defined.

         One of the great problems of Australian medicine is that of getting medical practitioners to go to small country towns. The reasons for this are complex and not only related to working conditions but also to social factors such as education and shopping facilities and the fact that doctors' wives tend to be city girls who do not relate well to living in country towns for long periods. For some time I have thought there was an analogy to be drawn between the health and education services under which young teachers are sent out to country schools for a few years after graduation. It occurs to me that one solution to the problem of providing adequate medical services in small rural communities might be to establish community health centres in areas of need where not one, but two or three salaried doctorsâ€”to ensure reasonable duty rostersâ€”would work as part of a team of health professionals which might include a visiting physiotherapist, occupational therapist and social worker.

         It is educational for the Senate to know why it has taken 30 years for secondary downstream processing to begin in the Pilbara. The reasons why secondary processing is only now becoming possible are these. Firstly, it is because of the previously appalling industrial relations record in the Pilbara, which only improved when the unions came to understand in the early 1980s that the Japanese could go to Brazil as an alternative source of supply for their iron ore and that there was no question of industrial problems occurring in Brazil, for obvious reasons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, automation has reduced the price of labour, which is a major disincentive to further development. The Pilbara 21 study of a few years ago revealed that it cost about $65,000 per annum to employ a skilled tradesperson in the Pilbara compared to about $30, 000 for the same person in Perth. While the cost of labour has not come down, automation means fewer people are employed, with a dramatic fall in the total cost of labour to industry.

         Thirdly, the deregulation of the energy market in Western Australia has substantially reduced the price of energy, so that now the Pilbara offers the lowest priced gas in the South&amp;hyphen;East Asian area.

         To the north of the Pilbara is the Kimberley region. The principal drivers of economic activity in the Kimberley are the mining, tourism, agriculture, pastoral, pearling and fishing industries, with the total Kimberley economy earning the nation about $890 million per annum. Irrigated agriculture at Kununurra on the Ord River has grown rapidly in recent years, capitalising on out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;season markets in Australia's southern capital cities and developing international markets.

Absurd and anomalous situations are emerging, like the council staff business unit which wins a Meals on Wheels contract from a neighbouring council but loses its own tender for its own service. The big end of town in Melbourne and the larger regional centres are reaping the economic benefits of winning contracts at the expense of small councils and small business. The Victorian state government has such a strong commitment to competition that it has legislated to guarantee its success.

          The battle against opportunism and greed can never really be said to be won. Our coast environment is precious. Not only will the next few years see an ever&amp;hyphen;increasing threat from ill conceived development; there will also be pressure to take more fish, to drill for oil and to regard the sea, like the land, as a limitless resource. The reluctance to protect the marine environment means the waters in our bays and ports are being strangled by weeds and pests introduced in ballast water. Governments have not acted on recommendations. They  hold the view that the problem is too difficult and not important enough to increase the cost of shipping and not important enough for us to demand international actionâ€”too late, anyway. Whilst reports fill the shelves, more and more marine rabbits enter our waterways, finding environments in which they can thrive.

        The need to have dignity and to be treated with dignity is the special element that sets us apart from all the other species on this planet. We are something special and, as such, should treat ourselves and our fellow humans in a way which gives dignity. Dignity is not a commodity to be bought, sold or traded. It is an inalienable right. Unfortunately today, too much time, effort, energy and money seems to be devoted to stripping away dignity rather than maintaining or enhancing it. It is for this very reason that I became involved with the pursuit of social justice in both the trade union and political arenaâ€”to do what I can to maintain and enhance the dignity of people.

        In reflecting on the great changes and advances made in our society over the last 200 years, one factor remains constantâ€”the need for the dignity of people. There were two industrial revolutions which I wish to briefly refer to that have profoundly affected humanity. The first was in the early 1800s. It was a time of dramatic change. It saw: one, a greater rate of wealth creation than at any other time; two, the nature of work and the way it was done changed forever; and, three, the organisation of society changed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        None of this was or is intrinsically bad. The creation of wealth logically precedes its redistribution. However, out of this era emerged the development of a social conscience to redress the abuses that had surfaced as a result of the enormous change. The social conscience sought to give dignity to those who were most vulnerable to the rigours of a system not of their makingâ€”that is, the workers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The trade union movement emerged as the principal force to upgrade and improve the quality of life for the vast majority who found themselves exposed. It saw the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. But for the intervention of the trade union movement, there would have been no redistribution of wealth. Dignity was never achieved for all, but we had proceeded a long way down the path of achieving the goal of dignity for all.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second industrial revolution was in the 1960s. There we saw the invention of the microchip, which has changed the face of life. Again, it saw: one, a greater rate of wealth creation than at any other time; two, the nature of work and the way it was done changed forever; and, three, the organisation of society changed. Again, none of this by itself was or is intrinsically bad. However, the social conscience was or became confused; the principal force for equality, the trade union movement, has or is under relentless pressure to roll over and die or be eliminated; and there is now a re&amp;hyphen;distribution of wealth the other way, from the poor to the rich.

        Whilst the rhetoric which went with those models may well sound good and warm to someâ€”hard work never hurt anyoneâ€”it is certainly no solace to those who cannot achieve the first step to dignity: meaningful work.

When their plight was revealed to the wider Australian community, the response was as swift as it was sincere. The burden borne by the families of the disabled is no less real and no less destructive. It is a burden they have borne on behalf of us all.

         Physical impairment is only one of the disabilities which many Australians are forced by circumstances to endure. Disadvantage can become a disability unless there is hope. Some people are born with disabilities; other people can become effectively disabled if their disadvantage becomes entrenched. Unemployment, then, is a disability, as is homelessness and poverty and lack of education. It is the responsibility of governments to prevent disadvantage becoming disability. Disadvantage without hope is effectively disability. A just society is one where we not only provide opportunities for people but also give them the support they need to take advantage of those opportunities.

          Consider the government's proposal to cut almost $2 billion from labour market programs over the next four years. Getting a decent job has always been the greatest concern for young Australians. Denying young people meaningful employment has proven to be disastrous. Young unemployed people can feel rejected and discarded. They are also more vulnerable to depression, ill health, homelessness, crime, drugs and suicide. But the fact remains that the more efficient and productive our economy becomes, the fewer jobs there are for our young people. The number of jobs for unskilled 15- to 19-year-olds has fallen from 600,000 in 1966 to 240,000 in 1992.

          If the last decade has taught us anything, it is the futility of blaming the young and unemployed for the situation they find themselves in. A more productive approach combines the creation of opportunity with the provision of support. That is why the Labor Party opposes the government's planned cuts to labour market programs. The cuts send a clear signal to the community that the focus of government policy has shifted. It has shifted from unemployment being the problem to the unemployed being the problem. But the truth is that the great majority of young unemployed people are not dole bludgers. They are the same kinds of people who in my generation left school, got jobs, got married, bought homes and raised children. By breaking that cycle the way we are, we are denying our children and grandchildren the chance to make a future for themselves.

          Last week the Governor-General told the nation that homelessness is perhaps the greatest disadvantage of all. He estimated conservatively that there are currently more than 60,000 homeless Australians. Half of those people are believed to be under 25 years of age. The causes of youth homelessness are known to include family breakdown, poverty and unemployment. Whatever the reasons, there is simply no excuse for anyone in this country to be without a home. For every person who is homeless, there is likely to be another four who are at risk of joining them.

           Predictably, no group is under more pressure in the housing section than the young. The youth housing strategy found the mean income of young people to be about two-thirds that of the general population. At the same time, housing costs as a percentage of gross income are 40 per cent higher than other groups. To help overcome these difficulties, many young people live in group households to reduce their housing and general living costs. I share the concern of many people in the community about the impact of the government's decision to reduce rent assistance for people in this situation.

           We are living in danger of creating a fractured society. Our communities and our families are in danger of fracture by poverty and unemployment, by hatred and intolerance, by drugs and by crime. I do not believe there is a single answer to all of the pressures which are tearing our communities and families apart. Rather, I think what is required is a building block approach to equality and justice. Particular government programs can give disadvantaged groups and individuals the support they need to take advantage of the opportunities enjoyed by the wider community. By removing those supports, we risk creating a society that is more dependent on welfare rather than less, and less able to cope.

        In placing the bill before the Senate, I want to reiterate two points which cannot be made often enough. Firstly, Australia needs to become more productive. Our living standards, international competitiveness and ability to provide employment depend on it. This bill is intended to help that productivity be delivered.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, we have a mandate for the reforms embodied in this bill. Since the election, we have been concerned to ensure that our policy would be implemented in the most effective way possible. Accordingly, we have consulted widely with employers and employer organisations; with unions and the ACTU; with state and territory governments; with women's organisations and the churches; and with ethnic, community and welfare groups. We have been open to the views put by all these groups and have benefited considerably from their suggestions. This is reflected in the bill that is before the Senate. But the fundamentals of the policy itself remain as put to, and accepted by, the Australian people on election day.

        Several issues have been raised in the public debate and by those here present about the proposed reforms; notably, the future role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the simplification of awards, the future of paid rates awards, the assistance being offered to workers with family responsibilities, the government's proposed arrangements for equal pay, the impact of our arrangements on young people, and the ability of employers and employees in the federal jurisdiction to enter into state awards.

        Certainly the commission's role will change, as it must necessarily do, given the changed environment it operates in. Indeed its role has already shifted under the current arrangements to one of maintaining the award safety net and facilitating bargaining.

        Getting the relationship between arbitration and bargaining right is critical for the overall effectiveness of the system.

          The Award System
         </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Madam President, I now turn to consider the impact of our reforms on the award system. At the outset, it is important to be clear that the Government has maintained its commitment to ensure that all employers and employees with federal award coverage will have the choice of remaining on their awards.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, the role of the Commission, the scope of awards, and arrangements for their adjustment, need to be consistent with and reinforce the role of awards as a genuine safety net. This is important for the viability of the wage systemâ€”to ensure its capacity to provide safety net protection, to encourage agreement&amp;hyphen;making and to meet overall economic objectives.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Commission's role in relation to wages will focus on the setting of minimaâ€”it will not generally be able to arbitrate claims above the minimum safety net. The mechanism by which the Commission adjusts safety net rates of pay and other award minima will not be prescribed in the legislation. This will be a matter for the Commission to determine.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Consistent with the focus of awards on safety net minimum wages and conditions, the Commission's jurisdiction (and thus the capacity of the parties) to incorporate matters in awards will be confined to certain allowable matters. The Bill provides for a Full Bench of the Commission to establish principles relating to the future handling of these matters, as it has done in the past with its existing award jurisdiction. All matters beyond those specified in the legislation should generally be determined at the enterprise or workplace level, whether in formal agreements or informally.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, conciliation will be available with respect to all matters, including agreements and the Commission's making of recommendations by consent.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         From the date of commencement of the new Act, new awards will not be able to contain matters other than those allowed by the statute. Transitional arrangements will apply whereby parties to existing awards are encouraged and assisted to simplify their awards to focus on the allowable terms and conditions, with other matters addressed by agree

          ment. After 18 months, any disallowed matters remaining in awards will not be enforceable.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Commission will also be reviewing awards to ensure that provisions are more flexible and geared to the needs of individual enterprises and workplaces. In particular, and as noted earlier, restrictions on regular part&amp;hyphen;time work will be removed from the award system. Such part&amp;hyphen;time work, with pro rata entitlements to the conditions available to full&amp;hyphen;time workers, and reasonable predictability in the manner in which hours are worked, will be a boon for many workers who, for reasons such as family responsibilities, are either unable or do not wish to work full&amp;hyphen;time.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         With awards concentrating on safety net minimum standards, new paid rates awards will not have a role in the wage system. Existing paid rates awards will be subject to the award simplification process applying to awards generally and, in future, will be treated in the same way as minimum rates awards. Over time and after consultation, paid rates awards would be phased out.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         All current legislative provisions relating to paid rates awards will be repealed and the Commission will no longer have the power to make such awards. Current entitlements for the allowable matters under such paid rates awards will be protected, with any changes being subject to the Commission's wage principles. It is expected that parties to these awards will make agreements that determine the detailed remuneration and working arrangements to apply, as most have done to date via certified agreements.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Because awards will be simplified, there will be more choice about how work is to be organised at the workplace. With simplified awards, employers and employees will find themselves talking to each other more about how they would like to organise, to their mutual benefit, matters that, until now, have been dictated to them by the award.

         Madam President, under this Bill, the options for agreement&amp;hyphen;making will be significantly expanded and simplified.

        </para>

         Both AWAs and CAs have been designed to meet the objectives of placing the primary responsibility for industrial relations with employers and employees at the workplace, and reducing the complexities imposed by the current system.

         A major innovation in the Bill is the establishment of AWAs, allowing agreements to be reached directly between an employer and his or her employee(s).

         There are specific provisions that protect the right of all employees to choose whom they wish to have representing them as their bargaining agent.

This right includes being represented by a union, should employees choose to do so.

         Complaints relating to non-observance of AWAs, including breaches of the minimum conditions, may be taken to the EA for investigation, and following investigation and conciliation, can be taken to a court. Thus, if a worker has not received any of the legislated minimum conditionsâ€”or any other entitlements in the agreementâ€”and if that complaint is substantiated, employers will be liable to a $10,000 penalty for breach of the agreement, as well as whatever recovery of entitlements is due to the employee.

         The use of duress to obtain an AWA will, where a complaint is upheld, lead to its invalidation, appropriate orders by the court (including rectification by the parties) and/or a penalty. The EA will be empowered to investigate complaints of duress in the making of AWAs.

         If a union wishes to make an agreement, or to participate in negotiations as a principal party, or on behalf of members, it must have a member in the enterprise concerned whose industrial interests it can represent. In the case of agreements made directly between an employer and employees, a union will be able to represent any member in discussions with the employer and, if it so chooses, may become a party to the final agreement if a member so requests (although the union may choose not to be bound by the final agreement). However, the agreement must still be approved by a majority of the employees to be covered, whether or not a union is involved. Special provisions will accommodate greenfields sites, so that agreements can be struck in advance of a business becoming operational.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Given the enterprise&amp;hyphen;based focus of the agreement system, it is appropriate that the capacity for multi&amp;hyphen;employer agreements to be certified should be tightly circumscribed and involve testing against the public interest by a Full Bench of the Commission.

         Prior to certification, the Commission will test agreements to ensure the statutory minima are met. In that regard, as is the case with the present no disadvantage test, the minimum pay guarantee may be satisfied on a collective basis. Thus, the guarantee may be met for each employee of a particular kind covered by an agreement if the Commission considers that, when considered overall, the wages payable to all employees of that kind under the agreement satisfy the minimum pay requirement.

        1.1 This report is made in compliance with Division 2 of Part IX of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979
        </emphasis>
        (the Act), which requires the Attorney-General, as Minister administering the Act, to have prepared each year a report giving details of interceptions of telecommunications for law enforcement purposes. This is the sixth report prepared in accordance with the requirements of
        <break page="3330" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that Division, and relates to the year ending 30 June 1995.

       <para>
        The Telecommunications (Interception) Act has two purposes: one, to ensure that we, as citizens of this country, can talk to each other over the telephone and use telecommunications in a way that is protected so that our privacy is maintained; and, two, to allow law enforcement authorities to carry out the very necessary purpose of detecting crime and suppressing it. It is important to keep those two things in balance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is for this parliament to set out for law enforcement authorities the limits that they must observe in going about their very difficult and necessary task of investigations. In recent times, the issue of how law enforcement people should go about their work has become a matter of some importance. There was the Ridgeway case last year and, more recently, the Elliott case in Melbourne, a case that was presided over by perhaps the most outstanding criminal law judge in this country, Justice Vincent. What was pointed out in both cases is the fact that we, as a community, must set those limits which preserve the democracy under which we live and, at the same time, enable the law enforcement authorities to go about their task.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         At times, great criticism is poured upon those law enforcement authorities. They have a difficult task and, by and large, they do an outstanding job in preserving the security of this community. It is important that we, as a parliament, are ever conscious of our obligations to see that Australia remains a free and democratic society. We do that by setting the framework within which this society operates, by passing laws such as the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the various amendments we have made to that act, and by exercising overall supervision and monitoring of how things operate. On the other hand, we should never go too far in making things difficult for those who carry out the duty of policing our society or those who are subject to that conduct. One of the ways that balancing act is carried out is by asking for reports such as this. It is a report which comes out regularly and I think it is the first one that the new Attorney&amp;hyphen;General the Hon. Daryl Wil liams has produced. I congratulate him on doing so and commend it to the reading of all honourable senators.

         â€”I rise, at this first opportunity, to pay a brief tribute to the contribution that former Senator John Coates has made in this chamber, in the parliament more generally, in the Labor caucus and in the Australian Labor Party. Senators will recall that John Coates announced his resignation on 20 August, on budget day. He did it in a way that typified the man: it was done without fanfare or fuss, it was straightforward and done in consultation with the Labor Party. That is what John Coates was all about. He is a person who has made a very significant contribution to the Labor cause. His contribution covered very many years. He was a member of the House of Representatives as the member for Denison throughout the life of the Whitlam government and was defeated, along with so many other Labor members, in the general election in 1975. He came back into the parliament as a senator in 1980 and his resignation occurred just a few weeks ago.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        John Coates made a very significant contribution and handled his resignation in a way that meant it was difficult for any of us at the time, given that it was budget day, to acknowledge his contribution. I did not ask John Coates whether he thought it appropriate that I now place our appreciation on record. I suspect he might have said, `Oh well, you can take it or leave it,' because, although thinking of resignation for some time, he did not join with other senators during the valedictory speeches that occurred at the end of the last sittings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        John Coates's contribution has been one that we ought to record in this place. His
        <break page="3331" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         committee service in the Senate has been enormous. I do not know of anyone in the Senate chamber, during the time I have served, who had a better understanding of the workings of this place.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While he was not a person who regularly jumped to his feet and took points of order, when he did, they counted, because there was not a person in this chamber who had a better understanding of the standing orders and the procedures in this place. I suspect his long service on the Procedure Committee and in a range of other guises led to the development of those skills over a long period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He was also a person who made a very fine contribution to policy development within the parliamentary party. He was a factional colleague of mine. There are many of us on the left of the Labor Party who also acknowledge his great loyalty to the cause of the left of the Labor Party over a very long period. Again, he took the same approach in relation to that commitment as he did to his loyalty and commitment to the Labor Party.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I found him a person who gave me a tremendous amount of personal support, which I always appreciated. But fundamentally, this was a man whose absolute commitment was to the Labor Party and the labour movement. He demonstrated that through thick and thin. He was a person who had the courage of his convictions within the forums of the party and within the caucus. He was a person who at times was willing to take the leadership of the party on when he felt strongly about an issue. That is always difficult in any political party. It does not necessarily mean that quick advancement is going to come your way when you do that. But he did have the courage of his convictions. He expressed his views without fear or favour, and did so for a very long time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        John Coates is a person who is going to be a very great loss to the parliamentary Labor Party. I am sure he will remain an active member of the Labor Party in Tasmania. His retirement will be a loss for Tasmanian Labor as well. He has been a great servant of our party. I think so many of us in the Labor Party are delighted that such a capable replacement for John Coates, in Kerry O'Brien,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         has been preselected by the Tasmanian branch  of the Labor Party. It was so typical of John Coates, as we had a number of functions to farewell him and thank him around this place, that in every single contribution he made, he acknowledged Kerry's preselection and the role that he believed he would play.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So John Coates is going to be a great loss to our party. He has made a fine contribution. I wanted to say, on behalf of my Labor colleagues in the Senate and many colleagues in the federal parliamentary Labor Party, that we will miss him. We believe that his contribution, firstly as a member of the House of Representatives and then since 1980 until very recently as a senator in this chamber, has been a very significant one for our party.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While he is a great loss to us, I am sure all of us wish him every success and an interesting future career. I know he is very much focused now on what he is going to do in the future. He has had an interesting career in the past. Before he came into parliament he worked as a scientist, as a biochemist; he has worked as a teacher at university. Of course, he also worked, in those tough years after the defeat of Labor in 1975, as an electorate assistant to Ken Wriedt, who led the Labor Party in this chamber. So he has had a very wide ranging experience outside the parliamentary arena. But we remember his long and very valued contribution in the parliament, in the caucus and in the Labor Party. On behalf of my colleagues, I say to John Coates: thank you. Thank you for the loyalty, thank you for the contribution, thank you for the dedication over the years. It is very much appreciated by us all.

        Firstly, I would like to add to the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, on the retirement of Tasmanian Senator John Coates. John Coates
        <break page="3332" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         served this parliament firstly in representing the Tasmanian electorate of Denison in the House of Representatives and more latterly as a senator. I suppose there are few senators in this place who have put their personal stamp on committee reports and the work of the committees in this House more than John Coates.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I met with him on many occasions in relation to issues arising from finance and public administration committee reports. It was not his secretary who was doing the adjustments to the final drafts on the computers, or on the typewriters in the earlier days; it was John Coates himself. So his style was very much reflected in those reports. I must say he was always a dogged fighter for what he believed in. That quality is what we expect of all parliamentarians in this placeâ€”to fight hard for what you believe in and to stand up for what you believe is right.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I always acknowledged John's rapport with the Tasmanian community. Even when he became a senator, his personal vote was exceedingly high, which indicated that he must have been very close to the Labor Party and the grassroots of the party that he served. His high personal vote was in spite of the system we have nowadays where there is a preference for ticking a box for particular parties. So I say farewell to John Coates. Thank you, and I wish you and your family the best of health in your retirement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second matter that I would like to raise concerns the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. I must say that there are a few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than tax laws. It should be a matter of considerable concern, but the most significant of these lawsâ€”the Income Tax Assessment Actâ€”is still in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity, even under the rewrite.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The act, as I said, is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. What we have recently seen in the plain English and renumbering system is just mark I. It is currently over 5,000 pages long. It cannot be easily read or understood. It no longer has a recognisable structure. Amendments have been piled on top of amendments over the last 60 years.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         The problem is the cost to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand and also to comply with this law. It has been estimated this cost ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually, a very significant amount. So any reduction in compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant micro-economic reform matter.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The defects of the 1936 act have been known for some time. Indeed, in 1993 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, on which I served, in report No. 326â€”a landmark report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the tax officeâ€”recommended the law be simplified. The previous government accepted that recommendation only in part and the tax law improvement project was born. The purpose of the project was known by all as the tax law improvement projectâ€”TLIPâ€”and it was to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point that I wish to raise is that what has been done in no way mirrors what report No. 326 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts really recommended or asked for. In that 1993 report, we said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . any attempt to redraft the Act must necessarily look at broader, structural issues within the total taxation system. Simplification, in this context, should concentrate on achieving a tax system which is fair, equitable and economical. The objective must be to reduce the total cost of the taxation system. Consequently a redraft of the Act, while crucial, cannot be successfully achieved in the absence of a fundamental review of the administrative, political and social implications of changes to the Act.
        </para>
        <para>
         From there you can see we have only done mark I in terms of the plain English rewrite. So, consequently, in performing a redraft, the committee in 1993 believed the fundamental assumptions underlying the act, including the basis on which the act must be administered and the policy directions inherent in the act, should be evaluated, discussed and clarified. That has not been done. The report went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For example, the possible alignment of the taxation law with accounting standards and concepts would be a fundamental change to be considered.

         I express some concerns. It is for those reasons that I got myself back on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to try to bring the system back on track. In a sense, we have partially done that. While it was stated that one of the main objectives was to reduce the long-term costs of compliance, it is unlikely, in the committee's viewâ€”and this is in the latest reportâ€”that the cost will come down significantly until such time as the underlying complexities of tax policies are addressed. So for the first time since 1993, parliament was told of the significant need to address these sorts of issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there still continues to be a sense of frustration that unworkable sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act are being perpetuated in the 1996 bill. Unfortunately, addressing those concerns was beyond the mandate of the current tax law improvement program. That was, indeed, unfortunate so my comments are in no way a criticism of that team which was very admirably led by Brian Nolan.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In practice, the tax law improvements mandate could not have been expanded without the rewrite process becoming bogged down in policy debates, but we as a committee, when we reviewed this tax law rewrite, indicated there is a minimum. There is a continuing need to address the small policy complexities being highlighted by the tax law improvement process. The success of the committee's review process suggests that a parliamentary committee may be an appropriate forum to examine those sorts of issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee also believes that the tax simplification does require more than just a rewrite or a tidying up of even policy complexities. What is ultimately required is this wide ranging review of tax policy at the federal and state level. I do acknowledge the comments made by the new senator from Western Australia, my colleague Senator Eggleston. I was particularly moved by the comments that he made in relation to the fringe benefits tax and the adverse effect it is having on the development of the Pilbara and north&amp;hyphen;west of Western Australia because this is an area where a fringe benefits tax was designed for city based operations rather than
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the bush. I suppose the fringe benefits tax has done more than any other piece of legislation to move people out of the regional and remote areas and back into the city. This is a tragedy.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those people who have participatedâ€”the tax law improvement team. It was not their fault that the mandate was so limited, but I think it is incumbent on the new government to pick up this issue. The recommendations are there for a more fundamental review. Unless we do this, our taxation system will continue to bog down business with unnecessary compliance details.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Over the years of the previous government, we have seen such things as fringe benefits on car parkingâ€”an extension of the whole concept of fringe benefits well beyond what was intended in terms of salary related sacrificial issues. It behoves the new government to look very closely at these issues if the Australian government is going to continue to grow and to prosper. I thank the Senate.

        I wanted to make some remarks tonight about my former Tasmanian Senate colleague John Coates from a number of perspectives. I found on John Coates' retirement that after just six years I have become the senior Labor senator for Tasmania. I am not sure whether that is a good or bad thing, but it did lead me to reflect a little on John's career. I first met John at the 1968 conference of the Tasmanian Labor Party held at the university. John was standing for preselection for the Federal seat of Denison. The ballot that took place was a relatively open ballot for the Australian Labor
        <break page="3334" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Party. It was a time when actually making a speech at a preselection process did influence a significant proportion of the delegates who were present on that occasion. My recollection of Johnâ€”it was my first conferenceâ€”was that John gave a very impressive speech on that occasion, which, given the narrowness of the result, certainly contributed towards his being preselected as our federal candidate. He was elected to the federal seat of Denison in 1972. Regrettably, he lost his seat in 1975.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During his period in the House of Representatives it has not often been acknowledgedâ€”I would like to acknowledge it tonightâ€”that John Coates played a significant role in the development of Labor's health policy during that period of government, particularly in the development of Medicare's predecessor, the Medibank system, which was regrettably scrapped over a number of years following the election of the Fraser Liberal government in 1975. I would like to place on record John's contribution in that area because it was very substantial. He would have to have been considered one of the major architects of our health policy through that era.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also recall quite vividly the events in the lead-up to the 1972 election when the then leader, Gough Whitlam, visited the Hobart Town Hall. A meeting took place at which my father, who was then a federal member, and John were speaking. On that occasion John gave two commitments. I related the story to him a couple of weeks ago when we had some retirement drinks for John. One of the issues he raised on that occasion was the transfer of the Antarctic base from its then location in Canberra to southern Tasmania. That was a specific issue and a specific commitment that John made. He made it a cause, and he delivered on that cause. He spent a number of years lobbying the federal Labor government during that period up to 1975, and he was successful. I think the then science minister was Mr Bill Morrison. He came to Hobart and announced the transfer of the Antarctic base. That has been critical, important and central in the development of Tasmania as an Antarctic centre for management and research. If there is an enduring
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         legacy to John, it is the Antarctic centre in southern Tasmania.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other commitment he gave was a commitment in respect to bull semen. John could not recall that issue that he raised on that occasion. He had a particular interest in that issue in those years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Up to 1975 John was a very active contributor in parliament and a very thorough, assiduous and dedicated member of the House of Representatives. Despite his defeat, John remained active in the Australian Labor Party. He was subsequently pre-selected and elected to the Senate. Throughout his period as a senator, John had a very distinguished committee career. I will just mention a couple of committees on which he was actively involved. They included the privileges committee, the regulations and ordinances committee and a range of other general policy committees. It is work that is not often recognised outside this place. Certainly from Labor's perspective, John was one of our major contributors in putting issues into policy through the Senate committee system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have said earlier, John was a very committed, dedicated and assiduous worker and very thorough in his approach, and a great stickler for detail. At times I found him a little too detailed from my dealings with him in the party. They are all attributes that led to his making a fine contribution in those areas. I have said earlier that committee work, as we all know, is very important in this Senate. Unfortunately, not enough people read the committee reports that we publish. Any cursory glance back through those reports would show that John, both as chair of a variety of committees and as a member of those committees, was a very active contributor indeed.

        Senator Faulkner has referred to John's factional activity. I was not a factional colleague of John's. We did have some differences of opinion over the years during his political career, but in politics I think it is important that we do not carry those differences personally. I certainly never did with John and I know he did not. He had a very committed set of principles. He always followed those principles through within the
        <break page="3335" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Australian Labor Party and within the broader community. He was a very dedicated and active senator, in particular in that area of committee work that I have highlighted. I think he is an example to anyone who wants to be involved in the committee area. There is also his work on the finance and public administration committee. I understand he was chair of that committee for a number of years.

        Former Senator John Coates can leave the Senate, reflecting back on an almost 20&amp;hyphen;year political career during which he made a significant contribution in terms of policy, committees and the internal workings of the Senate. As I said earlier, I think the Antarctic centre in Hobart is a monument to the perseverance of John as a politician. I wish John all the best in whatever his future undertakings. I wish his family all the best. I know that one of the reasons he decided on retirement at this point is that his son is entering his teenage years and John wants to spend more time with him. We all know the pressures on families, friendships and relationships as a consequence of our political service.

        â€”The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) The Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS) commissioned a study in 1995 with the Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) to investigate crashes involving airbag&amp;hyphen;equipped cars. The study was aimed at not only examining the benefits of airbags but also to alert FORS of any inherent problems with airbag deployments in the real world. Currently, MUARC has investigated sixty (60) cases of airbag deployment and there has not been any case of either adults or children in the passenger seat being injured or killed because of the airbag deploying.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       In addition, FORS is carrying out a joint project with the New Car Assessment Program consortium to provide consumer information on the benefits of airbags. This will involve crash testing a range of passenger cars fitted with and without airbags to provide an authoritative assessment of the injury reduction benefits.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) In Australia, children are required by law to be properly restrained in an approved child restraint. Approved child restraints incorporate an
       <break page="3338" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        upper tether strap which anchors the restraint to the vehicle structure. This requirement precludes the use of child seats and the like in the front seat of vehicles. The United States is now keen to follow Australia's lead in this area to minimise the likelihood of further fatalities in the US. The Federal Office of Road Safety has close links with their counterparts in the US, Canada, Europe and Japan so that there are regular reporting channels to alert FORS to any potential vehicle safety problems. In addition, FORS vehicle safety experts attend international meetings and conferences where the latest vehicle safety issues are canvassed.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) The full frontal Australian Design Rule (ADR) specifies injury limits measured by sophisticated crash test dummies. This allows manufacturers to choose the type of safety technology to demonstrate compliance and also encourages research into new, innovative restraint systems.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The setting of performance criteria is aimed at minimising the likelihood of serious injury in severe crashes. To meet the full frontal crash requirements, manufacturers do not necessarily have to fit an airbagâ€”an energy absorbing steering assembly, heavily padded steering wheel and improved seat belts can provide similar safety benefits.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       However, an airbag can reduce minor injuries on the occupant's upper torso and head in medium severity crashes.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The seatbelt wearing rate in the Unites States is only now approaching 70%. Australia has been over 95% for many years. Mandating airbags in the USA was the only way their government could ensure that occupants who do not wear seatbelts have some form of protection in crashes.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       This has its downside, as researchers are now finding out. To protect the unbelted, US airbags must fire early and with greater force (so&amp;hyphen;called `aggressive') than the systems seen in Australia. This means that the small in stature, the elderly and unrestrained or poorly restrained children in the USA are disadvantaged and both low and high speed crash cases are now emerging where the US `aggressive' airbags have caused fatal or serious injuries.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       That is why the Australian Design Rule requires the seatbelts to be fastened, allowing the vehicle manufacturers to tune their systems for restrained
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        occupants which results in less `aggressive' airbag systems.
