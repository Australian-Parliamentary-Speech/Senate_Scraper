         —In my speech in the second reading debate on the Telstra bill, I indicated that negotiations and discussions between the government and me had not been concluded. I also indicated that, in the weeks prior to the vote for the second reading of this bill, I sought concessions for Queensland because I considered the partial sale of Telstra to be eventually inevitable. Those negotiations and discussions I referred to in my speech have now been concluded.

        If the bill had been defeated on this occasion, and again after it had been reintroduced following a three&amp;hyphen;month delay, it would have been odds on that the government would take the opportunity to dissolve both houses. The likelihood of the government being returned with a majority in the Senate would be remote. It would have been unlikely, on the other hand, that the government would not have a majority at any subsequent joint sitting.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The partial sale of Telstra would then become a reality. But would there be any opportunity to seek special concessions if the government had the numbers to force its proposal through, however tortuous that path may have been? The opportunities would not exist, as they similarly would not have existed if the government had decided to sell part of Telstra by non&amp;hyphen;legislative means.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have outlined before, my principal concern with a part&amp;hyphen;privatised Telstra is the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         continued employment of Telstra employees in rural and regional Queensland. I accepted the fact that technological advances would lead to staff reductions, but I was not prepared to accept that centres where telephone operators were located would close.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There had been suggestions that they could close, and there was even a suggestion that 013 operators' jobs could be outsourced to the Philippines. While that would be most unlikely, the closure of operators centres in rural areas was openly canvassed. I was able to achieve the aim of operators continuing to be located in the following Queensland centres outside the Brisbane metropolitan area: Ipswich, Gold Coast, Toowoomba, Nambour, Mackay, Maryborough, Rockhampton, Roma and Cairns.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My second aim was to keep any reduction of operator numbers in those centres to a minimum. In accepting the number of operators who will be employed in those areas, I had to take into account that the number of operators would be reduced in other areas of Australia. To this end, the number of operators in rural Queensland will reduce by 3.4 per cent between 30 September this year and the end of June 1999, compared with a Queensland&amp;hyphen;wide reduction of 11.5 per cent and a nationwide reduction of 13.5 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to the agreement on the O13 operators, Telstra has agreed to locate a national directory assistance call connect customer service centre in Toowoomba. It is a new service which allows a customer to ring Telstra, ask for a person's number and be automatically connected to that person. The service will be offered from a separate access code and will attract a fee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Beginning in Queensland in 1998, this service will require the employment of 45 full-time staff by June 2000. These full-time operators are included in the percentage calculation of 3.4 per cent, which I have just mentioned. I seek leave to incorporate in

        I was wondering why there is a separate division 6 for customer service guarantee and whether there is a lack of faith in the consumer provisions that are already there. If that is so, why has the government not changed them in respect of all matters, not only as to the periods of time that suppliers might take to connect, but also the quality of the service? Why are they separate issues? The other question was one which I think Senator Harradine may have the answer to.

         —Because I want to ask the minister and Senator Harradine might want to think about this. In my previous speech I raised the problem of keeping the sale of Telstra to a third. The minister said that of course that would be so and it would be a little unusual that people would want to trade off more than a third. I would agree with those sentiments, but there are specific provisions in the proposed amendments which seem to contemplate that that might happen. I refer to proposed item 8AC which states:

        I agree with the proposition put by the minister yesterday that it does seem strange that Telstra would get into a position where more than a third was sold. The minister assured me that that would be a ridiculous position to be in. If that is ridiculous, why is that provision in the proposed amendments? If the government wants to keep the sale to a third and no more than a third, why does it have provision 8BX which says:
       </para>

        An act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Part.

        One way of keeping the sale of Telstra to a third and no more than that—in other words, one way of keeping the third from going beyond a third—would be to sell it by redeemable preference shares. Then if you do go beyond a third, you can redeem them back. It seems that a suggestion has been made that a great amount of capital can be raised by selling redeemable preference shares and that would ensure that no more than a third was sold. It would save the government having to put in a section which enables a court to fine Telstra and the government would not need to go to provision 8BX.

        It has been said that the government might not get as much as otherwise, but that is a matter for the markets. We do not know what we will get until we see the prospectus in any case.

        There are those two issues. Why do you have a separate provision, division 6, for the customer service guarantee when you already have one? You have left the one that is there without changing it in any substance, yet you are bringing in another regime. It seems fairly contradictory. I would like you to answer the consumer protection issue, if you could, and the issue of the creep in the size of the share of Telstra that is sold.

That is not in current legislation, unlike a number of other consumer safeguard arrangements such as the right to untimed local calls, price caps and the universal service obligation. The customer guarantee is something that we developed specifically in the lead-up to the last election in recognition of the fact that quite frequently the carriers, particularly Telstra, do not honour their arrangements to keep appointments

        This provision is designed to ensure that they do and punish them if they do not by way of pecuniary entitlement which can, as you pointed out yesterday, be  offset against your phone bill if necessary or if it is your choice. It is an entirely new provision. It is a world first for Australia. It does have regard to practices that I have observed elsewhere, particularly in the US and the UK, but to my knowledge no-one has taken precisely this approach. I think that is one of the reasons why the Australian Democrats finally came to the conclusion that the customer protection arrangements were so good that they wanted to get those pushed through the parliament as quickly as possible. It is over and above what is there already.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as the general notion that you should not be able to sell more than one-third is concerned, the starting point is political reality. No-one in this parliament would contemplate for a moment standing idly by and allowing Telstra, or indeed anyone else associated with the partial sale, to blithely contravene the act. If it were necessary I would not have thought there would be any shortage of volunteers to come into the parliament and do something about it, but that will not be a problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As you point out, there is already a provision that would punish Telstra to the tune of some $250,000 and would make it an illegal act if they were to consciously go beyond the one-third. A lot of consequences flow from illegal actions, as I pointed out yesterday. For example, any potential investor who entered into a contractual arrangement would be at risk of not getting their money back if they were a party to something they were aware was against the law. Senator Cooney referred me to 8BX, which reads:
       </para>

        An act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Part.
       </para>
       <para>
        This part is actually part 2A, which commences on page 29 of the bill. That essentially relates to restrictions on foreign ownership and the limit we are putting in place, and some of the other provisions as well including that Telstra's head office, base of operations
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and place of incorporation are to remain in Australia, and that Telstra's chairman and a majority of Telstra's directors must be Australian citizens, et cetera.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is fair to say that in that area you can have accidental overlaps which would need to be corrected. The Qantas float was a recent classic example of that. Therefore, that provision is designed to ensure that some accidental temporary overlap does not result in an invalidation of the whole sale exercise in relation to foreign ownership. But it does not in any way refer to the overall concept of the sale. Therefore, any breach would remain a breach and would not be overlooked by reference to that provision.

         —Section 38 of the existing act does relate to the quality of performance by the carrier. Therefore, there is an obligation on the carrier to provide certain information under pain of financial penalty but also to provide a deal of information which then finds its way into Austel quarterly and annual performance reports.

         That is one of the bases upon which we have come to the view that Telstra's perform ance has been inadequate. In other words, particularly outside the metropolitan areas, we consistently find that the quality of service is declining—the length of time it takes to answer a phone call, the length of time it takes to get through to operator assisted services, the length of time it takes to get through to service difficulties and faults, for example.

        All of those at the moment are simply dealt with by putting them on the public record. Section 38 simply enables or requires Austel to make public those deficiencies in Telstra's performance of customer satisfaction but does not take it any further. That is why the customer service satisfaction guarantee for the first time puts a legal obligation on Telstra to provide services within a fixed period, to install and maintain and keep appointments within a certain period, and if they do not you can get your money back.

As an outcome of the standard telephone service review report, which is due on 20 December, it is quite open to that group to recommend to the minister that we upgrade the minimum standards of quality of service. So we can deal with that by regulation at any time under the existing law.

        However, the customer service guarantee is over and above that. It deals specifically with defaults in terms of installation, maintenance and appointment keeping. So the combination of all these things is that you will get much more focus on Telstra's performance.

        In case it is suggested by Senator Schacht or anyone else that somehow this does not go far enough, let me remind him of a couple of examples in my own portfolio area of which he ought to be very much aware. The Creative Nation policy document was released in October 1994. It simply contained an announcement in respect of the Australian multi&amp;hyphen;media enterprise—$45 million. All that you got was the announcement. Ministers were still corresponding on which portfolio would take responsibility for the initiative several months later.

        Industry consultation was required and continued into January 1995, and the commercial structure was not complete until December—well after the announcement. The executive administration and board structures were eventually decided upon in April 1995, some six months after the announcement. The DIST concessional loans program of $48.2 million over four years was announced in the 1994-95 budget as part of the Working Nation package. At the time of the announcement, the government had not developed policies for assessing applications, nor had it developed an administrative framework or delivery mechanism. The scheme was not operational until the end of 1994&amp;hyphen;95.

The package also included tax incentives for encouraging owners of heritage listed properties to carry out approved conservation work.

It was said at the time of the announcement that the strategies would be developed following a consultation process that had not at that time been established.

Then we see in the list this great deal, this great pork barrel of Senator Colston, that by June 1999 there will be 40 extra jobs in Queensland for this national call connect centre. There is an indicative list of what Telstra has said it will provide in staff levels through 1997, 1998 and 1999.

         It just does not add up. You were taken for a ride by this government. I suspect the deal was done when you became Deputy President of the Senate—a wink, a nudge and a nod. For Senator Colston to table this as evidence of his great achievement really is quite astonishing. This slush deal has been done to provide funds that basically will be under political control and appears to have advantaged in some limited way the concerns of senators Colston and Harradine.

          This deal will rely on the exposure the minister gets when he makes his statement and other people can judge. This is not like any other arrangement, I say to senators Colston and Harradine. Once you sell one third of Telstra you cannot say in a couple of years, `I made a mistake; I want to retract it; I want to withdraw the legislation and get a third of Telstra back into public ownership'. This is done once and lasts forever. You cannot get it back.

         That was one of the points Senator Harradine made consistently in the last six months. He knew that, and he raised a redeemable preference share issue as a way to allow a future government to get the third of Telstra back. The way Senator Harradine has made arrangements for the committee to have a look at it but to have no effect on the outcome means that that has gone as well.

         Minister, we appreciate that today you have given us a little bit more information. Apparently you could have given it to us three or four days ago, according to Senator Harradine, but you chose not to; you dropped it here at the last moment. But it still does not overcome the fact that at the very least you should have replicated the national heritage trust fund arrangements—put it through a Senate committee to see that it was properly done as far as it possibly could be. What you have here is a political slush fund, which we will call the tele rort fund.

        Amendments 1 to 3 seek to modify clauses 8AA and 8AB of the bill. I have moved them
        <break page="7024" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         because I want to give some strength to Senator Harradine's proposal for a Senate inquiry. These amendments will ensure that the only shares that can be sold in Telstra will be redeemable preference shares. I am not sure at this stage about the redeemable preference shares proposal. I do not have a closed mind on it. I do at this stage think that it makes more sense to Telstra and to the government to raise finance by way of a bond issue than a float of redeemable preference shares. But, as I say, my mind is not closed.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One thing I do agree with Senator Harradine on, though, is that a float of redeemable preference shares is infinitely preferable to a float of ordinary shares. It is preferable for two reasons. First, it ensures that the control of the underlying assets of Telstra stay with the Commonwealth, stay in public hands. As Senator Harradine has repeatedly pointed out, a float of redeemable preference shares allows the government to raise $8 billion worth of revenue without surrendering control of the underlying assets of Telstra. I think that is really important. It is vitally important—this has been Senator Harradine's argument in relation to a whole lot of other entities—that, wherever there is basically a natural monopoly, it should remain in public hands.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second reason that redeemable preference shares are preferable to the issue of ordinary shares is that the entire financing proposal is reversible. The preference shares would be redeemable at some later stage by a future government. When the budget deficit is properly repaired in years to come, and if the Telstra sale does not proceed, such repair will proceed far more quickly and a future government with a bit more foresight than both the former Keating government and the current Howard government about the value of assets could start redeeming the shares. I know that that is a big political ask, but we are not talking about the best option here.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not unusual for us to look at the reversibility of this situation. Each year billions of dollars worth of government bonds fall due and they are redeemed, usually by the issuing of new government bonds. A future government may decide—at least this gives
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         them the option—to move the debt from Telstra redeemable preference shares to government bonds. I think the reversibility aspect of this is important because a lot of us here and a lot of Australians have not been convinced about this huge economic and social experiment of privatisation—in this case, a privatised Telstra.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are not convinced privatisation of Telstra will be in the public interest. Who is to say whether in a couple of years time consumers will be happy with the outcomes, despite the minister's assertions? Who is to say what business will be thinking in a couple of years time? Who is to say how regional Australia will view what they see they have been given and how it actually works out in practice? Maybe a political party may be able to make promising to redeem the shares a very attractive proposition to Australian voters. So that is the attraction of Senator Harradine's proposal vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis ordinary shares.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I reiterate, though, for us it is very much a second best solution. We should not be issuing any shares of any type at all. Telstra should remain in total ownership by the Australian people. I believe the public sector would be much better off if the float of Telstra did not proceed. I want to raise the economic argument here that the public sector will be better off to the tune of $1 billion over four years, with that amount increasing. That increases to $2&amp;half; billion when retained profits are added to the equation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is what we are giving up. This is what we are losing. We might have some little deal for regional Australia. Nobody wants to disparage the opportunity for employment for any Australian, but let us not overlook what has been forgone in this arrangement. Not proceeding with the float means $2&amp;half; billion of taxes that will not have to be increased. This government has not said yet how it will make up the income stream forgone. It means $2&amp;half; billion worth of services that will not have to be cut if we do not sell off the profit stream.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is a strong argument. I want to put it before a Senate inquiry with teeth—not a pathetic Senate inquiry whose report is preordained to go nowhere but a Senate inquiry
        <break page="7025" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         where its final report will influence what is happening with the Telstra financing option. If my amendments are accepted, then Senator Harradine's inquiry will suddenly become very important. It will be looking at two issues: whether there are benefits for the public sector in moving down the redeemable preference share float option or whether the public sector would be better off not proceeding with the float but rather financing $8 billion worth of public debt through normal government Treasury bonds.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That would be a very interesting inquiry. I do not see any point in participating in an inquiry that is reduced to an academic exercise in proving Treasury wrong on its arguments even though you know full well it does not make one iota of difference at the end because this government will still proceed to an ordinary shares float. We know what Treasury think about this proposal. I think these amendments will keep Treasury honest. It will force them to seriously consider, just for once, whether they are better off with redeemable preference shares or Treasury bonds. That is why I am asking senators Harradine and Colston in particular to support these amendments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fourth amendment seeks to enhance the reporting arrangements of Telstra Corporation to the parliament by seeking to ensure that, where Telstra makes major changes to its staffing levels, they are reported to the minister as the investment manager for the majority Commonwealth shares, who must then seek the option of his or her principals, the Commonwealth parliament. If the principals, that is both houses of parliament, by resolution approve the plan, it proceeds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This will give the parliament some control over Telstra's staffing levels. Obviously, in making an assessment, the parliament will balance the impact on staffing issues vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis dividends and profitability—not a radical proposal at all. Senator Colston in his remarks said that the guarantee or the safeguard for all of us over employment was for each senator for Queensland and each member of the House of Representatives for Queensland to monitor the implementation of the government's proposal. So what! We look at
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         it; we monitor it. What can we do about it? We cannot do anything about it under the existing proposals.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under this proposal, we are saying that the parliament, as the elected representatives of the majority shareholders, the two&amp;hyphen;thirds, should have the right to decide whether it wants to trade off some aspect of dividends against maintaining employment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a lot of other privatisation decisions which have been brokered through watchful upper houses and which have included guarantees about staffing. For example, the State Bank privatisation in New South Wales, in which my colleague Liz Kirby was involved, required no reduction in staffing numbers or branches for three years after privatisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My amendment is drafted in a similar vein, recognising that workers should not be the victims of privatisation. It is bad enough when privatisation results in a massive transfer of windfall gain from public hands to private hands with the undervaluing of asset prices, but then there is almost always this massive transfer of value from labour to capital as labour is stripped to the bone for a temporary—and it is always temporary—rise in dividends.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This amendment will ensure some protection against excessive and ludicrous downsizing. There are too many corporate cowboys out there who test their corporate virility by how many body bags they can produce. I have heard them in planes talking about how many faceless people they managed to downsize this month. It makes me sick. It makes me sick that people in secure jobs can always talk so callously about the people for whom there will be no jobs. And Telstra is no exception, with the most callous way in which people on million dollar salaries can say, `And 22,000 of you have to have no jobs at all'. Haven't they been listening to Stephen Roach, the so&amp;hyphen;called guru of downsizing? He is saying that downsizing is short&amp;hyphen;sighted. I am reminded that when Kim Beazley was minister he forced Telstra to shed 15,000 jobs. Then it started to expand again and they had to put most of them back on. That was a
        <break page="7026" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        BZW has forecast that Telstra will have a 27 per cent profit improvement over the next three years despite falling market share, and that is with staff reductions of just 6,000 to 8,000. But there has been all this predication that Telstra was not going to be worth selling in years to come; all this talking down for months and months. And now, suddenly, when you want to sell it, it is miraculously worth a whole lot more in your view. To me, 22,000 seems excessive. It is all about inflating the Telstra float sale price. It is the same innocent people. If this sale did not happen, 22,000 workers might not lose their jobs, 22,000 families might not face the prospect of serious financial upheaval and the communities within which those 22,000 workers live would not face flow&amp;hyphen;on job losses. Preserving 35 jobs in Toowoomba and 175 in Tasmania has to be placed in the context of losing 22,000 jobs over the rest of Australia.

        Please support my amendment. You say that majority ownership of Telstra means public control. Let us give the public a say through the parliament—a say on what happens with Telstra jobs. Amendments 5 and 6 are consequential on my amendments 1 and 3. They seek to modify the Telstra sale scheme to limit a float to the sale of redeemable preference shares.

Perhaps we would need to check with the minister how frequently an organisation like Telstra, for various reasons, would actually shed 100 jobs. We would need to check on the ability to report to the parliament. I am not sure whether or not there might not be difficulties and unintended consequences of there having to be a parliamentary decision each time there were 100 jobs—

        However, what we do not have is better outcomes. Ironically, the minister was today talking about people having to wait longer on phones or having to wait for services. It is ironic, because when you cut down staff in a service industry, people have to wait longer. Companies such as Optus, which are running in competition, can choose what services they provide. At the moment, there is a lot less choice from Telstra. I would certainly like to keep it that way so that the company has some public obligation.

         When you pull people out of a service industry such as telecommunications, funnily enough, people have to wait longer on the line and for other services. Telstra is providing not just a range of courtesy services for business at competitive prices but a whole range of services for a whole range of people. To be able to provide services in a country such as Australia, you have to have people. Machines are not yet able to do those things for which, in the end, you really need to speak to someone at the end of the line. If they keep getting changed from machine to machine, a few of those telephones will end up being abused by the people on the other end of them.

         The reality is that we are seeing not a concentration on actual outcomes but on a very narrow definition. I am afraid that Senator Alston's definition of efficiency in service provision in the public sector is that you get rid of people. He thinks it must be efficient if you get rid of people. I do not think that. The Parliamentary Catering Service is another good example of that. The people are not the problem. It is the way that you expect people with fewer services to provide a service. In the end, instead of putting that money back into the service, it goes off as profit. The benefit of the people forced into having very little choice ends up suffering. Exactly the same is happening with Telstra. When you end up giving Telstra those things which other people in the market do not want, that is what ends up happening. In the end, you will say, `See. We told you they were inefficient. Let us compare it to a privatised sector, which then chooses to cream those areas of the market in which they think there is a buck.'

         In general, Senator Kernot's amendments are supportable. To a certain extent, they pre-empt the outcome of the committee. We have started the committee. We have not yet dealt with the rest of the amendments. It certainly pre-empts the findings of any inquiry. Because of that, it is better than what existed to start with, but it is pre-empting the outcomes to a certain extent. I would like to flag that, at the end of all this process and Senator Harradine's amendment to the motion that the

In this way, we will have a chance, at the end of that legislative committee, to come back with the outcome of the committee and be in the situation in which we are now in. We can then make a real vote at the end of that process. I am keen to hear from the minister in relation to Senator Kernot's amendment No. 4. What are the implications of making sure that there are not any unintended consequences if amendment No. 4 is supported?

That is really the problem that you confront time and again when you look around the world. The fact is that, unless you get your

They would make them on a whole range of other factors, but not on the basis that management and a board are employed to make them. That is not in any shape or form a workable proposal.

         I have to say, whatever one's assumptions, Senator Harradine has made some very strong points as to why he believes the validity of the redeemable preference share option has great merit. In this amendment we are saying to Senator Harradine, `We've taken your view here. We say you should support this amend ment because it actually puts into action the possibility of the redeemable preference share. It also maintains Telstra in full public ownership, which is what you have said your gut instinct has been all the time to support. You have not voted for privatisation before.' This way there is flexibility for the government to achieve its fiscal outcomes, raising money to handle debt, but it is not irrevocably sold; it could always be looked at in the future.

        There are many arguments amongst economists and others about the points you raise, Senator Harradine, but we would believe that, for you, this amendment achieves 99.9 per cent of what you set out to achieve in many of your public statements over the last six to nine months. So I would be interested to hear Senator Harradine's comments about this amendment.

        I also take the point that Senator Margetts raised, which will be debated later in the committee stage, about Senator Harradine's amendment to refer his redeemable preference share issue to the standing committee on economics and to report back by March. This bill, if carried at the moment, cannot be gazetted until past that date. We have all said many times on the record that that is no satisfactory outcome at all because the government could completely ignore any recommendation of the Senate committee and proceed to proclaim the bill as passed in this Senate, with the support of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston.

         We believe that Senator Margetts's amendment has a lot of merit in that, above all else, it makes the work of the Senate committee absolutely effective. It makes it reasonable for the senators to say, `Whatever we are doing on this committee, whatever evidence we are dealing with, it actually could have some effect.' It cannot be ignored because the final vote would be delayed until the committee's report is dealt with. That really is a very sensible way to handle this. I could imagine on most other occasions the Senate committees would come into disrepute, if they were doing work the outcome of which was predetermined by government unilaterally taking other action. Members on the Senate commit tees would say, `Why would you bother with the work?'

        We believe that the amendment moved by Senator Kernot should be supported. We take note of the query in subsection (4) about staffing numbers. It is interesting that only this minister would respond by pointing out how to get around it, not how it could be used effectively in respect of future job losses. Only this minister would immediately look—as a lawyer from the Victorian bar—at how he can get around any provision that parliament may put in. So he says, `We'll sack in lots of 99 and ignore it.' That is typical of the way this minister treats these sorts of things.

        Minister, it is very true that nobody wants to second&amp;hyphen;guess the management of Telstra in full public ownership, but the way you have been going on and the way the arrangements have been reached, you are removing the power of the minister to direct on this legislation. Therefore, what are the other protections? If you left the power of the minister to direct in the legislation, this would not be necessary. We will come to that amendment later on. That is why the opposition is sympathetic to subsection (4) of this amendment. We also believe this is a way in which Senator Harradine may actually have his cake and eat it too, as far as maintaining Telstra in public ownership is concerned, but leave the possibility of having redeemable shares issues.

Let me make it perfectly clear once and for all—I hope it is once and for all—that the legislation, as it stands, does enable the Telstra board to raise money by way of the redeemable preference shares—

          speaking, the decision will be made by the Telstra board in respect of the raising of capital and it can be done by redeemable preference shares or other hybrid arrangements. I am not as absolutely convinced about the value or the merit, without allowing, as I think we should, the standing committee on economics to consider it. I was a bit surprised to hear Senator Kernot indicate that her preference may well be that the revenue raising amount should perhaps arise out of bond issues.

        I understand what you are saying about the employment issue. I had a look at that. There are technical difficulties. One thing that Senator Schacht did say—and I thought I heard Senator Mackay agree with him—was that were the government not taking away the power to direct under section 9 this would not be necessary. I am inclined to agree with you.

        The amendment is self&amp;hyphen;explanatory. I do not know whether honourable senators wish to canvass this at length at this time. I am happy to do so, but I think we are probably happy to deal with this particular matter simply as a procedural matter and then come to Senator Margetts's amendments if we want a real debate on effects. We can come to Senator Margetts's amendments at the end of the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        Before I deal with that, I think it is very important, as we are in committee, to raise a matter that was raised by Senator Kernot. Frankly, I am disappointed in Senator Kernot saying that the 22,000 jobs that Telstra is cutting are as a result of the sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra. The information was tabled in the parliament today. I have been able to get from the clerk a copy of the letter, by the chief executive officer, Frank Blount, that went to all members of staff, pointing out that the decision taken by the board was the result of open competition from July 1997. The result of that was that they needed to tackle the problem of efficiency. That problem was highlighted by the fact that Telstra was operating at 30 per cent below world best practice in this particular field.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The very big telecom companies are going to enter the market from July 1997. That decision, of course, was as a result of decisions taken by the previous government and endorsed by the current government. As Mr Blount said, `If we cannot keep pace with the efficiency levels of our major competitors, we will not be able to meet their lower prices, which means we will lose market share and revenue. Our profits will fall and our growth will be restrained.' In other words, they would lose employment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Blount said, `We are looking closely at ways of improving efficiency by analysing all parts of our business to see whether they fit with our future business strategies, in particular the way our core businesses are operated and managed.' Et cetera, et cetera. `Inevitably, these efficiency measures will mean staff reductions.' That would happen whether I voted for the sale of a third of Telstra or whether I did not. It does not make any difference at all. Telstra was in the process of slimming down to meet the challenges of competition, which, of course, were the result, I understand, of a bipartisan understanding.

        I repeat what I indicated to you earlier. It is incorrect for you and a mistake on your part to assert that, because of some changes that have been made for efficiencies, the government is not interested in this and not interested in that. It is possible to come back with a long list of efficiencies that your government sought in a wide range of areas when it was in government and to assert that, because you were seeking those efficiencies, you had no interest in beneficial outcomes. But, of course, that would not be true.

        Our approach to human rights is based on, first, a realistic assessment of what can and cannot be achieved; secondly, a constructive dialogue with other governments, including both bilateral and multilateral approaches; and, thirdly, working to strengthen democratic and human rights institutions, particularly in our region.

We would have no doubt wished to hand more back to them and wished that they had benefited more, but there is only so much you can do when you inherit a deficit of $10 billion. To be able to address that $10 billion deficit, to balance the books within a three-year term of government, whilst at the same time giving something back to those who suffered most under Labor policies is something that should be commended. If Senator Faulkner had the courage of his convictions, he would commend us for what we have done as well.

         —I am happy to give answers on both if time permits, Senator Cook. The report of the review of Australia's Quarantine and Inspection Service is not a review of individual applications. It has nothing to say about them. The key theme of the report is that quarantine is a shared responsibility, as you have said, Senator. It is necessary for all governments, industry and very much the general public to take ownership of quarantine in this country. The minister has pointed out that there is a need for quarantine to be viewed as a continuum which incorporates offshore, border and post&amp;hyphen;border measures, with each of these elements supporting and reinforcing the other.

        The report refutes the belief held by some that we can adopt a no risk quarantine policy, as it would be untenable and totally impracticable. Australia's quarantine policy is not and cannot be one of zero risk. Such an objective would require the end of all trade and international travel. The report recommends a continuation of the use and refinement of scientifically based risk analysis. It recommends further improving current processes in terms of timing and the amount of consultation and communication, and it has provision for an appeal mechanism on process.

        The report says that Australia's quarantine systems were generally in good shape and notes that much of the criticism about the effectiveness of AQIS cannot be supported by facts. However, the Commonwealth remains committed to maintaining a conservative quarantine policy to safeguard human, animal and plant health in Australia. The report recommends the creation of a statutory authority called Quarantine Australia to ensure political independence. There is a diversity of views on this issue, such as the recent Senate report on cooked chicken meat and the report of the national task force on fish and fish products.

        I understand that the minister's comments on this issue have been taken somewhat out of context. What the minister was addressing was the myth that exists amongst some sectors of the community that the overseas born in general are more likely to be involved in criminal activity than are the Australian born. Australian and overseas studies have consistently shown that the overseas born commit fewer crimes and are less likely to be in prison than the Australian born.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        According to the 1993 national prison sentence data, the overseas born prison rate of 86.9 per 100,000 was significantly lower than the Australian born prison rate of 131.6 per 100,000. This compares with rates in 1985 of 76.5 for overseas born and 107.53 for Australian born people. I suppose that simply shows that we are putting more people per thousand in prison; whether we are catching them doing the same number of crimes or more than that is not commented on.

        All applicants for entry to Australia must be of good character, and character requirements are designed to exclude any person whose presence in Australia would not be in the interests of the broader Australian community.

        There is no particular problem with New Zealanders. The minister used the example of

         New Zealand migrants, who have a higher prison rate than some other migrant groups do, and who are not subject to the same screening arrangements as other migrants are, to illustrate how effective Australia's migration screening procedures are. They are not subject to the same screening arrangements as other migrants, because of the special relationship between Australia and New Zealand.

          Under the trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman travel arrangement, Australian and New Zealand citizens may enter each other's country to visit, live or work without normal screening requirements. This joint arrangement between the Australian and New Zealand governments recognises the common historical, cultural, political and institutional history of the two countries. Being from a particular national or ethnic group does not make an individual more or less disposed to crime. The important point to make is that socioeconomic circumstances of individuals, irrespective of birthplace, are key determinants of the incidence of crime.

        The Institute of Criminology statistics indicate a positive correlation between unemployment and higher prison figures, and, therefore, specific overseas born groups who experience high unemployment may have higher prison rates—but for that reason, not by reason of their place of birth. A prevalence of higher crime rates among some migrant groups is not because they are predisposed to commit crime or because the immigration character checks are ineffective but because they experience higher unemployment and lower socioeconomic status.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To add one more point, the prevalence of high unemployment amongst some migrant groups can be best addressed by refocusing the immigration program onto skilled migration and thus restoring the balance in the program. That would be one step that we could take. That is exactly what this government intends to do with the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 intake. Senator, I think that does answer most of your questions but, as I have said, I will give this answer and your questions to Mr Ruddock. If there is anything he wants to add in relation to some specifics, no doubt he will give me some further information for you.

         Senator Bishop's question was prompted by a letter that most senators would have received today from the Chamber of Mines and Energy of Western Australia Incorporated. This letter makes very useful reading, particularly because the next question that Senator Parer received today was on the environmental measures being taken by the mining industry.

Of course there will be people who oppose what the government is doing because, whenever they are going to be affected by legislation, they are always going to come along and try to put their case strongly, just as, when the opposition was in government, people came along and put their points of view just as strongly.

        In any event, in each of those cases the governments position prevailed because, in effect, it is not just looking at one industry in isolation. In this case, you talk about penalising industries. When a government comes to power and finds itself with the financial problems that you as a government left us, something has to be done across the board to make sure that whatever cuts had to be made were felt evenly. This is not penalising companies; what we are looking at is overcoming budget deficits. That is why the decision was made.

We might have a different position, Senator Abetz, on different issues related to that industry. Yes, of course we do have a different view about diesel fuel rebate on the one hand and financing for R&amp;D on the other. Of course we would, because one is of much greater value.

          —Maybe we would make some adjustments to it if you are talking about rorting the system. The other thing you talk about, Senator Abetz, is interest rates. Well, let me just point out to you that, factually, interest rates for business have not decreased under your government. In fact, the differential between home loan rates and business interest rates has actually increased—and that is a fact. In 1992 it was 0.3 of one per cent. It is now over three per cent, so do not come in here singing your praises about how you have improved things in business as far as interest rates are concerned.

         Last but not least: industrial relations and the mining industry. Most of the industrial reform within the mining industry was done prior to your even winning government. I have to say that, given that your bill will not take effect—I do not think—until 1 January, it is not going to have any impact on the mining industry, nor its future industrial relations.

         —I rise to speak to this matter of public importance on the deleterious effect of the government's cuts and higher fees on access to the Family Court and related services. The Family Court is a much maligned but nonetheless essential service in our community. It is a body that is there to resolve the most personal and most important of disputes. It is not surprising that many Family Court cases excite intense emotions and anxiety amongst the participants and the community.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All the major parties as well as the minor parties in this place support the ongoing role of the Family Court. Whilst many of us from time to time have been critical of aspects of its administration, we all overwhelmingly value the service it provides. The Family Court is surrounded by a series of support services. Some are provided within the courts, such as the court's own counselling and mediation service. Others are provided in the community. These include marriage and relationship education, adolescent and family mediation, family skills training and family mediation services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The totality of these services is aimed at providing as flexible and as helpful response as possible to firstly prevent families entering into crisis and also supporting them in the event that they do. The objective of the parliament is that at the end of the day we want to see fewer divorces. We want to see more families stay together and we want to see those families that do separate do so amicably. We want to see more children have access to both their parents, their grandparents and their extended families. This is why the government cuts in this area are so mean spirited.
       </para>
       <break page="7056" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In short, the cuts imposed by this government, this Howard government, will make it harder for ordinary Australians to access these essential services. An inability to access justice meted out by the Family Court or the assistance provided by the related services means more family turmoil, more heartache, more despair. It is damage flowing from these cuts that simply cannot be measured by economists. It is damage to the very fabric of our society and something that we should not tolerate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So let us look at these cuts. Firstly, in terms of the Family Court itself, the government promised in the election campaign to cut $2 million a year from the court's budget. They claimed this would be merely efficiency gains by the court. But it did not take long for this promise to be proven false. The court's budget has been cut by $3&amp;half; million in 1996-97 after the so-called public sector wide efficiency cuts, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department efficiency cuts and the loss of Justice Statement funding are all taken into account.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The cuts do not end there, for the forward estimates show that the court will face a further cut of $10 million in real terms in 1997-98—big cuts and the impacts are deep. For instance, in terms of the consequence of these cuts, registries at Mackay and Bendigo have already been closed. Another at Launceston has been reduced to a counselling registry and even that is under threat. The registries at Geelong, Rockhampton and Wollongong are at risk.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The daily reduction programs in Melbourne and Parramatta were suspended, although high demand has forced the reinstatement of the Parramatta program on a more limited basis. The delays in the Melbourne registry have become so bad that practitioners there openly talk about over 1,000 cases that have disappeared into the waiting list black hole at that registry alone.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Circuits to regional areas have also been severely reduced. Circuits have been reduced to Albury, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Launceston, Mount Gambier, Traralgon, Warrnambool and Whyalla. But they are the lucky
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          ones. Burnie, Griffith and Wagga Wagga will not be visited at all.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The loss of Justice Statement funds will mean that the provision of two family consultants to service remote and regional centres will not go ahead. The Cairns registry will not be upgraded to a filing registry as promised and outreach programs to Campbelltown in New South Wales and Logan and Ipswich in Queensland will not proceed. Only 19 of the 39 new Family Court counsellors promised in that Justice Statement Australia wide will now be employed—less than 50 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I previously implied, related services will also be deeply affected. First, there is the Family Court mediation and counselling service. The Family Court Amendment Bill 1996, which is currently before us, seeks to allow the court to charge a $40 per hour fee for this service.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The concern of the opposition in this place in respect of the introduction of these fees is twofold. Firstly, there are deep access to justice implications in slugging families in crisis with a $40 fee for the provision of the service. Ultimately, this service does save the government money because it helps reduce the rate of divorce. Secondly, we are concerned about the longer term objectives underlying the bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In respect of this bill and the charges being implemented by the government, this is yet another breach of this government's election commitment to the Australian people. In its law and justice policy, the coalition promised to:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options for resolutions of disputes.
        </para>
        <para>
         A measure such as this one, which makes it harder for people to access mediation and counselling services because of the imposed fees, hardly supports or increases the options that are available to Australian families in crisis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="7057" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          But the cuts do not end there. Government cuts mean that the family skills training services that were to be provided under Labor's Justice Statement this financial year in the Richmond-Tweed area, Central Mur rumbidgee, Shepparton&amp;hyphen;Mooroopna, Bendigo, Ballarat, Gold Coast, Wide Bay&amp;hyphen;Burnett or the Greenough River region will not proceed. We can also look at the adolescent and family mediation services which were to be provided this year and next in Newcastle, the Clarence, Geelong, Whyalla and Preston. They will also go.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The range of programs that this government is prepared to cut is amazing. It does not stop there. Family mediation services which were to be opened in Gosford, Newcastle, Wollongong, the northern outer suburbs of Melbourne, Geelong, Bendigo, Ipswich, Wide Bay&amp;hyphen;Burnett or Perth's south&amp;hyphen;eastern metropolitan area simply will not be provided.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A whole range of services have been ditched—services that are critical to families in crisis and services that are critical to regional families in crisis. On top of those, we can look at the court fees. This government has made concessions to Senator Harradine, and I must say that we have not as yet seen the colour of those concessions or the regulations. It is getting very close to Christmas and the parliament will soon adjourn, and the Attorney-General is sitting on those regulations. They need to be brought forward immediately. Despite those concessions they will still garner a massive $90 million over the next four years out of the Family Court system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fees for a typical family law case will increase from some $368 to over $1,700. That is before anyone pays one cent to their lawyer. These fees are not user pays; they are basically a rough tough on families in crisis, a tax with devastating consequences on the families and on the fabric of our society. They are not going to deter the rich. The extremely poor will not be adversely affected because some of them will still be able to get legal assistance. The people who will suffer from these fees will be the new emerging group in our society, the group that is progressively being identified as Howard's losers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must say that this is not where it stops in terms of funding to legal aid. The ramifications of the cutbacks in legal aid on the family law system are also quite deep and pervasive. We had an assurance from the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Attorney-General that cuts to legal aid funding would mean more money for family law cases, but despite this we are already seeing caps placed on the funding. For example, in Victoria there is a cap of $15,000 on existing cases, with a cap of $10,000 on new ones.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is happening already is that we are finding the intellectually disabled having to represent themselves and fathers being forced to cross&amp;hyphen;examine their own children when allegations of incest have been made. This is a government which does not care about access to justice and which does not care about families. It is depriving families and Australian citizens in general from access to the most basic services in our court system.
        </para>

         —At the outset let me say that, if the judicial system is in crisis, then the responsibility for that has to be borne by the former government.

         funding cut of $1.65 million to programs initiated under the previous government's Justice Statement. Also, there is a two per cent reduction which is demanded through the efficiency dividend. So there are no great surprises here in relation to these cuts. There is nothing that has been hidden from the Australian people. It was on this platform that the Australian people elected this government.

        The other aspect that Senator Bolkus touches on is that of higher fees. In relation to the Family Court, the proposed fee for ancillary relief was proposed at $250. However, after negotiations and consultation, the government reduced this to $150. As well as this, the government reduced the proposed one&amp;hyphen;off hearing fee from $400 to $300. To partially offset that, the government agreed to an increase in fee for divorce applications from $460 to $500.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government announced all these proposed increases in the 1996-97 budget. It was as a result of finding the $8 billion black hole which the previous government hid from the people of Australia. It was in relation to that sad state of affairs of Australia's finances that this government had to take the course of action it took. It took it across the board—not just in relation to the judicial system, not just in relation to legal aid or the Family Court, but across the board.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to the question of related services, Senator Bolkus has raised the question of a deterioration in counselling and mediation services. The first thing is that the $40 an hour fee is only in respect of voluntary counselling as opposed to counselling which is ordered by the courts. There will be exemptions for those who cannot afford it. So at the end of the day you will not have a counselling fee for that which is ordered by a court, and you will not have it applying to people who cannot afford it.

        The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General in the National Press Club on 15 October this year said he was keen to maximise access to primary forms of dispute resolution such as mediation and counselling and to ensure that those services are provided in the most efficient and effective way. He said such services were less
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Bolkus appears to be saying that capping legal aid at $15,000 is denying people access to the Family Court. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has said it is better to try to resolve matters by mediation and counselling than to throw money at litigation and that if you must have litigation cap the fee so that it can be spread evenly across those who need it. The choice in legal aid is always whether to spend thousands of dollars on one case and so deny others a chance of representation. Capping provides more people with access to legal aid and representation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Regarding counselling services, Senator Bolkus overlooks the fact that there are some 288 venues around the country where counselling services are funded by the Commonwealth. In regional areas, where there are Family Court closures, community&amp;hyphen;based services may be required to pick up counselling work that would be otherwise done by the court. The government has not overlooked the ramifications of any closure. These changes will have an impact on community&amp;hyphen;based services and the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department and peak bodies representing these agencies are working with the Family Court to develop protocols for sharing the responsibility for providing the range of counselling services needed to support all the requirements of the Family Law Act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government is aware of the problems that might arise from these necessary closures and is addressing them through consultation and mediation. It is easy for an opposition to criticise the government and say cuts in counselling and the fees are too high and people are denied access to the Family Court and that legal aid is being cut back. But the opposition is unable to show where people have been turned away from the Family Court because they could not afford to apply. The opposition has failed to say that 40 per cent of all fees are waived due to exemptions for people on social security, getting legal aid, or successfully showing the court they cannot meet the filing fees entailed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It was not just a peremptory act by the Commonwealth to bring in these fees; it had
        <break page="7059" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         been in the pipeline for some time. When the opposition was in government it was looking at exactly the same fee increase. It knew cost recovery in the Commonwealth jurisdiction was poor, to say the least. The increase in these fees will barely take the Commonwealth to the same levels of cost recovery as the states. It is irresponsible of us only to meet the needs of today without planning for the needs of tomorrow. We have to make sure our financial planning will allow for an increased legal aid system in the future, a more efficient Family Court system, and it may be tough decisions will have to be taken in the meantime and we will have to look at rationalising some of the registries we have.

        One of the proposals mooted is the briefing out of counselling services. I can tell Senator Bolkus that the Family Court of Western Australia, which received much praise in the Joint Standing Committee on Family Law Matters for its efficiency, does not rely on court counsellors as such as other family courts in Australia do, but briefs work out to the family services to provide counsellors at the court. It operates in a most efficient manner. I hold up the practice of the Family Court of Western Australia as a good example. Use could be made of magistrates and country courts for Family Court access for those in regional areas. The joint standing committee mentioned that in its report last year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has approached this in a thoroughly rational manner. It has to be dispassionate in looking at this problem. It has to look at the question of cuts on the one hand and balancing that with fees and cost recovery on the other and the question of access to justice. Involved in that question of access to justice is how high do you go with your fees and to what extent you make the legal aid dollar go further. The capping of fees is not a bad start in that regard. None of the cuts were a surprise; they were contained in the government's election commitments and I dispute the $10 million figure Senator Bolkus has raised regarding the year after this. The cuts we are dealing with are before the parliament and are ones mentioned by the government as I stated.

         There has been no evidence to date to show these higher fees have stopped anyone from using the Family Court. Senator Bolkus could not give us any evidence. He mentioned the scenario of a father cross&amp;hyphen;examining his children in the Family Court. I find that hard to believe. In a Family Court there are discretionary powers about evidence from juveniles. That discretion is exercised most cautiously for obvious reasons. I dispute that example and refute it entirely as being the result of any cut or increased fee imposed by this government.

        This is the environment that some of the most crucial services of the Family Court are frequently called upon to deal with.

         The duration of dislocation and disadvantage was quite variable in this population of parents. Men usually recovered, and in many cases attained a higher standard of living within three years of separation; women suffered a severe drop in their standard of living which remained over the early years. Five to eight years after separation, the gap had lessened, an amelioration largely accounted for by the formation of new family units. The difference in magnitude and direction of the immediate effects of marriage breakdown on mothers with children and on fathers, and its long-term continuation unless the mother repartners, is one of the most confronting findings of this study.

          The most obvious barrier to justice is the financial one. This, of course, affects many people in the community, especially in time of high unemployment. But as the Australian Law Reform Commission has pointed out insufficient money is a barrier which affects women to a greater extent than men because women generally have fewer financial resources than men. There are other barriers besides lack of financial resources. People who do not speak English face difficulties both in obtaining adequate information about the legal system and in communicating with many of the people and organisations that form part of it. Presenting even more difficulties are cultural barriers. For example, recently arrived immigrants may be reluctant to resort to the legal system when they come from countries where the legal system is a tool of oppression and judges, lawyers and police officers are among the oppressors. In less extreme cases, many people will face a barrier as the result of a fear of what they perceive to be (and not without reason) an intimidating, unpredictable and complex system. Less dramatic but equally important, difficulties arising from geographical location present considerable barriers for many Australians living outside population centres.

Legal aid gives people proper representation before a particular court they may come to.

        A person accused before a criminal court should have somebody representing him or her. That is not my statement; that is a statement of the highest court in this land. What is happening now in the Family Court is that gross—and I use the word advisedly—injustice is being done. Some mention was made earlier about the position of children. What is happening now is that children who are involved in Family Court proceedings at times need their own representation.

So a judge may request legal representation for a child, who may well be of tender years, who has absolutely no responsibility for the situation he or she is facing, who needs by the very judgment of the court that is hearing the case legal representation, but the legal aid commission concerned refuses that representation because it has insufficient funds.

We as a community, as a society, cannot allow the situa tion to continue where people cannot, because of a lack of funds, exercise the rights we as legislators give them. It is wrong to have one group of litigants who are well endowed with resources and the ability to put their case against people who are much more disadvantaged because they do not have the resources of, if you like, character, education and experience to face up to an opponent or the funds to engage a lawyer to present their case.

If we are going to say people cannot have representation, then we have to do something about the legal system. We cannot have it both ways.

Added to that, just last year the report of the parliamentary Joint Select Committee into the Funding and Administration of the Family Court—headed, I might say, by South Australian Labor MP Martyn Evans—rejected calls for more Family Court funding. They said that throwing more money at this problem was not really what it required and they found that the court was living beyond its means like a person living on bankcard. There were some quite extraordinary examples of administrative costs. The chief executive was one example, having spent a little over $208,000 over four years commuting backwards and forwards between Sydney and Canberra. For the purposes of the Senate committee, the Family Court had some difficulty even articulating a comprehensive statement of what its core business really was.

        Few would dispute the need for the Family Court to make efficiencies to better streamline its administration. Given, of course, the $8 billion budget deficit that the government inherited, it was only fair and reasonable that the Family Court, like all federal departments, should shoulder its share of the burden in reducing public sector outlays and meeting budget savings targets.

        As Senator Ellison said, it was not as if the budget cuts and the fees were just imposed on the Family Court. In fact, the Family Court was asked to consider how it might make these savings. Most of the litany read out by Senator Bolkus were efficiencies which the Family Court has made of its own volition. What is particularly short&amp;hyphen;sighted about motions such as the one being discussed today—at least at the level of the discussion—is that they zero in on costs and fees without even acknowledging the substantial reforms and shift in focus in service delivery that underpin increases in the Family Court fees.

If you can actually assist people before their marriage or relationship completely breaks down, if you can work out what there is to salvage before they are embroiled in the adversarial system, it makes a great deal of sense to do so. In fact, it is perfectly obvious that it assists not only the individual partners but their children, their grandparents and, in fact, the community, if some way can be worked out without the cost, expense, delay and bitterness which inevitably follows an adversarial bout in the Family Court.

        To that end, the government's thinking is that these services are best delivered by a mix of court and community sectors in appropriate geographic areas. Part of the structure of the new reforms and fees highlights the important role that private and community based mediation services can play as alternatives to the Family Court. I would have thought that those on the other side would have welcomed the fact that the government is thinking creatively, in an innovative way, about how to emphasise the value of mediation based services.

        It is this belief that underlies the charging of a fee equivalent to that charged by community based counselling services for voluntary counselling access through the Family Court. The fee, of course, is $40 an hour, but only for voluntary counselling. So those poor unfortunate individuals, those poor unfortunate Australians, who end up in the Family Court as part of an adversarial contest will not be asked to pay for counselling or mediation. Of course, the thinking behind it was that it was inequitable, that some get the service free and others pay—it stands to reason.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I do agree with Senator Cooney that there is something to be said for looking at how the Family Court can structure greater efficiencies. The legal profession clearly has a role to play in this. In the past, the legal profession has, from time to time, risen valiantly to these sorts of challenges. A cap on fees is just one such challenge. Aspects of family law have been around since 1974 in their current form with a few amendments here and there. But basically, while there can be complex cases, and there always will be, not every case is so
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        Senator Bourne talked about the fact that a lot of people are denied legal aid. But, of course, the numbers reflect people who may not have been eligible in the first place. That figure bears no relation to those who have been refused legal aid, who otherwise might have been eligible and who were denied legal aid on the basis that funds were not available. The figure is just nonsense.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Cooney also talked about separate representation, which is an issue of great concern. Unfortunately, time is going to beat me on this, but the shift in focus to mediation, the imposition of increased fees on those who can afford it, the waiver of fees for those who cannot and the better targeting of delivery of services will ensure that the family law system is one that responds to individual needs at a time of the very greatest vulnerability.

         —Both Senator Ellison and Senator Coonan have made valiant efforts to justify cutbacks. However, I note that both of them looked extremely uncomfortable about their justification, because it is very hard to justify cutbacks in such a sensitive area of public policy. I accept some of the comments that have been made about wastage in administration. I accept that savings could have been made in that area. However, the majority of the cutbacks I am concerned about are impacting on ordinary families. This decision comes from a government that went into the last election saying how pro family they were. However, every decision relating to the family seems to me to be asking the family to pay and pay again.

        Senator Ellison said that none of these cuts would come as a surprise. I am sure that they will come as a surprise to families who will find out that the cost of a family law dispute will go from $368 to over $2,000. It may not come as a surprise to him, but it would certainly come as a surprise to those families. The user&amp;hyphen;pays principle is a denial of justice. Senator Coonan obviously has experience and skills in mediation. I am sure she understands

        I would like to put on the public record some of the problems that we are facing in Queensland. The proposed changes will mean the closure of the Mackay family registry. The Rockhampton registry is still at risk and its future has not been clarified. The Cairns registry will not be upgraded. Plans to establish a Gold Coast registry have been abandoned. Outreach programs in Logan and Ipswich will not proceed. Anyone who knows Logan and Ipswich as areas of extensive populations will know that it is just not good enough to tell families there that they will have to go into Brisbane. It is a very dense population region. Outreach programs in those two areas are most important.

        Only 19 of the 39 new Family Court counsellors will be employed. Clearly, that will impact on many thousands of families around Australia. The introduction of the user&amp;hyphen;pays charges will mean $40 per hour for counselling services. Why would you go to counselling if you have a cost burden at that rate? Families are struggling as it is. They will not choose to use counselling, because it will be seen as too expensive. In those families where one or other partner, usually the male, is reluctant to go to counselling, that $40 per hour will act as a deterrent.

        Earlier this year, the Queensland Law Society Family Law Committee Chairman Peter Sheeley said that the major concern was for country lawyers and their clients, who would have to travel to major regional centres to have cases attended to and heard. Mr Sheeley said that successful counselling in the early stages could contain the costs of divorce to under $1,000 compared with bills of many thousands of dollars for protracted cases. He predicted that these higher charges could be very detrimental to many families, particularly regional families.

        I return to Senator Ellison's statement that these charges were not unexpected. I have a memo from the Family Court of Australia. That they were obviously surprised is evident from this five-page document that details just some of the cutbacks that will have to proceed and are now in the process of proceeding. There is the closure of the Bendigo subregistry. The delay reduction programs in Parramatta and Melbourne have been cancelled. Library subscriptions have been reduced by 50,000. When family law personnel cannot keep up with their reading, it is pretty petty of government.

        Outreach activities will be eliminated other than minor expense travel. This is in a country like Australia, where one-third of the population lives outside capital cities. There will be the non-replacement of Justice Butler in Launceston when he retires later in the year. Clearly, Launceston will be badly affected. There will be the closure of the Rockhampton, Wollongong and Geelong registries. Pre&amp;hyphen;filing counselling and mediation activities have been abandoned. Senators have commented positively about mediation, yet this memo indicates that pre&amp;hyphen;filing counselling and mediation activities will be abandoned specifically because of budget cuts. These budget cuts in family law, of all areas, simply indicate that the coalition rhetoric is inappropriate.

        First, the Australian Labor Party innocently comes into this place and says how horrendous the government cuts are, as though they bear no responsibility for the reason we have to impose them.

We woke up one morning and found that the former Minister for Finance had misled the Australian people. Do you know when we found that out? It was on 3 March, the day after the federal election.

        The former Minister for Finance told us that the budget was in surplus and would be in surplus for the ongoing future.

No matter how much the Labor Party interject on this, the reality is—and the Australian people know—they left this place in a terrible mess and, as a result, we have been required to make some of these distasteful cuts. We do not want to make cuts but, if we do not make them, who will bear the burden? The next generation of Australians would be denied a future because of our ongoing debt which the Labor Party incurred as though there were no tomorrow.

        Time is very short, but there is another matter that really has to be nailed, that is, the question of the fees. The people of Australia need to be reminded that over 40 per cent of Australians who will be accessing the Family Court will not be required to pay the filing fees because they are on legal aid or social security, or because their income is such that they will not be required to pay. Are you honestly saying that more than 40 per cent of the Australian population live in abject poverty? We did accuse you of creating a new underclass in Australian society, but we never went as far as to say that over 40 per cent were in that category. Even with a bit of political hyperbole, never did we accuse you of that. Yet 40 per cent of the Australian population will be saved from paying the fees and only 60 per cent of the community will be required to pay those fees. That is not an injustice. If you say that is an injustice, then you will create an injustice for the total Australian community. The Labor Party is simply devoid of any policy issue, so I come up again to trawl over an old issue.

         That is a reason for some concern, because the test site management unit is responsible for maintaining the records on which the servicemen and civilians who are claiming to have received cancer caused by nuclear fallout are reliant. In other words, they have to go and prove their case using records maintained by the test site management unit. If the accuracy of those records is so poor, we need to do something to ensure that the situation is rectified. When you see records that are so inaccurate, it is clear that something needs to be done.

         What honourable senators may not be aware of is that there was a special administrative arrangement to provide compensation for people who were affected by the nuclear fallout. That was put in place in 1989. But what occurred a couple of years ago was that the previous government substantially reduced the opportunity for people to claim. Now people only have a right to claim if the first signs of their cancer manifested themselves within 20 years of the test to which they were exposed.

         Montebello occurred in 1956 and Maralinga occurred through the late 1950s and early 1960s. There are very few people who, having developed the signs of cancer in 1976, would still be alive to claim in 1996—20 years afterwards. That is of concern to me. I believe that until further research is done, it is not possible for us just to wipe out the chances of those people to make claims for compensation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am particularly concerned that there is an organisation of veterans who were exposed to the nuclear tests at Maralinga. Some of these tests were in fact very dirty nuclear tests—that is, they involved the destruction of plutonium devices at ground level and the detonation of nuclear weapons at close to ground level so that you create a large amount of radioactive dust, radioactive fallout. We still do not know the consequences of those tests.

         Underlying its analysis was the Committee's recognition that the primary purpose of superannuation is to provide retirement income. The Committee was mindful that any changes to the superannuation system must reflect this fundamental principle.

         The Committee considered the nature of investment generally and in relation to the trend toward globalisation. The report then examined the duties and obligations of trustees  and the history behind the development of those duties and obligations. In this context the report raised the concept of socially responsible investment and looked at some American examples. The more controversial concept of directed investment was rejected by the Committee. The report briefly considers the question of fraud as the issue was raised in some of the submissions.

         The report examined infrastructure investment and tax concessions. Evidence provided to the Committee suggested a degree of confusion regarding the intent and operation of these concessions.

         The Committee also examined investment in small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) was examined in some detail.

The Committee noted with approval the steps that are occurring in the market place to bring SMEs and superannuation savings together.

         The Institute of Actuaries of Australia defines short termism as `a preference for an investment policy which seeks to minimise short&amp;hyphen;term fluctuations in the rate of return on assets'. Superannuation funds have consistently been criticised for this investment practice.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Although the Committee found that undue short termism can lead to problems for superannuation funds, it also discovered that there is an awareness among industry players of the dangers, and that the industry is taking steps to address this issue. The report recommends that the government should review and monitor superannuation policy and

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The final chapter of the report reflects the Committee's consideration of broader social objectives in relation to superannuation fund investment. An essential question implicit in the Committee's terms of reference was the compatibility of the furtherance of broader social objectives with the fundamental requirements on trustees flowing from the trust relationship and prudential control legislation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The trust relationship is pivotal to our superannuation system. It has shaped its development to date, and has been its fundamental and defining characteristic. The Committee notes, however, the Budget announcement that a regime of retirement savings accounts is to be established outside the requirements of trust law and considers there is a need for Parliamentary oversight of such changes.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Throughout the report, the view taken by the Committee is that the primary aim of superannuation is to provide retirement income, and the law requires trustees to act at all times in the best interests of fund members. The furtherance of broader objectives, or socially responsible investment as it is sometimes called, is not necessarily incompatible with trustees' legal and fiduciary obligations.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For example, the Committee was told of a large industry fund which had a provision in its investment policy statement that, all things being equal in terms of returns and risks, trustees will prefer a project or investment which had job creation benefits.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         With the increasing emphasis on greater choice, the report recognised the need of superannuation fund members to have more information to assist in making their long term investment decisions. Members need greater eduction generally about the long term nature of superannuation, and specifically about kinds of investments that are possible within the regulatory framework.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee examined the view that Australia needs to develop a conscious national strategy to take advantage of the huge volume of superannuation assets in determining our social and economic future. As a result of the decline in public investment and trend toward privatisation, it has been argued that there is a need to harness superannuation for social and economic purposes.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Notwithstanding some of the attractions such a view offers, the Committee is unable to accede to it. There would be insufficient parliamentary
         <break page="7069" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          support for such a major revision to our superannuation system, especially given the development in investment patterns and financial markets that the Committee identifies in its report. Again the basic role of superannuation savings in providing retirement incomes needs to be emphasised. The assets of superannuation funds should not be regarded as a public asset.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To the extent that people can self&amp;hyphen;fund their retirement incomes, thereby reducing the pension burden on future taxpayers, and to the extent that increased domestic saving leads to higher levels of domestic investment, all Australians will benefit from the current superannuation system.

         Our plan should include a very fast train which adopts an inland route and has passenger and freight capacity and time lines to link our capital cities. The VFT will break down the barrier between city and country, curb the environmentally destructive urban sprawl, open up development corridors for the next 100 years and be the bridge to the 21st century. It will take Australia from a country retiring to the coast, living on welfare and resting on its laurels to a new frontier for development with job opportunities and excitement.

         For my own state of New South Wales, the development of an inland international air freight terminal would be a catalyst to restructure and vertically integrate the Murray-Darling farm enterprise and provide a long-term solution to salinity and degradation by water and land management practices.

         Madam President, the paradox and urban consolidation and urban sprawl, public and private transport, productivity employment, the myriad of environmental issues, clean air, fresh water—we buy fresh water now; will we eventually have to buy clean air?—are not some trendy `Greens' issues; they are our issues. They are planet survival issues which will not be solved by lobby groups, radical political agendas or single issue political parties.

         —Before the luncheon adjournment, Senator Harradine suggested that this clause be considered in conjunction with his other amendment, which deals with a reference to the economics committee. I do not disagree that in one sense they should be taken together. I do not know whether under the standing orders they can be put together or whether there has to be a vote now. Whichever way it is, I indicate on behalf of the opposition that as presently structured and presently proposed by Senator Harradine both this clause, this amendment and the subsequent amendment which goes to the end of the committee report referring the issue of preference shares to the economics legislation committee will be opposed by the opposition.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will oppose them for reasons which have already been alluded to but which I will now refer to very specifically. We have said to Senator Harradine on a number of occasions both here and elsewhere that to refer his proposal of a redeemable preference share to the economics committee to be considered and for that committee to report on 26 March only to delay this bill for its proclamation date till 1 May makes the work of the committee basically irrelevant.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It may well be a useful exercise for some to see further debate and discussion about the general principle of the redeemable preference share. But, to have any impact on this legislation, the very least Senator Harradine should do is change his amendment to accord with something similar to what Senator Margetts has proposed: that the third reading of this bill be held over or recommitted subject to the response of the report coming down by 26 March.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="7078" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         Quite frankly, as we have said before, even if the committee members unanimously agree that there was great merit in Senator Harradine's proposal, once the legislation is through, the government will comfortably wait till a proclamation date of 1 May, pro claim the bill and say that was a very interesting report. It will be tabled on 26 March and, at some stage in the future, it might be considered by some officer in Treasury.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But they will have their bill. They will proceed with the direct privatisation of Telstra, and anything to do with redeemable preference shares, irrespective of the recommendation, will have no impact at all. I have to say that, as an old wily campaigner in the Senate now for 21 years or more, I am surprised that Senator Harradine would let the government get away with this particular proposal that there be no cut in of the legislation having to be dealt with in its final third reading subject to the report of the committee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said before on a previous amendment, I think Senator Harradine has undersold himself and his proposal. He has now circulated to many of us his detailed reply to the response of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to his redeemable preference share proposal. I think he is quite proud of the fact that he has pointed out some errors in the Treasurer's response. To us, that would mean it is even more imperative that he tie the report of the committee he has proposed consider this matter to that response, saying, `You cannot have a third reading of this bill automatically until the committee's report is dealt with by the Senate and is taken into account in the debate on this unparalleled legislation.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We do not get a second chance at this. We will not be able to say in six or 12 months time, `We will try to unwind the partial privatisation of Telstra.' This legislation, if carried, with the associated processes being got under way, will be a defining moment. No parliament will be able to unwind it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Harradine knows that. It is for that reason he has proposed the redeemable preference share—that, at some stage in the future, if the parliament chose to support a government, it would be able to buy back the one&amp;hyphen;third shares so that Telstra could be maintained in 100 per cent public ownership. We believe that the opposition cannot support this particular amendment because it would indicate to people that, firstly, we may be going soft on our total opposition to privatisation and, secondly, we would be
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         willing to take part in a process that is fundamentally flawed on the principle of privatisation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would also say again to Senator Harradine that he now is, I think, almost the equally longest serving senator in the chamber. He is a senator who has strongly supported the evolution of the committee processes of this Senate, both on the reference side and the legislative side, going right back to the initial reforms of Senator Murphy in the early 1970s or late 1960s. He has been a strong supporter of the standing committees of the Senate being able to deal with both legislative issues and references on matters of broad concern to the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As senators, we all know, whether in government or opposition, that the workload on all of those committees is pretty heavy. Whether in government or opposition, all of us have to serve—except if you are lucky enough to be a minister—on a number of standing committees and reference committees. Senators have to juggle a lot of time and arrangements to put the time in to attend committee hearings and draft reports. It is not easy work. Much of it is underrecognised by the general public and even the media covering the goings-on of parliament. I would have to say my observation is that most senators on all sides of parliament accept that responsibility and that onerous work very well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But again I say to Senator Harradine: there is enough work on all of these committees without asking those members of the economics committee—the half dozen permanent members as well as the participating members—to serve on that committee and then find out that whatever work they do, whatever recommendation they bring down, the government can chuck it in the bin. It can just say, `Nice report,' drop it in the bin and then say, `Well, that was nice, but we are going on to proclaim our legislation', irrespective of any recommendation. Even if that recommendation was unanimous, it goes straight in the bin, with no opportunity to ask the government to reconsider—not just ask it to reconsider, but force it to reconsider because the bill would not have been finally completed if we go along the road of Senator Margetts's

        Therefore, Senator Harradine, we make one last appeal to you: please look at amending your amendment, particularly at the adoption of the report of the committee stage, to allow the bill to be held over until your committee reports back. That is the only effective way you will get coverage of your proposal—it is not anyone else's; it is your own proposal—of redeemable preference shares. We believe that is the only effective way for the Senate to handle this. Otherwise, this will be the mickey mouse of all committee work I have ever seen in my time in the Senate—and I do not think that is a justifiable thing to do to any Senate committee.

Questions arising from that will inevitably be directed at Treasury. It will be one of the very important economic references that the Economics Legislation Committee has had, because Treasury would not have been questioned on these sorts of matters since they stomped on the issue of redeemable preference shares in 1987.

          Obviously there will be a large number of potential investors and conservative funds—for example, superannuation funds—looking for a type of investment such as this. I suggest to the committee that we should allow this to proceed so that those investors will be able to make those submissions. You might say, `Okay, we can hold a gun to the government's head.' Who will be issuing the shares? It will be the board of Telstra.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All right; you could say, `The government could instruct the board of Telstra to raise the capital by way of issue of redeemable reference shares.' They could do that. But if the committee, for example, came forward with recommendations that the redeemable preference share option was a desirable and viable option and one which would attract the amount of money that is being sought—that is, $8 billion—why would the board of Telstra adopt that particular approach? After all, the investors may be looking for some sort of security which redeemable preference shares would give; those shares would give the type of security and preference over ordinary shareholders that these investors may desire.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They may not and probably would not want to simply buy ordinary shares, because they are not interested in running an organisation such as Telstra. They are not interested in buying up, as it were, part of the assets of the organisation. They are interested, however, in getting a guaranteed result in a preferential manner; thus they would be able to do that through the redeemable preference share option.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Up until now it does appear that the government has been following the advice of Treasury. Honourable senators would have the letter of the Treasurer (Mr Costello)—obviously written by the Treasury—and honourable senators would have my responses. I want to refer to a couple of points made in the Treasurer's letter. For example, on page 1, paragraph 4, of his letter to me, he says:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Telstra would be required to pay a 9 per cent annual return to investors for a 15 year period, at which time shares could be redeemed at the original $1 issue price. That is, your proposal would have very similar characteristics to Telstra issuing $8 billion in debt.

          </break>
         </para>
         <para>
          That, of course, depends on whether the redemption is optimal or whether it is mandatory. There is a wide range of options for the design of redeemable preference shares, ranging from fixed coupon cumulative preference shares, the redemption of which is mandatory, to participating non-cumulative preference shares, the redemption of which is optional at the instance of Telstra. It is therefore not correct, in terms of either legal or economic analysis, to say that the proposal to raise finance by way of redeemable preference shares is similar to raising $8 billion in debt.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is extraordinary that the Treasurer should be advised in that manner. I would suggest to this chamber that Treasury has a great deal to answer for in regard to this matter. I would be very interested to hear from the Treasurers of the various state governments. I am sure they would be most interested in the outcome of the Senate inquiry in respect of redeemable preference shares.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Again, the Treasurer indicated that the government wanted to have a situation where the issue would enable the company, Telstra, to respond to fluctuations in the market—that is to say, it being open to market fluctuations would have some effect on the efficiency of the organisation. I can understand that. I pick up what the Treasurer said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . I note the importance of market signals in applying pressure for continuous improvement in the management of public sector trading enterprises such as Telstra. The partial sale of Telstra will significantly assist in achieving that goal.
         </para>
         <para>
          My response to that is that participating preference shares, for example, where the dividend varies with the ordinary dividend, do have a fluctuating value and do give market signals as to perceptions of management efficiency in so far as that contributes to increased profitability. That is confirmed by the literature. It is all contained in the material that I have distributed to honourable senators.

           I refer to your letter of 2 September 1996 to Senator Alston in which you outline your reservations about the partial sale of Telstra. As foreshadowed by Senator Alston in his letter to you of 21 November 1996, I am responding to the technical issues raised in your letter.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           At the outset, I note the importance of market signals in applying pressure for continuous improvement in the management of public sector trading enterprises such as Telstra. The partial sale of Telstra will significantly assist in achieving that goal.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Your letter raises an alternative financing option to the partial sale. This alternative option has been the subject of careful and detailed consideration by the Government. Schemes such as the one proposed by you have received serious consideration from the Government as they have been put to the Senate Inquiry into Telstra.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           The model you suggest envisages Telstra issuing $8 billion in redeemable preference shares, then making this amount available to the Government through a partial `buy-back' of existing Commonwealth shares in Telstra. Telstra would be required to pay a 9 per cent annual return to investors for a 15 year period, at which time shares could be redeemed at the original $1 issue price. That is, your proposal would have very similar characteristics to Telstra issuing $8 billion in debt.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           An issue of this nature would be without precedent in Australia. In fact, market analysts advise that it is highly questionable whether Australian and international markets would be sufficiently receptive to raise $8 billion from such a security. For this reason alone, it is doubtful that an issue of redeemable preference shares would return to the Commonwealth the equivalent proceeds of an ordinary share issue.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Even if such a raising was possible, it would have the effect of significantly constraining Telstra's financial capacity as it would be required to maintain existing operational levels while at the same time servicing a substantial additional liability but without the corresponding asset base which would be transferred to the Commonwealth. In raising the company's debt to equity ratio from 31
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            per cent to approximately 70 per cent, thus placing Telstra at the lower end of its international peer comparison range, the proposal would be likely to be viewed negatively by commercial ratings agencies and may lead to a significant drop in Telstra's credit rating. This would have the potential to compromise the company's future financing and operating flexibility.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           It also needs to be borne in mind that the cost of borrowing envisaged by the proposal would be above the Commonwealth's current borrowing costs. As a result, the ongoing cost of servicing the debt raised by Telstra through the redeemable shares would be higher than the ongoing costs of the same value of sovereign debt to be retired with the proceeds. Furthermore, as the proposal would effectively represent a transfer of debt liability from the Government to Telstra, it would not permit a reduction in overall public sector debt levels as is envisaged by the partial sale process.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Your proposal also raises some fundamental taxation issues. You are probably aware that the issue of attaching franked dividend income to debt-like instruments has received considerable attention by government and the tax administration since the introduction of the imputation arrangements in the mid 1980s.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           A proliferation of tax financing schemes led to the enactment of specific anti-avoidance provisions designed to prohibit the transfer of franking credits and other tax benefits by dividends which could reasonably be regarded as equivalent to the payment of interest on a loan.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           The particular arrangement you describe would be likely to be caught by these provisions. The legislative amendments required to allow the franking of `debt dividends' would have wider application than to Telstra with consequent effects on the integrity of the tax system and the revenue.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           I should also mention that the nature of imputation precludes the franking of (deductible) interest. Imputation was introduced in order to remove the effect of income being taxed in the hands of a company as profits and being taxed again in the hands of its shareholders when distributed by way of dividend. The relevant income is distributed out of a company's earnings after obligations, such as interest payments, are met. Payments of deductible interest do not distribute taxable income of the company and should not receive the benefit of imputation credits. Allowing such payments to be franked would not have the effect of relieving double taxation but of sheltering from tax otherwise taxable income.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Whilst on the question of imputation arrangements, I note your suggestion that publicly owned companies operate at a competitive disadvantage because their shareholder governments cannot
           <break page="7082" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            utilise any franking credits which they may accumulate. If there is a disadvantage it is not to the company: its tax liability is the same whether its shareholders are taxed at normal tax rates, reduced tax rates, or are exempt.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           The general question of State-owned enterprises is dealt with by the Statement of Policy Intent on the taxation treatment of government trading enterprises, agreed at the 1994 Premiers' Conference; otherwise the basis for the imputation arrangements is that there should not be double taxation on that part of a company's profits that is passed to shareholders by way of dividend. Having regard to the fact that governments do not pay tax the issue of double taxation does not arise.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Your proposal also raises a potential difficulty with the Corporations Law under which Telstra operates. This relates to that aspect which would see a capital sum paid to the government for the explicit purpose of financing the Heritage Trust. Section 162 of the Corporations Law prohibits a company from undertaking an act other than in pursuance of its objectives. With such clear intention attached to the arrangement proposed it would be difficult to argue that the funds transferred to the Commonwealth were for Telstra's business purposes. The Government could not contemplate an arrangement which breached the Corporations Law in any way.

            Treasurer's letter. Who are these analysts? Where are their experts' reports? Generally the market is willing to buy any security—it is all a question of portfolio preference and pricing, weighing up the outlay versus the return. Given the unprecedented size of the proposed transaction, it would be reasonable to expect that Parliament have the benefit of fully reasoned experts' opinions, and valuation analyses of different options for raising funds from Telstra. The extreme demand Australian investors have for fixed interest paper (SBC estimates a $20 billion shortfall in suitable domestic paper per annum) would mean that even a non-participating redeemable preference share would be highly attractive.

           No one has ever suggested that redeemable preference shares are worth the equivalent of ordinary shares. The question is whether redeemable preference shares can efficiently raise $8 billion for the Commonwealth while retaining the Commonwealth's underlying rights to Telstra's natural monopoly assets. Ordinary shares locked into a one third minority may have to be offered at a greater discount to underlying value than redeemable preference shares. The question is not just how much money the Commonwealth gets in but what value it is parting with in return for its money. A freehold sale of land will always bring in more money than the sale of a 30 year leasehold of the same property but a leasehold sale may better preserve the wealth of the seller.

           Apparently, the Treasury took the view that redeemable preference shares are essentially a tax avoidance device and wished to eliminate them through section 46D. This policy view may be disputed, since redeemable preference shares were used for decades before income tax was imposed. Further, in the absence of a full integration system of company tax which would impute losses directly to shareholders, arrangements to use up company tax losses are necessarily either non-neutral or a form of tax avoidance. Indeed the Asprey Committee in 1975 recommended carry back of losses and flow through of losses for small companies!

         Let me say in relation to Senator Harradine's comments that the government takes the view that, by having this matter examined by a Senate committee, there will be an opportunity to test the various proposals in a way, as Senator Harradine quite rightly says, that has not been available until now. In other words, the process that has been gone through has essentially been a private one, where people have responded in writing to the various ideas and proposals contained in Senator Harradine's proposal.

         By allowing the matter to be tested before a Senate committee, there will be public scrutiny of the issue for the first time. As Senator Harradine says, there will be public accountability by Treasury officials, who will be required to subject themselves to cross-examination and explain the logic and thinking behind their assumptions. They will have the ability to test the assumptions themselves. There will then be available just over five weeks between the date of that committee report becoming available and the date on which this bill would come into effect. There will be a five-week period during which the government will be able to take into account not only the report itself but also the public reaction to the report. It can also assess the matters that may for the first time have been

         I think you should not jump the gun. You should wait until you see what is contained in that report. It is rather breathtaking that neither the Australian Democrats nor the Labor Party has shown the slightest interest in this issue, yet they get up today and argue that this is the only way to go and that we should scrap any thoughts of privatisation and simply endorse a proposal for redeemable preference shares. If they have had such a massive conversion to the cause that they now think it is a very commendable initiative, the least they could do is participate in the committee hearings and test the proposition to its ultimate conclusion. If they are not, it is quite clear that the only reason they have moved that amendment is to attempt yet again to delay the process.

Telstra made that decision at least as early as June last year. You may shake your head, Minister, but I will ask you to check that. If you do check that with Telstra, you will find that that is the case. Your statement is bordering on misleading and misrepresenting the situation. You put out a press statement implying that, as part of the arrangement for Tasmania and Queensland, somehow this deal has brought about local call access to the Internet for Tasmanians. That is just complete and utter rubbish, and a lie. They made that decision as early as June last year, Minister.

         —I want to follow up on some comments Senator Alston made about the opportunity to test proposals on redeemable shares. I wonder whether he could explain what he means by that. I would also like to know whether the minister has referred the remarks of Senator Harradine today in terms of the unsatisfactory response, from his point of view, of Treasury to questions that he has put back to the Treasury and whether it is not possible for these proposals to be tested by way of briefing meetings, further answers to questions, and arguments that have been put in writing. Can the minister explain what he means by testing the proposals and why it is that a Senate committee is the only opportunity for public scrutiny? I would have thought that a range of opportunities were available to Senator Harradine and the rest of the Senate to put those questions forward.

         —Of course there is a range of ways in which he can test a proposal. I was agreeing with Senator Harradine that having the ability to question witnesses in a public forum is likely to be a much more satisfactory way of eliciting information and testing the validity of propositions than simply by an exchange of letters. You can call people in and ask them as much as you like in private, but if they have to justify their position in public, if the propositions have to withstand the light of day, then you are more likely to get an efficacious result. That was the point I was making.

         —Yes. I have no doubt that Treasury has gone over it with a fine-toothed comb. But the point is that to simply get yet another written response, exchange of letters, is not, as Senator Harradine points out, as effective as having the matter tested in a forum where you can pursue issues, as we all know. You shake your head. If you do not see any difference between an exchange of letters and being able to ask questions and have follow&amp;hyphen;up procedures then you do not understand the difference between cross-examination and correspondence.

        The whole purpose of estimates committees, for example, is to be able to pursue an issue, to be able to get behind what is on the document, to ask what the assumptions underlying it are, to ask what additional information there might be and to explore matters that you contend have been left out. Quite often letters can be as significant for what they omit as for what they contain. All of those matters can be pursued much more effectively in a public forum than they can be by simply asking for a pro&amp;hyphen;forma response.

First of all, the opposition still is fundamentally opposed in principle to this bill for the one&amp;hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra. We strongly oppose it. Whatever amendment is carried or not carried, we will vote against the third reading and the carriage of this bill. In principle, we fundamentally oppose the privatisation, either in part or in full, of Telstra.

        Nevertheless, in view of the deal and arrangements made between the government and some senators, I have to accept, from the numbers, that the reality is that the bill on those votes may be carried. Therefore, the question for the opposition, if the bill is going to be carried against our strong opposition, is: what is in the best national interests of the Australian people from the operation of a partially privatised Telstra?

        An issue we have fought for, through the references committee in the middle of the year, is that the power of the minister to direct the board and to direct Telstra be maintained. It was an unequivocal recommendation by the opposition and the Democrats in the Telstra report earlier this year that that power should be maintained.

        It has to be said that, even with the partial privatisation of Telstra, 66&amp;frac23;of the shareholding of Telstra will still be maintained by the government on behalf of the Australian people. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) have said that there will be no more moves to sell any more of Telstra at least until there is another election. Of course, it cannot happen without it coming back to a vote of both houses of parliament.

        We believe that when you own two-thirds of the shares of Telstra—of any company—that shareholder should have the right to say what is going on in that company. It is in the national interest. Telstra will be the dominant carrier of telecommunications in this country for the foreseeable future. Australians—85 per cent&amp;hyphen;plus—will continue to use Telstra in full or in part to get telecommunications services. That is in the national interest. That is a natural monopoly, according to Senator Harradine. He says, `This means it is a natural monopoly.'

        Indeed, it will be very odd when, under the structure that the minister has put forward, the minority shareholders will be able to start dictating, under the Corporations Act, to the majority shareholders—the Australian people—the best outcomes to maximise the profit, against the interests of the majority. That is what will happen. In Corporations Law, minority shareholders have certain rights. What will their rights be? To maximise profit. For example, in an estimates hearing recently, we had confirmation from Telstra that, when they get rid of 22,000 workers, the bottom line profit to Telstra will be increased by $600 million per annum.

        I would imagine that the private shareholders—the directors—involved in that third will say, `We want that redistributed to dividends,' to maximise their return on their investment. That is what they would do. It is not unnatural. It would be a perfectly natural response for minority shareholders to get back as quickly as possible through dividends the money on their investment. But that may not be in the best national interest of Australia, for the Australian community.

        I draw to the attention of the minister, who will strongly oppose this, that in only the last few days the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) said in relation to legislation to establish an employment agency run by the private sector, the Public Employment Placement Enterprise Ltd, `We will maintain the power of the minister to direct.' I draw attachment 1 of the statement to the attention of the committee, particularly Senators Colston and Harradine. If Senator Vanstone believes she should have that power in relation to that enterprise, why should it not apply to Telstra? Attachment 1 states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will also be open to the minister to direct the provision by the company, at reasonable cost, of employment services in the public interest. This will ensure that the government has the capacity to cover any situation where employment services need to be delivered in a location but where the market has not responded in the tender process and no other arrangements are available.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what Senator Vanstone said. She is not exactly noted for an impeccable performance as a minister in this area over the last nine months. She has woken up. She wants protection in the national interest. Even though this is a fully privatised operation, she wants to hold the power of the minister to direct, to get outcomes in the national interest. If it is good enough for Senator Vanstone and that new private enterprise arrangement, it ought to be good enough for the minister to retain the power to direct in the case of Telstra.

        I say to Senators Harradine and Colston: you have reached arrangements on issues relating to employment and provision of services, particularly to regional Australia. If this power of the minister to direct is not maintained, you are relying on extraordinary good faith—forever and a day. The one thing you will be able to do to meet your commitments as far as you see them is to know that the minister has the power to direct. You will be able to go to the minister and say, `This deal is not being met.' If you let this provision go through as is, and the minister says,
        <break page="7094" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         `But the board of Telstra said something different and I cannot do anything about it,' the minister will be dead right. But, if you have this power to direct put back in, you will have some negotiating power with him.

        Even though the minister will say that the power to direct has not been used since Telstra became a GBE, we all know that the fact it is there has an influence on the board and in the informal discussions. The minister, in his own statement issued last week, headed `Telstra's presence in Tasmania and Queensland', stated:

       <para>
        If they do not agree to have talks with him, they all know that he can actually direct them. Remove that power to direct, and there will be no talks. It just will not happen. Once that symbol of ministerial power is removed, the informal discussions will stop. I believe that is the most pressing issue we are now faced with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Do we want a Telstra acting totally in the commercial interest at the behest of the minority shareholders, a la what happened with the AIDC? The way they acted was a considerable embarrassment and it affected the program of the government accordingly because they could threaten to sue. Do we want the same to happen with Telstra? Of course we do not.

        There will be issues from time to time over the next few years as we want to develop, as Senator Harradine wants for Tasmania, the high quality telecommunications system and broadband services.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the end, if we want it for Tasmania then at least we can get it by the minister directing Telstra to do it, so that some of the $20 billion capital works program of Telstra over the next five years will be spent in Tasmania or other regional areas. That will be to make sure that we have a telecommunications network throughout Australia to which all
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Australians have equal and equitable access. We in the opposition make no bones about it: we believe this power is there for the public good.

        Even if Telstra is privatised by a third, we give notice here and now that, if this power to direct is taken out, when we get back into government we will take every action possible to restore this power to the act. We say that now so that potential investors do not go around the place saying that they have been ambushed about this. We will take every possible action to restore this to the act if it is taken out during this process. We think it is much better in the national interest that this bill be amended now to maintain the power to direct so that we do not have to go through that process and so that all investors know what they are buying with Telstra.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These investors will know that the power to direct is in the act and that if they try to abuse the power of Telstra, this natural monopoly that Senator Harradine so aptly describes, the minister's power to direct will be able to be used for the benefit of the national interest, not for the benefit of minority shareholders interested in only one thing—profit—irrespective of Australia's national interest. Of course, a third of the third will be foreign investors. They have only one absolute interest—profit. They will not be interested in serving all Australians. They will not be interested in jobs in regional Queensland or southern Tasmania or anywhere else.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe that the issue of the minister's power to direct is fundamental. Being a shareholder representing 66&amp;frac23; per cent and then giving up and saying that you have got no power at all, that you cannot direct your own directors because they will then be taken on by the minority and the minority will sue accordingly, really is abdication by the government against the national interest.

        I say quite bluntly that I appeal to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston on this particular measure to support this in the national interest and also in the very narrow view of ensuring that they have got the leverage to deliver the arrangements they have made by the minister still being able to direct Telstra.

         —The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the power of the minister to direct Telstra in the public interest is retained. The Department of Finance made two key points concerning this issue in their submission to the Telstra inquiry. First of all, they argued that the removal of the minister's power would make no difference because it is a power which has never been used. We would argue that that is simply nonsense. If its removal makes no difference then surely neither does its retention. In our view, irrespective of whether or not the power is explicitly used, its very existence can create an influence on the board's deliberation and that is a very good reason for its retention. The point of this argument is not difficult at all to grasp.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, the Department of Finance argued that the retention of that power in a partially privatised Telstra would be inappropriate since it could potentially amount to a power that could disadvantage minority shareholders in a way that would be inconsistent with provisions of the Corporations Law. Our advice, however, suggests that if the government want to retain this power then they can do so. Undoubtedly, its removal will enable the government to attract a higher sale price but will weaken their ability to direct Telstra to act in the interests of the majority shareholder. I remind the senator that that is the Australian public.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian people want Telstra and indeed the government to act in the interests of the public—something we have not seen a lot of lately, I have to say. For the government to reject this power is to implicitly admit that they do not want the power to govern in our national interest. If the dictates of the market or the interests of corporations do not accord with the interests of the public, then so be it. These are the outcomes that the government is obviously prepared to live with. As far as I am concerned, a government that does not want to govern in the public interest is not a responsible government; it is
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         simply a government trying to avoid its role and its duty.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Retention of the power to direct Telstra in the public interest does not mean that the government need to run the company or to intervene in a heavy&amp;hyphen;handed manner. It simply means they retain the power to direct in the public interest should the need arise. If, as the government has argued, Telstra will continue to be responsive to the public interest following the one-third sale of Telstra then the government will not be required to use this power. But I would argue here that its retention will act as a safeguard for the  Australian public. It is for this reason the Democrats support the removal of this clause.

         It flies in the face of many assurances that have been given about how Telstra will operate in a post-privatised or partly privatised environment. It must be remembered that Austel will not exist in its form after next year.

        In this case, the majority shareholder held over 90 per cent of the shares. The principle that came out from that case was that it is not possible for the majority shareholder to oppress the minority shareholder. Perhaps the government could clarify whether or not they believe it will be possible for the majority to oppress the minority. I think it is very odd indeed that, with all of the assurances by government about what will and will not happen in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, pricing and service, to a large extent they are putting almost total faith in the market to do all of these things. If the market does not, there is no comeback.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister and the government will be stepping back from that and saying, `This is a majority public asset, but we are not going to give ourselves the ability to intervene in any way if our blind assumptions do not turn out to be true.' I think most people's concerns are very real in relation to the actual decision making that can and cannot take place in relation to this.

        With regard to the example of the AIDC, as has been mentioned, the government board member was put under a lot of pressure not to even attend meetings where issues of confidentiality were being talked about. It became very difficult for that member to provide that information. There is the ability

        So I would argue that the very least that we need to do to address those legitimate concerns in the community amongst workers in the industry, amongst unions, amongst customers, amongst consumer organisations—you name it—is to continue to have that ability, used or unused, for intervention in case those assurances are not met.

         —I have not spoken at any great length in the committee stage of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996, but I do want to speak on this amendment. It is an absolutely A&amp;hyphen;grade essential amendment if the government is to have any direction over Telstra in the future. I say that because, for the last two years of the Labor government, I was the minister for industry. Within my portfolio was the AIDC, the Australian Industry Development Corporation. For reasons that are public, the AIDC was partly privatised when my predecessor Senator John Button was the minister for industry. We privatised 18 per cent of the AIDC.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During my period, the cabinet decided to sell the lot of the AIDC. What happened then was that we found the holder of the majority shareholding in the public interest could not get access to the documents of the AIDC for the very good reason that the rights of minority shareholders under Australian corporate law are protected. That is a very good principle.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a principle that arose because in the eighties the corporate cowboys of this country flogged off corporate entities left, right and centre, irrespective of the rights of the minorities. For example, Alan Bond is on charges in Perth at the moment. The hour after the Bond Corporation took over Bell Resources, they went in and asked Bell Resources to write a cheque for $1.2 billion and hand it to the Bond Corporation, which they did. They were a shareholder. The minorities had no say.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That needed to be protected, and corporate law upholds the rights of minorities. So when
        <break page="7097" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         I, as minister, holding about 82 per cent of the shares of the AIDC, wanted to conduct a due diligence study in order to ready the AIDC for the sale of the other 82 per cent, I could not. The head of my department, Sandy Hollway, who is a respected public servant and who is now the head of DEETYA under this government, was my nominee on the board.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He could not talk to me about the affairs of the board. He was disbarred from doing that as a director. We were unable to conduct a due diligence study. Therefore, the AIDC was not sold. What we then did was buy back the minority shareholding. We bought it back so that we could have control of the company so we could then ready the whole damn thing for a float, not just 18 per cent of it. That is what happened. You would think that an 82 per cent shareholder would be able to influence a board decision. It cannot. It cannot in that sense, and we could not. I think it is absolutely essential for an entity like Telstra to have the reserve powers of ministerial authority. It is absolutely essential.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Honourable senators might recall the debates that we had in this chamber last year. When the AIDC board realised that the government was stymied, the first thing they did was put up their salaries. The outgoing Managing Director of the AIDC claimed a retirement package and a salary package over $1 million. I was questioned in this chamber as to how I, as a responsible minister, could allow salary enhancements of that order to go on when the government was preaching wage restraint to ordinary Australians. I was not allowing it, but I could not stop it. And I was the 82 per cent shareholder.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I seriously say to the government, and not just to the Independents on whose swing vote this may revolve, that once you sell a minority shareholding of an agency such as this, you automatically introduce into that agency the desire for it to make a profit and to reward those people who have bought those shares as an investment. That is in contradistinction to the service obligation that the organisation has and which we as a government will insist on.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         But under corporate law the rights of those minority shareholders are protected and they can insist too, with considerable force, that their interest has to be met. This sounds a bit like the immovable object meeting the irresistible force. What happens in those circumstances is that ways are found around it. Unless there is the reserve power of the government or the strong presence of the government, then you will find that all sorts of things that are not in your interest as a government or as a minority shareholder occur.

         If I were a cynical person, I would not tell you this. Being a cynic, I would sit back and allow you to be embarrassed in that way and then have a go at the whole idea of privatisation because of that embarrassment. But it is absolutely essential that this point be understood in this chamber because, once we vote on this bill, there is not going to be a second chance to come back.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If anyone is in any doubt about anything I say, do not believe me but go back and look at the circumstances of the AIDC. At that time the Department of Finance said to us, `Well, look, we want to float the AIDC, but we do not want the government to have a controlling interest or a golden share'—as the debate was at that time—`because that may well affect the price we get at the float.' That is true, it may well affect it. Some investors will be adverse to that proposition and not want to invest if they think that they, as investors and shareholders, cannot help form the policy directions of this organisation in certain areas.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a risk that you take when you part&amp;hyphen;privatise; that is a risk that you have to accept when you part&amp;hyphen;privatise. If you do not, you surrender the control of the whole organisation, and you might as well then have privatised the lot. Talking about being part-privatised when it comes to the corporate sector is a bit like talking about being part-pregnant.

        New sections 8AD and 8AI of the Telstra Corporation Act would impose reporting obligations on Telstra and ensure that the exclusive provision of this oversight information to the Commonwealth does not breach the Corporations Law. New sections 8AQ and 8AR oblige Telstra to assist the Commonwealth in the conduct of a Telstra sales scheme and ensure that the provision of relevant information to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the sale of Telstra shares does not breach the Corporations Law. In the case where Telstra shares were sold in more than one tranche, these provisions will remove any argument that existing minority shareholders in Telstra are being unfairly treated by the exclusive provision of information to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is very important to understand what occurs at the present time. Since Telstra became a government business enterprise in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         1991, it has been obliged by the Corporations Law, governed by the Corporations Law, to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. That does not allow the board to act uncommercially, nor has any government sought to request it to act uncommercially. As we have established, there have been no directions given under this power. In other words, there has been an acceptance since 1991 that the company ought to act commercially. To the extent that you want to impose any social obligations over and above the company, you do that by legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the scheme that governs all government business enterprises. That is the concept of a community service obligation. You impose on a company an obligation to do something that it would not otherwise do. You have provisions in relation to untimed local calls because, otherwise, the company would presumably want to act commercially and charge on a timed local calls basis. You impose price caps because you take the view that it is important to ensure that the benefits of new technology and productivity gains are passed on to consumers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So in a number of instances, the parliament recognises that to allow a company to act commercially will not always deliver social outcomes that the parliament regards as important. The parliament can then step in and take action, as we are doing in relation to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. In other words, it is a reasonable proposition to assume that neither Telstra nor any other carrier or perhaps service provider would be likely to provide services in rural and remote areas to the extent that some people might desire.

        But there is the world of difference between making a budget allocation providing funds to ensure that that is done in a proper and transparent manner so that everyone understands how it is occurring and, on the other hand, having an arrangement whereby you can ring up the company surreptitiously—and Senator Schacht says that you do not have to do it by giving an official direction; you simply lean on them.

The argument that the High Court decision in the Gambotto case means that the affairs of Telstra must be managed in a way which treats the interest of the minority shareholders as paramount is simply not correct. There are no provisions in the Corporations Law or any court decisions

        The Gambotto case dealt with the situation where the articles of a company had been changed by the majority shareholder to expropriate shares held by minority shareholders. The High Court's decision in that case confirmed that a majority shareholder must act in the interests of the company as a whole, not just promote its own interests, and must not act in a manner which treats minority shareholders unfairly. The government accepts that it should not treat minority shareholders in Telstra unfairly.

        The bill, therefore, overrides the Corporations Law only to facilitate the sale process and to ensure that Telstra is properly accountable to parliament.

I'll make decisions in my interest and to hell with the minorities.' That is not the law, nor should it be. That is simply what the Gambotto case reinforced.

We want you to roll out services in those areas.' You dress that up and call it the national interest. The national interest is as long and as broad as you want it to be.

        Until that time it was simply a government department, effectively, and you could do what you liked with it.

Governments have understood that there is an inherent contradiction between saying that the company ought to act commercially in the best interests of the shareholder, in the sense that they get higher dividends and profits, and giving the company the power to ensure that it passes on the benefits to consumers, that it actually does cater for people by way of lower prices and a better quality of service.

The view we have taken since 1991 is that we want it to compete effectively and deliver the best quality services at the lowest possible prices, and, to the extent there are any shortfalls in that, we impose certain requirements. If we say it would not otherwise have provided untimed local calls, we legislate for them. If we say it would not otherwise have provided services in rural and remote areas and we want it to do that, we impose a universal service obligation to ensure that it happens and we recoup the funds quite transparently from other carriers—and on it goes.

The Tasmania package was unveiled by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in Hobart in February.

        Tasmania, due to its physical isolation and smaller population, has borne the brunt of Labor's 13 years of mismanagement. It was not just Labor's reckless handling of the economy which hurt Tasmanians but an attitude under Labor that the needs of a small state like Tasmania counted for little. We saw that attitude again the other day from Senator Kernot over the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. Tasmania's best interests were too often sacrificed on Labor's altar of political convenience. Decisions were taken in Canberra to win the votes of people in Melbourne and Sydney at the expense of Tasmanians.

        I want to speak tonight especially about the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme, because it represents a new era of opportunity for Tasmanians. One of the most exciting components of the package is the passenger vehicle equalisation scheme. It is already providing a very welcome injection of confidence and growth for Tasmania's important tourism industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The scheme is modelled on the freight equalisation scheme, which was introduced in the 1970s by the Fraser government. It operates on the very fair and straightforward principle which seeks to equalise the cost of travelling Bass Strait with a car with what other Australians pay when travelling interstate on federally funded national highways.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The increase in passenger vehicle bookings has been a massive 93 per cent. Importantly, 70 per cent of the new bookings were for travel south from Melbourne to Devonport. The unprecedented surge in calls to the TT Line reservations centre has led to the employment of eight extra people to cope with the demand. These are the very real, positive and immediate results of just one component of the Tasmania package. We are looking forward to a continuing growth in the number of people crossing Bass Strait with their cars and entrenching the concept of a national highway link between the mainland and Tasmania.

Labor had no credibility on the Bass Strait transport issues in any case. Last year, despite growing enthusiasm for the rebate principle, Mr Keating came to Tasmania and told people who wanted to get to the mainland that they could fly across Bass Strait, and there was no need for a passenger vehicle rebate scheme. Tens of thousands of people, travelling with their cars, have since proven him wrong.

It gives me great and deep satisfaction that the new coalition government has already taken strong action to honour its election commitments to the people of Tasmania and to give them hope for the future.

The first step they should take is to remove Mr Grahame Morris, the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), from this ministerial committee, and they should do it right away. The first two contracts awarded in advertising and public relations went to their mates. These were people who had worked intensively on the federal election campaign in 1996 and had worked directly for Senator Minchin and Mr Grahame Morris when they were state directors of the South Australian Liberal Party. They also worked for the Country Liberal Party. Senator Collins has well documented their scurrilous activities in that territory.

        We found out that DDB Needham Adelaide was not on the OGIA register when OGIA was searching for firms to bid for this in a limited tender. Mr Grahame Morris, the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, wrote to Ms Cathi Moore, the acting director of OGIA, and said, `There is no doubt in some ministers' minds.' He was extolling the virtues of DDB Needham. We asked questions of each of the relevant ministers, such as the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams), the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) and the Prime Minister, none of whom Mr Morris had discussed this matter with. The document sent to Ms Cathi Moore is an absolute farrago of lies. It was developed to impress upon a public servant that ministers had formed this view when the view was only in Mr Morris's own head.

It was then left to Mr Grahame Morris, not Mr Jull, to brief all the public servants excluded from this rorted meeting about the details of the decision. Only two reasons came out. First, they were looking for a wider target audience. Translated, that means that instead of a community based campaign, they were going to turn it into a political campaign because they were doing well on the polls on this issue. Second, they refer to the fact that Needham is livelier. They were the only two reasons given.

In the very last part he says that he wants the campaign to be factual, less agro and more John Howard like. That is what he said at this particular meeting.

The letter is in some detail, but let me go to the last paragraph. If this is not classic weasel words, I have never heard any. Mr Howard says:

         —I rise to speak on the role, function and purpose of parliamentary privilege in the Western Australian parliament in light of the Commission on Government recommendations. The term `parliamentary privilege' refers to the powers, rights and immunities held by parliament, members of parliament and parliamentary committees. It enables parliamentarians to be able to do their job without fear or interference. Parliamentary privilege prohibits anything said or done by members in the course of parliamentary proceedings from being questioned or impeached in any court or tribunal.

        Parliamentary privilege is one of the fundamental principles which maintains the separation of powers in our system of government. On rare but significant occasions, parliamentary privilege has led to conflict between the courts and parliaments. One of the most significant was the clash between the Senate and the Supreme Court of New South Wales during the trials of High Court judge Lionel Murphy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Parliamentarians have to be able to expose corruption and misgovernment, must be able to fully and fearlessly scrutinise the actions of government, the public service and the judiciary, and to inquire into matters of public concern. For these reasons it is necessary that the rights of citizens or the state to take legal action against parliamentarians be circumscribed by parliamentary privilege in order

         that the essential and larger freedoms of a democratic society are preserved.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Parliamentary privilege had its origins in the English parliamentarians' battle against the power of the English monarchy in the 17th century. The result was article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1689 which stated that:
       </para>

       <para>
        As you would know, at that stage the executive was not part of parliament. Historically, the intention of parliamentary privilege was to protect parliamentarians from influence and threat by the executive, which was then the Crown. Now the executive is in the parliament and enjoys the protection of parliamentary privilege. What is more, the executive dominates parliament, particularly in this parliament in the lower house. The result has been that the executive can use parliamentary privilege to shield itself from full accountability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The detrimental effects of the shielding of the executive from full accountability through the use of parliamentary privilege was highlighted during the work of the royal commission into WA Inc. in 1992. It is believed that parliamentary privilege for the executive acted to prevent the full exposure of corrupt, illegal and improper conduct by public officials and the executive as members of parliament. It is my belief that, if properly pursued, a lot more people would have felt the full weight of the law otherwise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the interests of preventing this from re&amp;hyphen;occurring, the Commission on Government made a number of recommendations which addressed the concerns of the royal commission, members of parliament and the community. The principal recommendations include the clarification of the proceedings in parliament which are subject to parliamentary privilege, as in the Commonwealth legislation; the establishment of standing committees to make determinations on the breaches of privilege codes; and the provision of a right to reply where there are allegations of an abuse of parliamentary privilege.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Commission on Government made a number of recommendations with respect to the abuse of parliamentary privilege. Principally, a standing committee on privilege should be established in each house of parliament. The committee would be responsible for the creation of a code of conduct to serve as a guide for members in relation to possible breaches of parliamentary privilege. The standing committee, the Commission on Government recommended, should also be responsible for reviewing conduct alleged to be in breach of the code. The commission recommended that, in the event of a breach of the code of conduct being established, the standing committee should recommend an appropriate penalty to the house concerned. Depending upon the seriousness of the conduct, the commission recommended the penalty could be a retraction and/or apology, suspension from the House for a period up to 14 days, or forfeiture of the member's seat. Those are strong recommendations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Commission on Government was particularly concerned, in response to the extensive public hearings and complaints on parliamentary privilege, that the recommendations, once adopted, be reassessed after three years. The satisfaction of community concerns on this issue was of particular relevance to the commission's findings. I would remind this parliament that the recent occurrences in the New South Wales parliament indicate how current and how fierce are the passions about parliamentary privilege.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reviews the Commission on Government recommended should include public hearings to afford members of the public the opportunity to express their views and to enable the standing committees to judge community sentiment. Finally, the Commission on Government recommended that, if the standing committees find that the incidences of abuse have not been reduced to the satisfaction of the community, then the parliament should appoint an independent commissioner responsible for investigating and overseeing the use of parliamentary privilege.

        <para first-indent="16">

I would like to thank Senator Calvert for volunteering to Senator Campbell to stand aside on the adjourment tonight.

        ASIO, it is popularly thought, is mainly concerned with Soviet agents. But that is not true at present and it really never was true. It always has had a very wide area of interest. Some of the things it is principally concerned with are: politically motivated violence from minority groups and sections within the community, espionage, and the taking of intellectual property from Australian industry and from Australian institutions. It also has a very important role, as outlined in page 5 of the report, in relation to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons—weapons of mass destruction, their precursors and even the testing of them within Australia. It is not generally known how important that field is within ASIO.

        The report that was presented to the parliament today is very much an abridged version—all the sensitive areas and all the areas that are interesting to read have been deleted. Nevertheless, it gives a fair oversight of the range of activities carried out by this authority.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One of my regrets on reading the report is that more mention was not made of the retiring Director-General, Mr David Sadleir, who retired last month as the Director-General of ASIO. David Sadleir is self-effacing, intelligent, shrewd and possesses a sound and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         mature judgment. He was one of the best director-generals ASIO has had. He came in as director-general at a time when the authority was particularly run down and in a lot of trouble. When he left only a month or so ago, he left the organisation in very good condition. I wish him well in his retirement. On behalf of the parliament and the public, I would like to thank him for what he did through those years with what is a very important institution within the Australian community. I welcome his successor, Mr Dennis Richardson, who brings a great deal of enthusiasm and dedication to the job. I know he will perform very well in that role.

        The ending of the Cold War at the end of the 1980s has not eliminated in any way the need for the security and intelligence organisations that we have in this country. One of the great needs in those organisations is maintaining constant surveillance of their internal security, of their own personnel, and the handling of information. That is often not publicly recognised. But the penalties for not doing that are very high.

        The Senate will remember three years ago when Aldrich James, a CIA agent, was exposed as having been working for the Russians. He had a 10-year period of betrayal before he was detected. The price of his betrayal was enormous and was a consequence of a failure of internal security within the CIA. For example, in his first year of operation, in 1985, he betrayed 13 American CIA agents—nine of whom were executed and three of whom ended in prison.

         In recent months, a similar case, also in the CIA, has been exposed—the Nicholson case. The interesting thing about the Nicholson case is that it was not an ideologically driven betrayal. It was not that Nicholson in any way at all was attracted to the Soviets. He was a person with an impeccable record in the armed services and special forces, very much an all American. But he got into a great deal of difficulty with an expensive divorce settlement. It illustrates one of the problems that we have at present. People who are in need of money—and large sums of money—in a hurry are as much a security risk, and probably more so in the present ideologically free envi ronment, than those who have a commitment to a particular set of ideals.

        That leads me on to the matter of accountability and oversight of ASIO and the rest of the security organisations. Ideally, of course, the minister responsible for the security agency is accountable to the parliament. Unfortunately, as the last speaker was hinting, in his talk about parliamentary privilege, an executive government is not always able to be as accountable as it should be. The need for an alternative system or a supporting system in the form of committee oversight from the parliament itself is a crucial part of a modern democratic society.

       <para first-indent="16">
        ASIO operates within the law, within the statutory limits that are laid down under the act that set it up under the Labor government back in the late 1940s. So far as I know, it has never breached or exceeded those statutory limits. It is under the control of the Attorney-General and is answerable to him. The Attorney-General, though, is always one of the busiest ministers in any government. All other departments are constantly referring to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General a great deal of work for advice and legal opinions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As in the case of ASIS, one of our other security agencies, answerable to the foreign minister, what happens is that the security agencies are answerable to ministers who are in cabinet, who are very busy and who simply cannot put the time into the oversight for which they have to accept responsibility.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        ASIO is also under the umbrella of the Director-General of Security, who looks at its activities. This year's report defines the duties of the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General as being to see that ASIO acts legally and with propriety, complies with ministerial guidelines and directives and has due regard to human rights and civil liberties. He may inquire into complaints against ASIO by the public, into matters referred to him by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General or into other matters at his own discretion. But, again, basically the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General is there to see that ASIO does not do something that breaches the law.

        Finally, we come to the parliamentary committee of which I am the chairman. It was
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         a very bold move roughly 10 years ago when the Labor government that was then in power amended the ASIO Act, introduced section 5A and set up a parliamentary committee. That was a great advance forward at the time, but time moves on. There is a demonstrable need now, compared with other democratic societies, to increase that level of parliamentary oversight and accountability. It is not a matter of how that should be done, but when it should be done. My belief is that the time is now upon us when changes should be made to the ASIO Act, because section 5A is extraordinarily restrictive. The parliamentary committee which is charged with oversight of the organisation is denied any inquiry into any matters that ASIO has that derive from foreign intelligence, involve foreign nationals, involve any operational matters or involve complaints against the organisation. In fact, it can only deal with matters referred to it by the Attorney-General. That is a very great restriction on its operations. It cannot exercise the oversight that a democratic parliament demands.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we need to do in this parliament is alter the act. We need to put all the intelligence agencies under the umbrella, the oversight, of a parliamentary committee. You will remember that, when Mr Justice Samuels inquired into ASIS, there was a proposal that a new committee be set up to oversee ASIS. I would be strongly opposed to that. I think that the parliament only needs one intelligence and security committee. It should look at all the agencies. The responsibilities of that committee should be defined in the terms of the British act which sets up their Intelligence and Security Committee—that is, that the parliamentary committee should examine the expenditure, administration and policies relating to operational matters while not involving itself in day-to-day activities. It keeps those secure, but allows the parliament to exercise effective oversight and be accountable to the public for the actions of those agencies.

Passenger numbers per vehicle are going down. They have declined. That ship has the capacity to carry only so many cars. If you get less people per car, it means you get less people overall. That is the reality. Those are the facts. That was identified in the state parliament in the form of the estimates that they have in Tasmania. When the TT Line came before the members of parliament in Tasmania, those were the questions that they asked. That is what was identified. It was even reported in the paper. Yet Senator Newman still comes in here and misleads the Senate. She is trying to make out that the Bass Strait equalisation scheme is delivering something that it clearly is not. I know that the TT Line and the state government are seeking to renegotiate the arrangement that is currently in place. That is the fact of the matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I cannot believe that this minister, who has such great difficulty in answering questions, can come in here tonight, make—as I think Senator Ray pointed out—a ministerial statement, and get it so factually wrong. It is almost unbelievable. If Senator Newman had taken the time to check with the TT Line or even her own state colleagues, she would have been informed of the circumstances. Fine, the subsidy is still there. But it is not delivering what it was intended to deliver. I hope the government will take on board what the TT Line and the state government will put
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to it with regards to changing the focus of the subsidy. Tasmania does need more people. It needs more tourists to assist the tourism industry which is so critical to our state.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Newman tried to paint this rosy picture about all the other things that the government has delivered out of the Tasmania package. As Senator Calvert would know, the TT Line has a huge debt with regard to the boat. I acknowledge quite openly that a Labor state government purchased the boat. At some point that will have to be replaced. Where are they going to get the money? They are already losing money. They are going to lose more money because they are getting less passengers per vehicle. I would be very interested to find out from Senator Newman where they are ultimately going to get the money to replace that vessel.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, I would like to point out that, while Senator Newman tried to paint a very rosy picture, this government has taken $14&amp;half; million from Tasmania for the  AMC/AME hydrodynamic facility in Bass Strait. We lost that very important development. The University of Tasmania has lost $10 million. We have lost $3 million in wheat subsidies. It looks as if Tasmania's freight equalisation scheme will lose $13 million. That is just to name a few. Talk about major developments and the Nixon inquiry! I know what the Nixon inquiry is going to find.  It  will  find

BHP acknowledges that when clean up operations are complete, there will be some fuel left in the ground that will not be recovered. BHP has indicated that it is willing to negotiate a realistic adjustment to rebate payments based on an agreed and, if necessary, independent estimate of the lost fuel on which rebate has been claimed, and that will be a matter for decision by the Minister and Customs in due course.
