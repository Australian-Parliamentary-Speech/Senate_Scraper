         —I direct my question to the Assistant Treasurer representing the Minister for Administrative Services. During the supplementary estimates hearing on the DDB Needham smoking guns affair you stated that the question of whether DDB Needham was on the short list prior to the intervention of Mr Graeme Morris was fundamental to the case being developed by Senator Bolkus and me. Is it a fact that you have now been forced to reveal that the Minister for Administrative Services has now admitted that DAS made a thorough check of its files and could find no written evidence that DDB Needham Adelaide was in fact included on the list of advertising agencies prior to 28 June 1996? Is it not also a fact that this revelation by your own admission confirms that Mr Graeme Morris's fax was a key component of a political fix to guarantee the contract to DDB Needham Adelaide regardless of the quality of their bid?

It is Labor that suddenly, moving from government into opposition, says, `There's no way we can support the sale of another government utility. There's no way we can support the sale of Telstra.'

Since the 2 March election when the coalition government was elected, there have been two big reductions in interest rates, providing huge rewards and incentives to families and small business.

Perhaps one of the biggest benefits a government can give to families is to provide the environment which allows them to pay low interest rates with the buying of their most valuable asset, the family home. Similarly, small businesses derive enormous benefit from lower interests rates. Lower rates foster higher investment, more jobs and more growth.

        Since the election of the coalition, there have been substantial cuts in mortgage interest rates. Senator Cook, who has been calling out recently, may be interested to know that when this government came to office the variable home mortgage rate charged by big banks was 10.5 per cent. Correct? Correct. This has now fallen to 9.25 per cent, a fall of 1¼ percentage points. This fall has sliced repayments on a $100,000 loan by approximately $104 per month. For a person on adult average earnings, this is equivalent to an increase in pre-tax income of $160 per month—because, of course, mortgage costs are paid from after tax income.

        We are now seeing, partly as a result of competition and partly because of the government's good management of the economy—particularly, of course, with the budget—that some of the major lenders are offering the lowest home mortgage rates since the 1970s. No wonder the latest Newspoll has shown such buoyant figures for the coalition.

As I said yesterday, over the last 2&amp;half; years under Labor, the only way mortgage rates went was up. This is not surprising because over this time official interest rates went up as well. In fact, official interest rates went up to 7.5 per cent. Under Labor variable home mortgage rates last fell in September 1993. In September 1994 they rose three-quarters of a percentage point to 9.5 per cent. Just three months later they rose to 10.5 per cent—and that is where they stayed right up until the election.

         The conclusion of all this is very straightforward. It is that Labor is the high interest rate party. Labor failed to bring down interest rates. And by refusing to discuss questions of importance in question time, they are misreading the interests of the Australian people.

        I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery this afternoon of the senior traditional owner of Jabiluka country, Yvonne Margarula. She is here on behalf of traditional owners to say very clearly no, they do not want mining on their land, particularly the

We have indicated that we expect the highest possible standards before we would tick off on that. The senator will also know that we have currently instituted—in cooperation with ERA, the Northern Territory government and the Northern Lands Council—a social and cultural study on the effects of industry and mining in the Ranger region, which will be an important information base for us as well. We expect to get that back towards the end of the first half of next year.

        Apart from that, the company, of course, needs approval from the Northern Territory government. It certainly, arguably, legally needs approval. We can go into the fine points of that law if you like, but it is not really appropriate in this forum. It will be a question of, if the traditional owners do have that legal right, whether they approve it.

        Apart from all that, the sentiment of what I said in that earlier answer some time ago really stands: I think the rights of the traditional owners in these matters clearly should be respected. I have received quite a bit of correspondence from Yvonne Margarula, in which she has made her position very clear, and it is consistent with what you have put to the Senate today. I have indicated to my office that I would be pleased to meet with her during her visit in Canberra if that remains her wish, which I understand it to be.

         —As I understand it, the agreement in the management plan between the Commonwealth and the state was that the final part of the road to the river would be closed by September next year. That responsibility is a responsibility of the Commonwealth and the state pursuant to the terms of that agreement even though it is administered by the state. That would be our plan, unless there is a decision by both parties to the contrary in the meantime.

        The honourable senator will be aware that there have been representations that the road should not be closed. They have been based on issues of safety and the provision of access, including the provision of access for tourist facilities, in particular, shorter rafting expeditions down the river. These arguments are currently being evaluated by the state government, which is going to report back to the ministerial council in the first quarter of next year. If these arguments are well&amp;hyphen;founded—and they have got to be analysed carefully—then obviously they would be balanced against the conservation values for which the road was to be closed. That assessment would be made at that time. Unless they outweigh the conservation values, then I would expect that the agreement would be adhered to in its terms.

As I said to you, the parties to an agreement can always change the agreement, but I think there would have to be an overwhelming case made out for it—I accept that.

The media, after examining the report, took a similar—if at times somewhat inaccurate—view in some areas. In fact, the only one hanging in there trying to pretend that the report found nothing and was a waste of time is Senator Collins. His problem is that he painted himself into a very embarrassing corner by failing to wait for the report. Instead, he condemned it in advance: he came out and declared it a waste of time and money and insisted it would find nothing, and he was wrong. He is still pursuing that same tired old exercise.

        In broad terms, the report found that 272 ATSIC funded organisations receiving $174 million in grants were either not fit and proper, in need of further investigation, or so seriously in breach of grant conditions as to require immediate and close attention.

        The special auditor has also produced a number of recommendations which have been received positively by ATSIC.

Do you know what Senator Bob Collins is supposed to be? He is supposed to be the shadow minister for primary industries!

The failed and discredited Labor government was also aware of them but did nothing. The south&amp;hyphen;east fishery is a Commonwealth fishery that runs from the waters off Sydney, around Tasmania to South Australia.

        The fishery is managed by a system of output controls known as individual transferable quotas. Since the introduction of the system in 1992, a number of operators have argued that some aspects of the original quota allocation were unfair and reduced the value of their fishing entitlements. The continued wrangling about the initial quota allocation has greatly complicated the management of the fishery. One of the great advantages of a transferable quota system is that operators can
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         buy and sell their entitlements. The existence of a market for quota enables fisheries to adjust themselves to changing conditions. The continued uncertainty in the south&amp;hyphen;east fishery has meant that operators have been reluctant to buy or sell quota. It has also meant that the compliance and enforcement costs associated with the fishery have been higher than necessary.

        In December 1993, the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which Senator Chapman was a very active member, recommended that the Australian Fish Management Authority should explore all the options for adjustment of the fishery, including some form of buy&amp;hyphen;out of operators holding small amounts of quota.

        In 1994 the South-East Trawl Management Advisory Committee prepared a detailed paper on adjustment options in the fishery. In late 1994, nearly two years ago, AFMA wrote to the Minister for Resources outlining a way of approaching the issue. The Labor government did not do anything much about the issue in 1994. In 1995 it actually responded and said that it was still considering the matter. This is the sort of solution that the previous Labor government provided. It thought that if it did nothing, this major problem would go away. It was still thinking about the problem when it was swept from office.

The biggest problem, as everyone will know, when we faced the budget was the fact that we had to overcome years and years of Labor's irresponsible spending. Labor spent billions of dollars of money it did not have. It put the money on the credit cards so that future generations would have to pay. We had no option but to address that problem. Those decisions are not easy decisions, but it is something that had to be done. There was a general acceptance by the public that what we did was fair and equitable. They knew we had to face up to the squandering of people's money by the Labor Party. One of the things that the Labor Party has never understood is

        The Industry Commission undertook a series of reviews on bounty assistance. Their view in all cases was that bounties were no longer an appropriate means of providing assistance to industry and that they had clearly run their course. After 13 years of Labor, improving the competitiveness of Australian industry is what we have to do. Australia recently had the unenviable honour of suffering the largest slide of any OECD nation on competitiveness.

        Let me also say that there are significant benefits to industries in the budget. In relation to books, there are generous transitional arrangements. In the case of computers—Senator Cook did not raise this, but it covers the whole bounty issue—the government has convened the information industries task force to consider what form that should take.

        Unlike Labor, we do not advocate unproductive handouts to industry.

        We are also addressing this through the industrial relations bill, which the Labor Party continues to ignore.

Senators on the other side will have their opportunities to show us whether they are serious in addressing the problems that we inherited when we came to government.

        There will not be any change to funding for government schools if the government sector can continue to maintain its enrolments. That is the key to it all. The money, in a sense, will follow the students. As a result of cost shifting in the states between government and non&amp;hyphen;government schools since 1983, states and territories have saved more than $3 billion. Any movement of a student in a government school to a non&amp;hyphen;government school saves the states and territories on average $3,403. What the government is proposing will actually reduce the incentive of states and territories to shift students into non&amp;hyphen;government schools.

As a result of cost shifting between the states, they have saved about $3 billion. We have set up a system that is designed to create a disincentive for them to continue with that. I have indicated to you, Senator, that we are putting more money into schooling, that per capita Commonwealth funding for a student in a government school is going to increase by 17 per cent, whereas the increase in per capita Commonwealth funding in a non&amp;hyphen;government school is 14.9 per cent.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Robert Ray today, relating to the tendering process for an advertising contract won by DDB Needham, Adelaide.
       </para>
       <para>
        This particular matter has quite a history because what Senator Kemp was answering the question on today was misleading evidence at the estimates committee—and I commend him for correcting the record so rapidly; an example that some of his colleagues should follow. What Senator Kemp does not understand, I think, because he was not involved previously, is that this is the second major correction that has come through on this particular subject.

         On 30 September, at the initial estimates committee hearing, I asked the following question:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Were there any suggestions made by ministers, their staff or parliamentary secretaries, or other member of parliament who should be on this list?

         Not that I recall, Senator.
        </para>
        <para>
         I went on to ask:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         But you have no recollection that a particular firm or two may have been suggested by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's office or by Mr Jull or anyone else?
        </para>
        <para>
         The answer was no. I asked:

         There is no notation on the record anywhere that will assist with that?

         Not that I am familiar with.
        </para>
        <para>
         I then said:

         You would certainly remember if they struck one off or wrote one in?
        </para>
        <para>
         The answer was yes. So, on 30 September, there was a total denial that anyone had written or interfered in the tendering process. But what did we get when the estimates committee resumed? We got a statement read before the committee saying, `I am sorry. All that evidence is wrong. Mr Morris, the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, did in fact write and this message was received on 28 June 1996.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there has been a complete recantation of the evidence to that point. We went on to examine these matters and we asked:

         Can you say to me whether Mr Morris's intervention had any effect on your thinking as to who goes on the list of five?

         But you are saying that you had DDB Needham on a list before Mr Morris rang and discussed it with you.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          We can't find any written evidence that DDB Needham Adelaide was in fact on the list prior to Mr Morris's fax.'

         I raised in the supplementary estimates committee that the fact is the other four firms put on the list of five had an average billing rate of $47.8 million a year, yet this tiny little outfit in Adelaide had a billing rate of $5.8 million a year. The fact is—with its two principals, Toby Ralph and John King, working full time on the federal election campaign, employed by state directors Minchin and Morris—DDB Needham suddenly got the nod to get on to the list.

         There are some more interesting facts about Senator Kemp. Once Senator Kemp learned the news that they were on the list before Mr Morris wrote his fax, there was a big breakout at the estimates committee. There was great fun to be had by Senator Kemp. The transcript of the hearing states:

         But it is a fundamental issue, Senator Ray, is it not? You are trying to build a case against Mr Morris, but the evidence that has been tendered to this committee is that DDB Needham were put on the list prior to that letter which was received by Ms Moore. It is a fairly fundamental point, is it not?
        </para>
        <para>
         Well, isn't it! All that evidence is wrong and the fact is that all the defence Senator Kemp put up is wrong. This has happened on not one occasion; it has happened on two occasions.

The bottom line was: whether it was Williams, or the Prime Minister or whoever it was, they could not answer the detail and they could not justify the rort that they have all been involved in. This will go on. This will continue and this is a warning we give you now.

        Senator Kemp, when he was answering questions last week,  did not expect to come in here today to say, `Hold it. We got it wrong last week. We misled the Senate on a very fundamental point in this process.' He did not expect to do that. I am sure further on down the track that other ministers will also not be expecting to come back, but you will have to keep on coming back until we have a full and open inquiry into this matter which will expose the rort that Senator Minchin rode straight to the home post. Senator Minchin was the driving force behind this, not just Mr Morris. It is quite apparent from all the evidence that they were the ones who wanted

         to reward their mates in a small little firm from Adelaide whose Sydney operation was in a state of crisis.

        We have here a breach of the Prime Minister's code of conduct. There was an improper benefit provided through political intervention by those close to the Prime Minister's office—an improper benefit contrary to the principles laid down by the Prime Minister. This is a rort. The firm that got the contract rated last. They got the contract because they were mates—they had known Morris for 10 years; they had worked with Senator Minchin for some time; they had worked with Mr Georgiou in the Victorian campaign. It was a reward to their mates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Not only was it a reward but they acted in the dark, contrary to the basic principles of tendering laid down and adopted by this government. What did they do when the decision was taken? They kicked the public servants out. The rules state very clearly that public servants should expect to be there for the deliberations of the campaign. What did they do? They closed up shop, kicked them out about 11 o'clock and deliberated on their own—their own grubby little deal to benefit their mates. The process was corrupted. The process was stacked at the start in terms of who was on the committee. The process was stacked time and time again.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The advertising agency that got the contract did not even rate on the government's 1,000 tenderers list before this process started. They were not on that list when the decision was taken. They were put on the final list by Mr Morris's intervention—intervention quite critical to Senator Kemp's backdown today. On 7 June, 10 agencies were on OGIA's list of preferred agencies. DDB Needham was not one of them. By 28 June, after the Morris letter, as has become very clear today, DDB Needham was put on the list. The list of 10 was cut back to six. Five were dropped off but DDB Needham was put on the list. That is the evidence that we had to have corrected today.

Senator Minchin worked overtime to ensure it got up. Not only that, having spent money on research, having got your mates in, what did you do? You can shake your head all you like because the stink starts with you, Senator Minchin. We know it very well. You then rorted the campaign, the focus of the campaign. That is what you did.

         included DDB Needham Pty Ltd Sydney, Saatchi and Saatchi, the Ball Partnership and John Singleton, which are major advertising agencies—was put forward on the first tranche of the discussions about the letting of this contract. But, oh no, Senator McMullan was not happy with that. He did not want one of the leading companies. He said, `Could we find a company who has a more creative approach?' Guess who was found? A company called Corporate Impacts, headed by none other than an Anne Gorman who had been a candidate for Labor preselection in the 1973 election.

        I said at the time when I was looking at that investigation that the fact that she had connections with the Labor Party was not an issue. Yet they are saying on the other side that once you have had an association with a party you cannot ever have a contract with them. You are barred for life.

        Corporate Impacts in fact set up a little company called Social Impacts in 1983 to inform business about Labor Party policy when they got into government because Labor had been out of power so long they would not understand the policy.

And those opposite have the gall to come in here and criticise the way we chose a company when they chose a company that was balance sheet insolvent for a $5 million contract.

I sat through all of these hearings and I thought the officers of the department gave very forthright  evidence. I thought the minister answered it very well on the advice of his officers. Senator Kemp is not the minister involved; he was the representative minister, and I thought that he was most precise, deliberate and honest in the answers he gave. The minister of course is Mr Jull.

        Understand, gentlemen and ladies opposite, that your colleagues in the other House today have been asking questions on this particular matter, but I do not think they asked one single question of Mr Jull—not one single question.

        This issue is all about the guns campaign—getting the guns back in. You would think, from the way the Labor Party are going on about this, that they want to ruin the campaign. They do not seem to be terribly interested in the campaign to get those guns back in. If they were, they would be supporting the government in getting the very best campaign going. For all of the accusations and the vindictive following of particular people

        I have the utmost confidence in the people whose professional skills the government has relied upon in its selection of a management agency. I was not all that confident with the previous government's people. We had Rod Cameron, who I think has done the ALP research for so many years that we cannot remember, who seemed to get all of the government contracts. And who was that other fellow? Singleton. He seemed to get a hell of a lot of government contracts as well. I suppose it is just coincidence that, having got all those government contracts, both of them happened to do all the Labor Party's work. I suppose you will say to me that all of the work he did for the government did not help him in the advice he gave to the ALP on how they should pitch their campaigns.

        I think I have been through that, and I will not bore the Senate by repeating it. I think I have been through with you all of the campaigns that Mr Cameron and Mr Singleton ran, out of which they could have used the evidence they gained—the facts and materials—to run the Labor Party campaign. Obviously his campaigning and advertising was not as successful as that that was organised by people on our side who have some real skills and information in this.

          As senators are aware, the red is issued as a guide to the business which it is expected that the Senate will deal with on a particular day. It is finalised usually after the whips have met to consider the business proposed for that day. I have been advised that it has been the practice for some years now to list notices of motion at placing of business where the mover has given the whips a firm indication of his or her intention to postpone the notice and if no objection is raised to the postponement. Such notices have not also been listed under discovery of formal business on the basis that they will have been postponed by the time discovery of formal business is reached in the routine of business and, therefore, are not available for discovery.

          I have been advised that, if there is any doubt as to whether a notice is to be postponed or if it is likely that the postponement may be opposed, the notice will then be listed under discovery of formal business.

       The numerous barriers which exist in the higher education system for many groups in society make it essential for the Federal Government to provide support to those who most need assistance to attend university. The extra three years that students must remain dependent on their families presumes that families provide unconditional support for their studying children. The underlying basis for this change is especially flawed given that traditional notions of the `family' can no longer be upheld.

         —by leave—Motion No. 289 was a motion I gave notice of yesterday in relation to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The reason I wanted to move the motion was that we felt we were going to be required to deal with the workplace relations bill immediately. It was, in fact, really a new bill, because there was an agreement between the Democrats and the government which actually provided a further 170 amendments. We now see that there are amendments from the ALP, and there are further amendments from the Democrats.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is an extremely important bill. I know we have had weeks where the committee sought the opinion of people from around Australia but, in effect, we are talking about not only a different bill but a whole range of issues associated with the bill on which we are
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         required to make a considered opinion. These are issues which are likely to affect just about every working person in Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important that we make good decisions and good legislation. To be forced to deal blindly with those issues after 50 hours of discussions to which the Senate has not been privy—which I believe is bad process—is not good democratic process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The motion seeks two weeks to enable us to consider properly the issues and the hundreds of amendments that are now in circulation. This would enable us to make good decisions in this chamber. I think it is not unreasonable to ask for at least a couple of days to look at these issues. Fifty hours equals a couple of months of various discussions. That would have been preferable, but that is not reasonable considering that we have given commitments to deal with the bill in this session.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To ask for two weeks is not unreasonable. But it is not reasonable to renege on agreements that have been made in the leaders' meetings. We are now not dealing with Telstra—there are other bills that could be dealt with. We are being forced in a very shoddy way to go back to the industrial relations bill. This is not the way to make good legislation.

        I would like to voice my strongest opposition to any proposal to change the order of the bills we were going to deal with—that is, Telstra first, on which we still have a couple of speakers left, and then the workplace relations bill.

         —by leave—I want to take this opportunity to put on record my most sincere congratulations to Senator Hill for the flexibility that he is demonstrating in the management of the government's legislative program! One day he indicates to the Senate that we will be proceeding with the debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Then, because the government has failed to get its act together, he
         <break page="4661" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The next day he proposes that we complete the second reading debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill before we resume the committee stage debate on the workplace relations bill. The next day, because the negotiations with the Democrats have been concluded, Telstra is no longer, apparently, the priority it was and the committee stage debate of the workplace relations bill is to come on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This flexibility from Senator Hill would be very admirable for a circus clown or an acrobat, but it is not very admirable flexibility in this chamber. It is not appropriate behaviour for someone who is responsible for the management of the government's legislative program in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        How is anyone seriously expected to believe the protestations that we have heard from the government about the importance of these issues that are before the Senate—the vital urgency of the flagship bills of this coalition government—when it is the same government that is continually suspending debate on these bills, changing its mind as to what the priorities might be and deferring debate in this chamber on that legislation? How is anyone expected to seriously and sensibly debate this legislation?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government gave its commitment very recently to a particular order for debate for legislation—that is, that we would complete the Telstra second reading debate in the early part of this week before moving on to the workplace relations committee stage debate. This government has simply failed to honour those commitments that were given to the opposition and to other parties in the Senate.

        What the opposition has argued for for a long time in relation to these processes in the Senate is some certainty. Anyone at all in the government from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) down who suggests that it is the opposition that is preventing debate on its legislative program has now had exposed to them the sheer hypocrisy of such a claim. It is the government's own inept handling of its own program that has led to this situation.

         It is true. Senator Hill did sit around the table with me and, as I said, Senator Carr and Senator Evans from the opposition and other senators and give commitments about the program.

         What the opposition says—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—back to Senator Hill is that we expect some level of cooperation from the government.

We expect it to honour those commitments to the opposition and to the minor parties. It is not an unreasonable thing, in my view, for senators in this place, given proper procedures and an understanding of the way in which this place works, to expect from the government that, if commitments are given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, he will honour them.

         Yesterday, when everyone, as far as I am aware, had been proceeding on the assumption that we would be continuing the second reading debate on the Telstra bill, the government at the last minute tried to defer debate and bring on the workplace relations bill. Naturally enough we complained. I complained when I received what I thought was a rather pathetic call from Senator Hill saying, `I've got a problem.' He did have a problem.

Apparently even the government eventually agreed it would be unreasonable to expect senators to launch into the debate on 171 amendments, most of which had not been made available to a substantial number of senators in this place. And then it appears that the government—at least for 24 hours—reverted to the original arrangement to proceed with Telstra.

It is because of that, Senator Margetts, that we indicated that we would not be supporting your motion for a deferral of the committee stage debate on the workplace relations bill until 18 November.

Every member of this chamber knows that when the opposition gives a commitment to adopt a course of action in this place it is honoured. That is a lesson you could well learn, Senator Hill.

         —by leave—The opposition has a short memory. Its attitude in government to the opposition was that you cop what you get when and in what order the government determines. It made no effort at all, until the last few weeks of each sitting session, to speak to the then opposition in any constructive way. Only when it needed, obviously, a level of cooperation to get bills through at the end of the session did it make any attempt to find a cooperative program. Never before in my experience—and I had six years leading the opposition in here and I witnessed the previous seven years in opposition—did the government come in almost at the beginning of a session and seek to sit down with the opposition and minority parties to try to work out some orderly process. So if we have erred—and I think we have erred to some extent—it is very much that we have tried to do too much.

Unfortunately, they were not ready with their amendments as soon as Labor were, so we could not take those amendments in with us. But now, suddenly, and very opportunistically, they are up, making political mileage on this one.

           —How can you lock the public out of a 10&amp;hyphen;month debate, Senator Brown? Really, your arguments are silly. I now want to deal with the matter of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. I think that Senator Hill should explain to the Senate why, when we are one or two speakers short of the end of the second reading debate—and it would not be delaying the IR bill debate—it could not continue. There must be a reason. I would like to know which senator or senators want it this way, because it is not the Democrats. We were willing to facilitate the end of the speeches on the second reading of the Telstra bill and we were expecting a procedural motion to achieve that. As there is not one, it seems that we will move to the next item of government business. But, really, the process of government business, as we all know in this cham

        This is a very important issue for the Senate. At the recent estimates hearings, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs revealed that they had written to Minister Vanstone's office to draw their attention `to the incorrect reporting in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        on 19 August' which inferred that the department had advised the former Labor government that the five per cent unemployment rate was unachievable. The department was concerned at the incorrect inference in this article, attributed to Senator Vanstone, that the department had advised the former Labor government that the five per cent target was unachievable. Certainly, the department was not the only one to draw that inference. I think it would have been very obvious to any reader of not only the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        article but also the press release from Senator Vanstone on which the article was based. That press release says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similarly, DEETYA has advised that at the time of the election, on information available to the previous government, unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.

        I have argued here for some time that Senator Vanstone displayed the same disdain for accuracy that she showed in relation to the evidence over the Wright family and the same disdain for accuracy and the truth that she showed in her answer to a similar dorothy dix question on the issue of the Democrats' Internet home page. We have said very clearly that this level of disdain for the parliament, for ministerial responsibility and for ensuring that the public record is accurate is absolutely unacceptable—totally unacceptable in a government minister. It is unacceptable, in my view, in any public figure at all.

        John Howard, the Prime Minister, took the same view in his much vaunted ministerial guidelines. He quickly retreated when he realised the impossibility of imposing such high standards on his ministers. Now he is in the process of rewriting these very same guidelines.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a direct parallel between the information being sought in this return to order and the case of the bogus Wright family. Again, the department rightly drew the minister's attention to the inaccuracies in press reports, which again were based on the minister's statements. At least in that particular case the minister agreed to release a departmental advice. She should do the same here. We are asking for this precedent to be followed in this case. We believe that this is a perfectly reasonable request.

        Given that the minister twice repeated her assertions about the deceit of the Labor Party in maintaining, against the advice of DEETYA, a purportedly unachievable unemployment target, we also want to know whether the department brought this matter to her attention again after these subsequent statements. It seems to me that this is an open and shut case of a minister being required to fulfil a ministerial responsibility. I would ask for

         —What Senator Faulkner is doing is himself actually misleading the Senate and, out of misleading the Senate, attempting to paint a picture that Senator Vanstone shows, in his terms, disdain for the truth. He did it firstly in relation to the so-called Wright matter. That matter was explained by the department, which gave the minister an apology for the incorrect information it had provided. But that is not conceded by Senator Faulkner.

        He has instead come in here day after day and, either explicitly or by implication, said that Senator Vanstone deliberately misled the estimates committee. That is not so. Similarly in relation to this matter, what he is seeking to allege out of a press release that Senator Vanstone issued is again that in some way that statement was misleading, when there is no evidence in fact that it is misleading at all. The statement said:

       <para>
        That is a statement she has made, a statement that she is prepared to support. That was then interpreted in a subsequent press report, and then the department wrote Senator Vanstone saying that the press report was misleading. The opposition has not even sought to make out the case that the statement Senator Vanstone made in the press release was misleading. Yet, the impression Senator Faulkner is seeking to create in this place is that in some way she has disdain for the truth. That is why what he is seeking to do is misleading and grossly unfair. It is good sport for Senator Faulkner, I understand, but the record is entitled to stand as it is, rather than as Senator Faulkner would wish it to be.

        He takes this one step further and comes in here today and says that he is entitled to seek a return to order basically for all information relating to the matter, whether or not it is relevant to the issue of whether Senator Vanstone has evidence to substantiate the statement she put in her press release.

         advice, as I recall it, relating to unemployment projections was in the form of his notice of motion, not advices that might substantiate the argument Senator Vanstone put in her press release.

        The important thing is: is there a case to suspend standing orders to require the passage of this return to order? Firstly, there isn't because no urgency has been established at all, or even an attempt by Senator Faulkner to establish an urgency. Secondly, what he is subsequently going to seek goes far beyond the evidence for the case that he is trying to make. Thirdly, this is fishing. This is the practice that this opposition is now adopting day after day with returns to order without making out any prima facie case at all, fishing for all documents that are possible in order to find something that can exploit a political opportunity.

        I feel it might be useful in relation to this particular issue to remind the Senate of the history of this particular matter. The issue first came to light on 19 August in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        newspaper. In a newspaper article at that time it was stated by Senator Vanstone that, at the time of the March election, her department had advised Mr Crean, the then employment minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been, at best, 6.8 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That particular newspaper article caused Senator Vanstone's department to confirm, after it was published, that they in fact moved to inform the minister that Mr Crean was advised about `a range of conditions that would need to be met to achieve the former government's five per cent unemployment rate target by the turn of the century'. The department says it `did not put any view on the most likely outcome or suggest any particular level below which the unemployment rate was likely to fall'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That information has been confirmed by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in answer to question No. 232 asked by my colleague Senator Carr of Mr Hollway at the Senate estimates legislation committee hearing on budget 1996-97. In fact, it appears in

I must say, in relation to so many issues, the only reason that the truth has come out in relation to the way in which Minister Vanstone has conducted her responsibilities and administered her portfolio is the constant questioning by the Labor opposition and the demanding of the sorts of advices that would be required to be produced by the minister if the motion before the chair is successful.

There is no doubt that is one of the reasons that Senator Vanstone's reputation as a minister has become so tarnished in just the eight months since the election of this government.

         I want the Senate to reflect on the fact that, in the case of the Wright saga, Senator Vanstone was exposed of perpetrating a massive fraud not only in terms of misleading the Senate but also, and I think more importantly, in terms of misleading the public, the Australian people. There were newspaper articles splashed all around Australia about this massive fraud and she did absolutely nothing either in a parliamentary sense or in a public sense to correct the record. The only reason she acted at all was, again, that the opposition asked questions of relevant ministers, including questions I asked a day later to Senator Newman in a Senate estimates committee.

         As I said in an earlier debate, we could smell the Liberal Party dead cat that was dragged across the track in relation to this particular matter, but Senator Vanstone, in relation to the Wrights, actually decided after continual pressure from the media and from the opposition in parliament to table documents in this place. She was forced to table documents in this place. It is Senator Vanstone who has set the precedent in relation to this particular matter.

         Why will Senator Vanstone not agree to take the same action as she did with the Wrights in relation to this particular matter? I pose the question: what does Senator Vanstone have to hide?

But if you feel that it should be extended and other issues should be raised, you might care to consider why the same amount of information that is available in relation to the Wrights should not be available to those committee members. It is a perfectly reasonable question to ask you: what have you to hide on this particular matter; what are you covering up on this matter?

         —I oppose this motion moved by Senator Faulkner for a number of reasons, not the least of which is, in the first instance, that no case has been made that I have misled the Senate. No-one has produced any words that I have used in the Senate that have misled the Senate, to the best of my knowledge, at all. I will come to that and go back over those matters in detail, lest there is anybody who has not been focusing on some of the questions that have been asked and the answers that have been given.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But equally importantly, returns to order are a mechanism for the Senate to use in circumstances where they believe that information should be provided to the Senate. Presumably, that is because there is an important matter where you call upon taking from a minister and a department information that would otherwise not be publicly available, that is not on the public record. There have been occasions, of course—and there always will be—where returns to order should be used. I make no bones about that whatsoever. But in circumstances where no case has been made that a senator has misled the Senate, then I do not think it is an appropriate case to use a return to order.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, I follow on and indicate that the breadth of the return to order does not go simply to the question of whether I have misled the Senate; it goes to the much broader fishing expedition in relation to any advice to me from my department relating to unemployment projections up to the year 2000. That is any advice whatsoever—not advice pertaining to the, I say, fabricated allegation that I have misled the Senate, but any advice whatsoever and my statements about the purported
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         unachievability of the Australian Labor Party's target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I say, firstly, a return to order is an important mechanism for use by the Senate when it believes that documents that otherwise would not be provided publicly should be. Secondly, because that mechanism is so important, if you want to use it because you think someone has misled the Senate then you have to make a decent case that in fact they have. Thirdly, when you do want to use it, you do need to have some discretion in the focusing of the return to order to ensure that you are not trying to debase the value of returns to order by casting your net so wide that you consistently get refusals from a government. That is, the terms of the proposed return to order should be targeted to the matters in question.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, a return to order should be used, if all of those other conditions are satisfied, in circumstances where there has been an unwillingness to front up and give an answer. In that respect I would say, `Look, with respect to this matter, I have answered this in the Senate on a number of occasions yesterday and again today.' Also, I have been written to by the secretary of the estimates committee which is meeting on Friday—and it is early days in the week, I know, but Friday is not that far away—indicating that the committee may wish to discuss these matters then, and I am happy to do that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In those circumstances, to proceed with a return to order would cast an enormously wide net across any information provided on unemployment projections—and how do you do a projection? You take into account certain assumptions about a whole lot of economic matters and you necessarily therefore are asking for a lot more than that because you want to see what is behind assumptions that have been made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So let me come to the case of whether I have, in fact, misled on this matter. I have dealt with this matter once before, yesterday, and I have dealt with it today. But since members opposite do not seem to have come to grips with what I have said, and perhaps some people now in the chamber were not

         I turn to the second ground. Senator Faulkner seems to be seeking every piece of analysis and advice concerning scenarios, projections, forecasts, et cetera about unemployment. No government is going to simply give out all of this to satisfy the senator's curiosity and fishing expedition. The Public Service has to be able to provide dispassionate and fearless analysis and advice. This cannot happen if anything can be put in the public domain at a senator's whim.

         The return to order process was not created as a licence to fish. It was not created as a device to give automatic access, least of all for no good reason, to internal information in government. The previous government itself declined to provide information when it was judged not to be in the public interest. It is not in the public interest to undermine the institution of frank analysis and advice. That is especially so when aspects of the information, as with economic projections, can be market sensitive.

         That brings me to the third reason for opposing the motion. I would not lightly invoke market sensitivity and public interest as reasons for declining to provide material to the Senate.

           —Senator Kernot interjects. I hope she was listening in the early part of my remarks when I said that I do understand why there is a return to order and that I do think there are circumstances when it is appropriate to use it. I used it myself. To the best of my recollection I have used it only once, and certainly only once recently. That was when the previous government refused to be forthcoming with respect to the payment of Dr Lawrence's fees. That was a very important issue, and we believed it was important enough to use a return to order. Perhaps the Foreign Investment Review Board was one. I do not know; I was not involved in that. There are those circumstances.

         <para first-indent="16">
          All I am saying is that use of a return to order is important. Use of a very broad one necessarily becomes even more important. In order to use it you have to make a really decent case. What I said on the record is there for all to see: a press release that says one thing and an article the next day written by a journalist who has not spoken to me. It was written with no bad faith as far as I am concerned, although I suppose I should not say that without having met him to discuss it. I am giving him the benefit of what perhaps should be doubt, but it has never entered my head that this was done in bad faith; put it that way. The journalist has misparaphrased that. The journalist has not put it in quotes; he has misparaphrased it. The department has written to me and said, `There's a mistake in the media.'

          <para first-indent="16">
           I hope my department does not do that every time that happens and expect me to come and correct it in the chamber or somewhere else, because I will spend my life in here. I suspect the reason the department did it on this occasion is that the incorrect paraphrasing actually refers to an activity of theirs: that is, whether they directly advised the previous minister. I think that is the circumstance that occasioned them to do this. They certainly did not do it in other circumstances when there has been incorrect reporting—for example, in higher education, which we will discuss on another day.

          <para first-indent="16">
           In summary, let me conclude by saying that I agree—there is no dispute—that returns to order are important. They are a very important mechanism. The currency can be devalued by overuse and the currency can be devalued by poor drafting when you use a baseball bat or a sledgehammer to hit a nail. But, when the nail is not even there—when the relevant documents are on the public record in the sense that the statement I made is a public press release, when the article in the
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            Australian
           </emphasis>
           is on the public record, when what I said on

            Meet the Press
           </emphasis>
           is on the public record; and I think they speak for themselves—there is no case for using a return to order as broad as this to go right into every possible projection that the government might have made with respect to these matters. You need to have a case; otherwise what we are saying is, `Any time we feel like it, for no good reason, we think we'll just ask the government to open up its books on everything.' That is not the purpose of a return to order.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Lastly, before I conclude—because I will try to keep very close to the time that Senator Faulkner used—Senator Faulkner raised yet again the Wright family, the so&amp;hyphen;called Wright family. I will not bother going into everything he said. It seems that as much as I come into this place and acknowledge that the department made a mistake and that they have apologised—and although I wrote to the estimates committee, having asked for the draft of the letter to the estimates committee to be changed, having got some advice, and although I asked that the letter be sent around to the committee so that all members got it,
           <break page="4678" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            including, obviously, Labor members and presumably, therefore, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja as well—somehow this is a ruse and a cover&amp;hyphen;up.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           It is very important to remember something that was raised in question time today. I accept that this is not pertinent to the detail of this return to order, but it is pertinent to the remarks that Senator Faulkner made, since he is alleging I have some sort of record in this respect and is using the Wright family as an example of it. There were two things wrong with the Wright family. Firstly, the Wright family was presented as being an actual family, when what in fact happened was that an actual example of a family that had been caught by the means test was taken and altered. In my view it is not reasonable to then call it an actual family. That is fair enough. That has been acknowledged. Secondly, errors of calculation were made in the level of social security benefits that that family could get.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           But we should not forget that the Wright family example illustrates a very real problem. The problem is that relatively wealthy families were applying for Austudy—families which might also have available to them social security or other government benefits. Other departments do not have an actual means test. If anything, the case of the so&amp;hyphen;called Wright family demonstrates the merit of Labor's means test. Nobody disputes that a family with the Wrights' profile would have available to them around $12,000 worth of benefits other than Austudy. I have tabled in the Senate real cases of wealthy families denied Austudy by the application of the means test.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There has been extensive consideration over the life of this government of the desirability of extending the means test. There have been no rash decisions about an immediate application of the means test to other benefits, because no&amp;hyphen;one wants to disadvantage the genuinely needy. But let me reassure the Senate that we will be targeting the greedy, just as Labor did by applying the means test to Austudy. It was designed to get at people like the so&amp;hyphen;called Wrights, who, taking Senator Ray's advice, as I am advised, did have a
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            home worth over $1 million and who would, but for the means test, have got Austudy.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I just raise those points to indicate that the error with respect to the so&amp;hyphen;called Wright family is that they started with an actual family and changed it. It is not reasonable to call it an actual family after that.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Initially, there was an error in the calculations. I think the calculations put it up at $20,000, and we say it is around $12,000, but the guts of it—that a family with the profile would, but for the means test, be able to get those benefits—is not incorrect. As an example of how it works, it is a good example. It is only one example, and that was the error that was there.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Let me conclude by saying returns to order are important. They should be used for very important matters. They should not be more broadly cast than they need be. They certainly should not be used when the question of whether someone has misled the Senate has already been answered. They should not be used for a fishing expedition and there is certainly no case to use them when the estimates committee before which I am to appear on Friday has not even had the opportunity to answer and was told at the last sitting, when I was overseas on education matters, that I would be coming back. There is absolutely no reason, for all of those reasons, to proceed with this return to order.

I think Senator Vanstone made a fairly cogent general case about the use of return to order, but when I look at the material that Senator Faulkner has presented today, it seems to me that the question is not first and foremost a matter of misleading but whether it is pertinent to statements you have been making, whether this advice is pertinent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems to me that the advice is pertinent. It has been used and is being used. On the wider matter of the words of the motion which ask for advice relating to unemployment projections up to the year 2000, given
        <break page="4679" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that the whole future of employment&amp;hyphen;unemployment policy arising out of the budget is so important to this country, in the budget context the future of unemployment and this government's responses to unemployment, the framing of those responses and the advice that goes into the framing of those responses is really important.

        I do not regard that as general fishing. I do think that the information the Democrats got on a return to order which Senator Hill complied with ultimately on Hinchinbrook gave us material that was so useful in the estimates process that I do not think it is sufficient to argue, `If you wait until Friday, you get another go at it.' I am not persuaded by that particular argument.

        I am certainly not persuaded by the argument of market sensitivity and that there are things that the public does not have a right to know when it comes to commercial confidentiality. I think the issue of employment projections is an important one. On page 119 of Budget Paper No. 1 we have projections. On the page after that we have assumptions, four years out. It is no big deal. Treasury is worried about us doing this but it is no big deal in the budget, as long as you spell out the assumptions. At page 227 we have the actual forecasts and yes, of course, they are only one year out.

         That there will be laid on the table, by 5 pm on Tuesday, 29 October 1996, by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), copies of any advice to her from her department relating to unemployment projections up to the year 2000 and her statements about the purported unachievability of the Australian Labor Party's target of 5 per cent unemployment by the year 2000.

         I believe that this matter of unemployment is one of the most important policy considerations that are facing every individual member of the parliament and the people in general—not only the government but also individual members of parliament. I certainly would like to see the advice that has been given to the government by the department relating to unemployment projections. I think this is a very important matter.

          I take on board what Senator Vanstone said about these possibly including advices re ceived from Treasury. But as Senator Kernot pointed out, and as most would have observed, the budget papers themselves have employment projections and unemployment projections. The budget papers themselves have the assumptions upon which those projections have been made. It is very important to have as much information as possible about that question of employment. The government itself has established a cabinet committee on employment.

Some of the assumptions have to be queried. Once you query those assumptions, you then place the government and others in a position of considering whether or not the policies that are adopted will achieve the desirability of reducing unemployment.

         The problem of unemployment, simply stated, is that there are more people in or seeking paid work than there are jobs available at the same time as technological change and automation are slashing jobs that used to be about, particularly for the unskilled. We have to look at the situation very carefully. If we look at the assumptions, we have to look at what those assumptions are. We ought to be looking at those in paid work at present for whom it would be a great desire to be out of that paid work and doing something else and performing other tasks and jobs which they want to perform, which are socially creative,

       The House has passed that resolution to invite Mr Clinton to address it. It now invites us to do likewise and to accept that the form of the meeting take place as per the resolution of the House. This is the form, as I recall it, that was adopted by the Senate in relation to the time when then President Bush of the United States addressed both houses of this parliament. That was, I think, a very successful occasion and reinforced the very close, longstanding and important links between Australia and the United States of America. We therefore strongly support an invitation being
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        extended to the United States President, while he is visiting Australia, to address the Senate.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The only issue of some controversy is where such an address should take place—whether it should be in the House, in the Senate or on neutral ground such as the Great Hall—and what rules should apply. We wrestled with this, I recall, at the time of the debate in relation to President Bush. As I recall, some were somewhat uncomfortable with the notion that the Senate move into the House of Representatives for this purpose. Nevertheless, as that worked successfully—the meeting has to take place somewhere—and as the House comes to this place for the opening of parliament as set down in the constitution, upon reflection we think it is not a bad balance of power in all the circumstances.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That is not the argument I recall putting on the previous occasion, but we all learn from our experiences in such circumstances. As that worked well—the rules that applied on the last occasion would apply on this occasion—it seems that this is a process we should adopt again on this second occasion. I therefore urge the Senate to approve the motion in order that this invitation might be issued, and that we join together in the House of Representatives to hear the address of the United States' President.

It reminds me of the time that Robin Gray, the then Premier of Tasmania, decided to recall parliament to determine a matter of having a giant pulp mill on the farmlands of Wesley Vale but allowed North Broken Hill, the woodchip company, to announce it through dint of their own press release on their letterhead and to transfer to them the business of fixing when parliament should return.

       Not even our own head of state has addressed a joint meeting of both houses of this parliament in the House of Representatives. In fact, the only time she is entitled to address a joint meeting of both houses of this parliament in the Senate is when she is giving a speech which has been written by the government—by the executive of Australia. If she is giving a speech which has been written by herself—which she has done in this place—it has been given in the Great Hall, and that is quite appropriate. I see no reason why any other head of state should assume a higher status in the parliament of Australia—in this parliament building—than our own head of state, which is exactly what we are conferring when we agree to this.

       We will agree with this motion in the end. I do not believe every head of state should automatically be able to address both houses of this parliament in the House of Representatives or in the Senate—in either house of this parliament.

Yes, because this is twice in a row

       I am going to move that—and I never make a threat that I do not carry out, as you know, Senator Hill, not that that would be a threat, of course—and I would expect that that will be agreed to. I think it is really quite outrageous that a head of state is accorded a higher status than our own head of state. I am going to do that. I think Senator Brown has a good point when he says—as I have said many times in the past, and I did say it when President Bush came out here, and Senator Lees said it on the record—that we have to consider where we draw the line and where we start offending people because we are not inviting heads of state to address us in one of the houses of this parliament.

       I think that is a very, very serious matter that we have to consider now, because there are going to be other heads of state visiting after this. There are going to be heads of state of countries with which we do have very, very close relations, with which we have special defence treaties, as we do with the US, and with which we have other relations. Those people will be visiting this country and they ought to be given special consideration as well. We cannot just do this with one head of state—not even our own. When this motion is passed and sets the precedent, that is exactly what we are doing, so just keep that in mind.

There are other countries which are bigger in terms of their economic power.

I agree with the speakers today who have said that it is a very silly precedent, if it is a precedent. I would like to think it is not a precedent just because it has happened twice.

        Schedule 1 proposes a new principal object for the act, and these amendments to schedule 1 clarify the intent of the reforms and reinforce the overall thrust of the bill. Amendment No. 1 emphasises the importance of having a labour market that is both fair and flexible. The award system is to be focused on providing a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions. Amendments Nos 2 and 3 reflect the intention that the safety net be maintained and be enforceable. The new principal object already gives priority to ensuring freedom of association. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 reinforce the importance of registered organisations being able to operate effectively.

        The wine industry is one of Australia's success stories. It produces annually about 450 million litres from 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of wine grapes. It also is a major contributor to tourism and a big employer. Visiting wineries, of which there are approximately 900 dotted around Australia, is one of the most popular pastimes in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The wine industry holds about 97 per cent of the Australian market. The real success story in the industry, however, is its export performance. Exports now account for over 28 per cent of production, and the industry has set itself a target of $1 billion of export sales by the year 2003. This is from a country that is regarded as one of the world's smaller wine producers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The growth in the Australian wineries in the last five years has been rapid, with the then seven publicly listed wine companies recording a net increase in profits. That has been very good for those wine companies. A large part of this is the twentyfold growth in the exports over the last 10 years. There has been increased vineyard planting of premium grape varieties, especially in New South Wales and Victoria, in the cold country. I was out on Saturday actually visiting wineries in the Young area, for example. It is absolutely amazing what is happening in the industry. Between the years of 1993 and 1995 there has been an additional 11,000 hectares of grapes planted—worth nearly $400 million. It is an industry that has seized the export opportunities available, and I applaud it for that.

         However, while the industry is enjoying boom times at the present, the current eupho ria will not last unless the industry is managed appropriately. Much of the success of the wine industry must go to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, and this annual report sets out clearly its functions and objectives. The report also outlines the structure of its various committees, including the Australian Wine Export Council, which plans and recommends and executes export marketing programs; the Geographical Indications Committee, which plays a valuable role in defining the names and boundaries of Australia's geographical regions; and the label integrity program, which, in essence, ensures truth in labelling.

        The wine industry is an exciting star of the rural sector, and it deserves the support of all Australians. I must finish by saying that, of course, we have to be competitive on world markets. We have to be competitive because it is such a big employer. It is going to be so important that the industrial relations legislation is passed in the Senate. The legislation will be of great assistance when it has gone through to help the wine industry and many other industries in Australia.

        I am not going to take up too much time of the Senate, but I want to yet again register my protest about this process. Towards the end of each sitting, we have this great rush of documents, which are grouped department by department and in big numbers, and we have inadequate time to comment on them.

Obviously, there is no way that 86 documents could be dealt with in half an hour.

        I acknowledge and underline the point that the great bulk of these documents are annual reports. They can be dealt with in Senate estimates committees, and I hope that will be done. Nevertheless, it raises questions about whether it is appropriate to limit the tabling of documents to two days during the week and whether there should not be a change in arrangements so that these documents can be dealt with in a better way.

        I acknowledge that on Thursdays there is much more time put aside for dealing with accumulated documents, but it is unfortunate that the parliament, as a result of this procedure, comes a bad second to the media in terms of capacity to discuss the content of these annual reports. For example, the media has the opportunity of dealing with 86 reports tomorrow if it gets the time. We have no chance of commenting on 86 reports. When there are definite tabling requirements for annual reports of departments and agencies, clearly there is pressure on the Senate to deal with them. We have to make some other suitable arrangements to cope with this peak reporting time.

        I visited the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Darwin earlier this year. I want to make the Senate aware of what a seminally important institute this is and what a struggle it is for it because of the cutback in the funding going to it at a time when it needs more money to expand to carry out the extraordinarily important job it does of providing a whole range of studies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.

        It is quite a remarkable institution. It is ensuring that there is a two-way flow of information across the north of Australia and from people all over this country so that not only the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be better equipped to take part in the affairs of the modern Australian nation, as it is, but this nation can gain from the enormous storehouse of special information and cultural background which the original people of this country can provide to us.

         I take this opportunity to say to government senators opposite that this institute deserves adequate funding. This institute has enormous importance not only to the people attending it but to the nation as a whole. The work of this institute is unique. It has gained worldwide prominence and notice. People from elsewhere in the world, including people from the other 300 million indigenous peoples around the world, see this institute as something of a guiding light in terms of the educational facility it provides for those who go there. Yet its funding is being cut. It is being squeezed. The pressure on staff is phenomenal. The disadvantage to students because of the funding cuts is obvious when you are there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I urge the government to look again at the cut to the funding of this extraordinary important institute. If it cannot do that, I urge government ministers and members to be better acquainted with this institution, to read this report and to visit the institution to see the value that there is in that place for so many students and for the nation as a whole.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a travesty that it is being put under the slow squeeze, as it is. It is a travesty that it is being blighted by the pressure being put on staff and students alike. It is a travesty that so many people who want to study at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies cannot and that the institute is not expanding but is being forced to contract. I urge government senators opposite and government members as a whole to look again at what they are doing to this marvellous institute.

         —The introduction to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies annual report for 1995-96 mentions two important studies that the institute has been engaged in. One of those studies was into the Aboriginal councils that are incorporated under the federal act set aside for that purpose, which was commissioned by the previous government last year.

        The registrar of those Aboriginal corporations, Mr Bouhaus, has appeared before Senate committees to lay out the difficulties that Aboriginal corporations registered under this particular act have in respect of that question which is so much in the news—accountability of Aboriginal organisations. It is a fact that many of the organisations that do have financial difficulties funded by ATSIC are organisations that are incorporated under this act of parliament that the report refers to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A point that has been made by a number of Aboriginal leaders previously, and by me, I might add, is that it would have been far more reasonable, prudent and fair of the government to have waited until the report referred to in this document was finalised and presented to the government before it took the totally outrageous action that it did of appointing a special auditor, by ministerial direction, into ATSIC. It was a ministerial direction later found by the Federal Court to be unlawful, a ministerial direction which had the effect of declaring all Aboriginal organisations funded by ATSIC guilty until they were proven innocent. Funding was frozen by that ministerial direction until organisations had been cleared by the special auditor.

         There is a great deal of sensitivity at the moment about the use of the words `racist' and `racism', words that I have rarely used in my 20 years of public life, words that I think are applied far too freely. For example, I do not regard the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) as a racist, and I do not regard the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, as a racist. Sadly ignorant and ill&amp;hyphen;informed she may be, but I have met some real racists in my life and she does not even come close. But it is difficult to look at things like the appointment of the special auditor to ATSIC without accurately applying that term.

In fact, a more reasonable figure put by people publicly at the time the report came down was something like double that. But, as I said at the time, did anyone seriously suggest—I would not have—that a responsible act of the government would have been to have appointed a special auditor to the diesel fuel rebate scheme, to have frozen all payments under that scheme to farmers and miners across Australia, and to have declared all recipients of the scheme guilty until proven by the special auditor to be innocent? No. You would have been laughed out of the room if you had made such an absurd suggestion, but that is precisely what the government did in respect of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

         was the big feature and was leading a revival of Australian films on the international scene. We have always known that we were able to produce great films but we have seen over the years the impact that they may have had on the international scene rise and fall. It was in 1994 that I had those discussions with the Film Finance Corporation about the future of the film industry. I did so because the industry has always been an area of keen interest to me, not that I have always had the opportunity to put as much time into it as I would have liked in the past.

        One of the things I recall arising out of those discussions was the enthusiasm of people in the corporation—and I also met with Australian Film Commission—for the future of the industry. That has been borne out with the continuing release over the last couple of years of such movies as

        The other important thing is that the system of government and industry support through the Film Finance Corporation is one that is now generally acknowledged as being very successful and contrasts with some of the earlier efforts that governments made—I do not single out one side or the other here—in terms of using the taxation system to try to inject finance into filmmaking in this country. Whilst providing 150 per cent tax deductibility for filmmaking in this country was an

        The motion contains several of the bare facts of Sir Roland's career. There are many more. In particular, he was the first Tasmanian from a government school to be a Rhodes scholar. He was in his day one of Australia's foremost economists with great strength in economic statistics. He was the first economist to head the federal Treasury. He was a man of many parts. He was skilled in engineering and in cabinet making. In both these fields he had some notable achievements.

          Canberra Times
         </emphasis>
         last Sunday which said that during the war years Sir Roland would fossick in Canberra's rubbish dump to salvage material from which he built an electric motor car to defeat petrol rationing. In his youth he had success as a pole vaulter because `he had designed and built his own lightweight Oregon vaulting stick which was much lighter than the orthodox variety and was tailored to his five-foot height and nine-stone weight'. That is not entirely correct. Sir Roland was more than five foot tall, though perhaps not a lot more. He was small in physical stature but he was a giant in intellect and in the respect that he commanded.

         Sir Roland Wilson was an important member of a unique group of public servants who helped to transform Australia into a modern industrial economy after the Second World War.
        </para>
        <para>
         The group was unique. Although there were more than seven, those who were perhaps best known were the so-called `seven dwarfs'—Roland Wilson, Dick Randall, Allen Brown, Harry Bland, `Nugget' Coombes, John Crawford and Frederick Shedden. Between them they wielded enormous influence on the direction of postwar Australia right through to the 1960s and, in some instances, into the early 1970s.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was my privilege to have known Sir Roland Wilson. He was the Secretary to the Treasury when I joined that department in September 1963. I had the opportunity to work closely in his presence in the following three years before his retirement from the Treasury in 1966. I acted as his personal assistant on more than one occasion. I had almost daily contact with him whilst I was private secretary to the then Treasurer, Harold Holt, from late 1964 to early 1966. In these capacities we travelled to numerous international conferences around the world and, of course, saw each other, particularly in the domestic scene here in Canberra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Never on any one occasion was Roland Wilson other than the complete professional public servant. His relationship with the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          governments he served was correct at all times. He gave advice objectively and fearlessly. His stewardship of the Treasury was impeccable. It was almost certainly during his period as secretary that the Treasury enjoyed its greatest pre&amp;hyphen;eminence. The benefits to Australia were great.

        </para>

         Roland Wilson had a sharp tongue and a sharp pen. I can attest to the accuracy of John Farquharson's statement in his obituary where he said:

        </para>
        <para>
         I saw some of the most powerful and influential figures in the land stand in awe of Roland Wilson—and, in many instances, fear—but in all cases with respect. At the same time, Sir Roland Wilson had a razor sharp wit to match his razor sharp intellect. I often felt that he was a shy man. Once you got behind the steely glance and the sharp tongue, a heart of gold was often clear to see.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The world has changed a great deal since the days of Sir Roland's illustrious career. So has the Public Service. We may not see the likes of Roland Wilson again. Most Australians would probably not remember or even have heard of Sir Roland Wilson because of the great age to which he lived. It is very important, however, that we not lose sight of the values that he epitomised—character, intellect, honesty, integrity, objective and fearless advice to government and, through all of that, dedicated service to the Australian people.

Last week I attended the opening ceremony of the combined campus of Nicholls Primary School and the Holy Spirit Primary School, the former being an ACT government funded school and the latter being a Catholic school. A combined campus such as this may not be new in some other states but it is here in the ACT. This combined campus was an initiative by Labor when they held government in the ACT.

        The experience shared by all the invited guests at the opening ceremony—by the parents and politicians alike—is something worthy of conveyance to this chamber. It is worthy because it served to reinforce in my mind what I am doing here and why many of us are in fact here. All of the children from both campuses participated in the ceremony. They were welcomed by Principal Woolacott from Nicholls, Father Bernie blessed the congregation and we were joined by the Ngunnawal elders, who ratified the school's use of the land.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The themes the school adopted were `belonging', `friendship', `we are one', `tolerance', `sharing' and `learning without boundaries or barriers'. Each child had made an exquisite banner, while the walls of the hall were covered with bright murals of outstretched welcoming hands. The choir opened up with the national anthem and throughout the ceremony sang songs of peace and sharing. Their performance concluded with the song
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        The future of our children must be foremost in our minds—their health, education, security and, of course, happiness, their opportunity and their future. We cannot trust these things to the fancies of the market. To do so is to jeopardise the ability and responsibility we have as elected representatives to guarantee the best possible outcomes for our children.

        The depth of feeling this innocent school ceremony invoked not only in me but in most of those present reinforced in me the importance of government funded education—of public education. Show me a better investment of taxpayers' money. Show me a better way to ensure that our young people have the best chance of survival in a changing and

         challenging society. Some parents will have the choice between a public and private school. But most will not. Most will have to take what is given. If what is given is not as good as what you can purchase on the market, where does this leave the children? What if you are not earning enough to purchase the higher standard of education?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a dangerous path to tread for any socially democratic society. It will only serve to once again determine access to quality education on socioeconomic grounds. To reduce funding or compromise public education in any way will send us down this path. The Howard government is doing just that. This government will sacrifice the standard of public education to promote private education. They will steal almost $130 million from government schools to fund an expansion of non&amp;hyphen;government schools, providing huge incentives to middle-class parents to leave the state system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But will this expansion benefit children? Until now, new schools were approved after they had met educational and financial standards. These requirements will now be waived. Concerns have already been expressed that many new schools will be fundamentalist or run by narrow sects and interest groups. Now, schools that have been rejected before may, no matter what, get funding from this government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is an ideologically driven policy based on a misplaced notion of competition and level paying fields. And what about the children left behind? Have we no obligation to them? And what about the future for children in the new private schools? Under Labor we saw an increase in schools funding of 56.7 per cent in real terms. Under Howard we have already seen cuts to higher education of $2 billion, cuts to vocational education, cuts to recurrent grants for government schools—

        Holy Spirit Primary School and Nicholls Primary School have jumped many hurdles to get where they are today.

The expressions of sharing and reconciliation provide a powerful and pertinent contradiction to some of the narrow and introverted utterances that have attracted media attention recently and, as I have said, have served as a reminder of why we are here.

        At a meeting in Perth two weeks ago, he told the audience that he had become aware that an extensive body of data relating to literacy had remained unreported. He was referring to the Australian longitudinal surveys of Australian youth program. The minister went on to say on radio:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        Parents and educators across the country must have been overwhelmed by the minister's insight. Why did they not think of that! Before I indulge too much in sarcasm, I need to put on record the nature and the objectives of this study that the minister so cleverly uncovered.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian longitudinal surveys of Australian youth program is a study of 28,000 year 9 students which began in 1975. The main purpose of this program was to provide a better understanding of the process of young

         people's transition between education, training and work. It is made up of three components which together span a period of 20 years, and it is in fact not due to be published until 1997. I would be quite happy to supply the minister with further details of that program, but I can assure him that there is nothing secret about it. It certainly did not require the minister's intervention to prepare an analysis all of a sudden.

        As might be expected, Minister Kemp's revelation that 30 per cent of 14&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds in year 9 had not achieved basic literacy skills made the headlines elsewhere too. `No data on alarming literacy rates' said the

        Enthused by his own rhetoric, the minister announced that $12 billion is already enough to spend on teaching children to read and write. Bingo! Here we have it. The minister is preparing Australians, I believe, for the coalition's real intentions. This government wants to starve our public education system of funds to an even greater degree, I think, than the previous government did. And the minister wants to persuade Australians that the money is being wasted and that there is a conspiracy in schools to conceal this from parents. The minister said:

        As I have already pointed out, the study on which the minister bases his shameful pronouncements has not been concealed from parents for 15 years. Furthermore, it will come as some surprise to all the teachers I know, who spend many hours each term preparing extensive written reports and meeting with parents, that they are not only failing to report to parents but they are also hiding the truth. I suggest to the minister that nothing could be further from the truth. This government so often resorts to accusing the
        <break page="4700" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Democrats of scaremongering, but I ask: what is this if it is not scaremongering?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I said earlier that the minister has displayed his ignorance on education. If he were not the minister for schools, he could be forgiven for assuming that literacy problems are, firstly, easy to identify and define and, secondly, easy to remedy. In discovering the study, the minister imagines that he has defined the problem. He then goes on to give us his own version of literacy by defining it with a question: are our children learning to read?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister did not bother himself with detail. It is apparently of no consequence to him that the aspect of literacy on which the study concentrated is comprehension. The researchers of that study, the Australian Council for Educational Research, said that a failure in terms of literacy in this case meant `they have not achieved what is regarded as an 80 per cent satisfactory result on tests of reading comprehension'. Quite another matter, Minister Kemp, from just learning to read. The Australian Council for Educational Research warned in the study that the results were `based on a particular definition of competence and will shift as definitions are modified and as the requirements of society change'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is obvious to educators is that the demands on today's children are quite different from those made when Dr Kemp was at school. In fact, there is a substantial body of opinion which says that literacy standards are increasing. Dr Brian Cambourne, associate professor in education of the Centre for Studies in Literacy at the University of Wollongong says that, rather than a decline in literacy standards, data strongly supports a very different interpretation; namely, that, given the increase in the multicultural mix of students whose first language is not English, our schools and teachers have held the literacy line. If literacy standards were indexed like costs, wages and pensions, it would mean something like a 30 to 40 per cent increase in literacy ability over the last 20 years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the minister should do his homework. He should understand that the declining standards theory is a myth. He should also know that literacy is not a simple, easily
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         taught and easily tested mechanical skill. It involves getting together the ability to give meaning to situations, the ability to handle words to serve meaning, and the ability to process words by listening, speaking, reading and writing.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whatever problems there are in the literacy skills of our students, they will not be solved by simply forcing schools to timetable English instead of computer classes, physical education, art or any other subject. The problem is not, as the minister suggests, the result of a crowded curriculum.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not suggest that there is not a problem in our schools or that they are confined to government schools, but I do suggest that further cuts to funds for our public education system are not going to solve the problem.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Publishing literacy data school by school will do little more than frighten parents into shifting their children from school to school, and no doubt the government would prefer them to be shifted out of government schools and into private schools. Leaving aside the questions of usefulness and equity, the chaos that that approach would cause is reason alone to question the minister's judgment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        About the only useful headline which Dr Kemp's remarks have drawn were in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Herald&amp;hyphen;Sun
        </emphasis>
        . It said, `Gude hits Canberra over literacy cuts.' The Victorian education minister, whose views I often do not share, accused the federal government of extreme hypocrisy when it came to tackling literacy problems. In a stinging attack, the paper said:

       <para font-size="-=2">

        What was the minister's response? `At present Australia is spending about $12 billion of taxpayers' money on schools a year and most people in the community would think that that would be more than enough,' he said.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the minister did not say at that point and what the previous government has not said is that Australia already has an appallingly low level of spending on education. I suggest that to guarantee the best available education for Australian children is a fundamental obligation of any nation's government.

         —I rise on the adjournment debate tonight to canvass a number of issues in relation to this government's treatment of race issues. A number of people have commented that the response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to Pauline Hanson's first speech was racist. I don't think it was. It was not a racist response; it was simply a political response. The Prime Minister was doing what politicians often try to do; that is, have two bob each way. He did not get away with it, but the extraordinary thing is that he still continues to do it on almost a daily basis, as was evidenced just 24 hours ago by his statements on foreign aid.

        That is an extraordinary statement from a Prime Minister who just a short time ago was claiming that the election of his government gave a new birth to free speech in this country. Free speech apparently only lasted a month. I found this statement totally bizarre—all the more so when you consider it came from a man who has represented the seat of Bennelong in this parliament for more than 20 years; a man who just a few short weeks ago was so dismissive of the problems of the `stolen generation'.

         Captain Phillip designed a process by which he was going to do this by capturing an Aboriginal person forcibly and taking him away from his people. In December 1788 an Aboriginal man named Arabanoo was captured to be introduced to the `benefits of European civilisation'. Unfortunately, the first benefit Arabanoo was introduced to was smallpox from which he had the bad taste to die six months later.

         Captain Phillip then captured two other Aborigines, Bennelong and Colebee. Bennelong managed to escape in April 1790 and later that year he and Colebee were sighted in Manly. When Captain Phillip went to talk to them he was speared by another older Aboriginal. Bennelong, who had taken no part in the attack, began to appear frequently near Sydney Cove and, when assured he would not be detained, his visits became more frequent. A small brick hut was eventually built to house Bennelong and his family at Bennelong Point on the site now occupied by the Opera House of which the Prime Minister enjoys the best view in Australia from Kirribilli House across the harbour.

         This government, for example, has no empathy at all with Aboriginal Australia. Aborigines have been targeted by this government from day one. The central issue at the first cabinet meeting of this government in Canberra on 9 April and the first prime ministerial press conference in Canberra on 10 April was Aborigines and their alleged lack of accountability. After its failed attempt to gain power to sack the board and appoint an administrator and its bungled appointment of a special auditor, the government imposed savage cuts on inarguably the most dispossessed section of the Australian community.

          The devastating picture of these cuts is slowly emerging through the hearings of the finance and public administration committee.

With three&amp;hyphen;quarters of its budget effectively quarantined from cuts by the government, the ATSIC board was then left to do the government's dirty work.

But, even worse, he compounded the problem by then selectively quoting, and gleefully quoting, from a number of totally misleading and colourful newspaper reports to support his appointment of the Special Auditor.

All that we have heard is an attack on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and the Prime Minister clearly refuted that in the House today. He has made it abundantly clear that he is not racist, but we keep getting this allegation that, somehow or another, he is, by inference, racist in relation to the Aboriginal people of this country, and that is far from the truth.

        It is incumbent upon Mr Beazley to state his position, because he has been remarkably silent in this regard. One wonders whether it is because there is a certain amount of support for those statements within his own party. Why is he not coming out clearly and unequivocally in this matter? He gets his surrogate here in the Senate to make statements in this regard.

         —Well, his spokesman, if you wish. It is a term that is used. Then to compound it, for the life of me, Senator Collins has been pursuing this matter in relation to the Special Auditor. The allegations that came through to my office on my selection as minister came from Aboriginal people. As I go around the remote communities there is enormous criticism from people in remote communities, as I have said on the record, about a fire hose of money at one end and a trickle coming out the other. That is coming from remote community people. It is a spurious allegation to say that it is the government that is doing this. This is coming from remote community people who are making these allegations. Many of those allegations have been put forward. I will not repeat yet again the findings in the final report of the Special Auditor. Eighty&amp;hyphen;nine per cent were not in complete order—89 per cent, Senator Collins.

        In regard to these allegations about my comments in the estimates, I suggest that Senator Collins read carefully—get away from his obsession; get away from his demand that somehow I have misled the Senate—the

        . He needs to try to take the mote out of his eye and read it carefully. He will see that there has been no misleading. He has been pursuing this in question time consecutively. He is now doing it on the adjournment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Maybe he should ask somebody else—because he obviously does not have the capacity—to read the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        and understand it. Perhaps he can read it but perhaps not understand it. I would suggest somebody on his staff. Maybe it is somebody on his staff who is fuelling all this, and, Madam Acting Deputy President, this is the alternative government! These are issues of major moment that are going to bring down the government! If the opposition is ever going to get back into the game, then they have to start taking notice of things. We have a cattle industry crisis in this country, and the shadow minister for primary industries is carrying on with these issues.
