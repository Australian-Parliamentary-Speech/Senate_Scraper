If you look at the dividend figure of $1.368 billion, you find that is only about $74 million more than the implicit figure which we had budgeted for. In other words, there is a very minor increase.

         —Look, I know it is a bit simplistic and your approach does not readily lend itself to this sort of analysis, but there are two elements: one is the dividend payment and the other is the increase in corporate taxation. Senator Kernot was arguing that the increase in corporate tax was very significant because she said it was something like 76 per cent compared with 7.9 per cent last year. The fact is that that 7.9 per cent did not relate to Telstra. That is an overall increase in the level of corporate taxation and that disguises a multitude of ups and downs, pluses and minuses.

It is also very important to recognise that, because you are talking about the aggregate of contributions to revenue, there is no such thing as a windfall in this situation any more than there might be if BHP suddenly had a record result and increased funds were available. You cannot simply say, `Well, that means we got more than we expected; we can therefore spend that money.' You have to balance this out. You have to look at all the pluses and minuses, as I said in my release yesterday.

To the extent that the increase is due to an increase in its market share, then that is at the expense of its competitors. You may well argue that that means that their contribution to corporate taxes would be commensurately less. So there is no basis for saying that a one-off increase in the level of corporate taxation constitutes a windfall gain in this area any more than it does anywhere else.

        The same applies to the dividend payment. The dividend payment is substantially taken into account in the budget projections. In fact, we have already received 50 per cent of that figure announced last Friday. So that has already been factored in and received. The next amount will not be payable until December this year and that will then take account of the lag effect. That will be part of what was announced on Friday as well.

        You have to remember that about 90 per cent of the total increase in operating profit is due to an increase in revenue—about $1.1 billion—and efficiencies constitute less than 10 per cent. On that basis, you cannot possibly assume that this is anything other than a snapshot of the performance of one corporation at a particular point in time. It tells you nothing about next year and how it will perform then.

He did it again when he made a statement on Friday in relation to the opt&amp;hyphen;out provisions that the government has announced for very low income earners, so far as the superannuation guarantee arrangements are concerned, whereby, under the budget announcement that the government has made, someone earning between $450 and $900 a month will be able to opt out of the superannuation guarantee arrangements and instead receive, in lieu, wages to the equivalent amount.

        I would ask Senator Sherry: why is he so against letting Australian people make up their minds in this respect? Why is he so determined not to allow people choice? It is the old approach of Labor that the state knows better than the individual what is in the individual's best interest. That is one of the fundamental differences between this side of politics and your side of politics. That is one of the fundamental reasons why you were so comprehensively thrown out of office on 2 March.

        What was said at the press conference in the context of announcing the record profit result was that over the next two years there would be additional reductions in employment levels. There is nothing surprising about that. Indeed, as we know, between 1991 and 1994 Telstra reduced its work force by about the same level as we are now talking about—in other words, about 25,000 jobs. The unions themselves have conceded on a number of occasions that technology gains and productivity improvements will inevitably result in job losses—they have factored that into the equation. Both Ian McLean and Colin Cooper have said that—and both are from the CEPU.

        It is quite clear that there is also a need to address efficiency problems and, as I have indicated in relation to the announced figure the other day, only a very small proportion of that could be attributed to any gains in efficiency. And unless you get efficiencies in place, Senator Childs, through you Madam President, you will not be able to deliver the world&amp;hyphen;class service that we all want; you will not be able to get lower prices and better quality of service; you will not be able to get their access lines per employee up above 135 to the 200&amp;hyphen;plus that you get in New Zealand and even close to 300 for the RBOC.

        In other words, it is very important that Telstra is allowed to make commercial decisions. That is what the 1991 act is all about. It is not a matter of interfering and giving instructions; it is a matter of Telstra exercising its own sensitivity on these issues. Quite clearly, Telstra will be cognisant of the need to ensure that it is not simply reducing employment levels by head count and that it is doing it only in areas where it will contribute to the efficiency of the system and enable it to compete much more effectively after 1 July next year.

No&amp;hyphen;one gets any joy out of reducing labour in whatever sector it might be, but if there is one industry in which you would like to be if your job were at risk, it would be in a sector where the growth rate is about 18 per cent. The telecommunications industry is growing at that level and, as Ian McLean himself said, if jobs go from Telstra, they are likely to go to the private sector—in other words, you can confidently expect that there will be a huge demand for jobs from the telecommunications industry. That was said by SPAN and ATUG to the Senate committee. I am sorry that you chose to ignore that because it is very important evidence. To the extent that people are unable to be employed by Telstra, their prospects of being employed elsewhere are very good. And that is one of the great virtues of this industry and why you want to have as much efficiency as possible.

One which I can remind you about is the inherent conflict of interest in the government wanting to maximise revenue by way of dividends. You will remember what Paul Keating did when he was short of a quid. Basically, he went to them and demanded another $400 million or $600 million to plug his budget bottom line.

If you get efficiencies in the system then you have a capacity to deliver lower prices, better quality of services and increase the choice of products—all of those things that result from a lower cost structure. If your cost structure is too high your capacity to undercut your competitors is reduced and you end up with either a cosy duopoly or simply not a real contest. If you do have those efficiencies and you do have a private sector component you can, at the same time, overlay the rules and regulations that are important to ensure cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies, price caps, untimed local calls and consumer, customer guarantees.

         —I thank the honourable senator. I think all senators know her particular interest in health matters. Today is World Ozone Day. We recognise, really, one of the extraordinary achievements of the international community and that is efforts to stabilise ozone levels in the upper atmosphere and, ultimately, towards the year 2040 to reduce them. Ozone depletion, of course, leads to increased UV radiation which is in fact damaging to both the environment and to health.

In a release I put out earlier this morning, I mentioned the fact that the Olympic Stadium at Homebush is to include in its state&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;art design the use of passive ventilation to minimise the need for airconditioning. As with the Olympic Aquatic Centre, maximum use will be made of natural cooling and ventilation, and I think that that is a good example to other developers.

        Secondly, the MCG has just completed a program to eliminate CFC gas in all airconditioning and 70 major refrigeration units. Additionally, the MCG no longer uses foam cups made with CFCs. And the Sydney Cricket Ground has completed the replacement of CFC chemicals in all airconditioning plant and is in the process of replacing the chemicals in its smaller domestic refrigerators. So our industry is in fact showing a good example.

        Lastly, it must be remembered that, although the levels of UV radiation may have stabilised, they are still dangerously high. As we move into summer, it is important that all Australians realise that stabilisation is not good enough and that the UV levels are still extremely level. The warning then is to all Australians during summer to cover up.

We will be legislating for that. It will take effect from 1 July next year. All the details are contained in the budget and surrounding papers to which I refer Senator Sherry. It takes effect on 1 July 1997 as we promised during the election campaign, but it is of course only one of a range of measures that the government has taken to assist small business. We have applied, and we are applying, a similar exemption on relief from capital gains tax on the sale of a business for retirement. We have also reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, and we have taken a range of similar measures including in particular taking measures to get interest rates lower than they would otherwise have been through appropriate budget measures. That is probably the single largest policy approach that government could possibly take to assist small business.

First of all, the minister has had to break one of the major promises at the last election: ABC funding being maintained at current levels.

        The terms of reference make it quite clear that the government is after a reduced role for the ABC in public broadcasting. It does not want a broad comprehensive national broadcaster, a charter that had been adopted by this parliament in the 1980s. It was done before my time here but, as I understand it, it was done with genuine support from all sides that the ABC should have a charter to provide a comprehensive service. During the subsequent years, the previous government provided enough money—it is always not enough for some people in the ABC but it was more than adequate—for the ABC to extend its services. Triple J became a national network, there were extended new programs on ABC radio and several new networks were established. Money for TV drama went up. The money and resources were provided. The ABC was able to provide a broader range of services in accordance with its charter.

        Mr McDonald is now on the record as saying he supports the comprehensive charter of the ABC and he wants to protect it. He is concerned that the terms of reference of the Mansfield inquiry are going to undermine that comprehensive range of programs for the ABC. He has made it clear that he will fight to maintain the ABC as a comprehensive broadcaster. He points out the illogicality of having that review conducted on restricted terms of reference with the cuts already in place.

        The government has embarked on an ideological war to gut the ABC. It said it in the opening comments of the terms of reference of an inquiry into the ABC. The terms of reference state: `The government seeks a more focused role for the ABC.' Perhaps that more focused role for the ABC is part of the continuing attack by the Prime Minister and other ministers on the ABC. Those attacks continued as late as last week in the other place where the Prime Minister accused the ABC again of misrepresenting him and quoting him out of context.

        It was announced earlier in the year, long before the budget came out, that the ABC would receive cuts to the tune of $11 million and further cuts this financial year to the tune of $55 million—a gutting of the ABC. Over four years, that is going to amount to a total of $209 million, which no organisation, no matter how well it is run, can sustain in the short term without some dramatic changes to the services it is providing to the public. We are seeing already those services being cut back. But that is only the tip of the iceberg. It is going to happen more and more. Possibly even those services that are near and dear to the Deputy Prime Minister, the services that

        Also, very importantly, once these cuts that have been announced are in place and are hurting and depriving Australians of many services that the ABC was previously offering, there is a very comprehensive inquiry into the ABC, chaired by Mr Mansfield. That inquiry has so far attracted about 11,000 submissions. It was open for people to put forward their views only for a short period of time. As we all know in this place, people are very reluctant to put paint to paper, to put their views forward—

The cuts were imposed before the inquiry was established, before the chairman of the inquiry had an opportunity of taking evidence from people right around Australia on what the ABC ought to be about.

         —This afternoon, Senator McKiernan and Senator Schacht jumped up and told us how this government was taking away the work of the ABC as a general transmitter around Australia. I am glad Senator McKiernan mentioned what I was going to say. When your party was in government in 1994, without talking to anyone, without having any real inquiry, they took away the basic radio facilities in the Pilbara, the Kimberleys and the central desert of Western Australia—an area bigger in size than New South Wales. The only communication they had on any sort of radio was on VLW31—short wave transmitter.

        All that was needed was a lousy $2 million to replace a transmitter that was put in originally in 1936. Senator Bishop, having done union work in the far region, may have heard about this. Two million dollars was needed to replace that transmitter, but the previous government took the easy option; they just switched it off and left it off.

        The complaint originated from around your area, Senator McKiernan—from around Wanneroo. The old transmitter was interfering with television and FM radio in the Wanneroo area. When the complaint was made about the interference, what did the last government do? Instead of spending $2 million on setting up a new transmitter a bit further out so that it wouldn't interfere with services to people in Wanneroo, where Senator McKiernan lives—I do not know whether he works there, but he certainly lives there—and keeping the whole of the Pilbara on radio, the previous government arbitrarily switched it off and left it off. It wiped out transmission not only to the

In one fell swoop you undermined the confidence of the ABC and its employees, and the many hundreds of thousands of people in this country who rely upon the ABC, listen to it and support its independence. On page 98 of that report, again you stated:

I concede that it is probably wise to allow a little bit of leeway. But why is it that the shadow minister, Senator Schacht, with all of his resources and, as the minister pointed out during question time, with all the resources of the union movement that he has that he cannot get a submission in on time? I am disappointed to see that these sorts of special deals for special people are going on under our government.

        Why 11,000—which I think was the figure quoted—other Australians could get their submissions in by the required date, yet the Labor Party cannot, is a question that I think really requires some explanation from the shadow minister. Senator Schacht has had some difficulty, it seems, in getting his grasp on the portfolio. I am just a fraction concerned about this particular special treatment.

        I do think it is worth saying here and recalling that when the government was in opposition, when Senator Short and his colleagues were on this side of the chamber, they used to rail against the then Labor administration for missing deadlines and not complying with returns to order, even if it was only a matter of hours. Those senators who were in this chamber during the life of the previous government would know that that is the case. It is incumbent on the coalition, now that it finds itself in government, to explain why these deadlines are no longer important.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would want to see the government lift its game on this particular matter. This has been an extraordinarily sloppy and unimpressive performance on this return to order. The government did not comply with it when asked to by the Senate, took two months to organise itself and then, of course, failed to comply with all aspects of the return to order. Time and time again, Senator Short has to come in with even more threadbare and world weary excuses for not complying with these orders of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think we need an undertaking from the government that this approach to returns to order will not be repeated. As I have said previously in relation to these matters, the opposition intends to be very vigilant to ensure that the government does comply with the reasonable returns to order that are determined by this chamber.

       We oppose the proposed changes to Austudy living allowance, including the increase in the age of independence to twenty&amp;hyphen;five years. We seek your support in this matter. Tertiary Education will no longer be accessible to students from Rural and Regional areas of Australia. It is not only education that is expensive to these students, but living costs such as rent, which are not being considered. Tertiary Students fear that the Government no longer view Tertiary Education as a priority. We seek stability in the education  sector. We also oppose proposed increases in HECS and the introduction of upfront fees for some students. We believe that the proposed changes will be to the detriment of our educated and democratic society. We urge the Parliament to consider these points, keeping in mind that the future of thousands of families will be affected by these changes.

         RE: Changing of the Austudy Scheme into a Compulsory Loans Scheme
        </para>

         As a student at a tertiary institution in Australia, I would like to express my strongest objection to any moves to change Austudy and Abstudy into a compulsory loans scheme after one year as a grant for undergraduates.

         I already repay a significant amount of the cost of my education through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS).

         The prospect of coming out of university with two debts—HECS and Austudy—surmounting $20,000 is totally discouraging for me. And yet I value a tertiary education, and Austudy has given me access to this education.

        It is indeed a matter of urgency that we have this debate this afternoon. We have to do all in our power to force this government to think again about its ideological obsession with the privatisation of Telstra.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Bit by bit, the spurious arguments that this government has mounted month after month are being dismantled. No matter what the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, might say that Mr Blount is saying, the fact of the matter is that the government has relied on three main arguments to persuade us to allow it to sell Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, it has said that this will lead to an increase in public savings, but that has been debunked by this government's own National Commission of Audit. The commission rejected the cashflow based accounting method used by this government, saying that it does not give a true picture of its value.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, the government has told us time and time again that we need to privatise it because that will benefit consumers. It does not say that it means business consumers; it pretends that it is all consumers. But this argument too has been demolished by the simple fact that the government wants to bring forward legislation that will put in place regulation, because regulation—not privatisation—is the key to safeguarding consumer interests.

        But thirdly, and most of all, this government has relied very heavily on the argument of efficiency. That argument has been shot down over time, but particularly on Friday when Telstra told us that it has reduced its costs per line to eight per cent below the world average and that those costs are falling.

        Treasurer Costello said in question time in the other place today that I have made an error about my claim of a windfall. I do not believe that I have. I believe that, based on the year to year result announced on Friday, Telstra has contributed an extra $840 million in dividends and company taxes over what it did the year before. Yes, part of that has already been paid into Treasury coffers late last financial year, and now the rest will be paid. But it is more than was forecast in the budget—ask Tim Fischer—and that is the point.

        How much more Treasury will receive will depend on Telstra's half year statement after December. But the only way the Treasury forecast of 2.7 per cent dividend payment and the 7.9 per cent company tax payment could be met—the only way we could reach that forecast—is if there were a massive reduction in Telstra profitability over the next six months. Mr Blount said on Friday that this will not happen; Telstra investment will rise and its costs will fall. Is the minister predicting a massive slump for Telstra over the next six months, because that is the only way that this government's conservative estimates on forecasting can be met. Treasury has a very poor record on this, having underestimated company tax receipts for four years. It has also understated Telstra and Australia Post dividends for the last two years.

        Let us return to the efficiency argument. No matter what Senator Alston might say in his

         remarks to come, this government has lectured us ad nauseam on Telstra's inefficiencies. They have talked Telstra down month after month. I can quote Senator Alston on 6 May, when he said that the reason his government wanted privatisation was that `it forces efficiencies on the company'. Senator Short said on 7 May:

       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the matter of the efficiency of Telstra in public ownership. The fact is that Telstra has dramatically improved efficiency and productivity in recent years. A study coordinated by the Industry Commission last year found that Telstra had reduced its prices by 16 per cent in real terms since 1989&amp;hyphen;90 while doubling labour productivity, and that it has increased payments to government by more than 60 per cent since 1990&amp;hyphen;91. The Bureau of Industry Economics estimates that Telstra's total factor productivity, which measures both labour and capital productivity, grew at an average rate of 6.3 per cent between 1979&amp;hyphen;80 and 1993&amp;hyphen;94.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point is that these achievements are well above the national average and have been made at the same time as maintaining Telstra's community service obligations. If you look at some further facts from Telstra's announcement on Friday, you find that Telstra's unit costs have been cut by 10 per cent during the past financial year and are now eight per cent below the average for world telecommunications companies. These figures come from a cost efficiency benchmarking in a study by the consultant group Mercer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What about the other measures of success? There is a return on capital of 22.9 per cent and a return on assets of 17.9 per cent. These are both healthy indicators and we should remember, when dealing with the government's attempts to talk Telstra down and talking about after 1997, that BZW, allowing for a 20 per cent loss of market share, still says that Telstra will have an average profit
        <break page="3503" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para>
        I think that is fairly important to recognise. The quotes that Senator Kernot referred to, which presumably are from Alan Kohler's latest article, relate to the return on assets and the return on capital. They are not the most relevant indicators of efficiency. One needs to look at return on equity. Telstra could have done a lot better in that regard. Its return on equity was 17.9 per cent and world's best practice levels are much higher. Telecom New Zealand has a return on equity of 34 per cent and AT&amp;T has a return on equity of 35 per cent. In other words, it is almost double Telstra's return. If Telstra's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were as high as Telecom New Zealand then the bottom line would have increased by many billions. On it goes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It does not prove anything to argue that somehow, over the last six or so years Telstra has reduced prices, there has been an increase in payments to the government of 60 per cent or that the total factor productivity has gone up by an average of 6.3 per cent, which is well above the average in the economy, because we are dealing with a unique industry. Technological changes come along almost every second day and they have dramatic effects on the increase in productivity and performance. Cable modems are supposed, for example, to increase the rate of access for data by 100 times. Digital switching has made an enormous difference, as has optical fibre transmission.

        The government does not believe in intervention. You know what Labor was like. A few years ago they had to approve every press release that was put out by Telstra.

That is why you have regulation, but they ignore the regulation. They want to give directions.

That is what other countries do. That is why they all have their USOs. That is why they all have their variations on consumer protection arrangements.

Today, in trying to give the Senate an answer—which was gobbledegook at its worst—for over four minutes he tried to explain how $600 million increased profit, an increased dividend of several hundred million to the Australian government and increased taxes to the Australian government did not mean anything; there was no improvement.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Well, I do think Senator Alston is probably feeling a bit uncomfortable here. He has been arguing—and it's almost his only argument that's left—that Telstra has to be sold in order for it to become efficient, otherwise it will get trampled on by British Telecom and AT&amp;T. Well, clearly, Telstra is becoming efficient now, so that argument is falling over.
        </para>
        <para>
         The major argument to justify privatisation which this minister has put in this place for six months—that Telstra is an inefficient and unprofitable organisation—has now fallen over, says Alan Kohler.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another argument that has been put by some supporters of privatisation, including the minister, is that after 1 July next year there will be a much more open market in telecommunications, that other carriers will be able to start and that Telstra will not be able to beat all this extra competition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the Senate inquiry, those of us on the committee asked a number of people, including those in favour of privatisation, what they thought the future of Telstra would be post&amp;hyphen;July next year. Overwhelmingly, whilst they could not give an accurate figure to the last decimal point, they all conceded that Telstra would maintain its position as the dominant carrier—80 per cent of the market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the report which BZW produced earlier this year about Telstra—which the minister just quoted in his remarks—it said about the 1 July 1997 deregulated market:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         New carriers after July 1997 and the larger service providers in aggregate will take a gradually increasing share of the corporate, business, long distance and international markets (in the order of 5&amp;hyphen;10% over five years).
        </para>
        <para>
         On that figure Telstra would probably drop to just over 80 per cent of the total market. Then the report goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Telstra's own growth is likely to continue to exceed that of these players in aggregate.
        </para>
        <para>
         So BZW, in favour of privatisation, certainly made it clear that, despite the extra competition post&amp;hyphen;July next year, Telstra will still be growing stronger. Even though its percentage point of the marketplace may drop five or 10 per cent, as the market for telecommunications is growing—according to the evidence
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          we had before us in the inquiry, and no&amp;hyphen;one has disputed it—at about 15 per cent per annum, Telstra's revenues, turnover, profit, size, the value of its company, will go up accordingly. It will not diminish as a total company.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, despite new competition coming in, Telstra in the foreseeable future will be the dominant carrier. For ideological reasons, Senator Alston wants to hand that dominant carrier over to his mates in the private sector, including some foreign owners, to get their hands on the increasing profit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final thing I want to comment on is that in the annual results given last Friday it was said that, in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, Telstra has put aside $1.1 billion for redundancies. This is to help pay off the 22,000 people who will be leaving Telstra. Apparently in one year Telstra will be able to pay that amount of money. It may well reduce its profit for a year but, in the following year, all those people will be off the bottom line. Those people will no longer be a cost; therefore, there will be an extra billion dollars of profit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If that is the outcome the government wants, to reduce the costs in Telstra and to get rid of all of those workers, and there is going to be a big increase in profit accordingly, why can that profit not stay with all Australian people and go into the public revenues to be used in socially useful programs, including retraining programs for Telstra employees?

        Does the government really believe that public interest and international corporate interests are the same?

We can see this in the way they have linked this bill to short-term support of environmental programs while gutting recurrent funding for the environment. Clearly, this is a fairly crass approach with very little real integrity—ideological or otherwise.

        I would say that the continued push for the sale is evidence of the power of vested interests rather than ideology. Big business, Murdoch, Microsoft or Intel, would like us to sell Telecom. It is in their interest. And, yes, they have a global influence.

        It is clearly not a decision based on economics. The economics show that Telecom is being operated very profitably, thank you.

        So, if we have a profitable, efficient company operated by government in a fairly accountable way, where is the economic advantage in selling this company and destroying the income stream?

So it is not an economic decision.

John Howard, or from my honourable colleague here with me today Senator Alston. They are actually quotes from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. They are his quotes on the whole issue of privatisation which one could find fairly breathtaking, given what we have just heard from the shadow minister for communications. Labor is now in opposition and opposed to privatisation.

        But I want to move on to the important area of employment, because Labor is just as hypocritical in that area. Of course that quote from Mr Beazley did in fact say that `privatisation fits in with the government's broader imperative to create jobs'. So there we have another quote from Mr Beazley about creating jobs, yet right throughout the Telstra inquiry and this debate today we have had both of the opposition parties trying to create an impression that jobs are just going to disappear.

        Four myths have in fact been perpetuated throughout this debate. One is that the government's partial privatisation policy is responsible for employment reductions in Telstra. Wrong! The second one is that employment reductions must be accompanied by industrial action. That of course will happen only if the Labor Party and the Democrats continue to wind up the unions, who themselves have admitted that job losses are not about the privatisation issue but about technological change. Those are the quotes that are coming directly from the trade unions associated with the Labor Party and associated with the telecommunications industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third myth is that employment throughout the telecommunications industry will disappear. It is clearly not so according to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         those professionals in the telecommunications area who gave evidence to the committee only a couple of months ago.

        The fourth myth is that partial privatisation will reduce employment in regional areas. If that is so, why was it that so many people from country areas gave us evidence to the contrary? Why is it that so many people in country Australia want to see the partial privatisation of Telstra so that they can get more telecommunications services and facilities into rural and regional Australia?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Employment levels in Telstra continue to fall, and will continue to fall for some time, from back when the Labor Party were in government. Let us not forget that the Labor government scrubbed out about 23,000 jobs in Telstra. That is virtually the identical number that we are talking about now. Did they quibble about it? Did they quibble about the jobs in the Commonwealth Bank when they privatised it? Did they quibble about jobs when they were talking about the privatisation of CSL or Qantas? No! The question arises only when they are now in opposition and there is to be partial privatisation of a government instrumentality. Here it is—and it is different!
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Actual staffing numbers are fully determined not by the government but by the Telstra board and management as part of the corporate planning process. Employment levels in Telstra are an outcome of corporate planning—not of government policy—and that corporate planning takes into account customer demand; the requirements for capital investment in network development; productivity, including the effects of technological changes; financial performance; investment opportunities; and likely market behaviour by competitors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Technology in particular, as I said before, is reducing employment levels in telecommunications companies around the world. The Queensland Branch Secretary of the CEPU acknowledged, in his evidence before the Senate inquiry, its effect on employment. When asked by Senator Tierney whether those job losses in Telstra are primarily driven by technology, Mr McLean responded:

        Yes. The major driver is technology.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        On the figures that have been put to us, we have agreed in some areas that there can be staff reductions. We have been through all these processes with new technology.

       <para>
        To listen to the debate today and what has been said in the months that have preceded it, one would believe that this has come about only because of the whole notion of the partial privatisation of Telstra. The fact is that Telstra remains uncompetitive in a number of areas. If the Labor Party and the Democrats are happy to make sure Telstra remains uncompetitive, they can continue on this frolic that they have been on for some time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They can also continue on the frolic of perpetuating these myths, such as that employment reductions must be accompanied by industrial action. But that will happen only if the Labor Party and the Democrats continue to encourage such industrial action. I was unaware that the Labor Party had encouraged such industrial action when they made privatisation moves when in government. The staff reductions went largely unnoticed by most of the community because they occurred without significant industrial disputation and primarily through voluntary redundancies.

Have a look at the evidence that a number of people gave the committee about the employment prospects for people in the industry who might lose their jobs. You are saying that sustainable employment throughout the telecommunications industry will disappear. That is simply not true, and you know it to be not true. Mr Horsley of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group said:

        Let me make the point that the industry is desperately short of people. We cannot find them—we put ads in the paper and our members are looking for people and cannot find them . . . Our experience has been that there is substantial demand for employment and if changes . . . in Telstra result in fewer employees, those employees will pick up work, without a doubt, outside.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I can sit before you today and say that, in the company and amongst SPAN members, we have a great deal of trouble finding suitably qualified staff. I think that many of the people that will come out of Telstra as a result of this will certainly find employment within the telecommunications industry.

        These people are having difficulty finding staff, yet the Labor Party continues to say that there are no employment opportunities for those who lose their jobs.

        The fourth myth, that partial privatisation will reduce employment in regional areas, is just that—a myth. The spread of sustainable employment opportunities to hybrid telecommunications industries will not stop there. It will affect the entire economy. The telecommunications industry is very important in rural and regional areas. Many industries have shown they are able to grow and develop in rural and regional areas throughout the world, and that could translate here. For example, in the United States large companies have relocated functions such as airline reservations and insurance processing to rural areas where there are lower rental charges. It provides job opportunities at lower costs and with greater housing availability. And those jobs will be picked up. To say otherwise is completely and utterly false.

         —This debate indicates that, as a result of the decisions that were announced by the Telstra board on Friday, without any doubt Telstra is far too valuable to sell. The proposition we have before us highlights that this government's ideological obsession with the market and with the destruction of this public enterprise is based on one proposition: if it is in the public sector, it is bad; if it is in the private sector, it is good.

         The results on Friday indicate the complete total nonsense that that proposition involves. One of the biggest profits ever in this country was announced: a 31 per cent increase in the profits of Telstra and a return to government of $1.36 billion. It clearly indicates above all that the proposition to sell Telstra is essential ly based on a wrong assumption. There is no empirical evidence to support the conclusion that Australians would be better off, that Telstra would be better off, or that in any way this country would be served, by the proposition that is being advanced by this government. This clearly indicates that the wheels are very much falling off the government's cart in terms of its proposition to privatise Telstra.

What an obscenity that is! What an obscenity it is to suggest that, in this era of high unemployment, we can put to our public enterprises that they have no social responsibility and that they should move forward with a program based on headcount figures—ideological assumptions about the costs of the telecommunications service—to remove some 22,000 Australians from the employment of Telstra.

The union has indicated again and again that we see that technology can be used to reduce the tyranny of distance. It can be used to produce an economic advantage for regional Australia.

        We see the minister saying, `Let us have a look at the world best practice.' And what do we notice in regard to the financial performance of Telstra? The committee report makes it very clear. We see in terms of profit—the pretax return on capital, return on investment—that the Australian result is 22 per cent. The world best practice is over 20 per cent, so on that measure Telstra is above world best practice. On interest cover, it is well over world best practice, and on debt ratios, return on average equity and profit margin. It is all detailed in the report. Instead of trying to talk down the achievements of this company, you would expect this government to be talking about what real achievements are being made by Australians and what is one of Australia's and potentially one of the world's great companies. We should also appreciate the contribution it is making to Australian society.

        The minister constantly talks about the situation in America for a comparison with overseas companies.

So not only do we see cuts in jobs, cuts to

        Look at US West—that great comparison—which has one of the most notorious employment and customer service records in the United States.

By the end of 1993 that number had fallen to 9,000. It is now down to 4,500. A similar experience occurred in New Zealand, where the number of employees has been cut in half. International experience tells us again and again that there will be a loss of jobs, a loss of community service, a loss of customer service. This model is being pursued by the government.

We heard clear and convincing evidence from experts—not from amateurs—that such a change as the part&amp;hyphen;privatisation of Telstra will lead to an easier access to capital, create greater motivation for staff, benefit consumers on costs and services, and improve efficiencies of Telstra to better achieve world best practice.

         The nub of this debate is the way in which a more efficient Telstra, through the private injection of capital, can improve services and drive down costs. The very flimsy arguments that we have had today, which have centred on the fact that Telstra now has a large profit, miss the whole point of what is happening in the area of telecommunications in this country. In the next year, we are going to be moving to a regime where a number of companies are involved. Already AT&amp;T and Sprint are saddling up to become part of this market.

         We need a much more efficient Telstra. They have made great profits; that is terrific. But by Telstra's own admission, they are 25 per cent off the pace. If they are competing with AT&amp;T and Sprint as well as Optus, they cannot afford to be 25 per cent off the pace. They make great profits, but they also have huge amounts of capital. Only the more efficient operations that will come from a partly privatised Telstra will bring about a situation where we have a great Australian communications company which can not only survive but also compete in the international marketplace.

         —This motion is not about the principle of trading across issues. This motion is about whether we should privatise one-third of Telstra. Senator Alston's arguments, to me, seem to be summed up as these: we should privatise Telstra because the economic cheer squad says we should; we should privatise Telstra because everybody else is doing it; and, we should privatise Telstra because there is no role for government in a strategic industry like telecommunications. I ask Senator Alston: who is this economic cheer squad? They mostly speak for business—let's be frank about this—and some of them have a vested interest in the outcome because of
         <break page="3514" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          their companies' links with Telstra and future pay television scenarios.

        On the idea that we should do it because everybody else is doing it, the fact that lemming-like we must do what everybody else is fashionably doing these days—even Cuba and Albania: what about Cuba and Albania? Do we want to emulate their health care systems, for example, Senator Alston or do we just pick off telecommunications in this instance? Privatisation is economic fashion. It does not take account of Australia's demography, geography and history on this matter.

       <para first-indent="16">
        On the matter of ideology, the ideology that I think underpins the privatisation debate of the coalition government is that, first, the private sector always, no matter what, does everything better. I invite you to look at the recent example of the private sector running of the Olympic Games and the fact that the Sydney Olympic Organising Committee says, `Never again; it didn't work properly.' It is kind of like the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Animal Farm
        </emphasis>
        argument: four legs good; two legs bad. This is ideological obsession. The second argument is that the private sector has a greater right to profits and the third ideological argument is that the public sector under no circumstances can be efficient and profitable. This motion seeks to demonstrate otherwise. There is a role for government in strategic industries.

        I am asking the Senate to vote for this motion today in order to tell the government to think again; to put Australia's interests first; to congratulate a publicly owned company which is both efficient and profitable and which is doing well on behalf of all the Australians who currently own it. I want to ask this government to stop trying to flog off any of it to any other domestic or foreign owners. I ask all senators to acknowledge that the only argument left is that of blind ideology. They should remember that, on 2 March, 56 per cent of Australians voted for those parties which are opposed to the partial privatisation of Telstra. This government should not claim false mandates.

         —On 12 September, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the Hon. Warwick Smith, and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Shane Stone, announced the appointment of a new Administrator of the Northern Territory to commence in February of next year. I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the role that has been played by the now retiring administrator, the Hon. Austin Asche AC, who was appointed as Administrator of the Northern Territory on 1 March 1993.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Austin Asche has become a territorian of significant and special note not just because of his appointment, and his tenure and term as administrator, but because of a very distinguished career. Due to a family connection, I am very pleased to be associated with Austin Asche in many respects. My late father, Ern Tambling, was the schoolteacher of Austin Asche in Darwin, Northern Territory, in the 1930s when Austin Asche was there with his family and was then a school student working naturally for my father. Austin Asche has often made the point that my father was one of the people who inspired him with regard to his education and much of his future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Certainly, Austin Asche, in the fields of the law and in education and community service, has stood out as a very eminent Australian.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Austin Asche served for many years at the bar and as a QC. He certainly had a very distinguished career as a judge, both in family law and as Chief Justice of the Northern Territory, for a number of years.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have commented on his position as an educator. In fact, he has had the distinguished positions of president of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and chancellor of two universities—Deakin University and the Northern Territory University. He has made contributions in law and education and in far too many community service groups to properly name and do credit to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the last few years, in his position as Administrator of the Northern Territory, I can only say that he has done the Northern Territory proud. He has been an administrator who has moved around the entire Northern Territory constantly, hosted hundreds of functions in various capacities, particularly at Government House in Darwin, and who has acted as an emissary for the Northern Territory in other states of Australia, particularly in a number of official visits to Indonesian provinces. He will certainly be missed in the role that he has played.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        His role as administrator has been complemented by that of his wife, Dr Valerie Asche, who for many years worked for the Menzies School of Health Research, also in Darwin. She has also, as a very well qualified person, made a great contribution in the fields of health and community service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I know that it will be difficult for the administrator designate to replace Austin Asche, but Dr Neil Conn AO, the current Under&amp;hyphen;Treasurer of the Northern Territory, has been appointed. From my personal friendship and professional relationship with him, I know that Dr Neil Conn and Mrs Lesley Conn will make a wonderful couple to replace the Asches at Government House in Darwin.

          Games. He came from Goulburn, close to this place, and represented Australia at three Olympic Games—1928, 1932 and 1936. In 1936—in some senses, the infamous Olympic Games at Berlin—he was given the honour of leading the Australian team into the arena and carrying the flag.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Dunc Gray, in recent years, got considerable publicity—and quite rightly so—for being Australia's oldest living gold medal winner. I do not have the actual figures, but I would think there are probably no more than about 50 Australians, in 100 years of Olympic Games, who have won gold medals—and Dunc Gray was one of them. At the Olympics in Los Angeles in 1932, I think he was one of only two gold medal winners for Australia. I may not have that absolutely correct, but we certainly did not win as many gold medals as we recently won in Atlanta.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Dunc Gray, whom I never had the honour to meet, but I did see him on a number of occasions in recent years on television programs and in newspaper articles, struck me as the quintessential Australian sportsperson. Looking at photographs of him as a cyclist in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he was certainly a very handsome and fit young man—the sort of image I think most of us who were not ever able to be as athletic as he was aspired to in the way we looked and conducted ourselves in an athletic way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also note that in recent times, despite being in his very late 80s, he was always quick and sharp with his comments and still had a great interest in a range of issues. I think he clearly was a great Australian.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was taken by some remarks he made just over two years ago when at a function to promote the Olympic Games. He was at a function with the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Before Mr Keating was able to say anything, Dunc Gray expressed a few views that some might find controversial, but I was struck by them. He insisted on expressing these views to everybody at this function—at which several hundred were present—as the oldest Olympic gold medallist. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If we want to be Australians, we must have our own flag.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        Dunc said that as he reached into his inside pocket and handed out a sketch of his favourite design to Mr Keating. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When I won the gold medal at the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, they put the Australian flag up to the masthead and you could only see the Union Jack.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Then they played God Save the King and I wondered who was I riding for.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a later interview on Channel 9 he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        They presented the medals, they hoisted the flag to the mast and so on. Then they played God Save the King and they had a great big Union Jack on the Australian flag and I thought, `Oh my God,' as I was walking across, `who do I ride for, England or Australia?'
       </para>
       <para>
        It is somewhat ironic that four years later he still carried the flag which he made those comments about into the Olympic Games in Berlin.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to pay tribute to Dunc Gray for having the courage to express what some people would say would be controversial views. I also think it ought to be noted that as a gold medal winner he is in a very strong position to make a comment which I do not think many of us could in any way disparage even if we disagree with it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He has won a gold medal. He has stood on the podium as the flag has been put up on the mast in front of thousands of people at the velodrome in Los Angeles. He has heard
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         God save the King
        </emphasis>
        being played, but now that has been changed. Of course, he has marched, holding that flag, into the Berlin Olympic Games.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So I do not take his remarks as being in any way critical of, or disloyal to, Australia but as indicating that at the age of 87 he was able to show that he had moved on and still could remember some of what he considered the incongruity of having a symbol that to him was not quite clearly Australian.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think that is the real point. Dunc Gray was a quintessential Australian who, even in the 1930s, long before it became a matter of even public controversy, was willing to consider that maybe this country did need to have its own national anthem, which we now have, and ultimately our distinctive flag that is clearly and unambiguously Australian. Irrespective of those controversial remarks, I
        <break page="3518" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         want to pay tribute to a very great Australian who has done great honour to this country and has been a representative of whom we can all be proud.
