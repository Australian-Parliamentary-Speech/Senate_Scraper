         —I oppose the proposition regarding the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill. This issue has arisen essentially as a result of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) indicating that he wishes to reintroduce the concept of private roads attracting eligibility for infrastructure bonds. This is despite the fact that, on 15 December, the former Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the former Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) indicated that such roads should be exempt from future consideration.

         That action was taken after considerable public debate and discussion. As a result of that debate and discussion, attempts were made to address what is a quite significant policy imbalance in so far as it was discovered that the use of infrastructure bonds for private road development had in fact led to significant uneconomic actions being taken. Distortions were occurring in the use of these bonds in such a way as to render the public purse much lighter. In a most inefficient way they were producing a result which was of enormous benefit to a limited number of developers but of great cost to the public who had to use these facilities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The City Link project in Melbourne is the most obvious example. There is also the case of the M2 freeway in Sydney where similar sets of arrangements occurred under conservative state governments. These infrastructure bonds were used to feather the nests of their friends in the private sector, and legislation was introduced—in the case of Fahey and Kennett—using these infrastructure bonds to basically fleece the public of New South Wales and Victoria in such a way as to produce quite extraordinary outcomes for their friends but very limited benefits for the public of Sydney and Melbourne.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of City Link, with which I am most familiar, an analysis of the City Link contract and state legislation detailed at least 66 ways in which the Victorian state government would provide financial assistance, guarantees and compensation for the Transurban consortium. An analysis demonstrated that the Victorian government had effectively underwritten the City Link project while publicly seeking to give the impression that the Transurban consortia would carry the commercial risk that one could reasonably expect to be associated with such a project.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In that case, a project which should cost $1.2 billion for construction—and one may argue about the benefits and merits of the particular project—in the end will cost some $8 billion in terms of repayment costs. That is as a result of a secret contract entered into between the Victorian government and Transurban with the effect that over a 34&amp;hyphen;year period there would be guarantees of profits in
         <break page="2524" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          such a way as to produce results whereby the average motorist using those facilities would be paying, in today's terms, $1,500 per year.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The state government undertook to provide direct and indirect assistance to the project to the extent that the effective risks would be transferred to Victorian taxpayers which, in my judgment, is quite contrary to the spirit and guidelines of the development allowance arrangements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The state government provided City Link with a risk premium and effectively guaranteed Transurban a massive profit at taxpayers' expense to be enjoyed over the 34&amp;hyphen;year life of this project. The state government strategy in this regard minimises Transurban's risk exposure. That should also be measured with such things as their so&amp;hyphen;called agreed `traffic measures' which the former Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, described as a `state scandal' and a `policy obscenity' for corralling Melbourne motorists onto toll&amp;hyphen;roads to be fleeced like sheep by the private sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This strategy involved: providing $300 million directly for associated infrastructure works; various exemptions from state measures; the legal enforcement of tolls; indemnification against interest rate rises; and protection and immunity from prosecution on a range of civil laws such as environmental laws in such a way as to undermine the rights of citizens who also had to share the Melbourne environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The compensation provisions of such contracts and legislation made the state liable in an extraordinary range of circumstances to pay Transurban compensation for such things as changes in Commonwealth and state policy. For example, they made sure that the consortia would be exempt from the application of various federal and state laws on the pain of substantial compensation to Transurban if such laws were introduced by either a federal or state government over the 34&amp;hyphen;year life of this project. These changes also included a carbon tax, any conservation or other measures deemed to affect the revenues of the consortia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          As I read the arrangements entered into, clause 2.9 on page 296 of the City Link act provides 35 circumstances in which Trans urban may claim compensation from the state—35 circumstances in which so&amp;hyphen;called private developers undertaking a private project could claim compensation from the people of this country. That could only lead one to conclude that the actions taken were, essentially, anti&amp;hyphen;competitive and, in my view, quite clearly in breach of the spirit and intent of the development authority allowances.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The anti&amp;hyphen;competitive nature of the City Link project can be seen in a whole range of measures introduced by the state government in support of the project which can be clearly demonstrated to ensure a monopoly on: freight transport through linking the docks with the Melbourne airport; the closure of roads; road narrowings; and the removal of ancillary roads which are currently designated as clearways—Footscray Road, Swan Street, Toorak Road, Alexander Avenue, Batman Avenue, Boundary Road and Flemington Road—all of which are designed to reduce the capacity of alternative routes to the City Link project. Recently, the Commonwealth spent some $23 million upgrading Footscray Road—all that work will be undone as that road is to be narrowed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The One Nation package indicated significant improvements to transport movement in Melbourne. In Victoria the state government has acted to protect a particular consortia close to government. The infrastructure bonds are being used to protect that project and undermine the policy initiatives taken by the national government in other ways.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have seen prohibitions on the upgrading of public transport and parallel roads, which of course would compete with the City Link project. We have seen the prospect of compensation having to be paid if the state government were ever forced to provide a rail link, both a light rail or a heavy rail to carry freight. Such a prospect undermines the anti&amp;hyphen;competitive nature of such contracts which go to the heart of these bonding arrangements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have also seen the way in which these anti&amp;hyphen;competitive actions have been designed to funnel traffic onto City Link. Rather than clearing the streets of Melbourne and improving its traffic flows, it will in fact lead to traffic chaos.

        <break page="2525" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          This project will also affect access to various public institutions such as: the children's, the Royal Melbourne and women's hospitals along Flemington Road; various sporting facilities; the sports and entertainment precinct on the Yarra; the national rail depot, the development of which this parliament has extended considerable funds to; and the freight terminals in Footscray Road. Access to all these facilities will be directly compromised as a result of the state government's actions on this particular project.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For these reasons, in December last year the then Labor government, in a press release issued by the former Treasurer and the former Minister for Transport on 15 December, indicated that urban road projects would not be eligible for infrastructure bonds in the future. Yet in the most sneaky, underhanded way this government has tried to introduce infrastructure bonds in a most provocative manner—and attribute motive to those of us in the Australian Labor Party who have campaigned hard against these issues for some time in the interests of the constituencies that we represent. This government has tried to re&amp;hyphen;introduce these sordid arrangements, these `policy obscenities' as they have been described.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have seen that projects, such as the advice coming to the government through the Economic Planning Advisory Commission and the private infrastructure task force, are quite clearly an uneconomic use of resources. They are policy distortions which seek to lock in governments for a protracted period in such a manner as to line the pockets of private developers at the expense of the public. It is abundantly clear that such projects ought to be undertaken by the public sector, which can do the job much more effectively, much cheaper and much more efficiently.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we see on the other hand is an ideological obsession by this government to protect its mates by ensuring that the resources of this country are transferred from the public benefit to the private benefit. When that happens, a very limited number of people are able to enjoy the benefit. To make sure they enjoy that benefit, the government is
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           using the state apparatus to undermine the capacity of ordinary citizens to defend their rights. They are taking from people the right of legal protest, the right of legal appeal and the right to compensation.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government then says that the federal parliament should support such actions by allowing infrastructure bonds, such as these, to be put at the disposal of these shysters. It seems to me that that is a totally inappropriate use of the infrastructure bonds, and that is a position that was recognised by the previous Labor government. In that context, it is a proposition that I very strongly supported at the time and it is a proposition that I still support.

        I have to say at the beginning that this legislation is our legislation, and we are supporting it. We supported it last year when we introduced it into parliament. We supported it in this place when we granted it exemption from the Hill motion, which would have delayed its consideration until the next session. We then voted for the bill after a brief debate.

        So this is another example of a breathtaking new turn by the coalition. As usual, they opposed a Labor initiative when they were in opposition for plain, base political reasons. Then, when they came into government, they had another look at it and thought that the Labor government was correct. Without any recognition of their past perfidy or any apology for their past performance, they have turned around and are now claiming that we are holding the process up. We are getting used to this sort of weird behaviour from the government.

        I wish to say a few things about the word `sabotage'. Sabotage was a word introduced into this debate by Senator Short. It comes from him. I have to say that this debate is getting nasty and vicious. I have in front of me a report from Mr Sharp, the Minister for Transport, which attacks the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). He said that a move to block tax breaks for urban road projects would cause `more deaths on Australian roads'. They were his words. If he said that outside this place, I think that would be actionable, because it is untrue and has no other purpose than to attack the reputation of an individual.

        I want to say something about this claim of sabotage, a claim which I have to say is patently absurd. How exactly is the opposition threatening these investment projects? Apparently, this is by supporting—not opposing—the extension of the development allowance retrospectively to those projects.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We in the opposition identified the problem in the first place. We introduced the legislation. The coalition refused to pass it before the election and now we are supporting the consequentially reintroduced legislation. The only way in which any project is being threatened is if the government—or more specifically in this case the Treasurer—refuses to enact its own legislation. Is this what the government is proposing? If so, it should admit that this is the situation and stop raising red herrings against the Senate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second point that I want to make is this: does the government really believe that huge investments are going to cease or not proceed on the basis of the qualification for the development allowance? If so, Senator Short should state exactly which projects will be affected and the amount of development allowance that each project will be denied if the government—not the opposition or the Senate—refuses to enact this bill. Let us get the facts out. Do not make allegations. Put them down clearly where we can see which ones would be stopped, Senator Short.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Does the government honestly contend that a taxation concession of less than $10 million per annum spread across the whole economy is going to threaten the viability of $2.5 billion worth of projects? We must also remember that the legislation is retrospective. It applies back to the beginning of 1993, that is, 3&amp;half; years ago. In addition, not only will the bill benefit those who have given their applications to the authority but also those who have withdrawn their applications because they thought they were not eligible, that is, those firms that thought they were not eligible and did not apply.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         Did they abort their projects or did they simply carry on anyway? We believe that the latter is the truth. That is not to say that we will deny these firms fair treatment under taxation law, but let us not believe the fabrication that this is crucial to the survival of $2.5 billion worth of projects. If that were the case, it would mean that, even if all of the concessions of this bill were granted to these projects, it would amount to an alteration in the rate of return on $2.5 billion capital figure of around 0.4 per cent. If such a small  change made the projects non-viable, I doubt that investors and financiers would have risked their capital in investing in them in the first place.

         However, having said all that, I repeat that the opposition supports this bill. It had its genesis in our term of government, and it continues to have our full support. Any failure to enact it arises purely because of the lack of judgment of the Treasurer. The main reason that this bill is back here is the attitude of the government to amendments moved by Senator Kernot. These were good amendments because they implemented the policy of the previous government announced by former Ministers Willis and Brereton on 15 December last year.

          There is therefore no strong `tax efficiency' case for retaining infrastructure bonds which indirectly provide a tax benefit to some private projects. The bonds have provided an incentive to lenders to infrastructure projects and this has served a useful catalytic role. However, the development of the capital markets largely removes the ongoing need for such concessions. Accordingly, the Task Force does not see a compelling case for retaining infrastructure bonds in the longer term.
         </para>
         <para>
          That is EPAC in its private infrastructure task force report. The government's own Commission of Audit report has criticised taxation concessions as inefficient and generally undesirable relative to specific outlays measures. Page 295 of the `Charter of budget honesty' reads:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The different budgetary processes that apply to tax concessions and expenditure programs in Australia have contributed to the lack of transparency of tax expenditure reporting.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          First, spending on tax concessions is not monitored to the same extent as spending on programs. Treasury noted in its submission to the Commission that it can be three years before a tax expenditure is fully costed.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Second, consideration of tax concession proposals is hampered by the general difficulty of accurately costing them. This difficulty stems in part from the lack of resources devoted to monitoring tax concessions compared to those devoted to monitoring programs, and the consequent insufficient level of information about tax expenditures.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Third, unlike tax concessions, control of program expenditure is enhanced by individual Ministers being held responsible for spending by their portfolio.

          As a result of all these factors, tax concessions are a largely non-transparent form of assistance. This lack of transparency makes less visible the effect of tax concessions on the budget and reduces accountability. It also increases the likelihood that poorly targeted concessions will remain on offer.

          There is the further question of the concession being misused in financing structures which yield very high returns for investors at least partially at the expense of ordinary taxpayers.

          There is a further canard from the transport minister. As I said, he is claiming quite outrageously that the failure to reinstate the tax concession would cause more deaths on Australian roads. On that basis, the minister will be guilty himself if the Commonwealth reduces any road funding, which appears likely given the announcement that the Commonwealth will cut tied aid to the states by around three per cent this year.

          In addition, the Commonwealth has already welched on the general purpose funding arrangements put in place by us last year.

         —There has been a lot of muddying of where we started on this Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill and what the government has to act on. The Senate passed the government's request to amend the Development Allowance Authority Act to extend one of the tax concessions controlled by the authority to a group of applicants whose companies had restructured since the applications for the allowance closed in 1992. The Senate said, `Yes, go ahead'. Then the Senate moved an amendment to restrict access to another tax concession controlled by the same authority—the infrastructure borrowing concession.

        I was astonished when Senator Short said that we should not have done that because we knew the government would not accept it; we were very naughty because we are only allowed to move amendments that the government will accept.

        The government had some choices. They could have chosen to accept the Senate amendment. That would have had the effect of allowing the development allowance to be claimed by those 40 firms—which, I might add, have not managed to get their developments off the ground in three years—and it would have re&amp;hyphen;closed the outrageous tax rort on infrastructure borrowings which should not have been opened up again by this government. Those are choices. That would have been a good result. We would give a kick along for development and actually give a kick up the pants to the rorters they are seeking to assist.

Senator Short is pointing the finger and apportioning blame; he needs to look at his own actions. Given the rhetoric of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) over the last few weeks, it was an outrageous and bad public policy decision to seek to reinstate this concession.

Let's integrate them with public transport options; let's take the advice of EPAC.

Some are insisting that we require the taxpayer to provide a subsidy for what certainly the Greens believe is a very damaging development in Australia's planning. In other parts of the world, where they have clearly gone too far in the way of providing roads for every car that seems to want to go on the road, they have realised that bit by bit they have destroyed the amenity of their cities. They have destroyed the safety and the social and physical climates of their cities and, basically, the cities do not work very well any more. Now what is happening on a massive scale in places like the United States—certainly in parts of California—is that they are trying to reclaim their cities.

        Let me just comment on the comments that have been made today. It is quite clear from the comments that we have heard from Labor—from Senator Cook and Senator Carr—and from Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts that, basically, the debate has not been about this bill; it has really been about philosophical and ideological views about the development of roads, and the balance between road development—which is basically for private transport—and public transport. I think Senator Carr's contribution to this debate was heavily underlaid by that. That is the first point I would make.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second point I make is that much of what has been discussed up to date is really irrelevant to this bill because the decisions about whether roads go ahead and the nature of road projects are a matter for state governments. They have nothing to do with the federal government as such. The decision of whether you have a City Link, an eastern distributor or some other road project is a matter for state decision. That has always been clear.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me say a couple of things about the road projects that have been mentioned, and I will also come to the EPAC report. So far as City Link is concerned—and Senator Carr waxed very eloquent in opposition about it—the fact is, as Senator Carr is well aware, that the application for the development allowance provisions for the City Link project was given the tick by the then Treasurer Ralph Willis last year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition can go on as much as they like about the City Link project, but it was their government that saw the City Link project eligible for the development allowance. The Victorian Auditor-General, who I think is universally regarded as pretty independent, Mr Baragwanath, gave the City Link project and the matters relating to it a pretty favourable tick in his review of the project.

         Senator Cook asked me about providing information on applicants for the development allowance. A list of development allowance projects is not available, because part 4 of the DAA Act requires the development authority on request to keep details of applications confidential. As release of project names could identify applicants and commercial&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen; confidence information, typically only aggregated data is released. However, details of projects are released after the approvals have been finalised and the applicants agree to it. So part 4 of the act is the answer to the question Senator Cook raised.

         The tollway tax rort operates in two ways. Investors can borrow up to 100 per cent of the cost of buying infrastructure bonds and claim the interest as a tax deduction, then they pay no tax on the interest received from financiers on the infrastructure bond, a massive tax boost for banks and the wealthy.

         To the question of whether there are tax rorts in this system or not, `rorts' is a very pejorative term. That is not to say that there are matters that should not be reviewed in this area.

         Even if that is the case, what you are doing now is joining forces with a party, namely the Labor Party, which introduced the bill in the first place and which, in government, let that bill go unchanged for a period of three years or more. If it is seen, as Labor is now alleging, to have had a great rort loophole contained in it, isn't it very interesting how Labor's views have changed over the period from being in government—looking as if they were moving into opposition—to moving into opposition. That makes a very salutary statement.

         The whole question of reviews of taxation is an important matter for government, to be taken on appropriate occasions and at appropriate times. That is certainly the case. First of all, to the question of looking at that in this context, as I say, I reject the proposition. Secondly, you have put into the bill a totally different issue that was designed to enable 40 projects—that have been in the pipeline but have been excluded for technical reasons—to be accepted under the provisions of the development authority, and that is something that is going to be potentially extremely costly to economic and project development in Australia. That is the simple issue that is at point now.

That is a significant change in the policy announced by the then government on the road projects.

He did not realise that this bill—his own bill from his own department—was being introduced into the Senate this week. He has been absolutely caught out. Typical arrogant Treasurer! This is another performance by this Treasurer who believes that whatever he decrees must absolutely be the final outcome and that any other view can be ignored.

        The Labor government introduced a bill which we have followed almost to the letter. It had nothing to do with the question of the inclusion or exclusion of roads. As we all acknowledge, it is true that subsequently the
        <break page="2536" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         then Treasurer made a statement which was not followed up in legislation, presumably because of the electoral timetable. Senators might recall that there was a great deal of debate at the time as to whether it would exclude the City Link project or not. As I said earlier in this debate, the then government and the former Treasurer, Mr Willis, deliberately allowed City Link to be included in the provisions of the Development Allowance Authority. The real reason why this has all come about, and the only reason why Labor made the policy decision that it did towards the end of last year, was the political embarrassment that was occurring as a result of the actions of Bob Carr in New South Wales. That was the basis for everything that has gone on subsequently so far as Labor is concerned in this matter.

        I will return to a couple of the points made by Senator Kernot concerning the taxation position of the Development Allowance Authority. If Senator Kernot is concerned about the tax concessionality element contained in the bill concerning roads and if she follows that through consistently, she should be saying that the whole of the Development Allowance Authority ought to be abolished because the same principle in terms of the tax concessionality applies to any project, whether it is a road, mining or electricity project. Why is Senator Kernot drawing a distinction between roads and everything else? She might care to answer that question for me. She cannot hang it on the EPAC report because that report does not give her strong supporting evidence to mount that proposition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Democrats and opponents in this area claim that there are excessive tax benefits to the rich at the expense of the general taxpayer through Develop Australia Bonds. This seems to be what Senator Kernot and Labor, so far as roads but not anything else, seem to be saying. They claim that no tax is charged on the interest received. They also claim that the size of the parcel of bonds issued is such that only the very rich can afford them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Quite frankly, claims of that nature cannot be sustained. The cost to revenue of Develop Australia Bonds is relatively small. Under the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         infrastructure borrowings legislation, the revenue cost on non&amp;hyphen;assessable interest payments to investors is offset by recouping most of that cost directly from the infrastructure borrower, who loses his tax deductibility on the interest paid. That is the point I made to Senator Kernot earlier.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Develop Australia Bonds do not result to any significant extent in an increase in the quantum of tax deductions over time. Rather, some deductions are obtained earlier at a higher marginal rate. Forgone revenue is, for the greater part, clawed back in the longer term as the infrastructure projects start to generate net taxable income at an earlier point than would have been the case without Develop Australia Bonds. In the short term, the cost to revenue of the program is relatively modest. The revenue cap ensures that, in the short term, revenue forgone does not exceed the limits set by government regulation.

The issue is that the government believes very strongly indeed that the bill as introduced should stand unamended. It is an identical bill to the one that was introduced by the former government.

There is no doubt that many of the projects which will now be affected by the intransigence of the opposition on this matter may very well fall into precisely the same situation.

        Let us get a couple of things right so that the record speaks honestly. I want your acknowledgment that on 15 December 1995 the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), and the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), issued this joint media statement. I will quote from the beginning of it:

        While the taxation benefits in dollar terms of infrastructure borrowings over the life of a project are modest, they have been very important in facilitating private sector financing of such projects because of their ability to lower the cost of financing in the early or construction phase.

        My last point is in response to something Senator Kernot mentioned about a coal&amp;hyphen;fired power station. I think there is one there—the Collinsville power station. People would have different views on that. You are asserting that a coal&amp;hyphen;fired power station is somehow or other bad. We would obviously have a difference of view on that. The point I make to you is that, amongst the projects I can see at a quick glance of a one&amp;hyphen;page list of power stations, there are three gas&amp;hyphen;fired stations and one hydro station.

         In support of moving these amendments again, I will briefly say that these two amendments refer to the issue of policy by&amp;hyphen;laws and enhance ministerial discretion under the policy by&amp;hyphen;laws provision. This enables companies to make application to the minister for the level of duty to be waived on the importation of particular goods and, if the minister finds favour with their submissions, he is able to do that. The bill as it currently stands means that the minister's discretion would only reduce it down to three per cent of duty. The amendment enables the minister to reduce it down to zero.

         We would like to insist on these amendments because they relate to three areas under the act: items 55, 57 and 60. Item 55 relates to machine tools for working advanced metals; item 57 relates to high performance raw materials and intermediate goods, and item 60 relates to high performance food packaging materials.

         It seems to me that this nation, Australia, is developing industry which uses machine tools for working advanced metals. In fact, it is a growing industry; it is one in which we are very competitive throughout the world. It is an area of high technology. It is important to sophisticated manufacturing, and it is an area in which we ought not impose a penalty on the industry when, by imposing a penalty, the industry's chances of growing stronger will be stunted. Therefore a company ought to be able to apply to the minister and the minister ought to have the discretion to remove all duty on imported goods necessary to the growth of this industry.

We are acknowledged around the globe as a site for the production of clean and green agricultural products. That is our reputation in Asia. Getting those food products to the Asian market in pristine condition is an important consideration for our industry, and high performance food packaging materials enable that to be done. If our food is not on the supermarket shelves of Asia in a way that is attractive to Asian consumers—that is, fresh, crisp, green and clean—then our ability to win an even greater share of that market would be reduced. Therefore, the packaging material used to keep it in that pristine condition is an important consideration. These are mainly metal materials and goods which offer a performance advantage over similar goods produced in Australia. That is what item 60 relates to.

All of these are areas on which, if the bill stands, the government will impose a tax of three per cent. It seems to me that that tax goes against the evolution of these industries and the jobs that they will create. All we ask is that, in appropriate cases, where it can be made under a by&amp;hyphen;law application to the minister, the minister have discretion to remove the tax and provide zero.

         Implicit in your question, I think, Senator Margetts is this issue, if I may articulate it this way: this would enable the minister to exercise discretion to allow those goods that are made overseas to come into Australia to facilitate the transport of Australian products both domestically and internationally. The judgment call the minister will have to make is what steps he, as the minister, can take to encourage the domestic producers of those materials to be competitive and provide materials that provide those performance criteria of equal standard to the imports.

But those materials go to the weight, temperature control, packaging and presentation and, at the end of the day, the cost and the marketability of the goods that I am talking about, which are mainly foodstuffs.

         On Senator Cook's amendments, No.1 seems to be okay from the Greens' point of view. It removes the higher tariff on capital equipment used in manufacturing advanced materials. Australia is a source of feedstock for many advanced materials. It is silly to make downstream processing of these materials more expensive, especially as we are encouraging the manufacturers' products with a very high level of value adding.

         With regard to what happens to those who fail the test, Senator Cook is reversing the current situation. He is seeking to set the ministerial discretion to allow a minister to eliminate tariffs if the lobbying is effective, and to adjust the legislation so that discretion is allowed to cover goods where equivalent goods are not produced here. The effect of the wording would be to allow concession goods to be included in discretion, because under the current act they are excluded. In effect, the amendments will ensure that, if a company fails in their lobbying, then they can fall back on the three per cent concessional rate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It will make ministerial discretion the most powerful thing with a three per cent tariff as a backup second choice for companies that can argue that their imports fit the criteria. I do not particularly like that system. The problem lies where lobbying power is stronger than a more equitable and open system of non&amp;hyphen;discretionary hurdle jumping. I do not like the fact that it means goods that have equivalent goods produced here, can get a lower tariff than goods that have no equivalent goods produced here just because somebody's lobbying power is greater than somebody else's.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not convinced that in the face of a decision to reduce the tariff concession from zero to three per cent the minister will be able to use this discretion to reinstate a zero concession on any broad or equitable basis. Perhaps either the minister or Senator Cook could respond to that.

         I wish most of the goods in items 72 to 81 of schedule 3—basically, industry inputs of non&amp;hyphen;machine metal products—would get a zero concession.

          Frankly, the Greens' position on lots of these issues is that the process should be open and honest. We should have a means by which we can include through some form of sales tax differential those kinds of differences. If environmental costs are involved, they should be built into the cost of the product—I realise that the problematical categories have probably just been included as a part of item 39 of schedule 3.

          —Senator Margetts has raised a very important issue regarding what I would call the transparencies or the process of granting a policy by-law and the lobbying process that goes with it. As a former minister responsible for the policy by&amp;hyphen;law process for a couple of years, I agree that these questions
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           raised by Senator Margetts are very relevant. However, I want to point out to her that, as I discovered very rapidly, there is a very detailed legal process established with regard to policy by-laws. They are not a simple issue. It is not simply a matter of a minister capriciously granting a policy by&amp;hyphen;law to someone who is more effective in lobbying than someone else. If that happened under the existing law, I have no doubt that minister would rapidly be before a court facing a major dispute with somebody who opposed the granting of the policy by&amp;hyphen;law. Conversely, if the minister did not grant the policy by&amp;hyphen;law, it could be challenged that he took that decision capriciously.

         The minister in these cases acts under the law and the regulations on the advice of the departments. In both the DIST and Customs there are delegated offices who have to carry out a proper due process of seeking the information and explaining why a policy by-law can be granted after a tariff concession has been refused. That process may be very complicated, and that may be one of its worst aspects, but it is complicated because we are trying to be fair and transparent in the running of the system. So that is not an issue I have concern with because I have sat through the process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My main complaint may be that, because a system is made transparent and in a way that means a capricious decision cannot be made, we have very complicated rules and processes. This means that a whole industry of consultants lives from giving advice to companies about the process of obtaining a policy by-law. If there is an area of micro-economic reform that may be useful in this country, it would be reducing the need for companies to have consultants advising them about the granting of policy by&amp;hyphen;laws. That would be very useful, in my view, because it would reduce the cost to industry. Again, it is very much a function of the rules this parliament has imposed that ensures the capriciousness or off&amp;hyphen;handed approach of a minister being heavily influenced or lobbied by somebody in that area.

          Though it is true that in certain industries and certain areas there would be large com panies applying for policy by&amp;hyphen;laws, plenty of smaller companies can and do apply for them and have them granted. If you look at the total picture of obtaining a policy by&amp;hyphen;law for major projects, it is by definition. When it was at $50 million, obviously it would be a bigger company or a major organisation putting forward that project because of the size of the project. As I understand it, this bill has reduced the policy by-law size down to $10 million for major projects. I think that will enhance smaller businesses and smaller organisations being able to access the advantage of policy by-laws.

         I do not know whether Senator Margetts will trust the advice of a former minister on this issue, but I can assure her that there are very strict procedures. It is actually not the minister who signs the policy by-law. He signs a note that the recommendation coming from the departments is in accordance in his view with the government's policy initiatives. Senator Cook has outlined the reasons why we believe there is a policy outcome for the development of Australian industry to be more export oriented and export competitive: the creation of jobs and growth in Australia.

         Senator Margetts raised concern about amendment No. 2, which deals with the use of chemicals. It is unavoidable that plastics will have to be used from time to time and chemicals will be used to promote the use of the production of plastics. To try to separate plastic out because of its polluting quality or its littering of the landscape I would think would be very difficult under item 57. Though her concern is reasonable to raise, I do not think the three per cent ought to be reduced to zero. We believe that overall we receive wider benefits from the promotion of these industries. It will make them more competitive and will create more jobs in Australia.

         Senator Cook outlined the policies regarding the agrifood area.

         In some cases, it will involve plastic packaging to maintain freshness.

That means that people overseas are getting access to food that is less processed, fresher and more nutritious. The plastic not only benefits our industry but also improves the nutrition level of the less processed food for people overseas.

         The performance of the government on the issue of tariff concessions and policy by&amp;hyphen;laws over the last couple of months has been convoluted and contorted to say the least. They accepted the position we announced in the budget when in government of abolishing the tariff concession system. When the now Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the then shadow finance minister, Mr Prosser, accepted our announcement about savings, I do not think they understood as we did the impact it would have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We were quite open about the impact. We knew that some people would disagree with the decision. But in order to ensure that all our election promises were funded, that was the responsible decision that we took. It has been a bit of a circus since the election, with the new government trying to understand the impact of all of this and then trying to come up with their own significant change, which is that the tariff concession system would not be abolished but would continue at three per cent, with consumer goods included and three per cent applied to policy by&amp;hyphen;laws in a number of areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a misunderstanding of the reason policy by&amp;hyphen;laws were established in the first place. Originally, it was to grant a complete exemption from tariff. When you fail on a tariff concession to get the exemption, there are good policy reasons, as Senator Cook has explained, why the policy by&amp;hyphen;law system would operate to allow, under the circumstances outlined in the rules, those products
         <break page="2545" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to be imported without paying any tariff at all.

         I cannot see the difference between having a tariff concession operating in a number of areas at three per cent and a policy by&amp;hyphen;law operating in some areas at three per cent. Obviously, if you have a policy by&amp;hyphen;law operating at zero there is an advantage over a tariff at three per cent. But why, if you were rejected for a tariff concession at three per cent, would you apply for a policy by&amp;hyphen;law which still hits you with three per cent?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is the confusion the government is in because its ministers have not understood the basic difference between a tariff concession process and the policy by&amp;hyphen;law. I again make the point that it indicates that the government has got itself into a very confused and convoluted state in trying to work out this system to appease the lobbying going on from various groups in the community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we made the announcement that we would abolish the tariff concession system we said that the policy by&amp;hyphen;laws would still apply in all categories and, with respect to project status, we would drop it from $50 million to $10 million. The government is still doing that. But we did not say that some policy by&amp;hyphen;laws would operate at a three per cent level. We said that all our policy by&amp;hyphen;laws would continue to operate and at a zero level. If you can prove a policy case in terms of the national interest—to develop Australian industry—you should have access to that process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We now have a convoluted outcome. Fortunately, I think the government has accepted the amendments proposed by the opposition and the other parties to exclude consumer goods, as we excluded them in our announcement when we were in government. At that time I do not think the then opposition understood the difference between consumer and business items. We certainly did, and that is why we made the announcement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the list was finally tabled the other day in answer to a question on notice—a list which ran to a couple of thousand consumer items—you could see that putting the tariff concession at even three per cent on those items would be a substantial new tax. Let's
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          not beat around the bush: it is a new tax; in its own way it is a mini GST applying to consumer items in Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition parties in the Senate have done a very good job in forcing the government to back away from that measure. I still think that it is a mistake to apply a three per cent tariff to some of the policy by&amp;hyphen;laws. In some cases it makes policy by&amp;hyphen;laws irrelevant because with the tariff at three per cent you are saying, `You missed out on the tariff concession, so apply for a policy by&amp;hyphen;law—but if you get it we will still hit you with three per cent.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is just ridiculous. You might as well abolish the policy by&amp;hyphen;law of three per cent in all those areas and just stick to the tariff concession. But that is a bit difficult for the intellectual capacity of these ministers. That is why we have the very higgledy&amp;hyphen;piggledy outcome with which we in the opposition are very kindly trying to help.

        —I was reminding the Senate yesterday in the debate about the urgency of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 that not only is this legislation not urgent but it is a debate which has been going on for 3,000 years. I do not think that, by making this a matter of urgency, we are going to in just a few minutes or a few hours solve the problem.

        I was pointing out to the Senate yesterday that my reason for opposing making this legislation urgent and, therefore, bringing it into the Senate today is my great fear that we will, by hastening this legislation, contravene some principles that go back to the very beginnings of the Judaeo-Christian ethic.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yesterday I quoted from memory a couple of verses. I went and looked them up because I knew you would want the exact quote. This passage from the Old Testament—and there are many—is typical of the kind of text that I was quoting:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Lord defends the rights of orphans and widows. He cares for foreigners and gives them food and clothing. And you should also care for them, because you were foreigners in Egypt.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was pointing out the principle we are dealing with. If we pretend in any sense to follow the Judaeo-Christian ethic, we have a special obligation to care for those within our own country who are foreigners, who are migrants, who are refugees. It is a phrase that occurs over and over again in the Old Testament.

        In dealing with the issue of foreigners we are talking about an example that goes back

         to the absolute paradigmatic history of Israel. In being rescued from Egypt this became the fundamental principle for them in all their relationships with other people and other nations.

        If this Senate believes in following on that historical tradition, which goes back to the earliest recordings of history, then we must take account of the obligation which is put upon us to care for foreigners, migrants and refugees in our own country. I believe this legislation, which some senators want to make urgent, flies in the face of that very principle and contradicts it in a most fundamental way. It would deprive those who are prisoners, foreigners or refugees in our land of the kind of basic assistance which they need. That flies in the face of the principle which I have just enunciated. I know that at this stage we are debating the cut off motion and the urgency of the legislation. When we get to the substantive motion I will develop this principle at greater length.

          which is 3,000 years old. In my view that directly negates any thought that the legislation is urgent. The fact that we have been debating this principle for 3,000 years—and it has been suggested that it is necessary for us to make some decision in this place on this principle, which is contravened by this legislation—quite clearly shows that it cannot be treated in a cavalier sense or any sense of urgency.

        Surely there is a need to guarantee that any person detained on Australian territory is able to have access to legal advice to determine the legality of the detention. In the case of asylum seekers held in a remote place like Port Hedland, I would have thought that HREOC was the appropriate body to provide such a service or to give public assurance that such a service is being provided. The availability of the service should not be contingent on a detainee having sufficient command of English, Australian law and political process to make an undeniable request.

       I rise to support my Democrat colleagues and also the Green senators who have risen to speak in this debate so far and to condemn quite universally the contents of the bill put forward today. What does the bill do? I find nothing in this bill that is urgent or that requires a hasty decision. I see no reasons why this bill should be exempt from the cut&amp;hyphen;off. I have heard no good reasons from those opposite as to why this bill should be exempt from the cut&amp;hyphen;off.

       Let us look at what the bill is designed to do. It does two things. Firstly, it ensures that neither the minister nor his department has

        any obligation to give a person in immigration detention an application form for a visa unless a direct request for such a form is made in accordance with section 256 of the Migration Act 1958. Secondly, where a person in immigration detention has not made a direct complaint to either the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the ombudsman, the bill removes the rights of the detainee to receive communications from those authorities. These are two shameful aspects of the bill.

       Why should we proceed with haste? Indeed, why should we proceed at all with such retrograde and regressive functions as outlined in the bill? There is absolutely no reason. First of all, I do not believe that we have seen due process and consultation adhered to. In fact my understanding is—and Senator Woodley might be able to advise us on this—that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner has willingly accepted the idea of sitting down with the government, relevant departments and ministers over the winter recess to consult.

Certainly Democrat offices—and I am sure Senator Bell and Senator Woodley would concur—have been inundated with requests, pleas, letters and phone calls from people who are affected, not just lawyers, but people who are concerned in the wider community, as well as the chief human rights watchdogs in our community, the powers of which this bill seeks to curtail.

       I am sad to say that today the government and the opposition by seeking to exempt this bill from the cut&amp;hyphen;off or move this bill at all are not only showing blatant disregard for detainees and those refugees whose livelihoods are affected by this crucial piece of legislation, but they are showing contempt for those very human rights watchdogs that I talked about. Not only that but, as Senator Woodley and Senator Bourne have made clear, this bill actually threatens to contradict our rights under international covenants and conventions. That is a worrying trend and I would be curious to find out from the government and the minister what discussions have taken place in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in regard to us dispatching our obligations under some of the relevant international treaties and covenants.

       I should refer specifically to what covenants we are concerned about and why these covenants may be breached, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Secondly, it denies such detainees effective access to legal assistance to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. Again, that is another blatant breach of this instrument to which we are a party. Thirdly, it is inhumane in its treatment of immigration detainees and, lastly, it denies immigration detainees their freedom to receive communications from outside the detention centre. This aspect of the bill is particularly appalling, because the communication from which these detainees are excluded relates to authorities set up to guard against the abuse of human rights in Australia.

       In his submission, Senator Spindler points out article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I think it is appropriate that we remind people in this place today of the actual wording of article 9. It states:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful.

I am also conscious of the fact that, when debating exemption of a bill from the cut&amp;hyphen;off, we should take into account why that bill should be exempt. I have said that no good reasons have been proffered by those on any side of this chamber as to why there is some urgency to this bill. I would argue—I suspect I have been arguing—that this bill should not pass this chamber in any form whatsoever and, in particular, there is no good reason why this bill should be debated today,

        —If there is a financial aspect, it is not a financial aspect that suggests the bill should be passed with any urgency. As I have also argued, there is a very good reason to argue that the bill should be deferred for longer periods of consultation and discussion. In fact, I have said repeatedly that there has been a lack of adequate consultation by the relevant groups. We have this week a request, a willingness and an offer from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner to discuss, debate and confer with the government over the contents of this bill.

      <para first-indent="16">
       So what I and my Democrat colleagues are arguing today is that, apart from the fact there is no financial or other impetus for this bill to be exempt from the cut&amp;hyphen;off, there is a very good reason to defer debate on this bill: the watchdogs I referred to earlier, the Ombudsman's office and Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, have not had sufficient time to consider, debate and discuss the contents of the bill, and to outline a more appropriate outcome to this debate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have mentioned other organisations that are willing to be involved in discussion on this matter. They should also have the opportunity for consultation and to be consulted and involved in this debate. I have also referred to the haphazard nature of the committee hearing and discussion that took place the night before last. I think it is shameful that staff were kept working for a continuous period of 36 hours. I am sure that is not a precedent, but it is certainly nonetheless an appalling thing to happen in this place.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is sad that this day, this last day of the Senate sittings, should be marked by the discussion of such a shameful piece of legislation. As I mentioned after last night's debate, it is particularly touching that we are discussing this today but it is also, if we are talking about timing, ironic because this week is Refugees Week. Once again, it is a shameful coincidence. What is the gift we are giving to refugees in this country this week? A piece of legislation that threatens to blatantly contravene our obligations and our commitments under international law. Perhaps one of the submissions on this matter to the joint standing committee put it best when it described the bill as:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mean&amp;hyphen;minded, unnecessary, morally untenable, in contravention of Australia's international legal obligations and quite contrary to the traditional Australian ethos of fair play.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is a good enough reason in itself to refuse exemption of this bill from the cut-off motion. There are so many issues in it that deserve further investigation, discussion and consultation. It is indeed mean&amp;hyphen;minded, and in the eyes of the international community we should all be deeply ashamed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I say, I have heard no convincing reasons, either today or yesterday, as to why this bill is urgent and why it should be pressed ahead with today of all days—or any day for that matter. No-one has offered a single financial, social, cultural or legal reason for passage of this bill. I think there are many good reasons for this bill to be deferred and further discussed—for not just those groups I referred to: not just for the human rights watchdogs; not just for those individuals who have complained; not just for
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         those detainees and refugees whose livelihoods are affected by this bill; and not just for the benefit of parliamentarians. What about the departments?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I reiterate my question to this government relating to the role of DFAT in this bill: has the minister signalled to the Australian government and Australian people that we are dispatching those very obligations under international covenants that I referred to? I would like further time for the department to explain. Another reason why this bill is not urgent is that DFAT should be involved in discussions and given explanations as to what is going on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I state our objections once again to this bill being exempt from the cut-off motion. I reiterate our objections to this bill generally. Senator O'Chee, if any of your colleagues or any of our opposition colleagues could provide one decent, humane reason as to why this bill should be exempt or indeed even passed in this chamber, perhaps we would consider this differently. But all I see is a bill that threatens our international obligations. It is a shameful piece of legislation. It should certainly not be exempt from the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion before us today.

I concur with my colleagues who have pointed out that there has been no demonstration from either side of the chamber of any degree of urgency in terms of social, financial or legislative requirements.

Earlier today, mention was also made of Senator Harradine's concerns in this area. I know all honourable senators are concerned with human rights and the proper administration of justice, but Senator Harradine certainly has a long tradition of being wary of any attempts to legislate away those basic rights. He has spoken at length and often, I might say, on this topic. I wonder whether it is a coincidence that he is not in Australia at the moment and thus is unable to contribute. I wonder what his contribution would be to what is now before us in light of what I see as unseemly haste to get this bill before us and out of the way. That is definitely what I see is happening.

       I have been assisted in coming to believe that this is not an urgent matter by my membership of the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

       I notice in his absence that on Senator Cooney's bench there is a growing pile of legal references, each marked with inserts of yellow sticky paper. I do not think he has completed his case yet, but I know that Senator Cooney is working very hard to compile a case to address this particular question. I am not surprised about that because this question of whether there is a denial of access to justice—which should really concern someone like Senator Cooney, and I hope the entire Senate—was a question before the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We are asking senators to consider that. It is the role of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to consider each and every piece of legislation that comes before us, as well as the terms of reference, and that includes the question of whether access to justice is being denied.

         —I rise to support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. In doing so, I say firstly that there needs to be a sense of priorities—priorities that have not been focused on by those who are concerned by Australia's record on refugees. I do not think enough people know that our record on refugees is unmatched. We take more refugees per capita into Australia than any other country, and the assistance we give refugees is also unparalleled.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important in Refugee Week to put that on the record because, whilst that is the degree of our achievement, whilst we have taken some one million refugees into the country since the end of World War II, there is a bit of a crisis in public support for our refugee program. It is a crisis born of a lack of education or understanding of the issues involved—a crisis fuelled by prejudice and ignorance in the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Australia does not take refugees just because it is the good and moral thing to do. We should recognise that, through taking refugees, this country over the last 40 or so years has picked up an enormous human resource in the skills, talents, energy and dedication to starting a new life in a new country exhibited by those refugees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With the Vietnamese community—one of the biggest and latest batches of people in need of assistance—although there are problems with the settlement and composition of that community, within 20 years of migration to this country it is achieving record rates of placement in the work force and in the education system. It is also interesting to note that women are at the forefront of the achievements that community is making in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why, when we benefit so much as a community, when our record is so good in this area, is there little public appreciation of or support for it? One reason is that those who are devoting time, energy, resources and personal endeavour to supporting refugees do not have their voices heard. Too often the debate focuses on those who come here illegally by boat and the time it takes to process them. Not enough time is spent
        <break page="2557" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         promoting the achievements not only of government but of that community sector which is so critical to the good settlement of people into this country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One aspect of this diversion of energy, this lack of promotion of such achievement, is the concern—in fact, the obsession—some people have with boat people. You cannot let everyone who comes into Australia by boat stay here. They might have valid claims to make under our system of refugee assessment for humanitarian processing, and in those circumstances they are entitled to stay here. But for the system to work for our migration and refugee programs, benchmarks need to be applied.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The benchmark that this country has applied consistently over the decades has been the international definition of `refugee', and the international convention on the treatment of refugees. That is applied onshore and, to a great extent, to the way we assess people offshore. We need a system that is internationally accepted and which, through being internationally accepted, provides equity to those who are in dire need of assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Offshore we work with the UNHCR to identify the areas of need and to identify refugees. That system has worked pretty well. Onshore over recent years we have come a long way, and people in the refugee support sector acknowledge that. We now have an assessment system which provides refugee status for about a third of the people who apply for that status onshore. That is a very a fairly good strike rate when you compare it with other western democracies that have onshore assessment processes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to note that people's applications are processed much more quickly now than they had been over the previous period. It takes some six to seven weeks to get an initial assessment of one's refugee claim. It takes two or three months, for instance, for those who come here by boat to have a merit review at the Refugee Review Tribunal level. So you are talking about three or four months to get both an assessment and an external merit based review by the RRT. Those who find themselves in detention thereafter are those who take advantage of—it is there to be
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         taken advantage of—our constitutional system, and through that they have access to the Australian legal system.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I know the government is trying to see whether it can stop access to the Federal Court for people who get bounced on the RRT level. The advice that we used to get as a government—the advice given to committees of this parliament—has been that it would be a short&amp;hyphen;sighted move to try and do that, because, through the original jurisdiction of the High Court, people can find that they have access to the judicial system in any event. In fact, it may take longer to settle cases if the government does do away with the access to the Federal Court—a mechanism which is in place now and, I must say as well, available only to a limited degree. I must caution the minister in terms of how he proceeds down that route, because whatever you do in migration these days there has to be an eye to how the legal system, the Federal Court and the High Court will determine people's rights in our system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With that sort of backdrop, I think it is important to recognise that equity demands a rigid application of the international covenants that are in place here—a rigid adherence to our obligations. Our obligations are to entertain applications, our obligations are to entertain them fairly, and our obligations are not only to those who make claims in our system but also to those who are in the queue waiting to come to Australia by way of our humanitarian program. As I said, you have to apply benchmarks, and the international convention is important in terms of a definition of refugee and in terms of how cases are proceeded with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the last couple of years we have made amendments to our legislation to, for instance, ensure that those who had received protection in another country could not go forum shopping. We had great resistance to that measure in this place and in parts of the community. The UNHCR was keen to see that sort of measure in place because it knew that if we allowed forum shopping to the extent that it was starting to happen then those who are in desperate and legitimate need in other parts of the world—in fact the same region as some
        <break page="2558" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of those who have tried forum shopping—would miss out.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With respect to those who have been processed elsewhere, we brought in legislation to ensure that those who have been processed under a fair system elsewhere cannot start the process here again, and the opposition supported us on that when we were in government. Of course, we had, once again, concern from other parties in this place and in the community about what we were doing. What we were doing was essentially saying that those who had a legitimate claim which had not been met elsewhere or which had not been recognised under a fair system elsewhere should not be coming here and starting in the system again. I do not think there is anything fairer than that not only to the international system but also to Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The same, I think, applies to this particular legislation. You have got to play this game by the rules, and with respect to this particular legislation we have got to acknowledge that when people do come here they do not all say the word `asylum' or `refugee'. Senator Spindler, you should know this because you have had a long interest in this, and I do not want to engage in any acrimonious debate with you on your last day of debate here.

        To make the system work, we cannot afford to allow ourselves to become a soft touch for the bogus claims.

        I suppose, with a degree of frustration, I stand here and support this legislation. I say frustration because not only has the good work of the past been ignored by those who, by promoting it, would actually be able to build on that achievement, but also we are actually engaging in this debate in refugee week at a time when there are serious proposals on the table to reduce our refugee and humanitarian intake by some one-third. Senator Short might argue about the figures here, but whether it is 13,000 or 15,000, or down to 10,000, it is going to be a reduction of either 3,000 or 5,000.

The numbers that we have taken into Australia, the 13,000&amp;hyphen;14,000&amp;hyphen;15,000 I mentioned earlier, are assessed offshore for humanitarian entry into this country. At the same time as taking that large number of people per capita, we also have got to a situation where some 3,000 people a year are assessed onshore as being entitled to protection as asylum seekers. It used to be some 500 or 600 before we started the independent system some three years ago.

        It would be, I think, scandalous if the government were to include in their figure on the humanitarian program those who have been assessed within Australia. That program is there to cater for those assessed offshore, not onshore. It would be a sleight of hand to include 3,000 cases assessed onshore as part of an overall humanitarian program. Basically, the government would be decreasing our commitment to international humanitarian programs by a sleight of hand which would substantially cut back the program.

        The other aspect of the current discussions that I am concerned about and that the debate should focus on is the special assistance category program.

They have been through some difficulty in non&amp;hyphen;humanitarian circumstances and they have relatives in Australia. That works as a very important complementary program to the refugee program, as of course does the special humanitarian program.

In response to some murmurings by the government that they might cut that back, I certainly agree with the need to assess what we can do and to leave the intake at the number of refugees that we now take.

        As a relatively affluent society, I believe that we have a responsibility to hold out a helping hand to those that are in need.

        Similarly, I agreed with Senator Bolkus when he said that the special assistance program is a useful and cost effective program. More than that, it is an essential program which assists in the resettlement of migrants coming to this country. Once again, I make this warning: the other organisations—the non-government organisations and social welfare organisations—will have to bear the brunt of this measure if it proceeds. Many people could finish up on the streets and homeless, and the suicide rates and illness that we experience could increase. That is what we experience whenever there is a dysfunction in our society and whenever a large number of people are neglected by whichever government is in power.

        However, when Senator Bolkus spoke about a crisis, he left me wondering where the crisis was. Does 700, 800 or maybe 1,200 asylum seekers mean there is a crisis? Should we really be afraid to be flooded by that number of people? Are we so afraid that we are prepared to disregard one of the basic principles—namely, that someone on our soil who is considering going before an Australian court is entitled to know whether or not he or she has a chance to succeed and what rules govern the particular situation? Are we really saying that we are facing a crisis or a flood

        I believe that this country has, amongst its many assets—perhaps as its foremost asset—the rule of law. Every citizen can go before a court and challenge the government and challenge those stronger than themselves. This actually distinguishes us from a society where people are ruled by the executive government at will—in other words, by a tyranny. Surely we have plenty of examples of that. Indeed, many of the refugees who are reaching our shores have come from countries like that.

        Quite a few years ago, I came to Australia from Europe. When I was in Europe, for a number of years during my childhood I experienced conditions that I was glad to escape and I am glad I do not have to experience again. Hopefully, my children will not have to experience them. That is why I value and try to guard jealously the rule of law in this country. I believe that is the hallmark of a civilised society. We all crave that protection—the protection of being secure and of not finding somebody knocking on your door at midnight saying, `Come with me.' We want to be free and secure and, for that, we need the rule of law. Once we start saying that principles do not matter and that the cost of some court cases is more important than the principle of providing information on people's legal rights, then I believe we have started to dismantle the rule of law. I will come back to that issue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Bolkus also harked back to a previous debate which said that, in determining whether or not a person is a refugee, we should accept under the comprehensive plan of action the judgment made by other nations—that we should trust what is being done in the Philippines, in Indonesia and in other countries, where legal issues are not handled in quite the same way as they are in Australia. We all know they are handled differently.

They are the principles that they have professed to hold dear. For that matter, I would ask this question of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock): how can a Liberal, a person who professes to hold dear the principles of civil liberties, decide that we should save a few dollars but give up the principle of providing information on a person's legal rights?

        Australia, unlike many of its neighbours, ostensibly treats human rights as a national priority. Governments in this country, of all political persuasions, in international fora have championed the cause of human rights. The work of the former Prime Minister Mr Malcolm Fraser regarding the system of apartheid in South Africa immediately springs to mind. It is therefore with more than a passing glimpse that the international community looks at Australia's domestic scene to ascertain whether we practise what we preach.

        Human rights instruments, in any case, are minimum standards. They do not bestow superior treatment on those they are designed to protect.

         In Australia, the issue is recognised as being of such importance that we have created a statutory supervisory body, as I have said, known as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

One needs only to read the volumes of cases reported by Amnesty International and the abstract sorrow they entail to get an appreciation of how important a person's liberty is.

To say that we are prepared to simply cast these considerations aside because it is inconvenient and because we do not want to engage in the very often costly process of allowing these people to challenge in court decisions that are made by government departments, then I believe we are denying a very critical principle on which this nation and the way we are governed depends.

        The Senate has before it yet another migration bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, concerning the treatment of asylum seekers in this country, the boat people, those who came believing that in Australia the rights, freedoms and legal standing of people are respected more than in their own countries. I am not quite sure how many times during my four years in this place the Senate has amended the Migration Act in relation to refugee and asylum seekers. At least four come to mind, but I think it may be more. Senator Spindler assures me it has been more.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As has happened on more than one previous occasion, this bill is in response to a court case which the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs lost. The substance of the bill relates to the right of unauthorised boat arrivals to have access to legal advice. It seeks to alter section 193 of the act to make explicit the actions which are not required of an officer of the department in relation to a person in immigration detention and to reverse the decision in the Federal Court that the human rights and equal opportunity act has priority over the Migration Act. The bill also seeks to amend section 256 of the Migration Act to make explicit the right of a person in detention to request visa application forms.

        This bill echoes a bill from the previous government which included the bizarre wording that `not even a court may order the
        <break page="2564" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         person's release'—that is, from immigration detention. We must remember that this is not supposed to be custody. It is custody in every sense of word, but, as Senator McKiernan has often said in this place, these people that have fled and arrived in boats, often in very traumatic conditions, are free to leave and go back to where they came from. It is nonetheless detention and it is nonetheless bizarre that not even a court may order a person's release from that detention.

        The bill now before the Senate takes this thinking a step further by seeking to remove the protection of the common law from section 193. Furthermore, the bill seeks to make the ability to create written submissions to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the ombudsman a mandatory part of every asylum seeker's curriculum vitae. I refer to the proposed wording of new section 193 (3).

        In light of answers to my questions about the decrease in the ombudsman's budget and the likely reduction in the number of complaints the ombudsman is able to investigate, this section may prove to be an even bigger stumbling block to applicants for refugee status than it appears to be on the surface—goodness knows it is bad enough already. I issued a press release entitled `Is accountability a one&amp;hyphen;way street?', which deals with the funding cut for the Commonwealth ombudsman's office. I did that because I wanted to say that we seem to be quite happy about using the slogan of accountability to justify enormous policy changes.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One example is ATSIC funding. However, when it comes to the government being accountable and funding properly the accountability mechanisms that are available to ordinary citizens to challenge government departments, such as the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the funding is being cut by 16 per cent. The complaints that can be dealt with are likely to drop below 50 per cent simply because of the cuts to the funding and the probable drop in staffing levels. There will be certain difficulties in addressing very important inquiries such as the NOMAD crash and the ATSIC Burnt Bridge inquiry.

         We have, on one hand, a government that is saying accountability is very important yet, on the other hand, its accountability to the people and the accountability of government departments does not seem important. I think we should remember that. The Human Rights Commissioner—I might add that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is suffering in the same way as the Commonwealth ombudsman's office is in terms of funding cuts—Mr Chris Sidoti, held a media conference about this legislation last week. I am sorry I was not able to be there as it must have been very powerful. Mr Sidoti reminded those present of some of the words of the Australian national anthem:

         I thought that was very interesting because I had been to the memorial at St Christopher's in Manuka for those who died in the tragic Black Hawk accident. We sang both verses of the national anthem. It is unusual to sing both verses. I was choked with emotion on that occasion and I nearly choked when I was reminded of the second verse of Australia's national anthem.

         Mr Sidoti also drew attention to some statistics about people who have applied for and been granted refugee status in recent years. Up to June 1994, 856 people arrived by boat unauthorised, of whom 394 were granted
         <break page="2565" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          residency—that is, 46 per cent. From July 1994, 1,622 people have arrived, of whom only 78 or 4.8 per cent have been granted residency. How can this be? The refugee application process did not suddenly change in July 1994. The definition of a convention refugee did not change. Australia did not withdraw its status as a party to the refugee convention. What then happened?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The evidence points to only one conclusion, and if I may use biblical language to describe the change, the government hardens its heart against the asylum seekers. Sadly, the change was made with the support of both major parties in the parliament and hence we do not anticipate a more humane approach with the new government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1994 the coalition did develop a conscience and heart in relation to these matters. It was a wonderful occasion when they refused to vote for retrospective legislation to do a dollar a day compensation for illegal detention. I may be wrong about the details, but I do know that the coalition actually stopped the bipartisan inhumanity of its immigration policy over the last four years that I have been in this place. Unfortunately, because there was the potential for that bill being used as a double dissolution trigger they reneged and went back to their current position. Now in government, regrettably, they seem to be firming up their stance. I only hope that this is not the case.

         Throughout the sordid history of Australia's response to the boat arrivals since 1989, the government has worked extremely hard to turn public opinion in favour of its harsh and unfeeling policy. As I have pointed out on numerous occasions, this is in marked contrast to the climate of welcome created by the Fraser government in the aftermath of the Vietnam War when far greater numbers of people arrived by boat than are doing so at present.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also think both major parties were attuned to the political nature of criticisms in the community. In relation to the gun control laws they have stuck true to principle, they have not been swayed by loudness of voices and they have listened to the silent majority; whereas in relation to immigration policy they
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          are determined to listen to the loudest and strident voices. They have turned a deaf ear to the silent majority—the compassionate and caring citizens of Australia who would not wish to violate anybody's human rights or ill&amp;hyphen;treat people who arrive on our shores, who would want fair and just processes to be available to everybody in this country. As I was saying, during the Fraser government far greater numbers of people arrived by boat and there was a compassionate response from the government of that time.

         The community has been bombarded with government statements that the boat people are queue jumpers, that they are the victims of unscrupulous entrepreneurs in other countries who are making money by providing boats, that they are being used by touting lawyers who want to make money out of the misery of others, and that they are not refugees anyway. Let us look at those arguments. If people who arrive by boat are queue jumpers, then it is high time the refugee convention was rewritten, because the convention describes as a refugee a person who is outside their home country and is unable or unwilling to accept the protection of their own country. I have often wondered where the queue is. It must be a very long queue by now, as there are upwards of 25 million refugees around the world according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

         What about the unscrupulous boat providers? Certainly, people are reported to have paid large sums of money to get a place on a boat. That presumably implies that someone is getting rich from this trade in uncertainty. But what does that have to do with Australia's obligations to assess their claims for refugee status? What about the touting lawyers? As Mr Sidoti pointed out in his communication to me, there are many lawyers in this country who have jeopardised their financial wellbeing through their willingness to take on the cases of asylum seekers on a pro bono basis. They have shown precisely what the phrase `pro bono' should mean: work for the good; work for the good of the community. I commend the many lawyers I have seen who have taken on very heavy and

         Finally, the government argues that these people are not refugees. The usual lines are that they are economic refugees—whatever that may mean—or that they are simply trying to improve their economic lot and are not refugees of any description. They must be rather like the early settlers, if this definition is supported. They must be like our ancestors who arrived on these shores. Apparently it was okay in those days for them to be so&amp;hyphen;called economic refugees who were seeking to improve their economic lot.

         What we have to bear in mind is that asylum seekers do not label themselves with a little badge before they leave their home country. They do not say, `I am an asylum seeker.' They flee for their lives. They do it in secrecy, and they might use all their financial means to try to secure passage on a boat. When they arrive on our shores and see
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          people in uniform, are we really entitled to assume that they will say, `Ah, a wonderful department of immigration officer whom I can trust immediately with the stories of my persecution back home, even though I can't speak his language and I don't know who this person is.'

         We really do not know that the communication is there for us to assess whether they have the capacity to know whom to speak to and what words to say. To define them as economic refugees because of their phrasing or because of the way they seek to express their reasons for being here in response to questions that they may or may not understand and implications that they certainly do not understand is another matter. No-one is arguing that everyone who seeks refugee status will be granted protection, but the refugee convention makes it abundantly clear that the question of whether a person is a refugee can be answered only in terms of the individual case. Blanket decisions are not possible where refugees are concerned.

         At times the previous government sought ways to overcome that requirement—for instance, with the decision to sign a safe third country regulation pertaining to Sino-Vietnamese in China. That was one of the decisions I forgot when mentioning the numbers of disgraceful pieces of legislation that have come into this place. That move was one of the more reprehensible steps along this long and sorry road, because it ruled out whole categories of people who might seek asylum here while still upholding the need for individuals in other groups to prove their case for protection.

        <para first-indent="16">
         However the government might like to paint the picture, the fact remains that there are refugees among those who arrive without authorisation—whether they are 4.6 per cent or 46 per cent. The record proves that 46 per cent of boat arrivals who came before July 1994 were granted refugee status. They were found to be refugees. Even after the hardening of the government heart in July 1994, people have been granted refugee status. Even under the grudging, miserly system which now prevails, people are being recognised as
         <break page="2567" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          refugees. So now we have more legislation to change the rules.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The rules being changed now are an attack on fundamental human rights for everyone in this country. This legislation strikes at the heart of this country's human rights structures. If the parliament is prepared to countenance this change, it demonstrates an extremely worrying trend in the way this country values the rights and freedoms of individuals. The bill seeks to make sure that no&amp;hyphen;one will be able to volunteer information about legal advice and protection visa applications to people in immigration detention. Not only will no&amp;hyphen;one be able to; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner is not allowed to and the Commonwealth ombudsman is not allowed to volunteer information about legal advice and protection visa applications.

         People so being held are to be entirely on their own. We are asked to pass a bill which contains a provision which, if it were not so serious, would be funny. It is a laughable situation, except that it is an extremely black, tragic comedy. Proposed new section 193(3) proposes that the government may deny legal advice and other information to an asylum seeker unless the asylum seeker makes a written complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or to the Ombudsman. The mental image is staggering. A boatload of people arrive on the north&amp;hyphen;west coast of Australia. The people are picked up and transported to Port Hedland detention centre. Of course, the first thing they will do is ask for pen and paper so that they can write a complaint. No doubt, they will even ask for stamps and we could just about anticipate that future legislation will make explicit that asylum seekers are entitled to stamps.

         The irony of that is this: I wonder how many senators think that people arriving from another country—probably one with an authoritarian government, possibly with a corrupt local bureaucracy—will think their way through the arcane provisions of Australian migration legislation and realise that they will need to write such a complaint. We also ask whether English is their language and whether they can write in English. Is that the

If they do not have to write this letter to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner in English, I wonder what the name is for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner in every language from which asylum seekers come.

Is that the picture that the parliament wants the world to have of Australia's commitment to human rights?

The department received an opinion from a specialist at the Division of Molecular Medicine of the John Curtin School of Medical Research that, considering the lack of appropriate medical care available in China, sending this child back is a de facto death sentence.

We all need to remember that this is the same Treasurer who said that the tax system cannot be riddled and rorted and who pursued the state premiers with the sales tax exemptions.

        Mr Costello has not today or at any other time in this debate given a coherent set of reasons for this concession being reintroduced.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Is it because there is increasing confidence among the Victorian public transport campaigners that the City Link project might not be eligible for the concessions after all because of Premier Jeff Kennett's little gift of closing down public roads to corral traffic onto City Link? Is it because that breaches the competitive neutrality requirements for the concession? Is it that Treasurer Costello has been advised that City Link might need to reapply? Could that be the explanation?

        One thing I do know is that the eastern distributor can proceed without the concession.

         —The government will not change its position on this important matter. Through their actions in relation to this bill, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens have effectively posed a major threat to $2.5 billion of vital investment in development projects in Australia. That $2.5 billion is the estimated value of no less than 40 projects, which will be unable to access the development allowance provided under the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992. They have opposed it for technical reasons, which this bill in simple terms was designed to amend.

        The composition of the 40 projects is as follows: 18 in the mining industry, 10 in the tourism industry, six in electricity and gas, four in manufacturing, and three in transport and storage. Those projects are spread throughout Australia, with the mining projects concentrated in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. Development in all states will be set back. This will happen at a time when all thinking Australians are wanting a better life as well as jobs and security for themselves and their children. We need to encourage investment in this country, not hinder it, as Labor, the Democrats and the

        The amendment that Senator Kernot moved, which Labor and the Greens supported, means the virtual effective destruction of the bill. It was a very deliberate act. It was known by Senator Kernot that the amendment had nothing to do with the bill before the House. The primary purpose of the bill as originally proposed was to amend the principal act to remove certain restrictions on the restructuring of ownership of projects eligible for the development allowance. At the moment, 40 projects will be affected.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendments to the bill seek to change eligibility for another investment incentive—infrastructure borrowings. The amendments stem from a narrow concern about the use of infrastructure borrowing to support the private provision of urban roads. It is a very narrow concern for ideological reasons more than anything else, as I interpret the actions of Labor, the Democrats and the Greens. It is for ideological reasons that this amendment has been moved by the Democrats and supported by the Greens and Labor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The concerns raised, which in our view are misplaced, could equally apply to private investment in other types of public infrastructure. It is simply not appropriate to delay this very important legislation because of these concerns. Instead, if Senator Kernot and others have concerns along the lines that they have indicated in this debate, they should be debated and dealt with in their own right and not used to jeopardise the ability of projects to take up the development allowance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The concerns raised reflect the arrangements in place for projects developed in the early 1990s. Evidence from more recent projects shows that the involvement of the private sector has generated considerable benefits. For example, construction costs for the private sector, in the case of the M2, are $80 million less than those of the public sector. There has been the transfer of significant risks from the government to the private sector in the case of City Link. Infrastructure borrowings do not result in any significant amount of revenue forgone, as the borrower pays the tax that would otherwise be paid by
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the lender. Forgone revenue is, for the greater part, clawed back, as I have said.

        Widespread concerns have been expressed in recent days as the actions of Labor, the Democrats and the Greens have become known regarding the effective destruction of this bill. I have received today a copy of a letter written today to Senator Kernot from Mr Lim, the Director of Policy Analysis and Research at the Business Council of Australia. I will quote a couple of paragraphs from that letter:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Business Council understands that a potential investment of $2.5 billion over the period from now to 2002 is at risk. We also understand that the revenue effect of removing the restriction on transfer benefits so as to allow these projects to remain eligible for the allowance is approximately $90 million to the period 2002.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to recognise that the development allowance is not a concession in any real sense as it was enacted in recognition of tax biases which discriminate against major investments. In the absence of comprehensive tax reform which gave proper recognition to flow&amp;hyphen;through of deductions and losses and right-off periods for capital expenditure, it would be both inequitable and detrimental to the economy to curtail or limit the benefits of the development allowance.

        I understand that at a major business and industry lunch in Sydney today, the Tourism Task Force, whose chief executive is Mr Christopher Brown, called very forcibly on the Labor Party and the Democrats to drop their opposition to the government's bill as drafted. I will mention some of the reasons given by Mr Brown for their view. He said that tax concessions or infrastructure bonds were vital for the development of tourism transport infrastructure, such as a tollway linking Sydney's airport with the CBD or a Brisbane-Gold Coast road. Mr Brown also said:

        Mr Brown then said that the Democrats and the opposition, by denying road projects and infrastructure bond support, had expressed the belief that there was a never&amp;hyphen;ending stream of funds available for that infrastructure. I agree very much indeed with those comments.

        Anyone would think that there is a never&amp;hyphen;ending stream for investment in worthwhile infrastructure and development projects in Australia. Any person with any knowledge of the financial situation in Australia, the overall situation facing investment and our need for development knows perfectly well that there is not an unlimited supply and that worthwhile projects deserve appropriate incentives. That is what this bill is all about. It always has been about that. We have increasingly recognised that over the years and that is why we are taking every step to ensure that worthwhile valuable projects—40 of them—are going to be able to access the development allowance.

I know it is a lost cause to ask them to do so, but I do it in a final ditch to save the development projects that have been put at such jeopardy and risk by the—and I repeat the words very deliberately—rogue and unprincipled actions of the

So if you are wondering how we made the decision, it was on the basis of ideology, if you like—we call it principles. In your last quote, did the person actually say, `The bill as drafted'?

        On the matter of Mr Brown, whom Senator Short quoted, why would we be surprised that Mr Brown says today that the tourism task force wants the ALP and the Democrats to support the government's legislation? What Senator Short neglected to tell us is that this was at a function where the government is giving the task force $20,000 towards one of their projects. Of course they are going to stick to the script, aren't they? They do not want the cheque taken back, do they? Why would we be surprised that Mr Brown said that?

        So I do not see that as any development in the argument at all, Senator Short, that would make your case any more compelling or persuasive. The public policy issue is: the Senate agreed to your request for the extension of the allowance to these projects—we agreed to it. We also said it is not appropriate to have roads. It is as simple as that. We insist.

This will allow additional time for ATSIC and TSRA to provide the requisite information to the special auditor and for the special auditor's scrutiny to be undertaken for grants or loans made after 1 October 1996. I table a copy of the general directions I have made today.

I feel there has been a level of miscommunication between that side of the Senate and this side, and there was a genuine difficulty in the

         community. I believe the minister is acting totally responsibly in acknowledging that and in putting the measures that we requested in the censure motion into place with such alacrity. I only hope it will go to address the concerns of all the funding agencies that have been deeply concerned about the implications of the ministerial direction for a special auditor. I have only one request; that is, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) be notified that the censure motion yesterday was for a very positive purpose. His minister has responded to it in a constructive way. The comments that were made about our motion being simply a political tactic and thought police on a technical matter was possibly a response to ill advice. What we had in mind was exactly this. We welcome it and we commend the minister for doing it.

        On 2 June at Wattlegrove in Sydney's south-west, a meeting was held to protest the federal government's decision to undertake an environmental impact study for a second Sydney airport at Holsworthy. The member for Hughes attended. It has been reported to me by a number of people, including several parliamentary colleagues who attended the meeting, that the member for Hughes misrepresented both me and my colleague the former member for Hughes, the Hon. Robert Tickner.

        The member for Hughes claimed that she did not know about the proposal to build an airport at Holsworthy.

That is a gross misrepresentation of what I said. On 30 May 1996 I said in the parliament about the member for Hughes that:

        (New South Wales) (1.52 p.m.)--I would like to deal with two matters that are very serious for my city of Sydney. They are two examples of the duplicity of this government,
        <break page="2579" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and of the betrayal by the Howard government of the people of Sydney as far as aircraft noise and the positioning of airports in my city are concerned.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        First, I would like to turn to a speech I made on the adoption of the aircraft noise in Sydney report on 30 November 1995. I said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I just want to draw attention to why we say that we should prohibit the take-off of planes to the north from the third runway.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        This week the opposition was sprung in an article in the Financial Review by Tom Burton, headed `Coalition risks new airport noise protest'. He pointed out the fact that under the coalition government proposal--if they were to be in government--planes would be taking off to the north on the existing third runway. Of course, that is the secret plan. Although Senator Parer, as the shadow minister, was quick to deny it, I point out to the people of Sydney, particularly those people who will be affected, that this is just another way the opposition would, if they were ever in the government, vastly affect them in relation to activity that has been banned.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course, I was right and the people of Sydney were wronged, because the government of Mr Howard has gone ahead and is doing that. The major betrayal I want to refer to today is a much more serious one. It is the Holsworthy airport proposal whereby 450,000 people in various parts of south-west Sydney would be adversely affected. That is on one reading of it. That is one possibility. It is a serious proposition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The alternative is that this government is just putting up a smokescreen so that there will be no second airport for Sydney and so that some of the vested interests will not move out of Sydney. People in the inner city of Sydney will have to put up with extensive noise. Whereas our government was moving strongly to develop Badgerys Creek, this government now has stopped in the process and they have proposed this Holsworthy option.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        I remember, as a member of this select committee looking into aircraft noise, that we had a proposal from a Mr Pickrell, from a North Shore group. He was following the tradition, I think, that people want an airport but not in their own area. I quote now from the evidence where Mr Pickrell said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It may well be that this has to be surrendered as a water source and used as a recreational facility instead.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        He is referring there to the Woronora Reserve.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Closeness to the Lucas Heights atomic energy installation was mentioned in the EIS and our view is that it may be necessary to move the facility, which would get a lot of cheers from the people of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Sutherland. It certainly would not be accepted as a hindrance to a new airport.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So he referred to it in his proposal. Yesterday, I asked Senator Parer, the minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology, what the government would do as far as a Lucas Heights proposal was concerned. Senator Parer did not answer that question that I asked him yesterday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        This is very significant because in the 1979 report of the major airport needs of Sydney, where a careful evaluation was made, the people making that evaluation made the point that Lucas Heights was a significant issue as far as a nuclear reactor was concerned and, of course, that was not addressed by Senator Parer yesterday. It is a major problem and it seriously affects the financial probity of any proposal. But, of course, we do not know who the developers have behind them. We do not know what resources they have. We have no idea at all of how effective that proposal will be.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        We certainly know that it is a problem, particularly for the people of Sutherland. As soon as Mr Pickrell presented his material to the committee, I got in touch with Mr Robert Tickner, then the member for Hughes, and he immediately took that matter up in opposition, leading the people of Sutherland against that proposal. The unfortunate thing for Mr Tickner was that the government, then the opposition, did not share that with the people. This is a devious government that we face in Australia at the present. Even though Mr Howard--`honest John Howard'--came before our committee he did not present to us what he had on his mind; in other words, the Holsworthy option was never given to the people of Sutherland.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Mr Tickner fought that issue before the election and it will be very interesting to find out whether the Liberal candidate for Sutherland--she is now, at the last minute, taking up the issue--ever raised her voice on behalf of the people of Sutherland against the Holsworthy proposal. Mr Tickner pointed out to me at the time, as did other people, the reasons why the people of Sutherland opposed the Liberal and National parties' proposal for an airport in the middle of their backyard. People who saw the proposal rejected scientifically years ago, in the MANS report, are now seeing a Liberal Party that is desperate to do something after the election that they did not have the guts, the intestinal fortitude, to put to the people before the election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        I can only say that there will be another election and those people will know the issues. We will make sure that the people know the issues. Just as Senator Forshaw said, `We will make sure you know the issues'. The government will regret its duplicity because the people in the south-west of Sydney will oppose the government at the next election. We will make it a referendum on the sincerity of Mr Howard.

        (New South Wales) (7.40 p.m.)--I had responsibility before the last election for the Sutherland area of Sydney. Before question time yesterday I was speaking about the opposition of the people in the south-west of the state to the proposal by the government to have an airport at Holsworthy. I was referring to the fact that Mr Tickner, who was the member for Hughes before the last election, Sutherland council and others in that area had put to me arguments against that proposal for the airport. I would like to continue to emphasise in the Senate the points that they made. The studies have been done. Holsworthy has been rejected as a suitable site since the 1970s. The only reason to do another EIS is as a sop to the coalition's big business constituency, and that is either the existing airport organisations or the new consortium.

        --Yes, they all gave evidence in the sense that they are hesitant about the second Badgerys Creek airport--that is really the bottom line. Of course, the consortium itself has not been sighted. I do not know who they are or what they are up to. It is a mystery at the moment because we had no indication before the election of the devious deal that has been done by this government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Senator Parer's pre-election promise to the people of Sydney that Badgerys Creek will go ahead is put on hold now by this government. Is this just an excuse for further delays of Badgerys Creek? That is the worry, because that is a threat to all the people in the inner city of Sydney who at the moment have the problem of noise arising from Mascot.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        An EIS is not necessary. We know Holsworthy is not suitable. While the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek will be 15 kilometres from the nearest houses, the Holsworthy site is within three kilometres of some of Sydney's fastest growing suburbs, including Wattle Grove, which is only a stone's throw from the site. In the last 10 years 300,000 people have moved into the suburbs near the site.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The area already has Australia's only nuclear reactor, which I have referred to earlier, and the largest garbage tip in the Southern Hemisphere. The site has significant cultural value; it contains a number of Aboriginal sites. A recent unpublished survey by the Australian museum of the Holsworthy site shows that the land supports examples of sandstone vegetation and rarer Cumberland Plain
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         vegetation. Living in this environment are endangered frogs and reptiles, koalas and quolls. I know that Senator Brownhill is concerned about those sorts of things. In fact this is one of the few remaining healthy koala colonies in the Sydney region.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The Holsworthy site is part of a catchment area for the Georges River. The western site of the airport will sit almost on the bank of the river. The erosion and siltation due to the construction process will be more than the river can bear, not to mention the effect of increased aircraft and car pollution in the area. The Georges River supports a number of sensitive mangrove bird and fish breeding grounds. The residents of south-western Sydney have objected to the airport on environmental grounds and because it will affect the quality of life, as I have already mentioned, of 430,000 people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        From a more pragmatic perspective, how would an airport at Holsworthy cope with the massive floods which historically affect the Liverpool-Holsworthy area? How will the flood plains be affected by the massive earthworks required by the airport and associated infrastructure? There are high costs associated with clearing up unexploded ordnances in the military site. There are topographical problems. The land is very uneven, with deep ravines. This is the madness that this government is proposing in the geographic area that is proposed for Holsworthy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Waste cannot be used to fill the ravines because of settlement problems. One hundred and forty million cubic tonnes of earth landfill would have to be found to level the site. Sutherland council told the Senate aircraft noise committee that they doubted whether there was enough landfill anywhere in Sydney to fill the ravines.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The southern part of Holsworthy was rejected as a possible site in the 1980s because of the constraints already mentioned. The northern part of the site was advocated by the Pickrell group, which I have referred to earlier, but that part is too close to the residential areas. In contrast, the MANS study in the 1970s pointed to Badgerys Creek as a suitable site for a second Sydney airport. The same report rejected Holsworthy, as I have said already. Although there is some local opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek, the proposal has a great deal of local support.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Liverpool council, a very large council in Sydney, and other local bodies in the area have welcomed Badgerys Creek and indeed have planned infrastructure on the assumption that the airport would go ahead. In contrast, Liverpool and Bankstown councils have vowed to fight the Holsworthy proposal. It is not insignificant that the Liberal Party has dodged the by-election in the Bankstown area. They know the people of Bankstown know

        The federal government has already spent $800,000 on the Badgerys Creek site. No-one will be living within 15 kilometres of the Badgerys Creek airport site. That contrasts the thousands who currently live within 15 kilometres of Kingsford Smith airport. Suburbs such as Sutherland, Engadine, Waterfall, Menai, Woronora, Lucas Heights, Milperra, Panania, Revesby, Padstow, Picnic Point, Fairfield, Granville, Hammondville, Chipping Norton, Moorebank, Guildford, Chester Hill, Parramatta and Lidcombe will be affected. The proposed east-west runway points directly at Minto and Macquarie Fields. Planes will fly over both Westmead and Auburn hospitals and the long-established retirement village of Hammondville.

        So much for getting away from it all by going bushwalking or camping in the Royal National Park. This national park is one of the oldest in the world, but to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and this government it is just another flight path. Minister Sharp is calling Holsworthy `an insurance policy'. That is the ultimate insult. Meanwhile, there is no insurance and no security for the thousands of people who would be affected by this proposal. Their lives are on hold. They cannot sell their homes. They could not move out of the path of destruction even if they wanted to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Mr Sharp has added fuel to the fire by emphasising Holsworthy's supposed advantages as a site. One of those advantages is that the site is big enough to accommodate future expansion--whatever that means. It is cold comfort for the people of south-western Sydney.

        I must comment on the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, who is a Liberal member of parliament. She says that, when she was a candidate, she did not know about the possible Holsworthy airport site. Robert Tickner certainly did. He spoke out. The Sutherland council spoke out. I know she does not live in the electorate, but that is not the real problem. The real problem is that she is not believable because she has no excuse for not defending the people of her electorate.

         This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a schedule listing Government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.

         The practice of presenting this schedule to the Senate follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August

          1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently the former Labor Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. In those cases, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Senate was taken as the date that the response was presented, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.

         Senate legislation committees are often required to report on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations and therefore require a response are listed in the schedule.

         The schedule does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Senate Standing Committees on Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills, though such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.

         —The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) has more significance than perhaps the Senate recognises. Many senators who have made contributions so far have pointed this out. Senator Spindler and Senator Chamarette have made excellent contributions. It is sad that this is the last time that they will have the opportunity to speak in this chamber.

        Section 256 of the Migration Act has been quoted in this debate. In some respects section 257 of the act is more worrying. Section 257 states:

        If people are going to be imprisoned or have their reputations ruined, then they certainly should have legal advice. This bill will stop anyone telling them what rights they may or may not have or explaining section 257 to them. That is a matter of considerable concern.

        People have said that the difficulty with all of this is that people who are in fact refugees may be denied the sorts of rights that we would like to think they have. It is argued on the other side that these people in many cases are not refugees. Of course that is right. But,
        <break page="2589" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         as has been pointed out again and again in this debate, that is hardly the question. The question is whether or not we are going to have a legal system that operates effectively and as well and as mightily as it should.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I propose to go through the second reading speech because I think it is not put in a way that clarifies as it should. I use that word to begin to outline my worries about this bill. The first paragraph of the second reading speech says this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Migration Act 1958
        </emphasis>
        to clarify the rights of certain people—
       </para>
       <para>
        Now that is not right. It does not clarify; it changes the rights of certain people. Clarification is not needed. The clarification is contained in the decision in respect of which this act was brought in. So this is not a proposal to clarify at all; it is a proposal to change. I would like that to be clarified.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the third paragraph it says this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The onus is on unlawful non&amp;hyphen;citizens who arrive without a visa to advise officials as to why they have come to Australia and if they wish to seek legal advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps I can be given an answer to this when we come to a later part of the debate, but the problem is that in a certain sense it does not do that. The onus is not, as presently the law reads, to do that because they can be given advice as it now stands and then they can seek legal advice if they want to. The onus arrives only, surely, when they get to know that they have a right. Perhaps that is badly put. I will put it this way: to say the onus is on them is correct to a certain extent, but the law is not that they have to bear that onus on their own. They are able, as the law presently stands, to discharge that onus after getting advice from people outside. That is perhaps the more accurate way of putting it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the second reading speech this is said:
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This approach is clearly intended by the Migration Act, and has been upheld by the courts in a number of recent cases.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is not quite the case either. It talks about section 256 making provision for access to legal advice by persons in immigration detention, but only where the person in immigration detention requests legal advice. That is true, but it does not follow that that is what was clearly intended by the Migration Act in the sense that the Migration Act intended that no method should be available other than out of the person's own head. The Migration Act does not intend, as it presently stands, that people will not be able to get outside advice on a non&amp;hyphen;solicited basis. It does not presently intend that because the judge made it clear that that is not what it means.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The last sentence of the fifth paragraph says this:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The effect of this action would have been to ensure access to legal advice, despite the fact that none was requested.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is not accurate either. The only way they can get legal advice is if they request it. What the act says, as it now stands, is that they can be advised that they can take legal action and, in the light of that knowledge being given to them, they can then request it. Why we need a bill to meet that last sentence is beyond me.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The effect of the action that I previously spoke about would have been to ensure access to legal advice despite the fact that none was requested. The fact of the matter is that people request the advice: the lawyers cannot force themselves onto these people. All the lawyers can say is that they are there ready to give advice if it is wanted, but to imply that these lawyers or advisers from outside will force their legal services on them is not correct. That part of the second reading speech, along with the rest of those matters, should be put right.

         The last sentence in the next paragraph reads this way:

        <para>
         It does not do that at all. The intention of the Migration Act has been set out in the decision of Mr Justice Lindgren. The intention of the
         <break page="2590" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Migration Act is that it operate, together with all the other law, in the way that the judge has said it does. So if we are going to change the law, let us change the law on actual principles—not on a set of propositions which are just not correct.

         The next paragraph says:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Since the Federal Court's ruling RACS has sought access to all recently arrived boat people. In other words, RACS is engaged in a direct attack on the fundamental underpinnings of our capacity to manage effectively the boat people issue.

        <para>
         That is really an insult to people from RACS. I have nothing but the highest regard for people who work in the immigration department and in the Attorney-General's Department, but I have also got high regard for the people that work in RACS.

        <para first-indent="16">
         They are not doing that. They are not trying to ruin the system. What they are trying to do—whether rightly or wrongly—is to see that people know what rights they have when they come to Australia. If we want to stop those rights, then let us alter their rights. The reason we have these great problems is because of the constitution, and that has been put in argument before in this debate, and it is section 75(v.) of the constitution that has everybody worried.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The only way we are going to overcome this problem we have—if it is a problem—is to change the constitution. People would not want to do that because, if we take rights away from the people from outside, then we take the rights away from people inside the country. That is what has got everybody worried, and so it should. The second reading speech goes on to say:

         The approach adopted by RACS will encourage boat people to engage in unwarranted, lengthy and expensive processing.

         Whether the process is unwarranted, lengthy and expensive is, I suppose, a matter we ought to look at when we are looking at the costs of justice. But let us not say, in a derogatory way, that our legal system is unwarranted, lengthy and expensive. It might be in certain respects but, by and large, we have one of the best legal systems equipped with some of the greatest judges in the world, and to, by inference, insult the system in this

         The only other thing I want to say is that one of the problems with this suggested legislation is this: if, in fact, there are people who are rorting the system, who come out from China according to a plan, they are going to be the ones that know about section 256 because the people who are arranging the scam will tell them about 256. The only people who will not know about 256 are likely to be the people who are the genuine refugees. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        —by leave—I thank Senator Kemp for these documents. Can I say at the outset that the opposition has always maintained that we have not had all the documents on this matter, and we still maintain that now. I would like to put the Leader of the Government (Senator Hill) on notice at this particular stage that, when we resume in budget session, in the estimates process we will ensure that other documentation which should have been made available to us is made available.

       I particularly refer Senator Hill to this because he has responsibility in this place to represent the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

       Documentation always throws up new aspects and new matters or confirms old ones. It is interesting to see in this particular case the documentation indicates that we are talking about cessation and termination in a document marked 30 April.

      <para first-indent="16">
       I have two other concerns that I wish to place on record. One is that there are disturbing suggestions from within the Liberal Party in South Australia that documentation relating to this matter has been destroyed—documentation which may in fact be quite important if this matter ever goes to the High Court. I have placed that on the public record during the course of this week, and that documentation is something that we are very concerned about. For anyone to destroy documentation which should be produced in this place is Nixonian in the least. Once again, Senator Minchin, we place you on notice that we will be seeking out that documentation. We also suggest to Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris in this context that if she does get to

      <para first-indent="16">
       The other matter that needs to be raised in respect to this is that there is some suggestion that there has been a secret deal done in South Australia to have Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris resign and then to have her position filled by a secret arrangement by the Premier of that state. Can I say to the Senate that, if Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris is not validly elected to the position, then she has nothing to resign from.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There is a matter that may in fact still have to be argued before the court and I think over the next few days, and before any decision is taken by her or for her by Administrative Services or by this place, there needs to be very careful attention given to her status. If she was not elected validly, then she does not have a position from which to resign. The government ought to take very close cognisance of that particular fact because, unless this matter is cleared up by the highest judicial authority, then it may linger on during the next three, four or five months.

         —It is appropriate that the last time I address this chamber is on an Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's report. It is of particular interest to the ABC and deals with whether or not the ABC is being commercially alert in the area of co&amp;hyphen;productions. This is a matter of significance at a time when there are the usual tight budgetary constraints on expenditure and money going to the ABC. The Australian National Audit Office surveyed all Commonwealth budget funding entities engaged in any joint venture, partnership, collaborative agreement or ongoing contractual relationship with the private sector.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The reason I was interested in this from the ABC's point of view is that, as the report said:
         </tab>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        ABC Television—
       </para>
       <para>
        with co&amp;hyphen;productions totalling about $35 million a year—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        has well&amp;hyphen;established arrangements for managing the technical production aspects of the co&amp;hyphen;production process. However, there is no comprehensive  documentation of the reporting of progress of program production to management other than budgetary outlays. As a consequence, the sequence of activities from initial identification of a possible program topic through scriptwriting to production and management of ongoing returns runs the risk of not being properly coordinated. There is scope for improved and better documented program delivery procedures to identify clearly the various steps (and their associated milestones). Without these and their associated reporting requirements, there is an increased risk to program delivery and of cost overruns.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to stress `and of cost overruns'. ABC Television management, according to this audit report, has:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . advised the ANAO that although there are no published guidelines regarding the commissioning process the current practice is sufficient and clearly understood by all staff involved in the process. It is intended that the ABC's Efficiency Review and Audit Unit (ERA) will revisit the process with a view of identifying any areas of improvement. However—
       </para>
       <para>
        and I must say this on behalf of the ABC—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        the ABC is not aware of any instances where a co&amp;hyphen;production has not been properly coordinated or resulted in increased risk to program delivery.
        <break page="2593" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, this case is one of those situations where the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General is suggesting that the ABC should go by the book, rather than perhaps using its nous or experience. There is always going to be a serious problem in areas like this because the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General says that in the ABC:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . individual managers tended to use their experience to minimise technical risks; for example, expensive or complicated segments in an ABC Television co&amp;hyphen;production are completed first or given highest priority to ensure there is time to reshoot if there are unforeseen circumstances such as bad weather but there was no explicit strategy to minimise the business risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's point is simply this. The report says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . ABC Television was exposed to a number of financial risks without adequate contingency plans or safeguards in place. For example, a major justification for the expenditure of some $10 million to produce additional episodes of a series was in order to enter the North American market. However, the ANAO found no evidence of any market or sales analysis in support of this expenditure decision. The ABC has advised the ANAO that the main justification for the production of the extra episodes was a domestic transmission need—
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, domestic rather than the overseas market. Whoever is right, the fact is that there clearly are some financial risks and there is, I would think, a need for proper procedures. The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General then goes on to another, I think far more serious, problem, that is, the extent to which the ABC has been using its financial power, its status, to get the best possible deal out of co&amp;hyphen;productions. The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Discussions with the private sector suggested that Commonwealth agencies did not always fully appreciate the strength (and value) of the Commonwealth's negotiating position and might not be as well prepared as perhaps they could be prior to the commencement of negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, this extends far beyond the ABC. I think 61 such commercial arrangements were examined by the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. He says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This was confirmed by a general lack of adequate documentation in ABC Television to support the various positions adopted and the tendency to react to offers from partners rather than take the initiative and drive the proposals. It was also suggested that a key motivation for industry to seek a Common
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         wealth partner is to gain leverage through the relationship i.e. to an industry partner the relationship is possibly often more important strategically than the immediate financial benefits. The ANAO considers this position deserves better recognition by Commonwealth agencies in general.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that insufficient consideration is given to the revenue raising or savings opportunities offered by the two ventures examined—
       </para>
       <para>
        that includes the ABC—
       </para>
       <para justification="CENTERJUST">
        . . .              . . .             . . .
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ANAO also observed inadequate monitoring of royalties due to the Commonwealth. In 1992 the ABC's Efficiency Review and Audit Unit brought forward six recommendations covering the need for a management information system to ensure management was aware of the financial performance of co&amp;hyphen;production investments. To date these recommendations have not been implemented . . . the ANAO noted that details of returns owing to the ABC on one series were some 21 months overdue.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is from an organisation which is continually crying poor. Clearly, there is scope for considerable improvement. The audit office says further on this issue:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there is scope to improve the financial returns or savings available to ABC Television—
       </para>
       <para>
        and it notes this is also the case for Australian Archives—
       </para>
       <para style="Other">
        . . . from their joint commercial dealings by giving greater prominence to such considerations in the development and negotiation of arrangements in the first place as well as in ongoing monitoring mechanisms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ANAO concludes:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there are opportunities for better planning and management of these joint commercial arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that there will be increasing numbers of joint commercial arrangements of this kind. It is important that there be proper guidelines set down—not that I am suggesting that all these things should be done by the book; often they need much greater flexibility. There is obviously scope for a better system.

         Finally, I would like to thank the Auditor-General, his staff and his predecessors, particularly Mr John Taylor, for the excellent work they have done on behalf of the parliament and people of Australia to ensure that proper financial standards and full accounta bility requirements are being met by government and instrumentalities. I hope my Senate colleagues who remain in this chamber after I have gone to serve the government in another role continue to support the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and his work in this parliament.

         —I also want to raise a matter to do with Senator Alston's portfolio of communications and the arts, and it concerns Australia Post. I am normally a very great defender and supporter of Australia Post, its role in Australian society and the service it provides. I think it often gets very badly maligned. People use it as an easy excuse for letters not arriving when they have actually not been sent in the first place and that sort of thing. So I am always very defensive of Australia Post. I think the service is actually better than most people's impression of it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The complaint I want to make today about Australia Post relates to their withdrawal of a complete service: the air parcel service within Australia. This has been done, it seems to me, without any proper public announcement. I have not seen any advice to us. I have not seen any advertisements in newspapers or press statements to that effect. There have been small notices in post offices saying that this service will no longer exist next Monday, 1 July.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The withdrawal of this service means that there are basically only two options when sending parcels through Australia Post: surface mail or express post. I think the express post service is very good. In fact, for some parcels it is a very economical and worthwhile service. If you can get a parcel of under three kilograms into the appropriate express post satchel, it goes anywhere in the country for $7.50 and, if it is going to another capital city or other places within the network, overnight delivery is guaranteed. As senators would know, a service which costs $5 is available for smaller parcels under 500 grams.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problem with the withdrawal of the ordinary air parcel service is that, if people want their parcels to go faster than surface
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         post, they will have to use express post. For a small parcel that is under 250 grams, which could have gone anywhere in the country by air for $2.50, people will now have to pay $5—a 100 per cent increase. The slightly larger small parcels which are under 500 grams used to go by air anywhere in the country for $3.70. We will now have to pay $5—something like a 35 per cent increase.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said before, parcels between 500 grams and three kilograms can, if they fit into the right satchel, go for $7.50, which is not bad. But beyond that the sorts of rates that are charged for express post are very expensive and involve substantial increases compared with the air parcel charges at present. And if you are sending parcels outside the express post network you do not get the advantage of the 24&amp;hyphen;hour service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For people who say that $80 is too much to pay for sending a fairly substantial parcel by express post—and it would be of that sort of order, especially if it is going some distance—the alternative would be the surface parcel service. I am not saying that is a bad service but it is slow, especially for more remote communities. The boat across Bass Strait operates only three nights a week. If you are in Tasmania and you do not post your parcel on the right day, it adds substantially to the time it takes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also this disadvantage to Western Australians, Northern Territorians, North Queenslanders and perhaps even more so to the residents of the island territories of Christmas, Cocos and Norfolk islands, who use the air parcel service quite substantially for normal communications with the mainland. I am talking about parcels going in both directions; to and from all these places. These people will now have to use express post at a substantially greater cost.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Basically, I have two complaints. The first is the withdrawal of the service and the greater expense that Australians will be put to in sending and receiving parcels if they do not want to tolerate a slower service. The second is that this withdrawal of a whole service has not been given a great deal of publicity. People will gradually discover it as they seek to send a parcel, perhaps quite
        <break page="2595" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         urgently, next Christmas. Australia Post should not have done this, and in the way that they have.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I hope that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) will look at this matter, discuss it with Australia Post and convince them that they should reverse their decision. We are not just talking about a change in the rate of charge per gram for a parcel or anything like that. We are talking about the total withdrawal of a whole service that people have been used to in this country. Once the disadvantaged areas of the country that I have referred to hear about it, they will regard it very seriously. I appeal to the minister and Australia Post, which is a body I support very strongly and have defended over many years. I hope that they can organise things in order to reverse this for the benefit of Australians who need this sort of service.

        I rise on the adjournment debate tonight to address some remarks to the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) in respect of the public defence the Prime Minister mounted which I heard on ABC radio to my total dismay this morning. That defence by the Prime Minister of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) was about Senator Herron's censure in this chamber yesterday, which was richly deserved. The Prime Minister said that Senator Herron was censured for a slip of the tongue. With the greatest respect, he is wrong.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Among other things, Senator Herron was censured in here for not using his tongue on behalf of the government to talk to ATSIC. He failed completely to talk to them before setting out on a course of action which was about to force out of work thousands of ordinary Aboriginal Australians employed on the so-called work for the dole scheme, the CDEP. They are among about 30,000 ordinary Aboriginal Australians who voluntarily elect to accept less money to work on community development schemes than they would get by exercising their rights as ordinary Australians in getting unemployment benefits. I think they are doing their communities and the country a lot of good.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because of the decisions that were taken by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Prime Minister's government, more than 200 at just one community were told yesterday that they were about to be sacked. If the Prime Minister does not believe me, I can give him their telephone number. They live at Fitzroy Crossing. I am sure that they would be very glad to take his call.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am sure they reckon, just like me, that, as the Prime Minister heads back to Kirribilli House for the weekend, he ought to do a bit of reading and reflection. He ought to bring himself up to speed. The Prime Minister said on ABC radio that the thought police and the word police were hovering around Senator Herron. I do not think the people at Fitzroy Crossing who were told that they were to be sacked yesterday would consider themselves
        <break page="2596" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in either category. They are just ordinary Australians who were trying to go about a day's work. Senator Herron's decision was stopping them.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Prime Minister said that his knowledge of Senator Herron is that of an immensely compassionate man who has devoted his life to the relief of suffering. The people at Fitzroy Crossing unfortunately know him as a man who is making them suffer. The Prime Minister also used the expression `politically correct'. I do not think anyone could accuse or ever has accused me of being politically correct. I have certainly been accused of calling a spade a shovel more than once. I will tell you what I think political correctness has now become. Political correctness has become a gag that is designed to prevent discussions on things that need to be discussed. I can understand the sensitivity of the Prime Minister about political correctness because, from the tone of those statements this morning, he is still wearing like a crown of thorns the scars of the Asian immigration debate from 1988.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to turn to another expression the Prime Minister used in that interview. I was shocked and dismayed to hear him use it. It was that disgraceful and pejorative expression `the Aboriginal industry'. I have followed John Howard's career for 20 years. I have never heard him utter that expression before. It is a pejorative expression loaded with false racial undertones. It supports and fosters the worst misconceptions in the community about Aboriginal Australia. The last member of this parliament to use that expression of whom I am aware was the honourable member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson. She used it as a guest columnist in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Bulletin
        </emphasis>
        on 11 June. She was kind enough to define it for us. This is what she said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        My comments on reconciliation . . . certainly spurred the Aboriginal Industry into action.
       </para>
       <para>
        The member for Oxley then defined the phrase `Aboriginal industry' in what I believe is the accurate definition held by people like her. She said that the Aboriginal industry:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . has developed over the years into a culture, feeding off the taxes of ordinary, hard&amp;hyphen;working Australians. It has attracted a mix of black and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         white activists, politicians, academics, ex&amp;hyphen;politicians and people who see themselves as community leaders.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Oxley was expelled from the Liberal Party for using racially derogatory language and sentiments, all of which are caught up in that expression. She must be absolutely delighted today to know that the party from which she was expelled now has as its leader the current Prime Minister of Australia, a man who is now talking her language.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Prime Minister also said that Senator Herron was a caring and compassionate man. I also know a distinguished and compassionate Australian who has spent most of her public life helping to alleviate suffering. She is one of this country's most distinguished Australians. Her name is Lois O'Donoghue, and she is the chairperson of ATSIC. She is also suffering because of the decisions of Senator Herron.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the Prime Minister does not believe me, he should check the article Lois O'Donoghue wrote for the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        newspaper. I am sure if he has not seen it, his press office would be happy to give it to him, and he should read it. She said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You can imagine the rage and frustration of many Aboriginal Australians when they read and hear about rorts in places such as the Redfern Legal Aid Service . . . faced with all of the desperate needs of their home communities.
       </para>
       <para>
        She also said that people who rort the taxpayers' dollars should be nailed. I agree with that. Lois O'Donoghue also went on to say, rightly, that, despite all of these comments, we should not be afraid to face the facts.

        Let us look at another scheme in Australia, the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It costs the Australian taxpayers more every year in disbursements to farmers and miners than is contained in the whole of the ATSIC budget, including the third that is spent on the CDEP scheme. Senator Baume just talked about endorsing the National Audit Office. A report of the National Audit Office was tabled in this parliament a short time ago, and it identified more than $30 million worth of losses through maladministration of this scheme.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Prime Minister, put yourself in the position of an Aboriginal person who is watching and listening to this debate for just one minute. Are you angry that nobody in this parliament is screaming about the identified losses of over $30 million from the diesel fuel rebate scheme that Senator Baume has just told us about? No. All we have is wall to wall protestations about keeping the scheme in its entirety. No-one is screaming for greater accountability. No-one is screaming for a general direction to be issued to freeze all payments

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It takes a lot of work to get CDEP schemes off the ground. Is there maladministration in some of those schemes? Of course there is. Should you stop funding all of these schemes—including the majority that are properly administered—while you sort it out? I ask the minister fairly: should you issue a ministerial direction to freeze all of the outlays from the diesel fuel rebate scheme while you sort out the rorts in that? Of course you should not; only a fool would suggest that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What the government did was make a totally unnecessary and ill considered decision in the politically correct name of Aboriginal accountability. It would have closed down all of these major elements of the CDEP scheme—the good along with the bad—without a single word to the organisation that in fact administered them. One of those communities desperately tried to talk to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs about this. They faxed him and phoned him for three days, and they could not talk to him.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Today was an extraordinary day. The cold hard facts are that the minister walked into this chamber to finish this debate. He tabled his new ministerial directions, which in fact put off the application of this special auditor for a full three months until October. If he had bothered to go to ATSIC, they would have told him the mess this would have caused. The decision not to even talk to them about it was not only reprehensible but stupid—stupid for the government because, if
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          they had sought advice as they should have, none of this mess would have happened. It all would have been unnecessary. The hurt, pain, distress and confusion caused to the Aboriginal communities would have been alleviated and the government would have looked in far better shape than it currently does.

       It should be noted that many goods can be either consumer goods or business inputs depending on the use to which they are put.
