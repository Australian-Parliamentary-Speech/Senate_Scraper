That has been the practice in relation to formal matters or procedural motions and there is no problem with that. But if you are seeking something as important as setting up a select committee into uranium mining and milling, then I think you should at least tell us what the objects and purposes of your proposal are in the same way as the Greens did, because we are particularly interested to work out where the Greens sit vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis the Labor Party on this particular issue.

        This bill sets the scene for a co&amp;hyphen;operative approach to legislation in this Parliament. The legislation before us today was initiated in the last Parliament and was supported by the Coalition. Today we are honouring this support and invite the Opposition's continuing support of these amendments concerning investigative powers held by the Health Insurance Commission.

        These powers permit the Health Insurance Commission to obtain information and conduct searches in order to monitor compliance with Medicare guidelines. They also enable the Commission to execute search warrants and seize materials for the purposes of evidence.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This legislation will enable the continuation of these powers following the encouraging report from the Australian National Audit Office which will soon be tabled.  The `Impact of Sunset Clause on Investigatory Powers Follow&amp;hyphen;Up Audit' will confirm that the safety mechanisms employed by the HIC have ensured that powers have been used correctly.

        By repealing Section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 and Item 68 of Schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995, this legislation will enable the HIC to continue to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions against providers and requesting practitioners who abuse the system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 specifically provides that the entire Act should cease to have force on and from 1 July 1996. The sunset clause resulted from concerns expressed before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the broad ranging powers provided for in the Act offered scope for corruption and abuse of delegated authority by officers of the Health Insurance Commission. It allowed for a reasonable period of time, roughly two years, for Parliament to make a considered judgement about whether the powers had been abused in any way by the Health Insurance Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No evidence of improper activity by the Health Insurance Commission has arisen during this period. Moreover, the conferred powers have improved the Commission's ability to effectively detect and deal with Medicare non&amp;hyphen;compliance and fraud. It is, therefore, important that those powers now be preserved in order to give full effect to the role and function of the Health Insurance Commission as a regulatory body over Medicare practices and fraud.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similarly, Item 68 of Schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995 provides that Item 66 and the amendments made by Item 66 of Schedule 1 of that Act cease to be in force from 1 July 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Item 66 ensures procedural fairness in relation to the seizure of evidential materials for the purposes of investigating Medicare fraud and over&amp;hyphen;servicing. It does so by imposing an obligation on authorised officers or officers assisting the Commission to return material seized for the purposes of evidence in the course of conducting searches and investigat

        This bill establishes that certain measures should be kept in place to allow the continued control and enforcement of compliance with Medicare benefit guidelines.

        In the absence of any evidence that the powers delegated by the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 have been or are prone to being abused and distorted, the sunset clause incorporated into that Act should be repealed. In order to preserve a follow on provision in the interests of fairness and individuals' rights, the sunset clause incorporated into the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No.3) 1995 relating to Item 66 should also be repealed.

        This particular bill has had a tortuous history since it was first introduced into Parliament by the former Government in early 1995. The bill was initially part of an omnibus bill (the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill No.1 1995) which was subsequently divided into more manageable parts.

        This bill incorporates and re&amp;hyphen;introduces the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1995 which was passed by both sides of the House of Representatives on 28 September 1995, but was still awaiting consideration by the Senate when the Parliament rose at the conclusion of the 1995 sittings. As a result, over 600 applications for listing particular products for supply in Australia have been delayed. These applications comprise relatively simple, low risk products such as vitamin, mineral, herbal, homeopathic and sunscreen products.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government welcomes manageable legislation and particularly welcomes the innovations contained in this bill. We note that last year the former Government, who first moved this bill, also actively

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The provisions of this bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). This new process will significantly reduce product approval times to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the new scheme, products must meet the same criteria as currently exists. These criteria include a statement that the goods are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, being the purposes identified in the application for marketing, and not other purposes which go beyond the accepted indications for the therapeutic uses of the product.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the National Regulatory Scheme for Therapeutic Goods, which have been identified in its first five years of operation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A mechanism to address shortages or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the Act, the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill introduces changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the "penalty units" classification used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme, in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality, safety or efficacy from the market.
       </para>

        Also included in this bill are provisions to permit warrentless entry of premises to seize goods only where there is an imminent public health risk of death or serious injury, and where there are reasonable grounds for believing that illegal activity is taking place.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        A definition for "food" has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of "therapeutic goods" which excludes "food" but fails to define the term. What constitutes "food" in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words "prescribed dose" and "frequency of administration" included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.
       </para>

        Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the Therapeutic Administration Trust Account with the Therapeutic Administration

        The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened.

        The bill also corrects a defect in the legislation regarding the ability of the Secretary to approve the inclusion on the ARTG of products for export only where those products have been refused marketing approval in Australia. In these circumstances the Secretary is currently empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods. This power is however limited to goods that have been manufactured in Australia for export only, and does not extend to products imported into Australia solely for re&amp;hyphen;export. The bill proposes that this provision be amended to ensure that the Secretary's ability to require confirmation from Australia's trading partners of their willingness to accept goods refused marketing approval in Australia, extends to all products, irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in Australia or elsewhere.

         â€”by leaveâ€”I might be able to help the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the hazardous waste bill. The only changes have resulted from the need to reduce the three different amending bills that you had last time into one and any consequential changes that would result from that procedural requirement. There are no changes in substance. The delay in introducing it was a printing problem overnight. To help the opposition, yesterday we provided an unofficial copy to Carmen Lawrence, the shadow spokesperson.

        This is the Thirty&amp;hyphen;eighth Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia.

        I say these words with considerable warmth and sincerity, notwithstanding that I strongly support the Australian people considering constitutional reform to adopt an Australian head of state.

        Very appropriately, before giving his speech opening the Thirty&amp;hyphen;eighth Parliament we welcomed his statement in expression of sympathy for the people of Tasmaniaâ€”hurt, as we all are, by the tragedy at Port Arthur on Sunday. Also, it was on his initiative that we met on Monday in one of the cathedrals in this city, representing the whole nation of Australia as it were, to pray for the people of Tasmania. In that service the Governor-General himself read from the Scripture these powerful words from 1 John 4:7,8:

        I now come to the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech itself, which I welcome in its entirety. On this grand occasion I noticed the attention given by all 76 senators in this chamber, of all 149 members of the House of Representatives, of the members of the High Court, of our spouses, of the former Prime Ministers, of the secretaries to departments, of the press. Indeed, it was a grand occasion for the parliament, as has been the opening on all 38 such occasions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The speech was succinct, positive and clearly displayed the values and objectives of the new government, the coalition government led by John Howard. I noticed that here in the centre of the chamber the leaders of the government, Prime Minister John Howard and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, were, if possible, the most attentive of all as it was on their advice that the Governor&amp;hyphen;General was outlining the government's program for the three&amp;hyphen;year period of this Thirty&amp;hyphen;eighth Parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There were no surprises. This is a government intent on keeping its promises. But, on
        <break page="93" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         an occasion such as this, where there has been a change of government after 13 years of a Labor government and we have the inauguration of a Liberal and National government, we can expect a flourish of announcements, we can expect a statement of idealism. It is therefore not surprising that we have reference to `excellence', `cohesion', `great responsibilities', `national challenges', `unequivocal commitment', and references to particular areas of policy, such as a realistic defence policy, a constructive foreign policy, an active trade policy, and so on.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I say again that these are good aspirations, these are the appropriately flourishing words expected by the people of Australia of this parliament and of the government. Cynics, some observersâ€”I have not heard any in this parliamentâ€”might regard some of those phrases, the introduction and conclusion, as somewhat purple or even cliched. But I assure the Senate that the response of most of usâ€”I think, with graciousness, of all of usâ€”is that this is not the case because with a new government outlining the program for which it has a mandate we are not hearing hollow rhetoric; we are hearing the specific program promises of the new government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those specific programs relate to: youth employment; the promotion of small business; the reform of the labour market; raising national savings; boosting the competitiveness and productivity of the Australian economy; positive environmental measures; micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform; tax relief to assist families and self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees; new vocational and educational training initiatives; solutions to the problems of young Australians; positive policies for women, for indigenous Australians, for a multicultural Australia, for the arts, for constitutional reform, and for improving the standing of the parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The speech, as we all heard, was divided into eight parts. The first relates to the government's objectives, the second to jobs, or the economy more broadlyâ€”industrial relations reform, small business, micro&amp;hyphen;economic reformâ€”and the third part to families, community services and the elderly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fourth part relates to young Australians, to jobs and training, and the fifth to regional
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Australia which, as I do not need to remind the Senate, was one of the important battlegrounds at the last election. Regional Australia was comprised of electorates that had to be won by whoever was to become the government. The sixth part related to foreign affairs, defence and trade. The seventh part was titled `A Cohesive Society' and stressed unifying Australia rather than dividing one part from another. It emphasised `the government's commitment to govern in the national interest and not for vested interests'. The conclusion summarised these initiatives with appropriate flourish and commitment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Before moving to some particulars I draw attention to the first sentence of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech, which contained these gracious words:

        That is opening&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;parliament&amp;hyphen;speak for, as politicians would say using their vocabulary, `What a beauty! We won! The election was a success for the Liberal and National parties.' After five losses in which my colleagues and I have participated through the 1980s and 1990s, it is fantastic to have a win.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the themes of our meeting yesterday as we greeted each other was this note of celebration and joy in winning endorsement for the Liberal and National parties' programs put forward at the election. I take this opportunity to say that I trust democracy. I believe that people get it right if they are informed. Certainly, my colleagues and I cannot argue with the democratic outcome on this occasion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In South Australia, for example, 10 of the 12 House of Representatives seats were won by my party. In the Senate the Liberals will have six senators, the Labor Party four, the Democrats two. This is just one example of the dimension of the sweeping change in a vast national swing that has endorsed the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        May I also note with regard to women's representation in the parliament that South Australia continues to lead the way towards equality of representation by both men and women. As a result of the election, five of the 12 South Australian senators are womenâ€”
        <break page="94" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         nearly halfâ€”and four of the 12 House of Representatives members are women. Of all these women in the parliament from South Australia, two&amp;hyphen;thirds of them are members of the Liberal Party and my good colleagues. I congratulate them all. Indeed, I congratulate all those who  have won election from every party and every state.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me give my brief viewâ€”as I am sure this will be a theme which will be taken up in this address&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;reply debateâ€”as to why we had this outcome. First of all, Labor lost the election. After 13 years it was time, and I see the gracious smiles of Labor members opposite. They are used to some victories but they distinctly lost this one. The people of Australia not only wanted to endorse a Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party government with all the freshness and vigour of its policies and programs but also wanted to reject the failures of Labor after 13 years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are three lessons I would mention. I do not say this patronisingly to my colleagues opposite, but indeed to put it on the record for all of us. One, do not mess up the economy; it loses votes. Two, do not break promises; it loses votes. Three, do not lie and do not condone lying; it loses votes. I say that very seriously. I also of course see that the greater factor in the outcome of the election was the positive program of the Liberal and National parties. Those positive programs and policies have been summarised in the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech itself, and as we see the legislative program unfold over these coming months we will see that in action.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There were no disasters in the Liberal campaign: there was no GST, there were no hit lists, and there were no alarms set running about the reforms we envisaged. There was moderation, there was a sensible explanation of our polices, there was a direct appeal to represent all Australians. I congratulate John Howard, who superbly led my party's campaign, and I commend every member and senator for their efforts in the campaign.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         In the time remaining I would like briefly to address five particular matters: first, the wellbeing of Australian families; secondly, the essential investment that must be made in education; thirdly, the removal of all govern ment taxes and imposed costs on Australian exports; fourthly, the priority of Australia's foreign policy and trade in the countries in Asia, a priority that I have supported for many years; and, fifthly, the importance now of allowing the people of Australia to participate in and to own positive constitutional reform.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With regard to the wellbeing of Australian families, I quote a statement made by Morris West, a noted Australian author, with regard to the family in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Magazine
        </emphasis>
        just this last weekend. It touches upon a matter which I am sure is part of the incentive for the government to bring in tax relief and other measures to help strengthen families in Australia. Morris West wrote these words:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The breakdown of the family structure is very real, of that structure within which the child can be nurtured and cared for and given a set of social standards which they may later reject but which help them to survive in a moral sense. We seem to be producing on the one hand feral tribes and on the other, because of travel, closed&amp;hyphen;end societies.
       </para>
       <para justification="CENTERJUST">
        . . .              . . .             . . .
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Mechanistically, the whole protective structure of society is breaking down. The notion of `parish' or village or small town which was to a degree self&amp;hyphen;supporting and self&amp;hyphen;educating in the moral sense is impossible to administer now. Mega&amp;hyphen;cities are throwing people into total isolation, . . . The Internet, the global village . . . (are) driving people back on themselves: they are communicating with an inanimate object, with no tactile response or contact. The same with television, mere shadows on a screen . . . Alienation and isolation is becoming total. And if you look around at the debasement of children, of individuals, at repression, war, drugs, torture, then evil certainly is winning . . . the old notion of conflict between good and evil contains an essential truth.
       </para>
       <para>
        I quote that not because I agree with all of it; I am actually much more optimistic. I believe that families can be constructive in finding remedies for those evils and for those tendencies which lead to alienation and amorality which Morris West has referred to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In so far as the legislature can address these matters, we must do so as a top priority. But let me say that not everything is solved by the government or by legislation. A great deal is solved by the initiative and resources of families themselves in their personal interaction,
        <break page="95" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         by churches and by education processes and by community associations. We need to enhance and lead the forces that make for positive good and reinforcement in the family from all those quarters.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me briefly also refer to the family's current prized possessionâ€”the family home. Too often, it is a magnificent building with everything that opens and shuts but for many this prize is hardly ever used. Often the cry is, `There's nobody home.' We have sometimes seen families invest huge resources in the family home to find that it is empty or used for only six or seven hours sleep a night.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Families, in some senses, have never had so much money. They have never been richer. That is not true of all families, but I think it is true of the average Australian family. Despite this richness, many families have a reduced quality of life. For example, there is too much use of child-care centres. Child-care centres are good and they must be provided, but I think we are using them too much. Families are eating too much fast food. They are spending too little relaxed time together. I am much more optimistic than Morris West. I believe that the best models of Australian families are already addressing these deteriorations and are actually finding solutions. I wish that to be extended.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The second issue I refer to relates to the essential investment that must be made in education. I stress that there is ultimately no way to dilute the truth that the greater part of education provision must come from the public purseâ€”from the allocation of taxpayers' money through government budgets. There is no ultimate escape from the budget foundation that education requires real dollars from real governments. Although we may have efficiency reforms, avoidance of duplication, a contribution by students and parents through HECS, incentives for university research to win support from the private sector and so on, ultimately the coalition government and all governments must keep their promises for universities, schools and vocational education and training so that there will be no reductions in the real allocation of money from Commonwealth funding. The government's budgetary commitment to educ ation is a fundamental investment in Australia's productive future. The challenge is to make sure that that investment is secure.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I thirdly refer to the priority of removing all government taxes and imposed costs on Australian exports. That aspiration has been expressed by the coalition for several election campaigns. Now that the coalition can make those changes it is in a win&amp;hyphen;win situation. Those changes will generate exports and ensure the best path to prosperity for the Australian economy and the Australian people. At the same time they will generate the political capital in regional Australia and in large and small business to ensure support in the next and subsequent elections.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fourthly, I refer to the priority of Australia's foreign policy and trade policy in relation to the countries of Asia. The Governor-General's speech states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there will be no higher priority for the Government than advancing relations with countries in Asia, with particular emphasis on Indonesia and other members of ASEAN, Japan, Korea, China and India.
       </para>
       <para>
        I support this priority wholeheartedly, as would be well&amp;hyphen;known in the Senate from my speeches on foreign affairs, trade and defence matters over many years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also commend the next paragraph of the speech which states that the government will carry out its program in these areas through bilateral, regional and global negotiations. There will be direct bilateral negotiations, one country to anotherâ€”I have advocated that for many yearsâ€”which will benefit Australia. All three dimensions of negotiations will be used. The speech further states that the government:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . attaches particular importance to APEC as a forum for trade and investment liberalisation in the region that will also act as a catalyst for further global trade liberalisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I again endorse that. I believe that APEC genuinely has the bipartisan support of the parliament. The advantage is that the new government will approach achieving APEC's potential with fresh vigour and action.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The final matter I refer to is the importance of allowing the people of Australia to participate in and to own positive constitutional

I am optimistic that this process will allow the people to be all the more consulted and that it will all the more determine the outcome of constitutional reform.

        The excitement of the opening of this parliament is tempered by the tragedy in Tasmania. Violence devalues everyone because we are all transparently equal before indiscriminate violence.

        My first involvement with a parliamentary opening was on 4 May 1993 when the previous Governor-General, the Hon. Bill Hayden, opened the 37th parliament. As I had not yet taken my Senate seat, I listened to the speech from the President's gallery and I could not help but notice the expressions on the faces of the government members. There appeared a mixture of certainty borne of 10 years of government and absolute disbelief that they had been able to pull one last election out of a confused electorate. It seemed to me that the government had little expectation of being re-elected and the members were as surprised as everybody else that they were again in power.

But just as the weight of government tends to change people's perspectives, so too did his period as our head of state. He carried out his duties with decency, dignity and, above all, humour. He travelled overseas as our head of state and made constructive additions to some of the great debates of our time like euthanasia, our treatment of the aged and, in fact, the role of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General itself.

         Yesterday in the chamber we witnessed the traditional ceremony during which our new Governor-General, Sir William Deane, opened the 38th parliament and outlined the government's programs and priorities for the next three years. In that ceremony there was a coming together of the three components of what is known as the Westminster system: the sovereign, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Westminster system is a flexible system and is constantly under review but it has served the English mother of parliaments well and it has served our federal and state parliaments, and in fact other parliaments throughout the Commonwealth, equally well. It is a core element of our democracy and as Churchill said, `democracy, whilst not a perfect system, is the best.' We remain one of the few and longest lived democracies in the world and our commitment to the Westminster system has largely facilitated that.

         One component of our system is the sovereign, who in Australia is represented by her personal representative, the Governor-General.

The coalition is determined that proper community involvement will be provided in the review of Australia's constitution. We want to build on the effective system we have, not distract or falsely claim to simplify a system of government which both federally and in the six states has made us the envy of most political entities in the world.

         It is worth being reminded of the view held by the former Governor-General Bill Haydenâ€”that is, a republic per se might lead to considerable political instability.

To hasten slowly is essential because ultimately if there is to be change it will be the people's choice. I am pleased that we will legislate to ensure the flag cannot be changed by any government without considerable effort. I am sure that all those who fought under our present flag will be very pleased about that.

         The great difference between a coalition government and a Labor government is the pre&amp;hyphen;eminence Labor gives to special interest groups, and especially their desire to represent and foster organised labour in a way that many of us consider unrepresentative. Unions, like any other representative organisation, have a positive role to play. I am a member of a unionâ€”the National Farmers Federation. But unions, like political parties, should exist only on the basis that they earn their keep. They have responsibilities, not just rights. The fact is that almost all Australians believe that.

         The opposition is committed to a 100 per cent government&amp;hyphen;owned national carrier. I believe that selling part or all of our communications carrier, worth some $24 billion, would be an act of gross irresponsibility in itself. For the government to claim that it will be a more competitive company after privatisation is just arrant nonsense. It has been corporatised and it is already competing very successfully in the international market.

         We made our position crystal clear in the election campaign when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on January 23, `Telstra is simply not for sale.' The opposition also regards as thoroughly objectionable the government's approach of making environment policy some kind of bait or trade&amp;hyphen;off for the Senate to agree to the sale of Telstra. That also is an absolute nonsense.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra is a very strong, very vibrant company which achieved record profits of $3 billion in 1994&amp;hyphen;95. It is aggressively seeking and claiming new markets in Asia. Its value has increased from $18 billion when John Hewson wanted to sell it to around $24 billion now. We believe that inevitably a partial sale of Telstra would lead to its complete privatisation. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has never hidden his intentions. In the election campaign, Mr Howard promised that a third of the company would be sold in the term of this government. He never denied, of course, that all the $24 billion resource would be flogged off in the longer term, including to non&amp;hyphen;Australian companies.

         I particularly want to concentrate this morning on this very shabby link that has been established between environment funding and the sale of Telstraâ€”the holding hostage of environment funding in this country to the partial sale of Telstra. I must admit it was good to see that Tim Fischer fessed up to what it was all about, that the link was merely a ploy `to captivate a Senate vote', to use his words. I think only Tim could say
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that, but we all understand what he means. He said that on 2CS on 2 February 1996. The link was a ploy `to captivate a Senate vote'.

         I think we need to get very clear that it was not because the hearts of those in the coalition were in the environment policies that were presented by them at the election: their land and water degradation programs, which we have heard something about already today, the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin, national river care, coasts, clean seas and the national reserves cooperative program. It was not because their hearts were in it. Understandably, of course, these very environment policies were ours, were Labor's, and they were stolen for electoral reasons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition concocted the shabby link because it wanted to flog Telstra off by captivating the minor parties. The dry agenda far outweighs the wet. I think the coalition failed in this shabby trick, failed in the election campaign, to convince a majority of Australians that this was a reasonable proposal. I think, without doubt, it was the single biggest negative that the coalition had in that election campaign.

         Labor, of course, made very clear its level of commitment to the environment. We have always believed the environment in this country should be supported with adequate public funding with no strings attached. We actually happen to believe that the environment, and its protection, is a vital issue in its own right.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In our own time in government, without strings, we were able to ensure the protection of Uluru, Kakadu, the Franklin River and, more recently, Jervis Bay, Shoalwater Bay and the Hinchinbrook Channel. In our term we expanded the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 14 per cent of the region to 98 per cent of the region. We introduced the national biodiversity program, the best forest policy this country has ever seen; the endangered species program; the national reserves cooperative program; the save the bush program; the one billion trees program; the Antarctic mining ban; the national corridor of green; the river health program; Waterwatch; national

         Each and every one of those achievements, and the many other achievements that the Labor government made in environment policy, were made with no strings attached. Any government that is worth its salt should really show the same level of passion and commitment to protecting the environment without blackmailing the electorate. I do believe the coalition for a very long time has shown a very clear uninterest in environmental issues.

         Labor does not accept that the government has an unfettered mandate to sell Telstra. During the election campaign, the Labor Party made its position absolutely clear on this issue. I well remember the day in the election campaign when the announcement was made in relation to the part privatisation of Telstra and establishing the link to the coalition's environment policy. I well remember that some 60 minutes after that policy became public it was tagged as, `This is the Telstra environment policy'. I well remember that many of us in the Labor cabinet at the time very quickly considered what our approach would be.

         In the 1993 election campaignâ€”in fact, well before the campaign commencedâ€”when an issue of similar significance came forward, which was the establishment of a goods and services tax in Australia, Labor made a decision that it would not oppose that measure in the Senate. We made our position clear, and we made that position clear because of the amount of time there had been for public debate on Dr Hewson's program, which had been exposed to the electorate some 18 months before the election.

          announced its policy. We did not waver, we have not wavered, and we will not waver. We gave a commitment to those people who voted for Labor in the House of Representatives and the Senate that we would do everything in our power to maintain Telstra in public ownership.

         We have heard from a number already in the chamber that the Liberal Party has a majority to put its programs into effect. Undeniably, the Liberal Party does have a very handsome majority in the House of Representatives. It is a truism, of course, that it does not have a majority in this chamber. There is no doubt that some Australians who voted for the coalition in the House of Representatives did not vote for coalition candidates in the Senate.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Throughout the election campaign, from the time the environment policy of the coalition and the proposal to partially sell Telstra was announced, the position of Labor, the Australian Democrats and Green candidates on the Telstra issue became clear. I have never been in any doubt that some voters may well have cast their vote in favour of coalition candidates in the House of Representatives knowing full well that the chances of the Senate passing legislation to enable the privatisation of Telstra were extremely remote.

         I believe that we do always need to take account of the impact our parliamentary system and processes have on the concept of mandate. No-one in Australia expects any opposition to just roll over and allow legislation to flood through the Senate or upper house without appropriate scrutiny. No-one believes that. A free flow of legislation, a rubber stamp by the Senate, does appear to be Senator Hill's dream scenario, but it has never happened beforeâ€”never in Australian political history.

          I also want to make this point: in Labor's approach to opposition in this chamber we are going to be both sensible and constructive. We are not going to take the same approach that the new government parties did in this chamber when they were in opposition. Just this morning when poor old Senator Kemp was floundering with his first efforts as Manager of Government Business in the Sen ate, I was there to assist him. The government received the assistance of the opposition just this morning.

We will not be obstructionist. We will not be resorting to the same sorts of tactics at which the coalition became expert over 13 years in opposition. We are not going to involve ourselves in deliberate disruption. We are not going to involve ourselves in time wasting. We are not going to involve ourselves in filibustering. We are going to behave in a sensible and constructive way.

         In relation to the Telstra scam during the election campaignâ€”and that is what it was: a scamâ€”we believe we have an absolute obligation, an absolute commitment, to the people who voted for us, and we intend to keep the faith with them. We indicated what we would do loud and clear during the election campaign. We do want to take this early opportunity to give the Senate a chance to indicate its view in relation to the part sale of Telstra.

         We also have concerns about the manner in which the part privatisation policy was presented. That is of concern to us. I point out that the coalition pulled out its rolled gold environment vision at the last moment in the middle of an election campaign and linked it to the sale of Telstra without giving the electorate time to digest the sleight of hand that was involved.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I happen to believe that the two campaign promisesâ€”environment and telecommunicationsâ€”are chalk and cheese, except one was the political bait in a clumsy trap, as Mr Fischer said, to captivate minority parties in the Senate. Why did the sale of Telstra need bait? I suppose because without the environment policy no-one at all would swallow the privatisation of this vital public utility that delivers cross&amp;hyphen;subsidised services across the nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Liberals, I think, know that there is strong community opposition to the sale of Telstra and that Australians will not swallow the sale of Telstra. Labor is not going to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          swallow the sale of Telstra. We will respect majority opinion always and, I believe, in this respect we reflect a clear majority view and, certainly, a Labor constituency view in the electorate.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not think that anyone in this chamber should feel comfortable and relaxed about Mr Howard's promise that only a third of Telstra would be sold during his first term of office. We have seen already a clear propensity on the part of this new government to break the election promises that were made, such as the promise that only 2,500 public sector workers were going. Already we have got department heads hinting that not only will there be very significant numbers more going than the 2,500 indicated in the election campaign but, of course, now those numbers will not be from natural attrition.

         So I think that there will be a great deal of concern in the community about the government's willingness and commitment to honour its election promises. The key election promise in relation to the proposed sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra will be no more than just the thin end of the wedge, as will be the proposal of limited foreign ownership. I do urge the Senate to take this early opportunity to reject this proposal by supporting the amendment that I have proposed.

In this instance, the new government has given considerable attention to drafting a suggested set of sessional orders that I think is both fair to all senators but also reflects the need and commitment of the government to get its legislation dealt with by this chamber.

       You will see that we build upon the past sessional orders and the experiences of the management of this place that have been gained over a long period of time. In fact, there are not very many changes that we are suggesting from the contents of the last set of sessional orders.

       Most of these provisions, I would have thought, are not contentious in any way. We had a few contentious ideas but during the consultation process we actually removed them. So I am surprised that today we apparently do not have support from all corners of this chamber.

        The first of these sessional orders relates to the reference of bills to committees. This is a good practice which was adopted some time ago in this place. It allows for an accelerated process of consideration of government legislation by committees and is as an imp rovement in many ways on the committee of the whole debate within the chamber. I think that all senators believe it has worked reasonably well. I think the legislation committees that receive the bills through this mechanism could do even better in encouraging the contribution of the public to the process.

      <para first-indent="16">
       One of the advantages of taking the bill out of the chamber and into the legislative committees is that the committee can then listen to the community. A strong democracy in many ways is demonstrated by the level of contribution of the community. Certainly, the interest groups that are based in this cityâ€”the professional lobby groups and the likeâ€”become aware of these considerations by committees and do contribute. It would be good if the wider public became better aware of the process of consideration of these bills in committees and were given the opportunity to contribute. I do not think, as far as I can work out, that there is any concern about reinstating the provisions for reference of bills to committees. But if there is, no doubt we will learn of it in the very near future.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The second of these sessional orders relates to time limits for motions and amendments to refer bills to committees. As I recall it, that is again reinstating the existing provisions. I have not heard any suggestion that there is a wish within the chamber to change from those procedures.

       The third sessional order that we put before the Senate today is that which deals with debate on bills received from the House of Representatives, which is what we commonly refer to in here as the cut&amp;hyphen;off motion. Over a long period of time the Senate has sent a message to the government of the day that, for it to effectively operate as a house of review, there is a need for legislation to be given adequate time for consideration and therefore orderly process and the orderly introduction of bills into this place is sensible practice. Unfortunately, Labor failed to appreciate that and therefore the Senate, in the past, felt that it needed to entrench that sentiment within the sessional orders.

       The fourth sessional order is that which imposes limitations of debate in relation to motions for suspension of standing orders.

       The fifth sessional order relates to the powers of parliamentary secretaries. Again we have simply adopted past practices, so I do not think that there will be any dispute there. In passing, for the benefit of Senator Faulkner, there is an argument that it might be useful practice for parliamentary secretaries to appear in estimates committees in relation to portfolios in which the minister in this chamber has a representational capacity. Nevertheless, as we objected to that on the last occasion, we think that it is probably not worth while revisiting that now. So the proposal we have here is in the same form that was previously agreed to by the Senate.

       The sixth proposed sessional order relates to the speaking times for debate on motions. There has been in this place a trend towards encouraging shorter speeches. From time to time, we have objected to that; nevertheless, on reflection, I think it is sound practice. Whatever cannot be said in 20 minutes is probably not worth saying.

So this motion goes a little further than the previous sessional orders, but it is in a direction consistent with what I think has been the sentiment of the majority in this chamber. There may be some individuals that want to argue against that. I certainly would

       The eighth is that which deals with times of sitting and routine of business. The times of sitting in this place have always been a subject of vigorous debate and little unanimity. I have witnessed many of those debates over the last 15 years that I have been here, whether the Senate should or should not sit at night, whether it should start early in the morning, whether it should sit during the lunch break and what should be the terms and conditions if it does sit through the lunch break. What there is general agreement for, these days, is that the old practices of sitting very long hours into the early mornings is unwise Senate practice. As my colleague Senator Herron would say, it is bad for health. I think that all senators these days believe that that is the case, and I hope that that practice of the past will not be revisited. Certainly, it is not accommodated within the proposals that we put.

       We are suggesting that on Monday and Tuesday the Senate meet from 2 p.m. to enable cabinet meetings and the like to take place on Monday mornings and for party meetings to take place on Tuesday mornings. We propose that the Senate sit from 2 p.m. until 6.30 p.m., after which there will be a dinner break for an hour and the Senate will continue to sit until 10.30 p.m. That would be relatively consistent with the House of Representatives, which now gets up at 11 p.m. We have decided, on reflection, that two evening sittings on the first two days of the week would be sensible Senate practice. It would enable more business to be transacted, which is what the public wants of us. It would not require the Senate to be sitting unreasonably late hours. Therefore, we are putting it to the Senate for its consideration today.

        Once the issue of the times is settled, there is the issue of the routine of business within those times. We have sought to protect the times available for non-government parties and individual senators. It is a very important part of the review process and of this chamber's wider role as a second chamber. We have also sought to provide blocks of time for the government's legislative program. That would be a first if the Senate agrees to that today. I think it would be a sensible reform. I would have thought that the Labor Party, which constantly complained about the time for its legislation being encroached by other business, would also come in here today and say in good faith that that would be a sensible reform. I look forward to hearing Senator Faulkner's response to that suggested change. We have designed this to protect time for the opposition and for individual senators and minority parties. We have suggested some block periods of time for government legislation, and I commend that to the Senate as a sensible practice.

        The ninth sessional order concerns the consideration of government documents. I do not think there will be any problem with that. Matters of public interest is item No. 10, which reinstates the existing practice. Proposed new sessional order No. 11 deals with time limits for questions without notice. That has been the subject of long and tortuous debate in this place as well. Rather than re-visit that debate, we have suggested a continuation of the existing times. I presume that that will continue to be supported by the chamber. The twelfth sessional order relates to the limitation of debate on motions relating to answers to questions without notice. I think those time limits will be supported. The last sessional order we provide relates to the consideration of committee reports and government responses, which I think is also in the same form as before.

         It will therefore be evident to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that what we are putting up for the consideration of this chamber for its sessional orders for this session is very much what we have had in the past, with just a number of changesâ€”in particular, some changes to the sitting hours which we think flow from our experiences of recent times. When I say `our experiences', I mean the experiences of senators as a whole. The reform would give the government some block periods for the consideration of its legislative program, which would seem to be reasonable, and some further reduction of speaking times.

         I therefore commend these new sessional orders to the Senate. As I said, they were circulated to honourable senators last week, so there has been plenty of time for the opposition party, minority parties and independents to form opinions on them. We would certainly wish that they be adopted today and put into place; otherwise, as I understand it, we revert to the old standing orders which were the subject of previous reform and therefore would be considered by most to be a less preferable alternative.

       I put to the government and minor party representatives in the chamber that, by the commencement of the next parliament, we should have obviated the need for this sort of debate by incorporating, where there is agreement across the chamber, many of these agreed sessional ordersâ€”most of them are agreedâ€”in the standing orders. That would be a sensible reform. I would be happy to cooperate with the government to ensure that we see that significant step forward in Senate process and procedure.

       But I suggest to the government that the sensible way of doing that is to have either formal or informal negotiations. I believe that by Monday of next week we ought to have an agreed position. If we do not have an agreed position, at least we should be in the position of ensuring that the areas of disagreement are absolutely limited to just a few issues.

I think it would really simplify the entire debate if we adjourned until 6 May the motion that we are currently discussing, as suggested by Senator Faulkner, but if in the interim the sessional orders in relation to all matters revert to those used in the previous sittings. If we do that, my understanding is that some of the matters covered in Senator Hill's motion will be automatically put in place as they are identical to those we had in the last sitting. Some will not, and those remaining matters can be dealt with when we resume after adjourning.

       Let me just go through a couple of things that Senator Hill said. First of all, he said `during the consultation process'. This sounded as if there was a consultation process. The consultation process, as far as I know, was as follows. Senator Kemp certainly did try very hard. He had a paper which was very well written and informative, and he did come around and discuss that with me. That was consultation, and I thank him for that.

       If there is one thing that we in this chamber should have learnt from the last session of parliament, it is that, if we want to get something that will work, we have to have general agreement. I think that the current government probably knows as well as anybody that, if you disagree with what has been imposed on upon you, it is very easy to destroy the business of the Senate. It is far too easy to do. Imposition with numbers is something that the current opposition, when they were in government, tried not to do, because that is exactly what happened to them all the time.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I would rather that did not happen to this government. I would rather that did not happen to any government. The way to get over that is to have round table consultation, either informallyâ€”which, I think, in this instance, is the best way to go, because we want to do it pretty quickly, and I think we canâ€”or else through the Procedure Committee. The last Procedure Committee inquiry into the days and hours of sitting had some very forceful evidence about long hours, not enough sleep and that sort of thing. I hope we will keep that in mind for any other consultation that we have.

       We agree with a lot of the proposed sessional orders. As Senator Hill said, a lot of them are identical to the sessional orders that
       <break page="115" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        we adopted in February 1994 after the last large Procedure Committee report. The first sessional order dealing with the reference of bills to committees was put forward as a Democrat motion many years ago, in the 1980s. It was Senator Macklin's idea in the first place. We still think it is a very good idea. It enables the public to have an input into bills, which we now all agree is a very good thing. So of course we are still going to think that is a good thing. The second suggested sessional order deals with time limits on motions and amendments to refer bills to committees. In general, I think we do have to have more severe time limits. Senator Faulkner has made that point already, far better than I could.

       Debate on motions for suspension of standing orders has to be limited. That was an extraordinarily sensible sessional order. I do not know why it is not in standing orders; I believe it ought to be. That was put in sessional ordersâ€”like the first one on Friday committeesâ€”many years ago, I think in the early 1980s. We really should have that in standing orders. Why do we keep putting it back into sessional orders when we think it is such a good idea? Why don't we just put it in standing orders and, if it turns out to be a disaster in 50 or 100 years, we will change it again.

       I have no problem with the proposed sessional order dealing with the powers of parliamentary secretaries.

If I recall, it was the last opposition which thought it

        was a bad idea. I shouldn't give this away, but I will: I said to Senator Kemp, `As you will recall, Senator Kemp'. He said, `Never say that to me. Say, "As you will not recall, Senator Kemp"'. That was very nice of him. That is a lovely sense of humour, and I enjoy it. As anyone who reads

We ought to consider going back to the 1994 sessional orders and working under those. This is only until Monday. I was going to say that I don't know why we are having this debate in the chamber and not outside, but I guess there is not an awful lot else to do in the chamber. So it is fair enough really.

The consultations have been informal, with some senators being immediately forthcoming with their views and others wanting to take some time. There has been an attempt to put forward the government's position so that we could receive the views of the opposition, the minor parties and the independents. This debate has so far shown that we seem to be in blazing agreement. I think I heard the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, say that he agrees with 95 per cent of the government's proposal. Agreement has not been reached on the precise sitting times and there are some issues arising in relation to the routine of government business.

When in government this opposition made an art form of broken promises. The worst aspect about it was that it was then a government which had no intention of ever keeping its promises.

The tax on fuel put a special and extra burden on the less well off in the Australian community, and so it went on.

        That assertion was never once rebutted by any of the former government ministers during the election campaign. Indeed, the contrary was the case from the Prime Minister down. Despite that unequivocal assurance, two days after the election the new Treasurer was handed figures showing that the budget would be in deficit for the entire period of the forward estimates. For 1995&amp;hyphen;96, instead of a surplus of $720 million, we inherited a deficit of $280 millionâ€”a deterioration of $1 billion. For 1996&amp;hyphen;97 the picture was even worse, with what Labor had said would be a surplus of $3.4 billion in fact being revealed two days after the election to be a deficit of $4.9 billion. That is a turnaround of $8.3 billion in the budget bottom line.

        <break page="122" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The deceit practised by Labor and Mr Beazley during the campaign was twofold, of course. The first was that they pretended that the figures were not available. Secondly, they pretended that the budget was in surplus. Mr Beazley deceived the Australian public during the election campaign and now he is trying to continue that deception by denying the legiti macy of the Treasury figures. On 17 Aprilâ€”a couple of weeks agoâ€”Mr Beazley said:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We don't accept the figures that have been put forward. This notion of an $8 billion hole is largely a fraud.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet during the election campaign, Mr Beazley said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As far as we are concerned, the Treasury estimates that we had in connection with the last budgetâ€”and they were Treasury estimatesâ€”stand for good and we stand by them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now that Labor is out of office, the Treasury figures apparently are not good enough for him.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The only fraud being perpetrated is by Mr Beazley himself and his Labor colleagues.In stark contrast, the coalition government will ensure that the Australian people will be fully informed on the Commonwealth's budget position at the beginning of each election campaign period, as we outlined in our proposed charter of budget honesty. Mr Beazley in the last couple of weeks has rejected this valuable reform initiative, which is further evidence of his lack of commitment to open government.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So let there be no doubt about it. Despite Labor's efforts to conceal the fact, there is an $8 million black hole. Equally, there can be no doubt that the responsibilities for this huge deterioration unquestionably rest with the Leader of the Opposition and the previous Labor government. Labor deceived the Australian public during the election. It is inexcusable for them now to try to continue that deception.

         â€”I thank Senator Baume for a question that is long overdue and in need of a decent answer. Quite clearly, there are some people out there who have not been listening. The fact is that most other countries in the developed world went down this track a decade ago. They have not all done it because they have had budget problems of the magnitude that you lot inflicted on the Australian community. They have done it because they understand there is a very real benefit to consumers in having a more efficient telecommunications company.

        What you have in Australia at the moment is a company that is facing enormous challenges. If you look at the measures of its performance and productivity, you will find that it is sadly wanting. I know that is because the trade union movement and you effectively provided a veto over a number of the actions that were needed to be taken, but we have now reached a point of crisis. Telstra does need to become a lot more efficient, and it will become efficient if it is privatised because you will start to get price signals. You will start to have people focusing on the bottom line and wanting to ask the hard questions to ensure that that flows.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are very significant consumer benefits that will flow from our package. As a result of the sale of one-third of Telstra, we will then be in a position to deliver a number of consumer benefits, not just the safeguards that will remain in legislation in terms of universal service obligations, price caps and the extension of the untimed local call option to businesses. You well know that all those consumer safeguards are there, so you do not have any concerns on that front.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What you ought to be concerned about is a much more efficient telecommunications industry. If you have the highest local call charges in the world, if you are about 30 per cent off the pace in terms of OECD measurements of performance, you desperately want a company that can perform and deliver benefits to consumers. That is why the scrutiny of the marketplace will make a very real difference. It will also provide an opportunity
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         for Australian citizens to invest directly in the company and, to the extent it performs better than it should, they will reap that direct benefit and they will get preferential access to those shares.

        The usual furphy about foreign ownership has been put to rest. There will be an absolute limit of less than 12 per cent of the company in foreign hands and less than two per cent in the hands of any one strategic investor. We are absolutely confident that the Australian community will respond in the way they have to privatisations of telcos around the world. That will mean that everyone is a winner from an outfit that has so much to deliver but has been shackled by your government over the years. Telstra employees will get a two per cent benefit and that is a major improvement on their current position. They will have a stake in the company. They will have an incentive to produce higher productivity returns.

        I was also asked about the environmental package, which of course is an historic first.

There will also be $80 million for the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system to preserve Australia's biodiversity, and $100 million for a coast and clean seas initiative to tackle major environmental problems.

        So we have the combination of those very positive benefits and the fact that we have a chronic savings problem in the country, a problem which is identified by people such as Vince FitzGerald on a regular basis. Even your good friend Bernie Fraser knows the problem. We will apply $7 billion to reducing government debt.

Those who endorsed this environmental package prior to the election know that it very much deserves and needs to be implemented, and those who have quibbled about this proposal are simply ignoring the very real benefits that accompany such a privatisation, in terms of benefits to telecommunications consumers. I would have thought that you would be very interested in seeing local call charges come down significantly and in seeing the sort of benefits that can flow from being a world&amp;hyphen;class telecommunications environment. Telecommunications costs, as we all know, are the second highest cost input after wages and salaries. They are a very significant factor in terms of export, productivity and performance and, unless you get those cost down, unless you have a telecommunications company that is up to world practiceâ€”and not 30 per cent off world practice, as it is nowâ€”then of course thoseâ€”

Furthermore, if you were, with respect, a little more perceptive, you would see a big advantage in this trust fund because it would be outside the scope of cuts in the future. It would be a separately constituted trust. The advocates for the environment should see a special opportunity in what we are seeking to do, a one&amp;hyphen;off chance to set up a fund. I do not know where you think we are going to find a billion dollars. It is amazing.

It will be a working meeting of ministers responsible for small business from the states and territories and representatives of local government, chaired by the Commonwealth minister for small business, Mr Prosser.

In addition, many of the issues and recommendations which are identified at the summit will be referred to the small business deregulation task force for consideration.

I note the shaky start that Senator Hill got off to as Leader of the Government in the Senate today, but I do not put it down to inexperience; I put it down to the shaky ground on which he has been standing. The question by Senator Faulkner and the question by Senator Kernot later about the government's projection of the so-called $8 billion black hole is the shakiest proposition anyone can imagine. It is tantamount to the Goebbels technique of the big lie.

        The so-called black hole is a projection. As has been said by many pundits and by the government of the day at the time, any economic variable which will be routinely reported between now and when the budget is brought down will alter those projections fundamentally. We have already seen some of the economic variables come through, which have been a product of the fine economic management of the previous government. The most recent figure that caught the public attention was the low inflation rate that Australia hadâ€”a figure entirely due to the policies set in place by a Labor government. We know that things such as growth, inflation, employment and all of those other aspects that go to form what are the budget parameters will change dramatically between now and when the budget comes down.

        We also know that at this stage of the budget cycle Treasury is notoriously conservative when it puts forward projections.

We have ministers of the government going on the public record saying to lobby groups and interest groups that what they are proposing to do they admit is not good policy. In fact, Mr Moore said that with respect to  industry policy recently. He said, `What we are proposing to do will not be good policy but we nonetheless need to make these cuts.' He then trotted out this hoary old chestnut of the so-called black hole.

        The first thing that needs to be said about this is that that is not true. It is supposition and speculation which everyone knows will change. The second thing that ought to be said is that it is indeed a derogation of the government's position in the election campaign. Towards the end of the election campaign honourable senators in this place will remember at a press conference that the now Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, was asked an extraordinarily pertinent question by one of the journalists. He was asked whether he would still deliver on his election promises if the deficit that he believed at that point did exist in the budget or whether he would weasel out of those election promises.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Howard was forthright in his answer, and we ought to remember what that answer was because this opposition will be making it public at every possible opportunity. When asked whether, if the deficit were real, he would weasel out he said no, he would deliver on his policies and on his promisesâ€”yes, yes, yes, he would deliver. Now we see a major campaign of background briefing, of leaks, of innuendo and of on the record comments by government ministers that many of the undertakings and programs that were declared sacrosanct by the then opposition during the election campaign will now be cut.

We know that in the health area the razor is out and being stropped to find cuts there when the coalition was

       <para>
        The answer given by the minister was very heartening in the sense that he stressed that the government's policy was to do what it could, dependent on the support of this chamber, to improve the efficiency of Telstra by privatising it to the extent of one&amp;hyphen;third, bringing to it a sense of commercial reality which, under the previous government, appeared to be fast disappearing. We have seen in Austel reports in recent times a continuing failure by Telstra to meet the obligations and requirements of service that Austel has set. There have been disappointing response times to complaints and matters of that nature.

       <break page="132" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         A memo from Mr Blount last November contained the horrific forecast that unless there were significant efficienciesâ€”significant cuts in employment, for exampleâ€”there would be a $1 billion blow&amp;hyphen;out in Telstra's negative cash flow. We did not realise at the time that the cash flow was already projected to be half a billion dollars in deficit compared with the very significant positive cash flow the year before.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have seen employment in Telstra blow out to something like 96,000 as against 60,000, a level competitive with comparable overseas organisations and a level which, I understand, is some kind of target. That indicates present over&amp;hyphen;employment of something like 30,000 people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the previous government there was a massive mishandling of Telstra. We have seen in Senate committee hearings an arrogance by senior Telstra officials in refusing to deal properly with senators' questions. Quite frankly, the previous government was only too happy to see that take place. There was no serious attempt by the previous government to make Telstra accountable either to itself or, in particularâ€”this is why it affects this Senateâ€”to the Senate committees inquiring into the expenditure of Australian taxpayers' money. Those opposite may well say, `Ah, but Telstra does not spend taxpayers' money'. It simply happens to have massive guarantees; it has massive contingent liabilities, which it was very reluctant to come clean about before the Senate committees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra was mishandled and mismanaged by the previous government, so there is a clear, evident need for greater efficiency. Most senators on most sides of this chamber would be well aware of the fact that in many instances people with quite proper complaints against Telstra have had a disgraceful response from Telstra. There has been a level of legal deviousness which is simply unacceptable. Apparently this has been motivated not by decency or fairness but by totally non-commercial attempts to protect backsides. People have made mistakes and no-one wants to admit it. In a typical bureaucratic way, the motive is to protect the backside rather than

          I am overjoyed to hear that the minister, Senator Alston, is keen to ensure that Telstra becomes much more aware of commercial reality, that it becomes much more motivated by commercial decisions and that it becomes determined to provide a better service to Australians at cheaper rates. Privatisation of one-third of Telstra is an effective way of seeking to ensure that it do so. That is what that element of the government's policy is all about. I commend the minister for his continuing determination to proceed in that way.

He has described the performance of a company that bears no relationship to the performance of Telstra in recent years in Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is odd that Senator Baume would attempt to ruin and downplay the reputation of the company which his government is trying to sell one&amp;hyphen;third of, a company for which it is hoping to get the best possible price. If anyone in the marketplace thinking of buying Telstra listened to the remarks of Senator Baume, they would most certainly discount the price of $8 billion. In a very irresponsible way, he described this company as basically being hopeless, debt ridden, et cetera. That is not the record of this company. This company, which is owned by the taxpayers of Australia, last year employed full&amp;hyphen;time approximately 75,000 people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new government is complaining about the lack of job opportunities in Australia and says it is going to do something about that. It appears from Senator Baume's remarks that, without rhyme or reason, the government wants to dismiss a lot of workers from Telstra. They would then go on to the unemployment list. There is an inconsistency there.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at the financial performance of Telstra. In 1994-95 it had a revenue of $14 billion. The half&amp;hyphen;yearly report for this year indicates a revenue of $7.6 billion. If that amount is duplicated in the second half of the
        <break page="133" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         year, the total revenue for 1995-96 will be over $15 billion.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at Telstra's profit before tax. What an extraordinary figure this isâ€”and Senator Baume complains that the company is not performing. In 1994&amp;hyphen;95 there was a before tax profit of $2.4 billion. The half yearly figure for the present financial year is $1.8 billion. That shows an increase on last year's profit before tax. Last financial year there was a $1,700 million profit after tax. For the six months of this financial year, there is an after tax profit of $1,200 million. Again, that is a significant increase. Last year there was a dividend to the taxpayers of Australia of $944 million. For the first half of this year, that figure is $686 million. Again, if that figure is duplicated for the rest of the year, there will be an increase in the amount of dividend to the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What about creating investment in Australia? Last financial year this company spent $3.2 billion. Anyone who knows anything about Telstra will know that, overwhelmingly, that was spent in buying services and products from the small business sector, helping the small business sector grow. Senator Baume has bagged Telstra for not performing. If Telstra did not exist, small business would not get that sort of assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Telstra paid income tax of $649 million, separate from its dividend in 1994-95, to the Australian Taxation Office, which goes into revenue for the Australian people. Telstra's total payments to the government in 1994-95 came to $2.7 billion. This government wants to sell one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra for $8 billion, yet in one year the Australian government got $2.7 million in revenue. If part of Telstra were privatised, the government would still get income tax. But overall Telstra is performing very well; it is returning substantial dividends.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will finish my remarks on a point that Senator Baume only alluded to. Once you sell a third of Telstra, it will not be long before you sell the lot. That is quite clear. At press conferences during the election campaign, the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) could not rule out the fact that, in the end, the whole of Telstra would be sold.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the $2.7 billion total payments to the state after tax is taken out, or about $2 billion back to the federal government, would disappear. In four years we would be earning more than you would get for a third of the sale. I do not know what you would try to get for the full sale, but it would probably be the biggest float this country has ever seen. Whether you would ever raise $16 billion to $20 billion out of Australiaâ€”unless you sold a majority overseas to raise that sort of moneyâ€”it is hard to believe. Of course you would not be game to tell the Australian people that you put Telstra into foreign hands. The remarks of Senator Baume have been quite damaging to the performance of a company owned by the Australia people. This is one reason why we will not have a bar of the hypocrisy of the government in trying to destroy Telstra, which performs a great public service to the Australian people.

        I am glad that Senator Herron spelt out his agenda for returning accountability to ATSIC. For quite a while at least $2 billion worth of government funding per year has been going to ATSIC and ATSIC related bodies. For at least three years that I know of, there has been a total lack of accountability in ATSIC. I have expressed that concern in this chamber time and time again.

        Time and time again I raised this with him, but he took not one iota of notice.

Mr Tickner refused to have anything to do with an inquiry. So things went on. Senator Herron has had to take immediate action to look into what has been happening. I congratulate him for that.

        Madam Deputy President, you may remember that in August 1993, I moved for an inquiry into the accountability of ATSIC and ATSIC related bodies. I had not convinced the government of course, but I had convinced the Democrats and their leader, Senator Kernot, to support me on such a move. The issue was supposed to be debated on a Thursday. It was the same day that the book about women in parliament was released. With the amount of business that went on that day, we did not get to my motion. By the following Tuesday, the Democrats, who cannot hold the line for more than 24 hours, retracted their support. That was nearly three years ago. That inquiry would have saved a lot of time for Senator Herron now. No one will know what could have been done if that inquiry had been undertaken.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to a question without notice asked by Senator Schacht today, relating to funding for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today in question time, I clearly asked Senator Alston a question based on the coalition's policy speech of 18 January entitled `Better broadcasting'. In unequivocal terms, the coalition, now the government, said that it would maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC.

       <para>
        The policy speech stated:
       </para>

        We will continue to support triennial funding which has allowed the ABC to plan for the future with a greater degree of financial certainty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today in question time Senator Alston used every null and verbal device to get around saying yes or no to that commitment. He suggested that there were inefficiencies in the ABC and that those inefficiencies would provide savings, et cetera, but he would not actually reconfirm the commitment to continuing the triennial funding and at the end waffled off on something about the budget being considered.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Quite clearly, the supporters in the broad Australian community of the ABC now have it on record that the funding for the ABC is under threat across the board. The suggestion that has been speculated in the press that a two per cent efficiency dividend will be applied this year to training and funding, which would save about $10 million, is now the minimum available. Senator Alston would not even commit himself to that figure being the maximum they would take out of the ABC. He went on to talk about general inefficiencies in the ABC and most of us can take that as a code of words to say, `This means we can slash and burn in areas of the ABC.'

         . All through the document the coalition committed itself to maintaining all the existing programs and services of the ABC whether it was television or radio, whether it was in the capital cities or regional Australia, whether it was the orchestras or other artistic ventures successfully conducted by the ABC. Now it is quite clear that all of that is at risk, not just from the two per cent efficiency cutâ€”$10 millionâ€”but from other areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I think would worry many Australians is that some people in this coalition government will not be able to resist the temptation to try to run a political test across the programming of the ABC; those programs that from time to time put views and enable people to put views that the coalition would disagree with would be under threat.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This move would very much equate with what happened after 1975 when the Fraser coalition government was elected and Sir Henry Bland was appointed chair of the ABC with the task of cutting, slashing and burning the funding of the ABC and turning it around to be less antagonistic in the perception of the then coalition. We saw the ABC go into several years of turmoil in programming, funding and very low morale. One of the most important communication institutions in Australia that provides a service right across Australia to areas that the commercial broadcasting services do not reach, cannot reach or do not wish to reach was affected very badly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It appearsâ€”and I qualify that it appearsâ€”that Senator Alston may be starting down that same road because he would not back his own promise from the election campaign that the funding would be maintained. Back in 1975 Malcolm Fraser promised not to cut the funding to the ABC but when he got into government he did things quite differently. I call on the supporters of the ABC, those millions of Australians right across this country, to be aware that the institution on which they rely heavily for their information and for a diversity of views is now going to be under a funding threat from this government because Senator Alston today in this

         â€”The format currently in use for bills introduced into this parliament has evolved gradually since 1901. It is only in the last 10 years or so, however, that attention has been paid to the effect on readers of the format in which legislation is set out. This has happened in the context of a growing community expectation that legislation that affects people ought to be accessible to those people.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The accessibility of legislation has several aspects. First, of course, the text of the legislation needs to be comprehensible to its intended audience. As well, legislation needs to be physically accessible to its intended audienceâ€”that is, people need access to up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date versions of current legislation, whether in the form of reprints of acts or electronic databases containing consolidated legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For those who still use printed copies of legislation, which includes members of this parliament, the page design and layout of legislation also affect its accessibility. Document design is now recognised as a matter which can have a significant impact on the comprehensibility of documents and on how effectively documents communicate information. With this in mind, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has undertaken a project to
        <break page="136" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         improve the design and layout of bills, which will also impact on the design and layout of acts.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result of this project is a new format, which has been adopted by the office for future bills. The main features of the new format are these:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" left-indent="16">
        There is a substantial increase in the amount of `white space' on each page. This makes the pages look less forbidding, and this in turn contributes to the reader's confidence in dealing with the text.

        Running headers are used on the top outside corner of each page. The inclusion of section numbers in the running headers will make searching for particular provisions easier.

        The text of bills will no longer be right&amp;hyphen;justified. The use of a `ragged' right&amp;hyphen;hand margin makes text easier to read because it means that the spacing between words is the same in each line rather than varied, to ensure a straight right&amp;hyphen;hand margin.

        I do point out that the casino's gross profit for the year 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995 was $153,744,767.70, which was rather a remarkable amount. Although I do not have the figures before me, I suspect thatâ€”although it is for that entire financial yearâ€”the casino had not started to operate until some time through that year.

         The Senate will recall that this was a committee of inquiry undertaken by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee into allegations made concerning the administration of Australian soccer. In the first instance you have to ask yourself, `What has that got to do with the Australian Senate?' Certainly, a point that occurred to me very early in the piece was that it did not seem to have a great deal to do with the operations of the Australian Senate.

         Issues were raised by a number of people about the way in which soccer was administered in this country. This was done using the media and through the Stewart inquiry. Changes have been made to the administration of soccer, but not as a result of the proceedings of this committee. In fact, this inquiry, in the judgment of Labor Party senators who participated in it, can claim little credit for the changes that have taken place in soccer.

         My concern with this matter related specifically to the question of civil liberties. It seems to meâ€”it seemed to me when we were engaged in this exerciseâ€”that one of our prime functions as senators has to be to protect the civil liberties of Australians. Some 79 citizens were adversely named in the committee's proceedings and there were very few opportunities for those named persons to state their position and clear their names. This, in my judgment, was a very clear case of where sport and politics do not mix.

          A very large number of sensational claims were made by media outlets. Many unfounded allegations and malicious rumours were made against persons prominent in soccer. They became a subject of public vilification and in my judgment they had no effective means of redress. I think it is important for senators to not confuse public interest with partisan political comment. There seems to me an appropriate place for partisan political comment, especially in here, but it is not necessarily the basis on which we launch vendettas against individuals in the soccer community or participate in a partisan way in the feuds that are occurring within the soccer fraternity.

          As members of the committee, we indicated from April 1995 that we felt the committee should be wound up. Unfortunately, that advice was ignored. We saw an abuse of natural justice which, in my judgment, went very much to the heart of our responsibilities as senators to protect the rights of Australian citizens.

          I know it will be said that this committee provided an opportunity for people wronged to clear the air and that was often said. I would put to the Senate that none of us can be so naive as to believe that witnesses do not

           incur expenses in retaining barristers and solicitors who have to advise them on the evidence that is being presented. Witnesses incurred considerable expense in giving evidence to the committee and had great stress placed upon them which was not attended to through this committee. Many grave charges were laid against them and not all people are able to respond adequately in a committee format. They are not lawyers and are not able to have lawyers speak for them. The committee system is not a court of law. This is a simple proposition which so many senators opposite failed to understand through this process.

          In terms of specific findings there was no evidence found that Anthony Labbozzetta had done any wrong regarding the Okon transfer matter. There was no evidence presented to suggest that charges were found against individuals named. In particular, there was no evidence found against Tom Sermanni, who had been very badly wronged through the process of public vilification. It is important to highlight that Tom Sermanni was a highly respected soccer coach. In the past he acted as manager for a number of soccer players, most notably Ned Zelic whom he had managed for many years well before his departure to Europe. Mr Sermanni claimed, correctly, that he was frequently approached by young players concerned about their future. He had provided advice to a number of them without consideration of remuneration. He had been manager to a number of players and in one or two cases had advised or assisted players in obtaining trials overseas. There was no evidence of wrongdoing produced before this committee, yet Tom Sermanni's name was bandied about and his public reputation was put at risk as a result of some people within the soccer community playing politics.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It seems to me that this is an inappropriate use of the Senate and it was totally wrong for Mr Sermanni to be subjected to this sort of abuse. Equally, in regard to the allegations against Mr Ron Smith, that he had trafficked in players, again no evidence was presented to suggest that he had done anything wrong.

           involved in. It is particularly insidious to suggest, as this report does, that somehow or another there was a potential for conflict of interest. Every day of the week all of us face the potential for conflict of interest. The real issue in terms of public policy and public behaviour is whether action is actually taken which is in conflict of interest with our responsibilities as public figures. Surely that equally applies to national coaches at soccer clubs. It seems to be inappropriate and just wrong to use the Senate to attack individual soccer players in this way.

          We have to ask ourselves why people do this sort of thing. It seems to me to be a partisan political effort involving a dispute within the soccer community. It does not even have any implications in a party political sense and one has to ask what sort of morality is at stake here. As senators we can all have a go at one another in the public domain and it is part of our job to strongly advocate views and defend our constituents and the interests of our parties as we see them. It is wrong to involve people in the soccer industry in this way without the capacity to reply.

          People were smeared at the time. The Australian Soccer Federation itself went through its internal process and, on reflection, the Stewart reportâ€”which the federation commissionedâ€”was one which it and Stewart should have taken greater care in approaching and putting together. Some people were smeared and have had to live with the stigma. Last Sunday I was at a game and watched my team, West Adelaide, lose to Marconi and it was quite obvious that the history of all this was something that the game still had to grapple and contend with.

At the time, whether it was the Hill-Negus group who were coming in to `clean&amp;hyphen;up the game' or our national coaches or administrators, they were all lost as to how to handle the process. They were to appear before the Senate committee. They all had their particular side of the story, but none of them really was aware of the fact that when called they were expected to be here.

It came from the stakeholders; it came from the clubs; it came from the national administration; and it came from the reform group. This is what they kept asking: do we have a right to hear all the evidence against us? What sort of right to representation do we have? What rules of evidence are there? What

          There was real confusion, as you would imagine that people not involved in our process would find themselves in, and there was real concern as to the state of rights of people appearing before committees such as this. I think there is a lesson that we have to learn here, and hopefully it is one that the Senate can take on. We need to spend some time developing rules that govern people's rights when they appear before parliamentary committees: the rights of individuals, the rights to be represented, the rules of evidence and the rights to legal assistance.

          Some of the people we are talking about here are not and were not rich, but they could have found themselves, and some have found themselves, in a situation where they would have had to commission and had commissioned lawyers to represent them, to defend themselves on allegations which, in the normal course of events, would have been consigned to the dustbin of selection processes. So we really do need to focus on the rules of this place as they apply to individual citizens in our society, and I think that is one lesson that we should take on from here.

          I think in soccer we have in Australia an asset which is not and has not been appreciated sufficiently. It is a great sport. It attracts young people and both male and female participants. It has more players than any other sport in this country. Okay, it has been built on the back of migrants from Britain, Ireland, Scotland, all parts of Europe and, in latter days, from Asia. It is a game that is growing in popularity, as is witnessed by the audience of soccer programs on both SBS and the ABC. I am looking forward to the day, though, that one of the major networks in this country recognises there is probably as much interest in soccer as there is in some of the other codes and actually gives it the kick along that it deserves.

          â€”I guess the proof of the pudding about this second report on Australian soccer is evident from some of the things that Senator Bolkus has just said. The administration of soccer has improved immensely. Soccer is stronger. I am glad to note that New South Wales is doing well, with three clubs in the top groupingâ€”I just wish Wollongong was perhaps doing a little better. But one of the intriguing things about the negative response by senators on the Labor side to this report is that in effect what they didâ€”and it was a deliberate actionâ€”was to seek to diminish the impact of this report on some grounds which they say are significant. It was a report aimed at clearing up what were some unfortunate aspects of soccer. It was aimed at assisting those who were cleaning up soccer

        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, the Ombudsman may, at the moment, be having second thoughts about the wisdom of doing that. I think we ought to take heed of the function that the Ombudsman performed in alerting us to these problems. I think the recommendations that are at the front of the report are, and will continue to be, of great relevance to the Australian Public Serviceâ€”in other words, what the Public Service is; what Australians expect their Public Service to do; and why it is necessary for the Public Service to serve the Australian public. They were matters that were considered by this committee and they are matters that are addressed in the recommendations.

I recall that that recommendation arose from the information we derived from visiting Launceston, a regional centre. I know that Senator Watson in particularâ€”I am sure he will not mind me reminding the Senate of thisâ€”was impressed by the fact that these smaller agencies, and their smaller regional offices, were having great difficulty in meeting the efficiency dividend because they had been pared to the bone, so to speak. That recommendation will have the potential to have a great deal of irony in the very near future. I ask that coalition members of the committee, particularly Senators Campbell, Kemp, Minchin and Watson, to have a look at the recommendations to which they were party.

I wonder whether the new government has even taken the trouble to address this report, which was available to it and which had been agreed to by members of the coalition. In the light of these recommendations, I think we should be asking ourselves, and the new government, whether there is any relevance in seeking information from the departments and from Australian citizens to allow us to reach these conclusions, and to see whether they have any relationship to the policies which we are led to believe could well be applied to the Public Service.

          Other recommendations may be seen to have a greater or lesser degree of irony. From what I hear of the plans, it is obvious that the new government has not taken advantage of this excellent report, which is the product of a great deal of hard work, not only by the secretariat and the senators who were on the committee but also by members of the public and the departments that took the trouble to bring to the committee their concerns and the facts at their disposal.

But all that that does is acknowledge the Department of Finance's crucial role and the increasing importance of properly resourcing such central agencies to monitor, to recommend, to initiate and to implement models of good practice, and to apply models of efficiency through the Public Service. To reduce the resources of the central agencies is surely to fly in the face of that logical step which was agreed to as being important by, I would say, all those who gave evidence to this committee.

          Of course, the reason for that is the notorious example that we have of a member of the public receiving advice given orally, taking action according to that advice or the interpretation that the member of the public puts upon it, and then finding that that is the wrong course to follow. That is a great inconvenience to the public. It is a great inefficiency and it requires a great amount of time and effort to be expended by both the citizen and the department to rectify the situation. That problem was common amongst a number of departments. We recommend that that recording be undertaken. Of course, that requires the devotion of some more resources initially to save time and to create efficiency later.

         This committee was one of the most efficient and productive committees of the Senate and I think it is a tribute to the Senate that the Senate committee system has evolved to the stage where it is now. When I look back on the last six years of my membership of this committee, I believe that there are two milestones. One was the committee report on breast cancer and breast cancer screening in Australia, which has become a template, and as a result of which there has been extensive improvement in the breast cancer screening process in Australia. It was the cause of an enormous amount of debate and ultimately led to the establishment of the Australian National Cancer Network. I think this committee can take great pride in the fact that it was the catalyst for that occurrence.

I have not got around to thanking them because it was the first time my name got known throughout the wider community. They did not know that I tabulated all those names.

          â€”As a member of the Community Affairs References Committee, I would like to make a few remarks on its report into the tobacco industry. I congratulate my colleague Senator Herron on his chairmanship of the committee and the secretariat for what is a very comprehensive and valuable report in the main. I support most of the recommendations of this committee. In fact, 27 of the 39 recommendations have my endorsement as a member of the committee. I particularly support those measures directed towards the education of young people about the dangers of smoking.

         I am certainly no advocate of smoking. There are other measures in the report which are designed to prevent young people taking up the habit. I feel very strongly about doing all that we can to prevent adolescents from smoking. At my request, the committee has recommended that the states and territories investigate the feasibility of making it an offence for underage people to purchase tobacco products. I encourage the states and territories to actually take that action.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I take the view that we should treat smoking as adult behaviour. You do have to draw a distinction between the way governments treat adults in relation to behaviour such as smoking and the way you treat adolescents. I think governments do have a role in educating and preventing young people taking up or indulging in what is a dangerous and risky behaviour. The role in relation to adults should be somewhat different in a liberal society. I think the role is to do as much as possible to educate adults about the dangers of the habit and to ensure they know the risks

          of this particular activity, but at the end of the day the risk is theirs.

         On that basis, Senator Knowles and I did put in a minority report. There are 12 recommendations that we cannot support primarily because they seek to further increase the regulation of what is already the most highly regulated industry in Australia, regulation the like of which no other legal industryâ€”and it is a legal industryâ€”has to endure.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am particularly concerned about the effect of recommendation 25, which seeks to reduce the number of retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products. This is a Senate committee saying that there should be a reduction in the number of retail outlets. This would be devastating for the small business sector of our community. I think a lot of people are not aware of the extent to which the sale of tobacco products is a vital component of small business revenue. For tobacconists it is 85 per cent of revenue, but even for service stations it comprises 40 per cent of their revenue, for convenience stores it comprises 30 per cent and for milk bars it comprises 25 per cent. It is all very well for senators to sit around and feel good and say, `Let's reduce the number of retail outlets.' These are the lives of men and women striving in small businesses and trying to make a living under already very difficult conditions and they cannot withstand this sort of recommendation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem must be treated at the source. Discouraging people from taking up the practice by education is one thing, but to actually seek to have the government act in an authoritarian manner to restrict the number of outlets able to sell the product is unduly authoritarian and not one that I could ever support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I oppose in particular the proposal that there should be further increases in the real level of taxation on this product. My objection is on the basis that there has been a 96 per cent increase in real terms in revenue from tobacco to governments over the past 12 yearsâ€”a massive increase in the amount of taxationâ€”and, of course, this falls on the lower income earning sector of our society. It is a very regressive form of taxation and one that is very undesirable.

          ACIL, the very respected economic consultancy, has estimated that smokers are already taxed $2.2 billion over and above their use of subsidised health care. So they are making much more of a contribution to the community than they have received from it for the effects of their habit. They are subsidising the rest of the community who are non&amp;hyphen;smokers. I think that is unconscionable and I could never support a proposition for further increases.

          They informed me about the need to restrict access to tobacco products. These were people who were selling the product. There were a number of reasons for that. Lots of small outlets have a very low tobacco turnover and those who were concerned about the quality of the product felt that the low turnover was leading to stale cigarettes. They therefore felt there should be rationalisation within the industry. It seems that every other industry in this country has undergone rationalisation of their outlets.

          There was also a plea by outlets for support in enforcing the no identification&amp;hyphen;no sale law. A number of people rang me and said they were sick and tired of having parents sending their kids into the shops to buy cigarettes for them. They were embarrassed about knocking the kids back and by the fact that parents did not understand the magnitude of what they were asking their children to do, which is to break the law. They certainly wanted support in enforcing that restriction.

          In recent times in the central west of New South Wales the health department conducted a survey of compliance with the law and found a compliance rate of 80 per cent. That is fine but it means that 20 per cent are not complying with the law. It means that 20 per cent could be advertising incorrectly or selling to minors.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There is another issue regarding tobacco advertising which concerns me greatly. It is touched on in recommendation 25, one of the more contentious recommendations and the one that the industry and Senator Minchin do not like. It recommends as an interim measure the isolation of tobacco products from other products for sale in outlets. It is interesting to note that newsagents in New South Wales can isolate their lotto and other gambling sales but they cannot isolate their tobacco sales. It seems to me that if you can isolate your lotto

They are taking it up at a greater rate than are young males. This is going to have an impact on health later on. We know that unborn children are affected by tobacco. We know that babies are affected by the inhalation of tobacco smoke after they are born. These issues have to be addressed. I urge the government to take this report very seriously.

         â€”What a pleasant change it is to participate in a debate in response to an opening speech by the Governor-General which is full of sanity, decency, integrity and hope for the future. It is a pleasant change after 13 years of what we have had to put up with, what the Australian people have had to put up with, particularly the false hopes, false promises and, regrettably, unsatisfactory outcomes. As was pointed out in this chamber today, we were left with a black hole.

         The government, having won an enormous endorsement from the Australian people, now has to put up with resolving an even worse mess than was admitted to during the election campaign by the Labor Party in government. As the Governor-General's speech, which outlined the approach of the government, said:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Australia is a society rich in resources of all kinds. We should not have to settle for a lower level of economic performance than other countries with fewer advantages.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is what happened under the Labor government. Fortunately, that era has ended. This government's policies, as outlined, are to fulfil people's aspirations by rewarding hard work and initiative, and achieving rising living standards, affordable home ownership and a more positive future for our children. Let us look at all those things and the way we can achieve them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Rewarding hard work involves getting rid of the nonsense involved in the present industrial relations system. People in this place who represent a clear minority of the Australian people claim that they are going to do what they can to block the massive reforms needed to the Australian industrial relations system. Apart from rewarding hard work and initiative, we want to achieve rising living standards. That is done by reducing costs and by providing incentives, which leads to increased competitiveness internationally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An interesting issue is affordable home ownership. Before the last election it was particularly disturbing to see that after a year or so of home ownership, young families all around Australia found that, as a result of the previous government's policies, they owed more on their house than it was worth. This negative equity was a dreadful blow to so many young Australians, many of whom found it necessaryâ€”perhaps because of moving for a new jobâ€”to sell their house. They faced lossesâ€”some of them significantâ€”in doing so. I am not talking about mansions, I am talking about $100,000 houses.

         The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey), my successor after an unfortunate break, made his maiden speech today. He said one of the striking things about the win in the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          electorate of Macarthur was that he won booths in what had been Labor heartland. There was disenchantment by people who had lost faith. They were no longer true believers, because of the actions of the true deceivers.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It means that we have a specific duty to ensure that we take the strong actions needed, which the previous government failed to do, to protect the opportunities of these people, to make certain that home ownership is affordable and that the government's own actions do not damage the future for Australians the way the previous government's actions did. That is why it is so heartening to hear in this speech of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General, stating the Howard government's policies, that the needs of Australian families will be placed at the centre of the national policy agenda. Small business will be promoted as a dynamic engine of our economy which can offer new jobs and opportunities to many Australians. In particular, more young Australians will have the opportunity to fulfil their talents through rewarding jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In looking at the achievements, if I can use that word loosely, of the previous government, what I found interesting was that, despite all sorts of promises and assurances and despite its attack on the 1993 coalition policy supporting a broad based indirect tax, the previous government had massively increased taxes on many of the vital products that Australians consume, without providing the offsetting tax benefits that had been promised in 1993. That dishonest campaign by the Labor Party in 1993 came home to roost. That level of dishonesty was simply unacceptable to the Australian people, and that is one of the reasons for this heartland rejection by so many traditional Labor voters of a party that simply let them down, lied to them, misled them and taxed them significantly on the very basics.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the election campaign, I found that one of the most successful dodgers being handed out outside shopping centres was one which related to the huge increases in indirect taxes, in the face of the previous government's promise not to, which hit struggling lower income groups more than they hit anyone else. They were directed at the essentials
         <break page="151" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of life. These huge increases were not as promised. They were exactly the opposite of what was promised in 1993. That helps explain the level of disenchantment.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have mentioned before in this place the huge increase that was represented in some of these areas. For example, there was a 46 per cent increase in the sales tax on ordinary passenger cars after the 1993 election, when the previous government had promised not to increase indirect taxes. Sales tax on cars went up from 15 per cent to 22 per cent. There was a 30 per cent increase in tax on wine and cider. That was a terrific boost to the winemakers and apple growers, particularly those of Tasmania. No&amp;hyphen;one from the Labor Party said anything about that in the 1993 election. Their sales tax was up 30 per cent because it rose from a 20 per cent rate to a 26 per cent rate. The previous government whacked up the price of food items like biscuits, flavoured milk, fruit and vegetable juices, cordials, ice&amp;hyphen;cream and confectionery, snack foods and soft drink by 20 per cent, from a 10 per cent rate to a 12 per cent rate. And so it goes on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many people did not realise these taxes were there. They listened to the Labor Party talking about how dreadful indirect taxes and consumption taxes were and believed them. There were huge taxes. There is one group of items for which sales tax went up from 30 per cent to 33 per cent. That was an increase in sales tax of almost one&amp;hyphen;third. That was on things like televisions, videos, watches, clocks, records, CD players, cameras and tape recorders. These sorts of things are what many people say are luxuries. Most Australians take the view that they are the normal things that Australians are entitled to have, because, after all, we are not supposed to be a Third World country, even though the previous government may well have treated us as such.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But there are other things too. Sales tax went up by 10 per cent, unheralded, unsung, unpromised. In fact, the opposite was promised by the Labor government. It lifted sales tax from 20 to 22 per cent on items like dog food. Pensioners who had a pet to keep them companyâ€”particularly single pensioners
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          whose partners had diedâ€”faced these hidden rises. The reason I am stressing this is that we have a record of a Labor government which deceived the people of Australia with its hidden, unheralded taxes which it had promised not to impose. As against that, we now have a coalition government which has given a commitment to stick by its promises. This will involve a radical change in Australian politics.

         ALP President Mr Barry Jones yesterday added his voice to Labor calls for open debate on tax reform, saying that in the aftermath of its emphatic defeat at the polls, the party could not rule out a goods and services tax in any revision of its policies.

         That is going back to basics, is it not? I can remember Mr Paul Keating, the former Prime Minister who slunk out of this business without facing the parliament after his defeat, was one of the first people to urge for a goods and services tax. Is it not incredible to see how flexible the Labor Party is on matters of principle?

         It is disappointing that the Labor Party managed to increase sales tax significantly, which is the most common indirect tax, since it came into office. It was a huge increase which it hid; in fact there was a 50 per cent increase in sales tax as a proportion of GDP since it came into office. At the same time, it was saying we could not have any indirect taxes.

         The 1982-83 budgetâ€”that is, the Howard budgetâ€”had sales tax collecting about two per cent of gross domestic product.

But at the same time in 1982&amp;hyphen;83 income tax provided 16.3 per cent of gross domestic product. It is now up to 18.4 per cent. That is higher than even in the Whitlam years. So the previous government was hitting the Australian consumer by stealth, yet at the

         There is one area of the tax system that I hope the government takes into consideration in its review of tax: tax expendituresâ€”and I am glad to hear that it will be looking at equity and such matters. There is a statement before the chamber at the moment from Treasury dealing with tax expenditures. I hope that it will take into consideration the fact that there are some benefits in some tax expenditures. Tax expenditures, by the way, represent the cost to the government of tax concessions and many people find them particularly useful concessions for various reasons such as providing incentives, in some instances, for private sector activity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is intriguing to note, though, that there has been a blow-out in tax expenditures over the last six years. Six years ago tax expendituresâ€”in other words, the cost to the government of various deductionsâ€”were $10.8 billion. They are now $17.8 billion, something like a 70 per cent increase in just six years. Obviously, this is one of the things that will have to be looked at. As the Treasury document states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While most tax expenditures could in principle be replaced by a direct outlayâ€”
        </para>
        <para>
         in other words, by a grant of some kindâ€”
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         the tax expenditure estimates refer to revenue forgone.
        </para>
        <para>
         Is it better, for example, to give people direct grants or to give people tax deductions? Clearly, that is a question the government will have to look at. There are many people who would much prefer to see things given as a direct grant.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In some areas, like culture and recreation, there is a clear benefit in providing a tax expenditure; in other words, providing incentives for the private sector to provide funding for various activities in order to get a tax deduction. These areas are not large expenditure items. Tax concessions in culture and recreation now represent only 0.1 per cent of all tax expenditures; of the $17.8 billion that these concessions cost the governmentâ€”in other words, taxpayersâ€”culture and recreation now represent only $24 million, 0.1 per cent. Six years ago, they represented a whole 0.8
         <break page="153" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          per cent. They have never been big, but they have declined dramaticallyâ€”from about $80 million to only $24 million. At the same time, the total of all these other areas has gone up from $10.8 billion to $17.8 billion.

         The advantage of having tax expenditures for the arts is that it provides an incentive for the private sector to contribute to the arts in a way that the private sector may well not find interesting or attractive otherwise. A small concession by the government encourages a large contribution from the private sector. It is arguable that without the contribution from the government the private sector may find other ways of spending its money.

         There are quite a few areas where great benefits can be achieved. Film is one that was overdone. As a result of the abuse of film credits, there was almost a reaction against it. There is no doubt that taxation incentives for the film industry, which have continued, but on a less generous rate, have been a factor in the extraordinarily dramatic success of the Australian film industry. I think almost all of the $24 million that is going to culture and recreation goes to film.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are other areas, though, that I would hope would receive a much greater stimulus, in particular funding for the area of sports activities. Not enough attention has been paid, in my view, to the capacity for people to contribute, through tax deductible items, to the sporting success of Australia. There is an organisation run by the Australian Sports Foundation, which hopefully, with the Olympics in Atlanta and the Sydney Olympics coming up, will encourage many people to take up this matter.

         I want to make my plea to the government. If there is to be a total review of tax, and in particular tax expenditures, I plead with the government to recogniseâ€”and I am certain that the government will recogniseâ€”that there is some merit in some of these areas. There is no doubt that in many other areasâ€”I exclude arts and sport from theseâ€”there has been an incredible blow&amp;hyphen;out in tax expenditures.

          I certainly endorse that. The Australian people endorsed that at the last election.

          Many people go around the place saying that they have a mandate to do something. I would prefer to see it as a responsibility to do something.

          Maybe the opposition will say that we do not have a mandate and that, really, all the Australian people were doing was voting against them. I suppose that that is a respectable point of view. One would expect most people of sound mind to take the view that the previous government was not doing a very good job and deserved to get beaten.

It would seem to me that as fewer and fewer people in Australiaâ€”less than a third of the work force nowâ€”determine that they want to be `protected' by unions, there is greater and greater need for a new system to be introduced that will provide a degree of effective protection for those people. I am overjoyed to see that this government is doing that.

          <break page="154" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Arts (Senator Alston) to make Telstra more efficient, was taken by the Labor opposition to be an attack on Telstra which would diminish our capacity to float it off. How absurd! What was being demonstrated was very simple: there is enormous scope for massive improvements in the efficiency of Telstra, and those efficiencies will emerge from its partial privatisation, because at last it will be genuinely exposed to commercial reality.

          Obviously, it is very difficult for an organisation which has been an effective monopolist for so long to suddenly change into being a competitive force. You can see those difficultiesâ€”institutional difficulties, if you likeâ€”in the dispute about Optus and Telstra sharing cabling, about whether things should be underground or overhead.
         </para>

          It has been revealed that attempts to negotiate by Optus were met with a pretty tough and brusque response from Telstra. Whoever was right or wrong, the fact remains that Australian society is having to cope with an unnecessary and expensive duplication of a whole set of cables, some of which are unsightly, because of an inability to come to a rational and sensible arrangement beforehand. I would hope that commercial reality will be a much stronger factor in future decisions of Telstra. Far from my damaging the prospects of floating Telstra, what I am demonstrating is that if past figures which were quoted by the Labor opposition showed a great achievement while it was being run badly, imagine what could be achieved if it is run well and if you get back to international standards in terms of employment and so on, and you have better work practices and a situation where commercial reality is dominant.

          I do not know whether Labor members really believe the people who complained about Telstra affecting their businesses. Maybe the Labor Party does not believe those people.

         â€”I rise to speak on this address&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;reply to the speech of the Governor-General. Of course, as we all know, it is not a speech written by the Governor-General. It is a speech written by the governmentâ€”the Prime Minister in particular. I have been in politics for nearly 30 years. I have seen governments of all persuasions, state and federal. I sat here yesterday and I have to say that I have never heard a more uninspiring speech from a new government. One would have thought that after 13 years in opposition, we would have got something more visionary, more inspiring and more exciting than was dished up yesterday.

        It does not matter about the length of the speech. That is not important. The Gettysburg Address, which I think is 267 words, is considered to be one of the great speeches of all time. So length of speech is not a determining factor of quality or of content. It was a short speech yesterday, but it is the content that really condemns it.

        I waited for an indication of some view from the new government of the practical measures they are going to introduceâ€”bits and pieces of legislation, the odd privatisation and the odd change to industrial relations legislation. I expected that there would be some theme to it.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The one theme that I could detect was something to do with improving the competitiveness of the Australian economy. That is fine. Improving the economy is a noble objective. Certainly, if you went back and looked at Governor-Generals' speeches over the 13 years of the previous government, we also had the objectives to make ourselves a more internationally competitive economy, with more effective exports, et cetera. But there was no vision in this speech about the
        <break page="155" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         sort of society Australia should have, other than a few cliches about inclusiveness, cohesiveness or anything like that. There was no indication of how that was going to be achieved.

        I suppose one of the reasons why there was so little substance about policy in the speech is in fact because, to get itself elected, the opposition had to commit itself to supporting so many of the policies of the previous  government. It would have been too embarrassing for John Howard to support the continuation of the many excellent policies of the previous government in the Governor-General's speech.

        I will return later to some individual aspects of the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech. I certainly want to return to the remarks he made on behalf of us all about the shocking events that occurred last Sunday in Tasmania. I do want to make mention of the constitutional convention that he will be calling and the issue of legislation on the flag. But as shadow minister for communications, I wish to talk about the speech and the government's policies on the privatisation of Telstra.

        We have before us, in a limited way in the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech and also from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) here in the parliament today, reasons why Telstra should be privatised. We have heard remarks from Senator Baumeâ€”probably not the last remarks, but maybe we will not have long to hear from Senator Baume, if the rumours are correct. I hear that he may be given one of the first political appointments of the new government, some ambassadorship or high commissionership overseas. Many of us on this side of politics may think that his appointment as ambassador to Liberia would be appropriate.

         â€”When Senator Baume's appointment is made, one of the things we will not have to put up with is the sanctimonious remarks the opposition made for 13 years about political appointments. Senator Baume will be the ultimate political pay-off of the new Prime Minister paying off an old friend who stuck with him through thick and thin, the bad days and the good days, of the 13 years of opposition. I suppose maybe Senator Baume, with his previous record with Patrick Partners being a stockbroker and investment adviser back in the seventies, is hankering for the consul generalship in New York, where he can be close to Wall Street and may be able to see how people like Mr Michael Milken defrauded hundreds of millions of dollars from the shareholders in America and ultimately went to gaol for his crimes.

        The comments Senator Baume made about Telstra today in the parliament are really amazing and way off the point. He has talked down and bagged one of the biggest companies in Australia. He has tried to make out to the Senate that this is a broken down company that is inefficient and appalling and that it should be privatised to be saved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I pointed out in my remarks when taking note of Senator Alston's comments, this is a company that at the moment employs 75,000 Australians full time. Senator Baume wants to sack about 30,000 of them, if you try to read through his remarks. This is from a senator who made sanctimonious remarks about the need to reduce unemployment in Australia but is quite cheerful about the idea that up to 30,000 employees from Telstra around Australia would be sacked.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Remember this, it will not be just the employees or middle managers at headquarters in Melbourne or Sydney that will be dismissed; it will be literally thousandsâ€”tens of thousands of employees of Telstra spread out across rural and regional Australia. I would have thought the National Party would be particularly worried to see the impact that
        <break page="156" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         would have on employment in small and large towns in regional and rural Australia.

        He has bagged the performance of Telstra, failing to mention that in 1994-95 this company made a profit before tax of $2.4 billionâ€”the biggest profit of any company in Australia's history. That is not a bad performance. Profit after tax was $1.7 million. The dividend to the federal government, to the people of Australia, was $944 million, which was on top of tax of $649 million paid to the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The total value added of the company for 1994-95 was $8.7 billion and that was distributed, which again points out the value of this company to Australia. The value of that $8.7 billion went to workersâ€”employees' wages and superannuation of $3.9 billion or 44.6 per cent. To the providers of capital, $506 million went as interest, and $944 million, as I said, went as dividends.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Government taxes were 7.4 per centâ€”that is, income taxâ€”and other taxes were $288 million. For reinvestment, $2.4 billion, 28 per cent, of that value added went in reinvestment. That is major investment for the infrastructure of Australia. It is investment that created jobs, investment that created growth for literally thousands of small businesses across Australia that rely on Telstra to be a major purchaser of their services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Telstra has a policy of buying Australian. It is an industry policy that, when we were in government, we were proud to be associated with. We wrote it into the policy of Telstra and into our telecommunications policy. We have no indication from the opposition when they privatise Telstra how those industry policies, those guarantees of Purchasing Australia, will be maintained. When you start letting foreign owners in, they are not going to be interested in buying from the corner store or from an Australian SME. They will want to buy at the cheapest possible price. They will import the product from overseas, and that costs jobs. It costs the jobs in the small business area.

        Telstra has a purchasing policy, wherever possible, to buy Australian. You go and talk to Ericsson Australia, to Alcatel and to other major manufacturers and they will all tell you that they only exist in Australia because of Telstra's policy for the past 30 or 40 years to buy Australian. They would not be in Australia if it were not for that Telstra policyâ€”a policy that goes right back to when it was a government department. That will all come to an end. There will be no industry development policy with the privatisation of Telstra.

        The opposition has said, `But we are only going to privatise a third of it. We are going to privatise a third and raise $8 million, and we will only allow 12&amp;half; per cent foreign owners.' We all know that will be the foot in the door. During the election campaign, on a couple of occasions Mr Howard let it slip, `That is only the first step. Maybe after the next election, if we are successful, we will look at privatising more of it.' We all know that once you privatise part of such an organisation the inevitability of the whole lot being sold will follow as surely as day follows night.

        Let us not beat around the bush here. We are talking about the privatisation of Telstra. We are told that there will be limitations on the foreign investment, the foreign ownership, of Telstra. At the moment it will be 12 per cent but, when you go to full privatisation, the government would be looking at selling Telstra and getting a price of something in excess of $20 billionâ€”the biggest float of any company in the history of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is said by many experts that you will not be able to find anywhere near the $20 billion in the Australian stock market or the Australian capital market. The only way you will get anywhere near that figure is to allow a large proportion of it to come in from overseas. Even though you may want to limit it, in the end, to get the money you want, you will have to raise the foreign limit and basically let the foreigners have as much as they want
        <break page="157" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to get the price you want. Once that occurs, every time you make a phone call in Australia thereafter the money registers will roll over in Tokyo or Paris or New York or London. Those foreign companies will get the benefit.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other aspect of the Telstra policy that the coalition has not talked about is that once you allow foreign ownership from other telcos in at any level they would not want Telstra competing with them in foreign markets, particularly in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. Some people have predicted in the next 10 years 500 million phones will be connected in the Asia-Pacific region, which will double the number of phone connections in the history of telephony in the world.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We should be in there with a big company, like Telstra, owned by Australians, by the government, to make sure we get a big slice of that action. Could you imagine that a Japanese owned company, an American owned company or a French owned telco would be very happy having an Australian company sharing with them? If they are a shareholder in the Australian company they will do everything at the board level to wind back Telstra's investment overseas so they have less competition.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Those of us who have had the opportunity to see the impact Telstra staff have made on places like Vietnam, China, Indonesia and India with the development of foreign markets that are earning income for Australia would realise we have great prospects. The privatisation of Telstra, allowing other foreign owned telecommunications companies in, will restrict our ability to develop an Australian generic nameâ€”an export earner for Australia. These are important issues which the government has not yet addressed in the debate we have heard so far.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the issues the government has tried to address is cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies and community service obligations. Senator Alston has been at some pains to say, `We will write in the privatisation legislation that we will guarantee community service obligations will be connected, will continue and will be subsidised.' I know, and anyone who has been around politics long enough will know, that you can write it in, but when a government five years
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         hence is a bit short of money and trying to raise funds it will say, `Well, it is costing us $500 million for the community service obligations.' Treasury and the Finance department might say, `Well, we know how to get you a couple of hundred million. We will reduce the community service obligations.' It would be put in the budget and through it would go. That would be a reduction. You cannot guarantee the community service obligations forever and a day even by legislation or regulation.

         â€”We had an example of this only a couple of weeks ago when Telstra approached the new government, after approaching the previous government on several occasions, to say, `We want to charge for directory assistance. We believe we can raise $80 million in a year by handling the millions of phone calls that people make to get telephone and directory assistance.' That is provided free at the moment.

So farâ€”I may be correctedâ€”I have seen no public statement by Senator Alston saying that he is going to reject such an application. The reason I believe he will not reject it at the moment is if the so-called privatisation process is allowed to run he will want to tell those companies who want to bid for Telstra, `There is another $80 million of revenue coming your way. You can charge for directory assistance.' This will boost the price at the expense of the blind, the old, the feebleâ€”those in the community who can least afford it. You cannot guarantee with a privatised organisation that all these community service obligations can survive. But there is even a wider issue than community service obligations.

         Because Telstra is a national network it operates a cross-subsidy to help, in particular, the non-metropolitan areas of Australia, Senator McGauran. Figures I have been given show that in rural areas of Australia the cost of providing a normal telephone service to ordinary Australians can vary considerably. I will use the electorate of Barker in my own state as an example. The member for Barker is the Defence minister in the new government. In Bordertown the annual access cost per line is $1,480. In Murray Bridge it is $460. In Naracoorte it is $1,650. In Kangaroo Island it is $2,360.

        <para first-indent="16">
         You cannot convince me, and you will not be able to convince the Australian public, that when you privatise Telstra and allow it to be purely market driven it will not go down the list and say, `We are not going to subsidise and lose money on providing these rural services in these areas. We have to make a quid for our shareholders.' Therefore the cost will start going up. Telstra will start changing the rates to recoup those cost subsidies from those areas. You will not be able to even out the profit, even out the national network, to have some informal cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation. Again, as sure as day follows night, the price will be jacked up.

         Senator McGauran, I will give an example from your own state of Victoria. In the Bendigo electorate, in Charlton it costs $900 for an annual excess cost. In Bendigo it is $480. In Maryborough it is $550. Again, the smaller the town, the more remote, the bigger the access cost, the bigger a privatised Telstra will start charging to provide that telephone service. These issues have not been addressed, and no matter how you write the legislation you will not be able to protect the ordinary citizen that you are supposed to represent, Senator McGauranâ€”those people living in rural and regional areas.

         I conclude with a couple of other remarks about the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech. Yesterday, the Governor&amp;hyphen;General quite rightly mentioned in his opening remarks the terrible tragedy in Tasmania and all of us in the parliament have shown how appalled we felt at this unbelievable occurrence. People are asking what can we do to stop it. I want to be blunt about this. Clearly, national and state parliaments in Australia have to take action to ban public access to these sorts of weapons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Tasmania has the loosest gun laws existing in Australia. People there are able to buy automatic and semi&amp;hyphen;automatic rifles. There have been stories in the press in the last few days about that. Let us be blunt about it, unfortunately, Tasmania has reaped what it has sown by not carrying out decent, reasonable legislation to restrict access to these weapons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In a letter to the editor the other day, someone quite rightly pointed out that even if this man was mad, if he had turned up with a meat cleaver, a knife or a baseball bat, instead of an automatic rifle, he may have killed only one or two people before he was stopped. But because he had access to an automatic rifle, he killed 35 people and wounded another 15. It was the fact that he had access to an automatic rifle that led to the killing of so many people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The argument that we hear from the Shooters Party, and its ilk, that it is not the guns that kill people, it is the people themselves, is a fallacious argument. I say quite bluntly in this place that I hope that John Tingle, who is a member of parliament for the Shooters Party in New South Wales, recognises what his party has wrought on Australia by following these policies. I think that that party, and the lobby groups that it represents, have to take some responsibility for conducting a political campaign to intimidate politicians so that they cannot carry out suitable and proper reform of the gun laws of this country. I believe that the people of Australia are now asking all state and federal politicians to do
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          something about it. If the states do not take appropriate, reasonable action, then the Australian parliament should, even if it needs a referendum to do it, to ensure that there are decent, tight gun control laws in Australia so that the dreadful events last Sunday at Port Arthur in Tasmania do not occur again.

         If we think this is an issue we can avoid, just listen to the remarks of the relatives of the victims. All of them are asking why this happened and what do we have to do. Listen to the heartfelt appeals of those relatives, particularly the father who lost his wife and two daughters, questioning how someone could get an automatic rifle and kill his family. That is a question that all parliamentarians in Australia have to answer.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One last point I will make is that in this very mediocre Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech on behalf of the new government, a speech lacking vision, substance, and any indication of what sort of Australia we should have, there was one interesting proposal which is, of course, to establish a constitutional convention to talk about the issue of the republic and related matters. I hope that when we get the detail of that, we can see that it is a fair dinkum convention which can debate the issue. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you, personally, will be keen to participate in such a convention, because you are one of those from the Liberal Party who stood up and said quite loudly that you wanted an Australian head of state, and I congratulate you for that.

         Another remark I want to speak about concerns legislation to protect the Australian flag. I find it a bit extraordinary, in one sense, that we have legislation to indicate that this flag can be changed only by a referendum or a plebiscite. You cannot do it by referendum because it is not written in the constitution. That is fine in one sense, but I wish Mr Howard had pointed out that, when the law went through to establish the present flag of Australia in the early 1950s, it was done by legislation. There was no consultation with the people of Australia. It was done by an act of parliament. Sir Robert Menzies introduced it. It went through with the support of the then opposition, but there was no consultation
         <break page="160" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

I remember very clearly a painting done from an account of our troops at Anzac Cove. The flag flying over Anzac Cove was not the current flag. It was a flag with a red background, not a blue background. The soldiers who fought so courageously at Anzac Cove fought either under the Union Jack or under a flag that had a red background.

         When you look at many of the photographs taken during the Second World War showing the places where our soldiers fought, the soldiers either fought under the Union Jackâ€”and my father certainly did as a serviceman in the Royal Australian Air Force in the Middle Eastâ€”or under an Australian flag that had a red background. Those things were changed by an act of parliament. The flag was not changed by a plebiscite. While I do not in any way disagree that if there is going to be a change to the Australian flag there should be some form of plebiscite, I do not want to hear the hypocrisy of the government saying that it has always been done this way.

        The purpose of this bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 to ensure that Australia can discharge its obligations under international instruments relating to the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced to the Senate by the former government on 29 June 1995. At the time of introduction, a small number of issues regarding the amendment of the principal act were still unresolved. In order that the progress of the bill not be impeded, it was agreed that these matters would be further discussed after lodgement, and any necessary changes achieved by government amendment. As a result of subsequent consultation, a number of amendments were proposed and formed part of the bill on which debate was commenced and adjourned on the last day of the Spring sittings on 1 December 1995. This government notes that the consolidated bill represents the subject of exhaustive discussions with all interested parties. The package addresses the need to give effect to the relevant international agreements, and also satisfies industry's need for both certainty and flexibility. After careful consideration of the consolidated bill, the government, which supported the bill when it was debated last year, has decided to reintroduce it without further amendment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The principal act was passed at the time that the Basel Convention was negotiated. At that time the major concern regarding trade in hazardous waste related to hazardous waste sent to another country for what is termed final disposal, that is for incineration, landfilling or the like. As a result, the principal act defines waste as material which has been rejected as worthless or otherwise falls within the ordinary definition of waste. As such it generally does not cover material sent for recovery. In the years since the convention was negotiated the emphasis in international debate has shifted to its coverage of materials which are traded for recovery operations; that is, for reclamation of metals or recovery of other useful materials.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Just as the trade in hazardous waste for final disposal led to an active process of transferring the environmental costs associated with the generation of hazardous waste from one country to another, and in particular from developed to developing countries, so the trade in hazardous waste for recovery operations can similarly lead to the transfer of environmental costs in an uncontrolled fashion. The Basel Convention was drafted to cover both kinds of processes, that is both final disposal
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and recovery operations, and both kinds of processes are included in the convention definitions under the single term "disposal". The Australian act does not cover a wide range of hazardous wastes from which valuable materials are to be recovered; these hazardous wastes have not been rejected as worthless or do not fall within the ordinary meaning of waste. The major purpose of amending the act is to remedy this discrepancy between our international obligations and our domestic legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Basel Convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and the many other countries which are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules. The interpretation of the convention as expressed in the principal act and with the amendments now put forward is in line with the views of other parties to the convention. In the absence of these amendments, Australia will continue to be out of step with other Parties in its capacity to give domestic effect to the convention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In accordance with the primary intention of the bill, the object of the act is to be amended to make it clear that one of its major aims is to give domestic effect to the Basel Convention and other international instruments relating to trade in hazardous wastes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The definition of hazardous waste now to be adopted is aligned with that in the convention. This will ensure that in future Australia does not find itself in breach of the convention by virtue of having adopted a definition which is at odds with the interpretation of the convention followed by others. Nevertheless, the question of definition remains central to the operation of the act, and indeed definitional questions remain the subject of very active debate in Basel Convention meetings. In Australia, a high degree of concern has been expressed because of the uncertainty of the definitions in the convention. The bill addresses these concerns through the establishment of a process to provide greater practical certainty regarding what is and is not a hazardous waste. The bill provides for the establishment of a Technical Group of scientific and technical experts who will advise the Minister on definitional questions. The advice of this group will be of great benefit in enabling the Minister to decide whether he or she believes that a material falls within the definition of hazardous waste and so is regulated.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Minister will have the power to issue Evidentiary Certificates which will be prima facie evidence that a given material is or is not a hazardous
        <break page="162" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         waste; and by compiling a list of materials for which Evidentiary Certificates have been issued, the Minister will be able to provide greater certainty to those subject to regulation on what materials will be controlled and what will not. This means for example, that it will be possible to issue an Evidentiary Certificate stating that a material such as clean ferrous scrap is not a hazardous waste subject to the act and can be traded without any controls. At the same time, flexibility will be retained to respond to incremental progress in international discussions on what materials should and should not be controlled. As an example, recent international discussions suggest that the existence of internationally recognised product specifications will be influential in deciding what are and are not hazardous wastes. The Evidentiary Certificates will not be conclusive, but will be prima facie evidence; and the definitions in the act would remain as the final means of determining the definitional question. In practice, however, the advice of the Technical Group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues, and should satisfy the needs of those who are subject to regulation for a clear understanding of their obligations under the act.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are many who would prefer to replace the uncertain Basel definitions with Australia's own list or set of criteria. To follow that course, however, would inevitably lead to Australia once again being at odds with the convention and the views of trading partners on what constitutes hazardous waste under the convention. This would risk not only breach of our international obligations but could well lead to shipments acceptable under our definitions being rejected at foreign ports, to the embarrassment, cost and inconvenience of all.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The convention itself recognises that the hazard criteria it establishes are in need of further development. There is provision for the development of national tests which would provide greater precision in determining whether a waste is hazardous. That provision is included in the relevant Annex to the convention, by reference to which the bill defines hazardous waste. Over time the Technical Group will advise on national tests to establish hazard on a more certain basis, taking account of international developments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another key concept in the convention now adopted into the act is the definition of "environmentally sound management". The convention requires not only that an exporting country obtain prior consent from the country of import before allowing the transboundary movement to proceed, but also that the country of export require that the waste to be shipped is managed in an environmentally sound way in the country of import. The concept of environmentally sound management of hazardous waste is defined in the convention as "taking all practicable steps" to ensure that the hazardous
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         waste is managed to protect human health and the environment. The Technical Group will advise the Minister to assist in determination of what constitutes environmentally sound management and whether particular facilities or processes meet the definition. For that reason, it will include people with expertise in scientific and technical, social and economic, environmental and public health fields.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The concept of environmentally sound management as set out in the convention replaces the phrase in the principal act "dispose of safely". In the principal act "dispose of safely" is defined in terms of an outcome, that is hazardous waste is disposed of safely provided there is no damage to human health or environment. By contrast, "environmentally sound management" is defined by reference to a process, that is, "taking all practicable steps" to prevent damage to human health or the environment. On the other hand, he definition of "dispose of safely" appears to exclude any assessment of effluents and emissions from the disposal process. In practice, pragmatic considerations are likely to prevail. Within the Basel Convention process detailed guidelines on what constitutes environmentally sound management have already been drafted, and these will provide the context for the Technical Group's advice to the Minister. Australia will put its efforts into ensuring that those guidelines are sound. Once again, the need to ensure that our legislation is fully in line with our international obligations is the overriding consideration in the changes set out in the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the convention the general rule is that Parties must not trade in hazardous waste with non-Parties. An exception to this is provided for in Article 11, whereby Parties may enter into agreements or arrangements either with other Parties or with non-Parties. These agreements or arrangements can set out controls which are different from those prescribed by the convention itself, provided those controls do not reduce the level of environment protection intended by the convention. The main such agreement to which Australia is a party is the OECD Decision on Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste Destined for Recovery Operations (the OECD Decision), which regulates transboundary movement of hazardous wastes among OECD countries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides explicitly for regulations giving effect to such agreements and arrangements, and for those regulations to give domestic effect to rules different from those in the convention. The materials covered by the agreements or arrangements may also differ to some extent from those covered by the convention. Thus the OECD Decision covers some wastes which are not hazardous wastes under the convention and trade in these must comply with the controls set out by the Decision; conversely, the Decision classifies some materials as non-hazardous waste (the OECD Green
        <break page="163" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         List) and these materials may be traded without a permit provided countries outside the OECD are not involved. The provisions are general and can be applied to any further Article 11 agreements or arrangements which Australia enters into.

        The procedures by which the Minister reaches a decision on whether or not a permit should be issued for a transboundary movement have been amended, once again to bring the act more closely into line with the convention. Among the changes are those ensuring that the notification and consent procedures established by the convention are followed. Another amends the existing provision that the Minister have regard to the prospect of processing hazardous waste within Australia rather than allowing export to take place. This is in accordance with Article 4(2)(d) of the convention which requires parties to "minimise the transboundary movement of hazardous waste
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of hazardous waste". The intent of this Article is met by requirements that disposal in Australia must be both efficient and environmentally sound. The intent is that a local disposal facility must be more than merely an experimental or test facility, and must operate on a commercial basis. There must be some cost effectiveness factor which is brought to bear when the Minister weighs up the pros and cons of local versus overseas disposal in deciding whether or not a permit should be issued.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The principal act already provides that there must be appropriate insurance for shipments of hazardous waste before a permit is issued. A new provision in the bill allows the Minister to require bonds or guarantees in addition to, or instead of, insurance. This recognises that where there is contravention of a permit, for one reason or other an insurance policy may not be paid out, and in an appropriate case a bond would allow the Commonwealth to ensure that there was some coverage. In other cases insurance may not be available, and a guarantee would provide the opportunity for a permit to be issued in such cases. The principal act allows the sum total of such arrangements (insurance, bonds, and guarantees) to be assessed when the Minister comes to a decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other procedural amendments are aimed at ensuring that the administration of the act proceeds smoothly and efficiently, and that all convention requirements are met. Because the convention itself contains detailed rules, it has not been possible to simplify the administrative system beyond a certain point. That is why both the principal act and the amending bill are complex. Where possible and appropriate, provision is made for the making of regulations to set out requirements under the act, in order to ensure that its administration will be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry. A detailed set
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of administrative procedures is being developed in consultation with interested parties, including industry, and will be complete by the time the amendments are ready to come into force.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The act also addresses a number of aspects of the convention which were not picked up in the original drafting process. One of the most important of these is the issue of transit permits, that is for Australian consent (or its denial) to the transiting of waste from another country on its way to a third country for disposal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is also explicit provision for more than one shipment of the same hazardous waste to be covered by a single permit. The convention allows such a procedure up to a maximum of 12 months, provided that certain conditions are met and that is now reflected in the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current system for recovery of the government's administrative costs in respect of issuing permits is unnecessarily inflexible. The bill provides for fees to be set in regulations on the basis of administrative costs of each type of permit. The Minister has discretion to reduce fees where appropriate. The fee level may not be above the fee currently prescribed in the principal act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Penalties under the act have been increased in order to provide a deterrent to illegal traffic. Prevention of illegal traffic is specifically required by the convention, and the value of some of the transactions involved requires that penalties be raised to ensure that companies are deterred from failing to comply with the act's requirements. A new provision is that executive officers of companies will be personally liable for contraventions by companies, with the onus of proof resting with the Commonwealthâ€”that is, liability will not be automatic. Liability for executive officers of companies is an important step in ensuring compliance with the act, as it would be difficult for other compliance measures to be effectiveâ€”for example, identification of hazardous wastes at the Customs barrier when materials leave the country would often be difficult given that hazardous waste cannot readily be distinguished from a variety of other materials.

        Third party standing under the principal act is already very broad with respect to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 has been extended by providing standing for Australian organisations and associations which have matters which relate to the act as part of their object or purpose. This will provide further legislative clarity to the standing rules for the purposes of the ADJR Act and is an extension of the standing rules already recognised in recent cases under other similar legislation. The standing provisions in the bill relate only to persons or organisations living or incorporated in Australia.

        The bill has been the subject of extensive consultations with a variety of groups both inside and outside government.

State and territory governments have also been consulted. An exposure draft of the bill was provided to members of the Reference Group and to states and territories, and comments have been taken into account in finalising the bill. In the course of the consultations, an issue which has stimulated more discussion than any other is the prospect of bans of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries. This issue has been the subject of a decision at the Second Meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Basel Convention in March 1994 (Decision II/12) and an amendment decision at the Third Conference of Parties to the convention in September 1995 (Decision III/1). This latter decision, known as the Ban Amendment, implements an immediate ban on the export of hazardous waste for final disposal from countries listed in Annex VII of the convention (parties and other states which are members of the OECD and the EC, and Liechtenstein) to non-Annex VII countries; and phases out by the end of 1997 and bans from that date the export of hazardous waste for recovery operations from Annex VII countries to non-Annex VII countries. In it Explanation of Vote at that meeting, Australia said that ". . . it is essential Parties have a common understanding of what is prohibited", and indicated that it would "only consider ratifying the [ban] amendment when the work on hazardous characteristics is completed to (Australia's) satisfaction". (The work referred to is being carried out by the Basel Convention's Technical Working Group, and is aimed at clarifying the wastes covered by the convention.)

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to note that the bill does not implement the Ban Amendment. This government is yet to consider its position on ratification of the amendment, and before any decision is made on ratification, the government's new process for treaty-making must be observed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The export of wastes for final disposal to developing countries, however, is not generally regarded as acceptable practice. That is now reflected in the bill. Indeed the bill extends that policy by limiting exports for final disposal to any country to exceptional circumstances, such as where there is a direct risk to human health or environment if the waste remains in Australia, or if the wastes are being exported for research or testing. Each permit issued under this provision of the amended act will be specified in the regulations to ensure that the application of the concept of "exceptional circumstances" is transparent and subject to scrutiny by the community.

        The extension of the definition of hazardous waste from that in the principal act to that in the convention will inevitably result in regulation of a far wider range of hazardous wastes than at present. Studies which have been carried out recently into the range of wastes that may be covered by the Basel Convention and Australia's trade in them suggests that total trade may be somewhere between $100 million and $200 million each year. The vast majority of this takes place with OECD countries, and is therefore subject to the less rigid controls set out by the OECD Decision. The kinds of materials in which we trade with developing countries of our region include spent lead acid batteries, metal-bearing wastes such as sludges, slags and drosses and a miscellaneous range of wastes variously containing metals such as lead or arsenic. These are the kinds of materials which will be regulated under the amended act. Suggestions that ferrous and most non-ferrous scrap metal will be caught up under the convention are mistaken.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In general, the amended act will not cover trade in products, mineral ores and concentrates, processed minerals and metals, petroleum products, forest products including uncontaminated waste paper, textiles, or materials produced to meet commercial specifications intended for recycling. The distinction between wastes on the one hand, and non-wastes on the other, will be subject to consideration and advice by the Technical Group, and will exclude co-products, intermediates and by-products from the definition of hazardous wastes. The Technical Group will also be giving priority to assisting the Minister in determining which of the OECD green listed materials are clearly inside the scope of the act and which are clearly outside it, with a view to the Minister's reflecting this in Evidentiary Certificates. Consultations with all interested parties will continue as regulations and supporting administrative arrangements are developed.

        Bilateral discussions between Australia and our developing-country trading partners make it clear that they wish and expect Australia to abide by the rules to which so many of the countries of the world have agreed. A continued failure to do so may lead to retaliatory reaction by these countries, which could threaten trade far more seriously than the controls required by the convention and now established by this bill. It is time for Australia to give effect to the obligations it has taken upon itself, just as the vast majority of its trading partners have done.

         â€”I rise in this chamber today as the youngest woman ever elected to a federal parliament. It is an honour that I cherish but for no longer than it takes other young women to be chosen by an electorate that has shown it wants true representation of all sectors of our population. I look forward to the day when I look across this chamber from my seat and see such a diversity of facesâ€”young people, old people, different ages, men and women, and the many cultures that make up our nation, including indigenous culturesâ€”that we no longer have to strive for it. When that time comes I think we will accept that neither youth nor age, any more than being male or female, black or white, is a virtue in itself, except that it deserves to be represented in a system that claims to be representative.

        Accepting and including difference with tolerance and respect is what Australia has shown herself to be all about, and I think we are all proud of that. I hope you will consider that what I have to offer is worthy of this great chamber and that what I have to say is of more interest than my footwear, which the media seems to notice so frequently. The truth is that last year I was given very big shoes to fill when I replaced former Senator John Coulter after he retired due to ill-health. I am pleased to say that Dr Coulter is in the gallery today, looking much more robust after surgery. In fact, I served only two days in this place before the federal election when the electors of South Australia showed great confidence in my party, giving me a quota in my own right and saving me from the fate of being the shortest serving senator.

        John Coulter's eight years in this parliament will be remembered for many things: his negotiation of the ethanol package, his time as leader during a period of consolidation for the Australian Democrats, his staunch defence

        I thank John for his wisdom and his support. It was during his time as leader that he took a chance by employing me as a researcher.

I was given responsibility for the education, training and youth portfolios, areas dear to my heart and ones I also gladly act as the spokesperson for today. It was through this work that I discovered not only the wonders of this chamber but the many opportunities there are to effect change through the parliament and law making.

        We live in a time where legislation is greatly affecting destinies. Equal opportunity legislation and sex discrimination laws have changed lives for the better without dampening the fierce individualism that Australians wish to maintain. I think the native title package has the potential to go the same way towards righting institutionalised and ancient wrongs in the relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It seems natural to me to want to be a part of this processâ€”one that puts into laws the nation's best aspirations of fairness and decency and also fosters decent dealings between people. Some of the best, if not all, changes for the better in Australian society have been initiated or supported by laws of this parliament.

It is this concept of ecological sustainability, combined with the Democrats' commitment to social justice and democracy, that made me join a political party. I bring to the parliament the values of that party and values that have been formed in the late 20th century, an education enhanced or limited by decisions made in this parliament and the experiences of a peer group and my parents, which reflect contemporary challenges.

        Mr President, it is often said that some cultures have a special respect for the aged. I think our society has a special fear of the young. They are so often stigmatised as lazy, unappreciative of parents, easily lured to drugs, and uncaring about their country, their history and their language.

        For four years I have conducted the Democrats' Youth Poll, the only survey by a political party that gives young people a chance to express their views on a range of topicsâ€”employment, education, sex, drugs and rock `n roll.

It shows a very caring generationâ€”caring about employment prospects and concerned about their families and teenage suicide levels. They are anxious to be a part of decision making processes and determinedâ€”absolutely determinedâ€”to ensure that the environment is not further degraded. Perhaps even the vilified Paxton young people care more about the big pictureâ€”the nation, their futureâ€”than some media will ever allow us to know.

The role of this chamber has changed over time. We no longer operate as a states house but have refined our responsibility as a genuine and deliberate house of review, a house in which I think the views of the populace are more fairly reflected and represented.

I emphasise that when people talk about the role of the Senate and whether mandates have or have not been given.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          At the last election, 50 per cent of elected senators were from the Liberal and National parties. In each state, the Liberal Party achieved three senators, except in New South Wales and Queensland where the National Party achieved one each to join two Liberals. The Senate result in Queensland was the best ever result for the Liberal Party with, for the very first time in a genuine three&amp;hyphen;party state, the Liberal Senate team achieving more votes than any other party.

         In a passing reference, I want to dispel some of the inaccurate statements made by the Democrats and, curiously, most of the media. The Democrats did not achieve in Queensland a quota in their own right and had to again rely onâ€”surprise of all surprisesâ€”the preferences of the Labor Party to get their candidate elected. So there we go again. The Labor Party were supporting their mates. At least they are all sitting together on the other side now. The Labor Party ensured the election of a Democrat candidate who could not get a quota in her own right. I am happy to say that the Democrat candidate just pipped the third Liberal candidate, Ms Debbie

         But it should also be pointed out that, in spite of comments about the huge increases and gains made by the Democrats, the Democrat candidate this time received much the same sort of vote as she received six years ago, so there has been no increase in Democrat support in Queensland. The Democrat candidate again had to rely on Labor Party support to get herself elected.

Following the magnificent win in the state election by Lyn Warwick in Barron River, the Liberal Party has really consolidated its position in northern and regional Australia. In the electorate of Herbert my good friend and now colleague, former Townsville city councillor Peter Lindsay, swept the floor in what was previously a traditional Labor seat, particularly since the boundaries have now contracted to encompass basically just the cities of Townsville and Thuringowa.

         My 10 year goal to turn the north of Australia into a Liberal bastion has at last started to show dividends. When I first entered parliament six years ago I was the only Liberal north of the Brisbane suburb of Aspley in either the state or federal parliament. Queensland, unlike most other states, is a very decentralised state with a great number of federal and state electorates north of the capital city. It is a matter of some pride to meâ€”and, I must say, relief as I now have four colleagues to do the state and federal work which previously fell to my officeâ€”that there are now four other Liberal parliamentarians in the north. This is not said just because of pride in the political party to which I belong; it is said more in the knowledge that these members are members of a party that supports initiative and enterprise, that believes in freedom and choice; a party in which they will give representation both as part of a Liberal government and as individuals, to the constituents it serves.

This target was based on population estimates for 1993 but the 1995 figure shows that the original estimates have been exceeded by about 29,000, of which Queensland accounts for more than half. If this trend continues, Queensland will still not catch up with the national average even with the additional places already promised. All additional places have been allocated in Queensland to regional areas, particularly the new campuses at Cairns and the Sunshine Coast and in others planned in Logan City, Ipswich and Hervey Bay. If, therefore, the Commonwealth government is obliged to cut higher education funding to meet Labor's black hole of $8 billion in the budget, that reduction should be achieved by an equal percentage reduction across all states, not by an arbitrary removal of the growth funding for Queensland.

The Democrats, I think, lost one and gained one, but it was all at the expense of the Labor Party. The people of Australia quite clearly understand that it does not matter who you vote for. Whether you vote for the Democrats or Labor, it is all the same, because they have the same policies.

         I should indulge myself in the last couple of minutes, if I can, by just pointing out the pettiness of the Democrats. Have a look at the Queensland card that they registered. Their preferences went to everyone except us, I might mention. They started at the top of the thing and went down. They went to 15, 16, 17. They got to the Nationalsâ€”it was Boswell. They got to 28, 29, 30. They got through them all and got to the Liberal Party. Then they counted from the bottom and went upwards. So I got the last vote and I am very proud of that. It is a badge of honour. The pettiness of it is just incredible. I am very pleased to announce that I am going to talk about that as often as I can. I shall wear that as a badge of courage. I thank Senator Kernot for letting me know that I point out the undeniable truth about her relationship with the Labor Party and that is that they are just part of the team. She does not like me saying it. She went to that pettiness to make sure that I got the absolutely last vote.

          he is on the backbench and why Prime Minister Howard has overlooked him. For six years in this chamber, we have heard nothing but bile and vitriol from you against the Australian Democrats. You did not even have the graciousness today to restrain this bile and vitriol straight after the first speech of our newest senator. Such is the level of it. Is this a reflection of the new parliamentary standards of the government? I see it as the same old business. I guess one day Senator Ian Macdonald's deep and dark psychological reasons for this pathological hatred of the Democrats, and me in particular, might be explained. But from day one, not knowing Senator Ian Macdonald before I came to this placeâ€”

Well, Senator Ian Macdonald, you failed spectacularly. For the record, I got the highest ever Democrat vote in Queensland. However you want to distort it, I got the highest ever.

         â€”Can I just ascertain that Senator Ian Macdonald has finished all of his interjections for the time being? Before I speak on the address-in-reply, two speeches ago in this chamber we heard the debut speech of Senator Stott Despoja of the Australian Democrats. On behalf of the opposition, as I am the first opposition speaker since that speech, I congratulate her on a very fine debut speech.

        We observe the comments made, I thought uncharitably, by Senator Ian Macdonald following upon her address that the dispiriting nature of the youth view of Australia was due to the Australian Labor Party. In fact, I understood the senator to actually say that the young people of Australia had an inspiring view of the prospects of this country and that, in fact, they were pigeonholed into a caricature by the media, which had them as a drug-riddled, disinterested, unemployment prone group. But indeed, their view is much wider in the world.

        Yesterday the Governor-General, Sir William Deane, opened the 38th parliament of Australia and delivered the opening address. The tradition is, of course, that in that address he presents an outline of the program for the coming three years of the government. I rise to speak in the address following that speech and to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, Senator Faulkner, on Telstra. I mean no disrespect to the Governor-General, but I do

        Before turning to the speech, I say that it is the first appearance by the Governor-General as the Governor-General in this parliament. He was appointed to the position of Governor-General by the Keating government at the beginning of this year. I congratulate him on his elevation. I think Sir William has proven to be a thoughtful and distinguished member of the High Court and I believe he will fill the office of Governor-General with equal distinction. He is, in the view of all Australians I believe, an excellent choice.

        In the last several months Australia has come through what I believe to be a quite extraordinary time. A government which, I think by fair measure, would be regarded as a successful government has been turned from office at a time when the Australian economy is buoyant and where the prospects, particularly for the latter half of this year, are ones for strong economic growth. It is unusualâ€”in fact, I think, unprecedentedâ€”that governments are defeated in those circumstances. Let us look at the details of the Australian economy and compare the record of the Labor government with the record of the previous Fraser government, a government in which the now Prime Minister was a Treasurer. On inspection, you can see that the records, on a historic Australian national comparisonâ€”if
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         you like, us, the Labor government of the time, compared to them, the Liberal government of the timeâ€”show that we had much more effective managerial credentials than they did. If you compare us on a geographical or global basisâ€”that is, to like economies elsewhere in the worldâ€”our economic performance was indeed, by that measure too, outstanding.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If one compares the records on economic growth, one sees that the average rate of real economic growth during the Labor period of office was 3.7 per cent. When Mr Howard was Treasurer it was 2.2 per cent. The average rate of inflation during the period in which Mr Howard was Treasurer was 9.8 per cent whereas under the Labor government it was, on average, 5.3 per cent, and since June 1991 it was on average 2.5 per cent. The rate of inflation at the time Mr Howard last left office as Treasurer in Australia was 11.4 per cent, whereas the rate of inflation when we faced the electors early this year was 5.1 per cent. And so the figures go.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn to another key measure: employment. The average number of jobs created per year during the period of Mr Howard's incumbency as Treasurer was 50,199, whereas during our 13 years of office we averaged on the job creation front 164,514 jobs per annum. The average annual growth in employment during Mr Howard's incumbency as Treasurer was 0.8 per cent, whereas under us it was 2.9 per cent. Unemployment when John Howard left office as Treasurer was 10 per cent, whereas the rate when we faced the electors was about 8.1 per cent.

        On the measure that most home owners in Australia are concerned aboutâ€”that is, the measure of home loan interest ratesâ€”the average home loan interest rate today is roughly around 9.7 per cent, whereas when Mr Howard left office in 1983 it was 14 per cent, with a strong argument being that the practical rate, given the cocktail nature of the loans at the time, was about 18.9 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I make those comparisons for a number of reasons. I make them because I want to make two observations about this election. The first observation is that I think the modern Australian electorate is certainly more volatile than
        <break page="179" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         we have become used to in our previous electoral experience. Indeed, I think that, with strong economic performance, the electorate is more ready to pay attention to issues such as the `it's time' factor. That type of approach does count in their minds more than it would at other times of economic difficulty. So, in part, I think the decision was made easier by the electors facing to a `it's time' type of enticement than it would have been had the economy been in less good shape than it is now.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other element of this election that is worthy of noting in this address-in-reply speech is, as well, the policies that the opposition at the time, now the government, ran on in that election were policies that mirrored in many respects the policies of the government of the day; that is, the policies of the Labor Party.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I remember, graphically and surprisingly, ads being aired in the closing days of the campaign on, for example, Medicareâ€”an area in which the now government, then opposition, had trenchantly criticised us, the government, during 13 years of Labor government in this countryâ€”indicating that, in fact, they had moved to a position in which Medicare, one of the defining issues of difference between the two major parties in this country, was now an issue of no difference. That obviously means that they a have jumped from their position of the pastâ€”an implicit admission that they were wrong in the past and acceptance that we were right; that we have pioneered and engineered significant change in Australian health care delivery and health care servicing in this country; and that now they would join us and minimise that difference between us.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many of the other policy formulations that they put were formulations of policy that we had pioneered too. We have as an outcome of this electionâ€”I must say there are a few notable exceptions to those pointsâ€”a situation in which the risks of voting conservative were minimised as a deliberate election ploy. Mr Howard was presented to the electors as someone who would not rock the boat, who would not bring in radical change and who would tread softly. It would be pretty much
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         business as usual. I think that, as I have said before, no doubt the Australian people take the view that if the economy is sound they can then risk a change of government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well, I think the peculiar outcome of this election is that the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party coalition is governing with, essentially, the Labor mandate and that the Australian people have taken the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party commitment to that mandate at face value. While recognising that fact as an analytical imperative, nonetheless, unfortunately, there are already signs that that faith is being betrayed. Of course, we in opposition, loyal to our task, will take every opportunity to point out where the mandate has been deviated from.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As well as those remarks about the most recent election there are, of course, lessons in the outcome for the Labor Party. We are a party that certainly has retained a vision for the future, a flexibility in the application of the principles for which we stand so that they fit the circumstances of the time and a fundamental commitment to standing up for the ordinary Australian people in this country. But the election lessons are lessons of us in defeat, and we will honestly face what those lessons mean to us. We will forge again a strong bond with the Australian people, and we will rekindle the confidence that they have in us that enabled us to govern in this country for so long and so successfully. We will come back to power as soon as that will and confidence is restored.

        What troubles me about the present Australian government is their readiness to manipulate the arguments, to manipulate the economic outcomes and the expectations of the community to suit political endsâ€”to, in fact, engage in political double speak. For example, in the field of small business, we have had a lot of rhetoric about the importance of small business to the Australian economy. Of course, small business is integral to the success of the Australian economy. This is a country in which small business is the most common form of business found anywhere, and about 80 per cent of business activities conducted in this country are conducted by what you would define as small business. Therefore, it is not to provide a great insight
        <break page="180" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         but, nonetheless, to cite a reassuring fact when one says that small business is the rock upon which economic growth will be built. If you can encourage the growth of small business, so too will you encourage the growth of employment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is true, but it is also in the field of a motherhood statement and it does not take us any further. The truth of those assertions, the truth of that propaganda position, really is found in the detailed policy prescriptions about how the objectives enunciated by those soft words are to be realised.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When one turns to the government's policy platform in that respect, one finds it thin on detail and, in fact, contradictory in many respects, superficial in the extreme, and patronising of many of the advocates and spokespersons of small business. It takes their words and twists them in a way in which it might appeal on the broad front, without being specific to the particular policies and needs of the small business community. I want to go through some of those elements of superficiality and contradiction so that I can illustrate my point by resort to actual examples and detail. But, before I do, I make a couple of threshold observations generally about the economic approach of the government as enunciated both in the policy statements before the election and things that they have said since the election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had today, at least by one or two of the speakers from the government, a reference to what they have styled for propaganda purposesâ€”the so-called $8 billion Labor black hole in the budget. Of course, this is not true in the context in which it is now being used as a political slogan. It relates to forward estimates. It relates to a speculative possibility. It is, as I said after question time, a situation in which the Treasury notoriously is conservative about outcomes. Those figures change and will change come budget time, and they will change as the various parameters of the macro economy change.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The figures are already different because of the most recent reported figures on inflation level outcomes achieved by the policies of Labor when it was in office. I do not think this furphy that is being used as the raison

         d'etre for a sweeping axing of government services and cutting of jobs in the public sectorâ€”a reduction in efficiencies in the public sector and a withdrawal and reduction of services to people who rely on government services or industries that work with governmentâ€”is justified in any way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe this furphy of this so&amp;hyphen;called $8 billion black hole is being used to justify a slash and burn policy which will, in the end, dishonour the political promises made before the election by the then opposition. It will introduce Fightback by stealth and will undermine its commitments in the Medicare and health field, certainly in the education field and bizarrely in the field of employment generation. You don't have to believe all of them; you just have to see the credibility of some of the changes being foreshadowed, particularly in the employment area. By cutting employment and employment generation programs in order to reduce outlays, one cuts the ability of the government to help people find jobs to suit their skills. The government ran to the election on the basis that it is the party that can create employment. Now it is talking about cutting the very programs that will help deliver that outcome.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As wellâ€”this is my main point in economic termsâ€”the cutting back of government programs in the economy as it is poised at the present time will have a dampening effect on business activity and therefore will start to slow economic growth. The anticipation is that in the second half of this year we will have strong economic growth. Maybe the judgment is being made on the government side that we can therefore absorb a few hits from massive government cuts. Irrespective of that judgment, the truth will be that it will slow economic activity and cause more unemployment then otherwise would have been the case.

        Let us take the bizarre example of ripping about $1 billion worth of expenditure out of the acquisition of information technology.

        <break page="181" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         greater reach in service delivery. Chopping out $1 billion of expenditure will mean reducing the ability of a modern government to deliver up to the minute services in the best and most effective possible way and to save other costs elsewhere. It is a cutting off your nose to spite your face approach.

        It will also have a massive impact on Australian industry. Australia has the second largest IT, information technology, industry in the Asia-Pacific area. We come in just  behind Japan and ahead of every other country in the Asia-Pacific area. That has been built up because it was nurtured by the former Labor government with partnerships for development programs and a whole series of other things that have helped to build an indigenous Australian information technology industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Government purchasing was used to build that industry sector. By chopping out government services, by refusing to continue with an enlightened program of efficiencies generated by the enabling technology of information technology, we not only curtail or impair the ability of government to give to the taxpayers what they want and what they are entitled to but also stilt and stunt a major industry sector which is important to our future economic growth and which, if it does not grow apace, will mean that we will import the technology they would have created in Australia from overseas and blow out our current account deficit as well.

        Let us look at factor F, which is the pharmaceutical area. We provide a payment to companies that produce pharmaceuticals in this country because they sell to the government and we peg the prices so there is no free market. We pay a bounty to them on the basis that they locate their research and development here, they locate their operations here, they export overseas and then attract a bounty. That compensates for the lack of a free market for them and has enabled a number of Australian pharmaceutical companies to grow and become world competitive at a time in which there is a rationalisation in this industry sector globally. But this has meant that we are a player. If you chop that bounty out, if you chop the factor F program

        When I say these cuttings will dampen Australian economic activity and undercut business activity, I have described two clear examples of major industry sectors important to the economic development of a modern industrial state in which this government is moving in a regressive way.

        During the election campaign, the then opposition was very keen to sneak up to people and whisper quietly in the ear of the electorate, `Don't worry. We're not going to do anything that is going to hurt any individuals.' If you look at what detail we now have available, it is unmistakable that the impact will be the possibility that wages will fall across Australia because individual workers could be victimisedâ€”their wages could be put at risk, their living standards could be put at risk and their families could be put at risk because of those changes.

        I think the government should pause here. It should not proceed any further. It should try to forge a better and deeper understanding with the Australian union movement about how these changes can go forth. It should not foist them on the union movement after nominal consultations in which there is no change or very little change based on the evidence that can be adduced.

        If the government proceeds down the course that it has now embarked on, it will simply be inviting unions in this country to maximise their bargaining position before any legal changes are made, and that would be disruptive to the economy in itself. It would fracture our internationally recognised record of industrial peace and the genuine workplace cooperation that we have been able to build up over the years. It would also drive Australia down the New Zealand road of low wages but not high skill. It is the turning away from high skills and the embracing of the low wage concept that is, I think, at the base of these changes and, in economic terms, the worst

         element of them. It would penalise good employers who have built trust and confidence with their own work force by encouraging negative cost cutting by bad employers forcing the good employers to follow suit if they are to remain competitive. I urge the government to pause, to engage in genuine discussions, to recognise the strength and merit of the cases that can be adduced to show that progress here is being dramatically but cooperatively achieved, and to not unilaterally proceed now and fracture the industrial harmony that this country has obtained and carefully built and nurtured after many years.

        These changes that I have just referred to will affect all businessâ€”big business, medium business and, most of all, small business. This is why the government's rhetoric on small business is very empty. Let us look at what the government is proposing to do in terms of what it said before the election. I am not talking here about the rumours and leaks emerging out of the government in its run to the budget, but what it promised to do before the election and which one must have a full expectation it will try to deliver on. In the industry and science area alone there is to be a cost cutting of $270 million in programs that are key supports for small&amp;hyphen; to medium&amp;hyphen;sized business in this country. These are programs that are strategically targeted to meet the needs of small business, to help them flourish and grow in the Australian community.

         Take the empty rhetoric of the government when it talks about the need to increase trade and the need to work with Australian industry to do so. The government, according to its election platform, is proposing to cut the export market development grants and the other supports that are provided as financial incentives for companies to get into export. Export market development grants are fundamental and critical, particularly for small business. Small business cannot export without access to those funds. It encourages small business people to recover the costs of developing a market position in a foreign offshore market and it helps to defray some of the costs for them in going overseas to do that. By cutting those funds, we cut the penetration of these Australian companies into those markets and reduce our export effort accordingly.

         What the government has undertaken to do in the export area is, of course, unbelievable. Let us go further and look at the DIFF Scheme.

Two of the companies that spring to mind, being the biggest beneficiaries, are Clough Engineeringâ€”of course, the principal of that company is the President of the Liberal Party in Western Australiaâ€”and Transfield. The country in which most of these funds are expended is Indonesia, a developing country where we can use soft loans to get our infrastructure developers in to help develop the infrastructure of those countries. This scheme is going to be removed if the government's election undertakings are to be believed. Our penetration of the fast growing

         I can go further: research and development funding is to be reduced. We in this country have a great ability to invent things but we want to encourage more private sector research and development, and incentives are needed to do that. By cutting those funds, it means that we can come up with the ideas but we cannot develop them for the marketplace. If we cannot do that, we cannot take advantage of our capacity and win new markets in a fast changing international marketplace. That is a regressive change.

The states will complain about this, and so they should, because they will have to bear the brunt of the reaction that comes from industry when this is cut. But this is also slated to be reduced.

So I think that that would indeed be a regressive step. They are some examplesâ€”I have to say they are superficially treated examplesâ€”of where I believe the slash and burn policy of the government is wrong in fact.

I was deeply touched and privileged to have been invited by the family of my friend Glen Roy Pears to be part of that gathering. As I was there, I observed their Excellencies, the Governor-General and the Governor of Tasmania, quietly and unassumingly move amongst the mourners offering the nation's and the state's sympathy. Their demeanour, their presence and their obvious sympathy made me feel proud of the heads of state of Australia and Tasmania. The community turnout today in Hobart and the messages were of great comfort and support to those of us who mourned.

One of the Liberal members of our delegation said, `That's where all the battlers are, pal.' I replied, `Yes, they've probably got a photo of John Howard in every house.' One of the Liberals said, `Yes, and Mr Abbott as well'.

       Pork Producers in Queensland

         â€”I would like to commend Senator Abetz for his contribution to the debate on the adjournment. He raised some critical issues. Senator Abetz and I do not always agree but I agree absolutely with what he said tonight.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to raise an issue which has been raised with me by a number of pork producers in Queenslandâ€”from Warwick, the South Burnett area and Monto. They have a number of concerns about their industry, particularly the prospect of more pork producers going out of business or being taken over.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A couple of their concerns involve the possible initiation of a couple of large piggeries in the Warwick area. One of them, already quite famous in this place having been mentioned quite often here by another senatorâ€”Danporkâ€”could be starting a 10,000&amp;hyphen;sow piggery.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The producers want to know whether Danpork was given favoured treatment in terms of environmental responsibilities and controls. It wants to site its piggery only one kilometre from the Condamine River which, of course, is part of the Murray&amp;hyphen;Darling Basin.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the positive things about Danpork is that it claims to be creating 500 jobs through building such a super&amp;hyphen;piggery in the area. But the pork producers, particularly in the South Burnett, asked me what point there was in creating 500 jobs if you lost 500 farms because of it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They have also raised with me the issue of the importation of Canadian pork. I certainly agree with the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Bruce Scott, who for some years has raised this issue on behalf of the pork producers. I would like to mention a number of concerns that he has raised.
       </para>
       <break page="187" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to place on record a number of company names and brand names which have been used to import, process and/or retail products containing Canadian pork. It is important that we understand this. The alternative is proper labelling laws so that consumers have a choice. I trust that the coalition will very quickly bring legislation into this place that will allow consumers to know what they are purchasing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the absence of such legislation, I inform the Senate that, as I understand it, Meapro of Sydney, which is sold through the Franklins stores, is one of these companies. Primo and Goldcob are two product brand names sold through the Coles stores. Duncan and Davis are processors of these products. Redlich, Ritter and Dyson, Melbourne manufacturers of ham and salami products, also process and retail imported Canadian pork.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My other concern is the health threat that Canadian pork still poses. I am happy to repeat some of the concerns raised by Bruce Scott in previous years. He called for a ban on all Canadian pig meat imports because of his concern about disease. He specifically talked about the threat of importing porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, otherwise known as mystery swine disease, MSD. He pointed out that this is very prevalent in regions of Canada and results in a reduction of fertility rates, increased neonatal mortality and an increase in the prevalence and severity of other diseases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He pointed out that the infective agent is unknown and that the risk associated with the importation of fresh meat and frozen semen from Canada cannot be quantified. He was reported in a press release as saying:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has supported a ban against Canadian semen imports due to little being known about the disease's transmission but continues to allow the import of fresh pig meat.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While we readily import a possible diseased product from Canada a local meat works recently had a consignment of beef refused entry to Canada due to a lower class `G' in the kilogram measurement on the cartons.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is this kind of unequal competition which Australian producers have to face in the global market. I agree with Mr Scott when he
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          says that Australian producers pay a levy to the Australian Pork Corporation towards the promotion of the consumption and sale of Australian pork and that Canadian importers directly benefit from such promotion with no associated costs. Those are the issues that I want to raise; I could refer to many others, but I know that there are other speakers in the adjournment debate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I again impress on the government the need for, in the least, proper labelling so that Australian consumers can make a choice for themselves about whether they want to eat an Australian product or imported products.

         â€”I rise tonight on a very sad occasion. It is ironic that tonight Senator Wheelwright referred to the parliamentarians who last year travelled to Tahiti to participate with parliamentarians from many parts of the world to help in solidarity the French Tahitian people who were deeply concerned about the beginning of French nuclear tests again on their soil. When I came back to Australia from Tahiti, as soon as I could I fulfilled a promise to a woman I met in Tahiti, Marguerite Tetuanui, to present in the Senate a speech which she was to present to the Beijing Women's Conference. She was unable to attend that conference. A small section of her speech states:

I hope that the work Marguerite has done will help the world to change its mind about the production of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons.
