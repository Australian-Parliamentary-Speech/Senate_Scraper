Minister, I refer to your glib and misleading denial yesterday that your dodgy figures on the contributions of American, Japanese and Danish students towards the cost of their higher education had been used in any way to justify the government's proposed changes to HECS.

         University students are amongst the luckiest people in the country. We give them roughly, at a minimum, $20,000 worth of higher education—far more than we give people who go to TAFE and far more than we give people who do a trade or an apprenticeship. We give university students a lot. We ask them only to make a contribution and to make it when they start earning an income. If you do not think that puts them in the luckiest category, fine. You go out and tell the tradespeople that it is right that they should pay for their tools but university students do not have to pay until they earn an income—an income of $28,000, as you would have it. You go ahead and do that.

          But from where we come from, university students are amongst the luckiest school leavers. So it is fair enough, given the private benefit they get, to ask them to make a higher contribution. It is fair enough not only to ask for a higher contribution but to shift to the recommendation made by Neville Wran, the former Labor Premier of New South Wales, when he suggested that we have a differentiated HECS. We are not asking teachers, who do not get as much in the way of private benefit, to give as much per annum as doctors. If you think that is fair, you go out and argue it. But I will be out arguing the opposite case.

The recent budget confirmed the government's support also for Australia's highly prized tradition of family medicine centred on the general practitioner. We have

        We have retained the general practice strategy with funding being maintained at $224 million, reversing a savings decision made during the election campaign. That includes the better practice program, the rural incentives program, funding for divisions of general practice, and also the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners training program which provides 400 training places for young doctors. This government is intent on reshaping these program elements to better target quality and good outcomes. We will therefore be putting in place a comprehensive review of the general practice strategy to deliver the best opportunities for GPs, including part&amp;hyphen;time doctors and women practitioners.

        I am advised that there is considerable scope to re&amp;hyphen;target the better practice program which provides formula&amp;hyphen;based grants to practices assessed against a set of benchmarking criteria, taking into account concerns of the profession about how the program currently operates. The BPP gives eligible practices a revenue complement for fees for service.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the options that the minister is particularly interested in is payment for after hours care. As you would be aware, the conduct of home visits and participation in after hours care are current eligibility requirements for the program. Certainly at the moment the program does not adequately reward practices which have on call or deputising services. This is something the government wants to look at in conjunction with the medical profession for, if the returns are inadequate, locum and deputising services will continue to be underused.

         there is an undersupply of several hundred.

        The government's overall medical work force strategy is consistent with its commitment to quality general practice. By restricting access to Medicare only to those doctors with postgraduate training or those on a training program, the government is treating general practice with the respect it deserves. This government values general practice. It wants to see it survive and grow in a professional environment increasingly dominated by specialisation.

In contrast to the continued rise in Commonwealth debt, state and territory governments reduced their debt levels last year.

         `Don and I did it together', Paul would later say, to a table of economists in Indonesia and to President Clinton and his advisers over lunch in the White House. The two of them were proud of the way they had withstood the squalls and strains within the party, shouting down Graham Richardson, who was forever running around to see Hawke and telling him housing should be exempted, that it was all too much and Labor was gone for sure.

         The reality is that there were a few people in caucus who worried about Labor's approach to interest rate rises. Nowhere was it mentioned that Senator Cook was worried about the rises in interest rates. Nowhere was it mentioned that Senator Schacht was worried about the rises in interest rates. Nowhere was it mentioned that Senator Faulkner was worried about the rises interest rates. There are many more quotes like that if you want to ask a question.

It was a very delicate exercise that had to be conducted on behalf of the high commission. There were very many performing arts venues that had to be serviced. There were a number in Delhi where it was very difficult to anticipate the number who might be interested in attending. As you may well know, Bangarra, which is a world class presentation led by Stephen Page, the principal choreographer of Red Ochre, which does have an international reputation, was not as well attended on the first night as it should have been. I was there on the second night and it was pretty much a full house. That may be purely coincidental.

        The judgment that was made in relation to those earlier programs was that it would be sufficient to simply send out invitations to a select number and to follow up selectively and hope for the best in a sense. It is very difficult to judge. People often, as I am told—maybe this cultural idiosyncrasy is not confined to India—say they will be there and they do not turn up. Maybe they get a better offer.

        Low educational levels is another serious problem that is correlated with poverty, as is marriage break-up.

The measures that Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp are putting in with regard to schools will also, hopefully, encourage young people to be better educated and reduce the illiteracy problems that so many social security customers, for example, suffer from.

If ever there were an argument for the need for reform of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, it was in that Smith Family report. The measures that we believe need to be taken and which the state governments are working with us on mean that we are trying

By comparison, people in public housing are paying up to 25 per cent and as low as 14 per cent in some parts of Australia.

        We are trying to achieve greater equality of subsidy between the two sectors so that all the quarter of a million people who are on the waiting lists for public housing, and therefore currently renting in the private sector, will be able to evaluate whether they still need to apply for public housing or whether affordability in the private sector is such that they no longer need to aspire to public housing. We believe that it should be the tenant's choice. Our measures, which we are working on with the states and the territories in the task force that has been established, are designed to achieve that equity and concern.

        Once again, I see that Senator Woodley is concerned about this matter. The official opposition does not seem to have an interest in trying to redress the problems of poverty due to the high cost of housing. Thirteen years of Labor have produced that, whereby the public housing stock is now down to 5,000 buildings a year and yet the same amount of money is being paid by the Commonwealth. The aging stock of the public housing sector is a matter of serious concern. The private sector needs to be more affordable to those who cannot get into the public housing sector.

         The Honourable Senator's question suggests that under the current law, there is a void in protection in relation to internet publications. While the situation must be closely monitored reform must be measured and respond to demonstrable need. The Senator might not be aware of the report on legal issues prepared by the previous Government's National Information Services Council. That report indicated that the belief that the technological revolution embodied in the information superhighway of necessity entails the need for a legal revolution of the same magnitude is an unnecessary and panic response that should not be taken too seriously. Overall, the Council recommended that care should be taken that there is no undue rush into legislation where none is needed.

        He adds that the office is not visited by Austrade staff from Australia or elsewhere in the region and it does not engage in active trade promotion, consistent with our policy of neither encouraging nor discouraging trade. It simply responds to questions raised by Australian companies, and this is to a background where our commercial trade with Burma is really minuscule. The result of that is basically that we do not believe that closing that office would have any effect in policy terms.

        Similarly, the minister advises me that we are not attracted to visa restrictions because we do not believe they would be effective in promoting reform. He confirms that very few senior Burmese officials wish to visit Australia and that, in any case, the application of visa restrictions might lessen our ability to encourage reform through quiet diplomacy. We do not therefore believe it would be fruitful to isolate the SLORC in this way.

         Between Pauline Hanson and this government there has been a big effort to undermine the Australian tourist industry. In the case of Pauline Hanson you can say that is a special factor, although the government must share some of the blame in not responding to her directly and unambiguously, sooner than it did.

         My remarks this afternoon are about the tourism industry and government steps that have been taken in the budget which impose new taxes and costs on that tourist industry and undermine the ability of smaller operators in the industry to effectively compete in what is one of Australia's most premier tourist locations, the Great Barrier Reef.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The tourist industry in Australia is one of the fastest growing industries we have in this country. Australia is rightly world famous as a tourist destination and for the magnificent scenery we offer international visitors. Tourism, as a facet of the Australian economy, is one of the biggest earners of foreign exchange of any, and is one of the reasons why services exports for Australia show a huge growth. It is one of the industry sectors that is most active in turning back the current account deficit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Cynics in the tourist industry say that Australia is known overseas for three things: the reef, the rock and the Opera House; and that foreign tourists come to Australia primarily to see those three attractions. I do not wish to comment on that other than to say that what that remark does underline absolutely is the importance of the Great Barrier Reef to Australian tourism. It is one of the world famous natural phenomena that bolsters Australia's income. The Great Barrier Reef is also one of the few things that you can actually see from the moon.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With respect to the Great Barrier Reef, in the last budget the government increased charges for reef visits—the infamous reef tax—by 500 per cent. The interesting thing about the budget was that it was supposed to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          have made savings in order that the budget could come more sharply into balance. But it is a curious piece of accounting to tax an industry which is a growth industry, thus stunting its growth so it will not grow as fast and so the government will not receive in the budget income from employed persons in the form of PAYE tax or will not receive from companies which would otherwise have grown more rapidly than the tax would allow, income to the budget from the point of view of corporate tax or company  tax.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what we have is a narrowly defined accountant's view that if it is a tax, increase it. That is what happened in this budget. But do not have regard to the earning capacity of the whole industry and the total advantage that industry is to the Australian community in employment, job creation and earning foreign exchange in growing companies, and in allowing small businesses that base themselves on tourism to prosper; and do not account for the advantage that gives to the income side of the budget.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is, in the classic case, one of the most short&amp;hyphen;sighted things a government can do—not look at the total impact, just increase a tax and stand back and not worry. There is reason to worry and the reason is best articulated by the people in this industry. Operators in the Australian tourist industry, particularly those on the Great Barrier Reef, rightly have been complaining. This tax, in many cases, has caused international contracts not to be renewed. This tax has meant that small operators who put their prices in their pricing packages months in advance now have to go and reprint and reorganise their pricing charges. In some cases that is bad for business. If they do not do it they will go under; if they do do it they will lose traffic and trade—and the impact is something the whole economy will feel.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the reef tax was first imposed there was understandably an outcry by tourist operators in Australia. One would have expected a sensitive government to pay attention to this because it does mean jobs for Australians, it does mean income to the tax side of the ledger as well and it would mean that a government that paid attention to the
         <break page="5071" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          needs of this industry was listening to what the people said. But has this government paid attention? No. Today we heard from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) representing, of all people, the minister for tourism, say, `We'll ring you, don't ring us,' to this industry. He said, `You have made representations. We will take them on board and we will get back to you if we choose.'

They were sick of 13 years of the anti&amp;hyphen;small business, anti&amp;hyphen;tourism legislation and approach from the previous Labor government. It overwhelmed on 2 March when, to a man and woman, North Queenslanders threw out the Labor representatives. Senator Reynolds may well be lucky that she was not up for re&amp;hyphen;election this time or she may have gone the same way as her former Labor colleagues in the north. This environment management charge was, as Senator Hill mentioned during question time, introduced by Labor.

        It was also the Labor Party that had some reports commissioned which recommended that this tax or charge be substantially increased and that it be imposed upon all small boat owners plying the waters in north and central Queensland. I was totally opposed to that at the time that report was brought into the Senate last year under the previous Labor government. It is something which we on this side are totally opposed to because those sorts of boats are owned by family people—little boats owned by average Australians up our way.

        I thought that matter had been put to rest but, lo and behold, on the weekend a former Labor member who hung around Townsville somewhere, who still thinks that he is the member in waiting—and he has a big think coming, as Senator Reynolds will agree; Peter Lindsay will be there for a long time—was in the press or trying to get in the press, and I

         must say that nobody really rang him at all, trying to suggest that it was the intention of the new government to tax all small boat operators. This is, of course, not the intention of the new government and Senator Hill has categorically denied that as I, with whatever little authority I have, have also done. So that is not on. But it will not stop the Labor Party from trying to make a political point about the issue.

        The tourist operators in North Queensland have had a very tough time in the last 13 years. They have been hit with increasing taxes and increasing regulation by the previous Labor government. They were instrumental in determining that the previous government should be thrown out and the new government introduced.

        On the increase in the environment management charge, we come at this from a position where the Labor government left us with a $10 billion deficit in the current budget—$10 billion!—which had to be made up from somewhere. Savings had to be made right across the board and one of those savings, regrettably, was to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, an authority which I think does a good job. It could be perhaps a little more efficient but, generally, it does a good job. This proposal to increase the environment management charge was introduced to give the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority some additional funding to make up for the savings that it was required to contribute.

         —Senator Ian Macdonald has a very selective memory on this issue. He says that the tourist industry has had a difficult time over the past 13 years but not nearly as difficult as it will have with a 500 per cent increase through this tax. Senator Macdonald kept talking about it as an environmental charge. Make no mistake about it, it is a reef tax. It is discriminatory because it only applies to visitors to the reef.

        On four occasions the Howard government has refused to debate its massive reef tax hike. It has had that opportunity in the House of Representatives and on four occasions it has refused to debate it.

        What will this reef tax do to tourism in the north? James Cook University Professor of Tourism, Phillip Pearce, has backed tourism operators in condemning a 500 per cent hike on reef visitor charges. He said yesterday that the new arrangements increasing an environmental management charge from $1 to $6 per visitor per day to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park clearly represented a tax—not a user fee, not an environmental charge but a tax.

        Perhaps Senator Macdonald could increase by 500 per cent the entry fee to the Canberra National Gallery. If it is good enough for visitors to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, why not to the Canberra National Gallery? After all, the Canberra National Gallery gets a $19 million—100 per cent—subsidy here in the south but that is not a privileged position that we get in the north.

         —I rise on this issue because I think there are a number of myths that have been perpetrated this afternoon about the issue of the reef tax. The first thing that I want to allude to is the fact that when the then Leader of the Opposition launched the tourist policy, it was launched in Cairns on the promise that there would be no additional taxes in the tourist industry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The tourist operators in the north took that very much to heart. I have had the pleasure of travelling to Cairns and meeting with tourist operators, who have expressed to me their bitter disappointment that the government reneged on that issue, in particular by upping the reef tax, as it now has become known, to the tune of 500 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think one should look at what exactly the reef tax is. When this charge was introduced by the former Labor government, it was an environmental management charge of $1. That charge of $1 was to do nothing else than to assist research on our most important wonder—the reef. Of the $1, 75c went to the Cooperative Research Centre For Ecologically Sustainable Development of the Great Barrier Reef. In other words, the money was put into research and development associated with the reef. The other 25c of the original dollar, of the environmental management charge, went to GBRMPA, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, as a management collection charge to assist in the collection of the $1 at the various points from the operators.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was never under any circumstances a direct tax because the operators, when it was originally mooted by the former Labor
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         government, were quite adamant that they did not want to be taxed; they did not want a tax but they would go along with the concept of an environmental management charge, which would go very much to research on the reef. That is the way it has been interpreted by the local operators up there and that is what they believed it would be. So when the government came along and upped it by 500 per cent and used it to no other purpose other than to fund GBRMPA and to relieve the funding of GBRMPA, it then became a tax on them, and it was a tax that they could not bear.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The tax has been compared to the charges to enter national parks but of course there is no relationship at all between the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and other land based national parks. So the charge cannot be in any way equated with the charges on the mainland for other great national parks that we have.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The real problem facing the tourist operators up there is the fact that they have had to advertise their prices and fix their prices out to April 1998. That is a substantial period ahead and, if those prices are not fixed, then they lose their credibility in the international tourist market. That is the problem that is confronting the tourist operators because they are the ones who have to pay the tax. It is not a tax that is directly collected from the individual who visits the reef on a day-to-day basis; it is something that is built into the price. To change their price structures now would, in effect, destroy their credibility.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This becomes the concern of these small operators, these small business people. I was led to believe, when I met with people from the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau, who have some 700 members, that the substantial majority of their members are involved in one way or another in the tourist industry, two&amp;hyphen;thirds of them are small businesses with five or fewer than five staff, and 80 per cent of their membership have 20 staff or less. So what we are facing here is a crisis for small business.

          Great Barrier Reef Marine Park inasmuch as it seems to me that, if you think of the proposed sale of Telstra and why that should be required to fund the environment, the environment is being picked out as the area which should be self&amp;hyphen;funded, should have individual ways of being funded which are not out of the general revenue.

        I find it both ironic and dangerous that the environment is picked out as being that one area which is user-pays and at the same time has its funding that would normally come out of general revenue pulled out. This is not the first time we have seen this happen. We saw it in the lead in petrol debate in 1993 where the ALP did something similar. It suggested that funding could go to the environment, but at the same time it pulled money out of the environment portfolio and simply swapped it with another general revenue raising measure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to think this measure will not be the general picture—that every time we want to raise a bit of extra money and put it into general revenue, we are going to find some way of looking like we are raising money for the environment while all we are doing is ripping money out of the environment and expecting the environment to pay for itself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The irony here is that perhaps the pressures on GBRMPA—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—have made it act a bit like the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia. Why are there parallels between these two organisations? We have heard just this week that there are proposals from some forces within GBRMPA to have a trial on some of their reefs to see what happens when you fish out pristine reefs or just fish enough for them to be damaged—to see to what point you can fish them until they are damaged.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The parallel here is that it is very similar to what happens in the Department of Conservation and Land Management. The small royalties that the Department of Conservation and Land Management gets from the use of clear-felling of native forests actually go towards their running expenses. It becomes a perpetual motion machine. You have to keep ripping out native forests in order for the Department

        I would hate to think we have a situation where the destruction of the reef becomes the rationale for the continuation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I would hate to think we will start looking at royalties for fishing and recreation. That decision in the long run—just like the decisions that I believe CALM are making in Western Australia—will be to the detriment of tourism and the environment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In that instance, it is really not necessary to conduct 11 experiments in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, because these experiments are being conducted all around the Pacific to the detriment of everybody. In fact, because the reefs fertilise each other, we are also putting at risk the reef systems right around the area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we are concerned about short-sighted decisions relating to tourism, we must also add this other Great Barrier Reef short-sighted decision. If we as a parliament let it go by—so that we oversee an `experiment' which does not need to occur: that is, to see what happens when you fish out a reef or damage a reef, its environs and its fishing—we are doing worse than our proposal to make the Great Barrier Reef pay for itself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are problems with that, and there are a number of issues involved in requiring the environment to be self-funded. If you ask people—as EPAC did within the last 12 months or so—what they think their taxes should be spent on, amongst those issues which they strongly support are the maintenance and good quality of the environment.

        I think it is a dangerous track we are running down—this idea that the environment should pay for itself via special levies and that a body like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has to find other sources of funding.

        We the undersigned respectfully submit that Social Housing is a major social safety net, crucial for all Australians.

        Your petitioners therefore call upon the Senate to maintain a commitment to the buying and building of new housing properties. The new Commonwealth State Housing Agreement must provide the States with monies to buy and build more Public and Community Housing. Dismantling the safety net of Social Housing will mean homelessness, overcrowding and the scrapping of public housing redevelopment plans, all of which will impact on the most disadvantaged groups in the Australian society.

        Your petitioners thus urge the Senate to reject current plans in the area of public and community housing.

         I move this motion because this matter is urgent. The motion before the Senate seeks to allay the anxiety of 1,500 East Timorese asylum seekers who are in Australia and who want to maintain their protection, their security, their safety and their peace of mind in this country.

         My motion calls on the government to create a humanitarian visa for the 1,500 East Timorese asylum seekers in this country. It aims to repeat the special protection given by the government to the many Chinese students in this country at the time of Tiananmen Square, when a special provision was made under the then Labor government for those Chinese students who were in fear for their safety, their wellbeing and their lives if they were at that time forced back to China so that they could have permanent residency in Australia. If those circumstances warranted that, surely the circumstances confronting the people of East Timor who have fled to the safety of this country deserve no less.

         This is a very urgent matter. A couple of months ago, many of these people received a letter from the department of immigration which indicated that they were about to be  deported on the basis that they were Portuguese. These are people who have never been to Portugal. Most of them do not speak Portuguese. They have no affinity except what they have read in the history books about the previous Portuguese colonial administration in their country.

         They are also people who, as citizens of East Timor, have very often stood up to the military occupation of their country. For that, they can live in fear of their lives. For that, they have been forced to leave our nearest neighbour, the country of East Timor. The plight of these people now in Australia with this threat of deportation hanging over their heads is indeed a harrowing and pitiable situation to hear about. At the outset, this government ought to maintain the stand it took in opposition.

The urgency for this matter would not be there had the Minister for Foreign Affairs kept to his statement of 11 October last year, when he said that the claim that the East Timorese asylum seekers are Portuguese is simply absurd and hypocritical. If it was absurd and hypocritical in October last year for Mr Downer, surely it is absurd and hypocritical that they are threatened with deportation as Portuguese citizens in November this year. If there were consistency in the government's policy on this matter and in their commitment to these 1,500 special citizens of Australia, as I would class them, then they would not be living in fear for their safety.

          Let me give the case of one particular person amongst their number who came here in 1984. I am again pointing out the urgency of the matter for this person. During the occupation of East Timor, he witnessed his brother, aged 11, being killed outside his house. His father was killed. He fled, after being arrested and imprisoned for five months for passing on some notes and pictures to visiting journalists in 1994. Since then, Indonesian soldiers have entered his house and beaten his mother to death. Since then, one of his sisters has been raped. Since then, and just this year, two of his sisters have managed to escape to this country.

         —The opposition does not support the suspension of standing orders to bring forward this motion. We believe the issues contained in parts of the motion moved by Senator Brown are important. But he has two different views mixed in this resolution. One, in great detail, is about the issue of qualification for refugees to come to Australia. There are several paragraphs in great detail, but at the end the motion refers to the Nobel Peace Prize winners, about which the Senate has already declared its position and on which it has voted. The motion then calls on the government to create a humanitarian visa class for East Timorese asylum seekers. We believe there is a mixture of issues that, quite frankly, should be dealt with in a much wider debate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In my view, these sorts of issues should be dealt with, if necessary, by a standing committee of the Senate looking at the issues contained in this motion. Senator Brown has raised a very significant suggestion: the creation of a humanitarian visa class for East Timorese asylum seekers who applied before October 1996. There are probably 30 countries around the world that you could make an equally just case for giving a particular humanitarian class of refugee status to.

        Only today I met a group of people from Sri Lanka, the Tamils, asking for the direct issue of humanitarian problems to be dealt with. Again, people from that part of Sri Lanka which the Tamils inhabit want to get applications for visas to come to Australia. You could make just as needy a case for those people as you can for East Timor.

        The issues raised by Senator Brown are profound. I am not denying that at all. But I think the Senate would not be able to do the issues justice in a short debate brought on under this motion. If Senator Brown wants to refer a number of these issues to the appropriate committee—either the Senate standing references committee covering foreign affairs or the joint committee on migration regulations—I think that would be a much better

The reason for denying formality was that I wanted to hear the arguments from not only Senator Brown but both the government and the opposition. It seemed fairly obvious from the whips meeting that neither the government nor the opposition had any intention of supporting the motion. It seems to be the current case that declaring a motion formal and voting against it is a way of stopping even hearing the arguments on a debate.

        This is an urgent motion because human lives are at stake. There are very few examples where it is relatively easy to check the bona fides of people who are seeking refugee status for various reasons. Australia has been tiptoeing. As Senator Brown mentioned, the interesting thing is how the tables turn so quickly when someone has gone from being in opposition to being in government.

This was one of the reasons why countries would not in a pink fit support Australia for a position on the Security Council: it continues to be so hypocritical on an issue so close to Australia for which we should have access to the information.

        It is urgent because the people's lives are dependent on this action. Their lives may well be at risk. There is no valid reason in any ethical or moral sense why they should not be classified as refugees. The only thing I can think of, which is why it is so urgent for us to talk about it, is that Australia does not want to risk our market to Indonesia. I would think countries would be respected if they did not shillyshally around on these kinds of things which are in Australia's aegis.

         These are not internal matters. These are people who have a valid reason for seeking refugee status. We in Australia have the ability to make up our own minds. It is not interfering with anybody else's internal matters. Pushing the matter on to Portugal is not the right thing to do.

         It is urgent that this Senate indicates to the government that it is time they took their responsibilities seriously. This is the only way that this can be done quickly. What kind of quick resolution could we get from, as Senator Schacht has suggested, a standing committee in the Senate—which one?—because how many are not flat tack at the moment; when would we get an answer; and what would that mean to the lives of those people in the meantime?

         Certainly in the long run we do have to deal with this issue honestly and fully in the Senate. If there is a Senate standing committee that is prepared to look at it, perhaps Senator Schacht might be able to recommend it to us. That will not necessarily help those people whose lives are currently in jeopardy at the moment.

         I would like to see some better response from the ALP. I would certainly like to have seen a better response from the government in this very urgent situation that we see now. These people had to leave for their own lives and for the fact that their lives will be in danger if they return. They deserve to be given basic humanitarian consideration. That is why it is urgent. That is why it will be very disappointing if the Senate does not support, first, the call to have the issue debated and, second, the motion that is before us today.

I do not want to get into the substance of the debate. The motion before us is for the suspension of standing orders. If that is carried, we can then get into the substance of the debate.

         —The government will be opposing Senator Brown's motion to suspend standing orders to enable debate on notice of motion 183, and it will be opposing it for a number of reasons. Senator Schacht has already mentioned a couple of those reasons. In some ways, Senator Harradine has also given a couple of reasons.

        Firstly, the way in which the Greens senators have raised this matter is a contrivance. I think that Senator Margetts would almost agree with that. Standing order 66 is a provision to ensure that motions can be dealt with and determined without amendment or debate. If Senator Brown were genuine and honest about that, he would have dealt with this matter without debate and without amendment. But he was either not genuine or not honest in seeking to declare the motion formal because he contrived with his colleague to ensure that there was debate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Secondly, the matters contained within notice of motion 183 are complex and, as Senator Brown's motion says, they are mat ters before the Federal Court. Senator Brown wanted to call the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, inconsistent because, when in opposition our position was that we would allow the Federal Court to deal with these matters. The reality is that these matters are still before the Federal Court, and Senator Brown should know that.

        As I think Senator Harradine alluded to, under the asylum seeker category there is something like 120 nationalities represented. As Senator Schacht said, these are matters that should not be dealt with without notice and in an urgency debate in the Senate. They are complex and important matters.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Perhaps Senator Margetts and Senator Brown see themselves as the keepers of all conscience of all parliamentarians across Australia. Certainly, Senator Margetts would have Australians believe that no&amp;hyphen;one who is not a member of the Greens (WA) or the Greens Australia, or whatever they like to call themselves these days, has a conscience or cares for anything. I think she actually believes that, and perhaps Senator Brown does as well. The people can judge whether that is the case.

       <para first-indent="16">
        They can make a judgment on Senator Brown and his conscience when they ask whether he is to be believed as genuine and honest when he seeks to use the contrivance of asking the Senate to agree to declare a motion formal when he knows in his own heart that is not what he is seeking at all. His was an act of dishonesty. It is an act of someone who is not genuine. Under those circumstances, the coalition will be opposing the motion to suspend.

        The bill will put in place the necessary framework to give effect to the Government's decision to sell Commonwealth Funds Management Limited (CFM) and its subsidiaries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        CFM is a wholly Commonwealth owned public company that provides investment services in the public and private sectors. Its major clients are the Boards of Trustees of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (the CSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation (the PSS) Scheme. However, it acts as a wholesale funds manager for a number of other public and private sector funds and is involved in retail funds management for individual investors via its superannuation and general investment retail products.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        CFM's functions are not part of government's core activities and for this reason and to ensure the longer term future of CFM and the best returns on the funds it has under management the Government has decided to sell the company.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        CFM was created in 1991 by the transformation of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT). SFIT had been established in 1976 as a statutory authority with trustee responsibility for the management and investment of the CSS Fund which contained the contributions of CSS members and the income earned from the investment of those contributions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the new PSS Scheme was established in 1990, full responsibility for that scheme and the investment of PSS Fund moneys was given to the joint employer/employee PSS Board. At the same time, the CSS Board was established, with responsibilities for the invalidity retirement process and setting the interest rate to be allocated to contributions. In 1991, the CSS Board was given responsibility for management of the CSS Fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The transfer of SFIT's trustee function and responsibility for the investment of the CSS Fund to the CSS Board, was accompanied by SFIT's transformation to CFM with the role of general funds manager. To assist its establishment as a funds manager, CFM was provided with legislative monopolies over the management of the CSS and PSS Funds until 30 June 1995. Since then, the CSS and PSS Boards have been free to determine their own investment management arrangements.
        <break page="5083" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During the period of its monopoly, CFM worked with the CSS and PSS Boards to develop investment management arrangements to apply to the CSS and PSS Funds after 30 June 1995. The new arrangements involve CFM's subsidiary, Total Risk Management Pty Ltd (TRM), in providing advice to the Boards about the overall investment strategies for the funds. The strategies involve management of substantial "passive" cores of the funds. This is being undertaken by CFM. The balance of the CSS and PSS Funds has been progressively allocated by the CSS and PSS Boards to a number of specialist "active" funds managers who have been selected on the advice of TRM.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Although CFM has developed additional business and attracted funds from other clients, the substantial CSS and PSS funds under management still represented some 75 per cent of the total funds under CFM's direct management at 30 June 1996.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ending of the monopolies over the CSS and PSS Funds has renewed pressures on CFM to improve its competitiveness in attracting additional clients and additional funds under management. This has come at a time when competition in the funds management industry itself has been increasing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the volume of funds in the market is growing, so too is the number of fund managers. In addition to traditional funds managers, there is competition from small "boutique" managers offering specialised services and from overseas managers who are establishing operations in Australia. Existing life insurance companies and banks are also seeing funds management as a source of new business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Moreover, the growing numbers of competitors provide opportunities for CFM. Many of those competitors are facing similar pressures and it is expected that some would be interested in joining forces via a purchase of CFM. It is expected that CFM's expertise and experience will be of benefit to potential purchasers and in turn that CFM would benefit from the wider opportunities available for further development of its business
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's decision to sell CFM is consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit (NCOA) which considered that government business activities whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest case to do so. Against the background of a growing number and variety of funds managers, and the investment strategies of the CSS and PSS Boards, there is clearly no public interest case to retain CFM in public ownership.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In reaching its decision, the Government consulted with the Board of CFM which has fully supported
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         this initiative. The sale process is also being undertaken in close consultation with CFM and CFM's major clients, particularly the CSS and PSS Boards of trustees. The sale of CFM should provide it with the opportunity to further improve its commercial performance and this should benefit its clients, including the Boards of the various superannuation schemes and their members.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The CFM Sale Bill provides the necessary framework to give effect to the decision to sell CFM.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides for a flexible disposal strategy. It allows for the sale of the shares in CFM and the separate sale of the shares in CFM subsidiaries on the same or different days. It enables the establishment, under Ministerial direction, of subsidiaries of CFM and the transfer of subsidiaries to Commonwealth ownership to allow their separate sale
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Part 2 of the bill provides for the transfer of CFM subsidiaries to the Commonwealth. In particular, it enables the transfer of CFM's existing subsidiary, TRM, to Commonwealth ownership to facilitate sale of that company separately from the sale of CFM, if sale in that form eventuates from the tender process now under way. That approach was recommended in the scoping study prepared by the business advisers appointed by my Department.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That Part of the bill also includes provision for the transfer of CFM staff, by Ministerial declaration, to a CFM subsidiary which has been transferred under this bill. This is because at present all the staff employed in CFM's operations, including those of the subsidiary TRM, are employed by CFM. The bill provides for continuity of employment terms and conditions and accrued entitlements for CFM staff who are transferred to TRM or any other CFM subsidiary that may be created. Provision is also made for the application of certain parts of the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Act, and certain other legislation to transferred CFM subsidiaries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Part 3 of the bill provides for the declaration of the sale day for CFM and any transferred bodies by the Minister
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Importantly, the bill provides in Part 3 for the preservation or other recognition of entitlements of CFM staff. It preserves accrued long service leave and superannuation entitlements and ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act continues to apply in relation to injury or loss incurred before sale day The bill provides for certain other rights, such as mobility rights under the Public Service Act 1922, to cease when CFM or a transferred body is sold. In these respects the bill reflects the past practice of Government in protecting accrued rights of employees in asset sale situations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also provides in Part 3 for the cancellation of CFM's franking credits, as the Government's
        <break page="5084" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         clear advice has been that there would be no benefit to the sale process in having those credits pass to any purchaser.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Part 4 of the bill further provides for the transfer, by Ministerial declaration, of specified assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of CFM or a transferred body to specified transferees on specified days. The ability to transfer these matters in this way will allow for the sale or transfer of matters that do not constitute CFM subsidiaries and for which it would not be appropriate to establish a subsidiary. This includes the transfer of assets and liabilities to transferred bodies to enable them to be sold as separate commercial entities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill amends the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Act 1990 to remove the constraints on the sale of CFM included in section 47 of that act and provides for the removal of similar constraints from CFM's memorandum and articles of association. The bill applies relevant provisions of that act to CFM subsidiaries that are transferred to Commonwealth ownership while they are in Commonwealth ownership and provides that they will cease to apply to CFM and the transferred bodies when they are sold.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill also makes consequential amendments to a number of other Commonwealth acts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill will provide a framework for the sale of CFM in the most flexible and expeditious way in response to commercial interest that is expressed in the sale process. It will also protect the interests of CFM employees and enable the effective disposition of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including for the benefit of CFM's clients.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the 1997 autumn sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.

       This motion seeks to exempt from the order of the Senate relating to the consideration of legislation the CFM Sale Bill 1996. The early completion of the sale of CFM is essential in the interests of CFM staff, contributors to the superannuation schemes whose funds it invests as well as the government's revenue. CFM's role has been changing since its legislated monopoly over the funds of the main Commonwealth schemes ended on 30 June last year. Since then CFM has had a declining share of those funds as the trustees, in the interests of the contributors, have been progressively allocating amounts of the funds to specialist active funds managers. This has reduced CFM's revenues as reflected in its last annual report.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       CFM has gained a number of other clients for its wholesale funds management business and is also involved in retail funds management for individual clients. Nevertheless, uncertainty over the future of the business is having an impact on the amount of funds under management and therefore on CFM's continuing profitability.

       The sale process announced in May is proceeding and the government expects that the successful purchaser will be selected before the end of this year. Passage of the legislation is essential for the completion of the sale. It would be most unsatisfactory for
       <break page="5085" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        the contributors to the super funds invested through CFM and for CFM staff to have the potential purchaser selected but unable to assume control pending legislation. It is also in the interests of CFM staff to have the uncertainty over the future ownership of the business resolved as soon as possible. These are the succinct reasons for the urgency of this bill. I ask the Senate to support this motion exempting this bill from the order of the Senate.

       In the last few weeks we have seen so&amp;hyphen;called urgent and non&amp;hyphen;controversial bills come through at the same time. We have found them to be anything but non&amp;hyphen;controversial. I cannot see where you would fit this bill into the normal program. If it is about privatisation it certainly would not be non&amp;hyphen;controversial. However, that is not the issue. The issue is whether the bill is urgent and how it suddenly became urgent in the last week or so. At the leaders' meetings in the last couple of weeks there were no other bills that were knocking at the door needing to come through.

       It may well be that the ALP has made a decision that, for various public relations reasons, we might be seen to be putting through more bills on Thursday lunchtime. That is up to the ALP to decide. If we are looking at the wording of the motion, the legislation has to be urgent.

       In relation to CFM, the urgency is that the government wants to sell it. They probably want to sell a lot of things, but that does not necessarily mean that it is absolutely essential for the Senate to deal with it now. If it is urgent and essential, to shove it through on a

       Whilst a lot of pressure is being put on the Greens (WA) to deal with the bills which are on the program and which are to be passed by the end of the year, at the same time the government is putting through more bills which it did not propose to put through. Suddenly they are urgent and have to come through the Senate. If you are in a situation like the Greens, you suddenly have to find people to work on them. Quite frankly, in recent times, bills that were put through as non&amp;hyphen;controversial certainly were not non&amp;hyphen;controversial.

       If the government wants us to handle the big program that we have in the next 4&amp;half; weeks, it is certainly not very sensible to be shoving through bills like this which, in the leaders' meetings a couple of weeks ago, did not surface. If it is urgent now why was it not urgent two weeks ago? I think the reasons for its urgency are manufactured.

       It is not for sale yet. It might never be for sale. It is pre-empting the decision of the Senate to say it is for sale. I certainly have not had a chance to find out from various people whether or not this bill is as urgent as the government says. At the very least, I think it would be reasonable to have a little more time to talk to people to find out whether the government's reasons for making this bill urgent, which we only got this morning, are compelling. That is why I am not supporting the motion today.

       Perhaps it would be reasonable at the very least to look at it at another time. We certainly do not have the staff to be able to deal with all these issues. We cannot, firstly, look in detail at every bill to find out whether it is urgent, and, secondly, when each one comes in, try to deal with it and shove it through in a Thursday lunchtime, which is the intention here. The arguments for urgency would only stand up if the bills were urgent a couple of weeks ago. They did not seem to even be on the agenda then. Why is this suddenly urgent now?

I will have to deal with the industrial relations bill and I would like a break from it on Thursday at some stage. Putting that aside, we recognise that the government has a program that requires processing. We will disagree from time to time on some of the issues in that program.

It is not a complicated matter. The minister has been to see you. In relation to both of these matters we are seeking your cooperation on, you have not raised a single matter of controversy or debate. In all of the briefings and discussions, which have been a number in relation to the social security legislation and at least one or two on the CFM Sale Bill, not a single matter of controversy has been raised.

        The requirement that the AIRC have regard to the need to apply the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, without discrimination based on sex, reflects the fact that its functions under part 6—dispute prevention and settlement—largely relate to the making of awards. The phrase `equal pay for work of equal value' is the principle developed by the AIRC to deal with the equal pay matters in the award area. As recently as November 1995, the AIRC has confirmed that this principle still applies. The principle applies and will continue to apply to all pay matters in the award stream, including to bonuses and allowances, which Senator Jacinta Collins will recall were something I responded to on Senator Mackay's queries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would be inappropriate for the AIRC to deal with alleged discrimination in the over&amp;hyphen;award area in the context of its award making functions. The specific inclusion of the principle in the legislation in the context of the AIRC's award making functions strengthens current arrangements.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Currently, where equal pay matters in awards are not legislated but left to the AIRC's wage fixing principles, the phrase `equal remuneration for work of equal value' has not generally been used in the context of the award stream but it was introduced through the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 in the context of separate minimum entitlements provisions. These provisions allow the AIRC to make orders on application to ensure equal remuneration for work of equal value for men and women workers, without discrimination based on sex, where there is no adequate alternative remedy.

         The phrase `equal remuneration' reflects the words used in the ILO equal remuneration convention on which the provisions are based. The use of the word `remuneration' indicates that the provisions have the potential to deal with a broader range of matters than have normally been addressed in the award stream—in particular, over&amp;hyphen;award pay. Remuneration is defined in the ILO convention as `including the ordinary, basic or minimum wage or salary and any additional emoluments whatsoever payable directly or indirectly, whether in cash or in kind, by the employer to the worker and arising out of the worker's employment'. That is something I expect Senator Jacinta Collins would have known already. Through a combination of provisions, including those set out in proposed section 88B and the minimum entitlements and equal remuneration provisions, legislation will be comprehensive in its coverage of equal pay. The AIRC will be able to deal with the full range of equal pay issues in both the award and over&amp;hyphen;award areas.

But, with respect, after what I have just heard I would have to say that the brief given to the department must have been `Justify the mistake we have made rather than remedy the mistake we have made in this agreement.' Yes, I have referred back to the ILO convention, which, I might add, was established in 1951. The point made there in the definition of the term `remuneration' was that it also included, as the parliamentary secretary has said, `additional emoluments whatsoever payable directly or indirectly'. I ask the parliamentary secretary whether that includes superannuation.

        I appreciate the parliamentary secretary's offer to take this on notice but my understanding—and someone might correct me on procedure—is that if we want to move along with this bill, we need to deal with the amendments on this issue now. I call on the government and the Democrats to say that instead of taking this issue on notice, they support the amendment the opposition has put with respect to equal remuneration, because it does not detract in any way from their agreement. There is not one single area where it can be pointed out that this small change would be any detraction, but it would make a significant improvement and perhaps would reinforce the honour which the government and the Democrats seem to place on this agreement—particularly the Democrats—in terms of protecting the interests of Australia's women workers. I call again: rather than just taking this issue on notice, let the opposition's amendment in relation to equal remuneration—I particularly call on the Democrats—be supported.

In its industrial legislation your government failed to deliver any progress after the departure of the much esteemed Senator Susan Ryan. Not just that, but under your model of enterprise bargaining, the gap was widening. Women were recording lower rises on average than men and more pressure was being put on workers with family responsibilities, most of whom were women, due to longer hours and more stressful work.

         —Thank you, Mr Chairman. Section 88B is not the objects of the part. They are considerations to which the commission must have regard in exercising its functions. Obviously, the functions it is exercising must touch on the principle: where the commission is dealing with work and payment for work, it must have regard to equal pay for work of equal value. It does so now.

        Where, however, it is dealing with payments other than payments for work, it must have regard to (e), which is the need to eliminate discrimination on the basis of, amongst other things, sex and family responsibilities. The commission is also required to have regard to the objects of the act under section 90, which include expressly assisting workers to balance their family responsibilities and assisting in giving effect to their international obligations, which include the ILO conventions on equal remuneration and family responsibilities.

        I really believe that, regardless of the sincerity of your views, you are barking up the wrong tree in this one. The commission is required by this legislation to give far greater prominence to equal pay, to family responsibilities, to anti-discrimination issues, than it was under your act.

If the allegation of Senator Murray is correct that the trend towards enterprise bargaining has been to the disadvantage of women—if that is correct, if it is true, and I have not seen any wage analysis that proves that one or another—Senator Murray, why are you party to a deal with respect to this bill which puts a greater emphasis on enterprise bargaining, and which, presumably, on your logic, would make the growing equality for the remuneration of women and men worse? I notice that you were on the phone when I put that point.

        The other issues Senator Murray raised were largely irrelevant and not central to the debate before the chamber. Before we proceed to the debate, could I ask that our very critical amendment with respect to remuneration and substituting for the word `pay'—not `pay' substituting for `remuneration'; I can understand why Senator Murray is getting confused—amendment 6, be put separately?

         Amendment 3 can be found on the Greens (WA) revised sheet 217. Amendment 3 on revised sheet 217 replaces our amendment 13 on sheet 183. This is our amendment in relation to the insertion of the concept of workplace harassment in the discrimination clause. Honourable senators will find the definition for workplace harassment on page 2 of our sheet 183. The reason for including workplace harassment in this bill is that, according to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, there is a growing incidence of harassment in the workplace. We feel there is a need for it to be dealt with in this bill.

        <para>
         What we have done in our amendment 3 is add `insert workplace harassment' after `discrimination', and I do not think that is an unreasonable thing to do. It is important that we provide some recognition and some legal remedy in relation to harassment in the workplace. Whilst we see that there are efforts to deal with workplace harassment—whether it is sexual harassment or harassment of any other kind within the workplace—there is the necessity, we believe, to be able to get a proper redress under law so that people are not treated unfairly in this way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend to the Senate the inclusion of `workplace harassment'. I would like to see this supported because a number of groups in
         <break page="5094" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the community—women's groups, people with non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and, as I say, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission—are looking to make improvements in these areas. I really think we need to move in that direction. Anti&amp;hyphen;discrimination commissions are looking  carefully at issues of workplace harassment but it is not actually covered by the acts as they exist. Because of that, it is difficult for the various bodies to deal with these issues.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like there to be at least recognition that we should have some legal mention of workplace harassment. If we are trying to work towards workplaces that work and that are fair, it is not fair that people could legally, in any sense, continue to harass people in the workplace. Therefore, I would like support for the Greens' amendment to at least include that as something that is not part of what we should see as a good workplace environment.

         —As is frequently the case with Senator Margetts, I think her intentions are excellent in moving an amendment to include `workplace harassment' in section 88B, but I do have difficulty in determining how this provision adds to the bill as a whole. All awards will contain an anti-discrimination clause. The bill is full of provisions which deal with express grounds of harassment, such as prohibiting harassments on the ground of membership or non-membership of a union, which are outlawed. Unfair termination is covered. Conditions which are harsh or unjust are expressly covered, and there are processes through HREOC for dealing more appropriately with most harassment cases. I think this amendment—particularly looking at the definition proposed earlier—is just too broad and does not add much to the act; therefore, we will oppose it.

         —I thank Senator Murray for his contribution, but he has probably given the best explanation of why our amendment is
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          necessary. He gave the limits, if you like, to what is covered under the current discrimination clauses, but that does not actually cover harassment. You would have to actually prove that there was a discriminatory decision made, and harassment is not necessarily related to provable discriminatory incidents; harassment is something quite different. Currently, that does not include sexual harassment. Therefore, the fact that somebody has discriminated on the basis of someone's sex is quite different from sexual harassment in the workplace.

        I guess there are certainly people who would be able to give clear evidence of what the difference is between discrimination based on sex and sexual harassment and harassment of other kinds. It is quite different. That is why I read out the definition of why they are different and that is why I still see that what exists does not cover sexual harassment and harassment of other kinds in the workplace. This amendment still deserves the support of the Senate because harassment is not covered in the current bill and it is not covered in the current amendments.

        This amendment, which is also on the revised sheet 217, relates to amendment 18 of the government and the Democrats. Paragraph (e) reads:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        the need to prevent and eliminate discrimination because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there are still groups in the community who, if you like, fall through the gaps in relation to those categories. In particular, I want to mention our amendment which seeks to include `transgender identity'. Often when you bring up the issue of transgender identity, you get people sniggering and finding reasons for jokes. There are all sorts of interesting responses.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         I want to outline the reason why we have moved this amendment. The main premise for the inclusion of transgender identity in the anti-discrimination provisions contained in the workplace relations bill relies on the element ary legal and human rights premise that all Australian citizens should be afforded equal rights to all Australian law. To continue to deny transgenders equal rights and protection from discrimination on the grounds that anti-discrimination laws are far too costly on business is a nonsense. Besides the fact that the transgender population in Australia is estimated to be no more than about 5,000, financial cost should never be a trade-off for an individual's human rights.

        In 1994, the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health funded the report entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Transgender lifestyles and HIV/AIDS risk: National transgender HIV/AIDS needs assessment project (Australia)
        </emphasis>
        . This report found that the educational levels of transgenders are considerably higher than the national population. Yet in nearly every type of occupation from before to after the gender crossing there is a reduction of between 25 per cent and 50 per cent in work experiences. The exceptions to this trend are in sex work and in pornography, which are often the only options left to many transgenders when they cross the gender line. There is no doubt that the reason for this trend is discrimination. Indeed, every day of their lives, transgenders have to confront an inordinate level of discrimination. The sheer amount of discrimination they consistently face is telling with an estimated 47 per cent suicide rate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To date, no Commonwealth government has afforded transgenders protection from discrimination in either industrial relations law or in anti-discrimination law. There is a legal basis that could be used. In New South Wales the same arguments were recently used and worked for the inclusion of transgender identity in the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1997. The ACLGR believes that the inclusion of transgender identity in the New South Wales Anti&amp;hyphen;Discrimination Act also translated into an automatic inclusion into the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991, because the Industrial Relations Act refers to the prohibitive conduct conducted in the Anti-Discrimination Act.

        I would be interested to see if the parliamentary secretary is able to refute this. There may well be legal precedent. It is now 1996.

         There is no excuse now not to start dealing with these issues which are so blatant in our society. If we separate out a group from society and say, `This group because of their sexual identity is not able to access basic human rights,' then we are to be blamed. On that basis I commend to the chamber this amendment 4 from our new amendments. I hope that people will see in their basic human commonsense that we cannot continue to separate out one group from society and say, `That group is not able to access basic human rights,' which any other group in our society should be able to access.

Indeed, the desirability of federal legislation in relation to transgender identity is before that committee. I am sure that Senator Brown and Senator Margetts would understand as much as any other Senator or any person in the broader community that these are matters that deserve detailed consideration. I am sure that those senators who support the aim of this amendment will ensure that it gets that sort of consideration through the committee process and through further deliberation.

        Secondly, as Senator Brown and Senator Margetts would know, there is a private members bill before the Senate dealing with this matter.

Lastly, it is questionable whether the Commonwealth has power to legislate in respect of transgender identity discrimination. The scope for the use of the external affairs power is limited because at this stage there is no international instrument ratified by Australia that refers to the issue.

It is interesting that Senator Campbell is concerned with ILO conventions now but does not necessarily think that ILO conventions should be followed in all aspects of the bill. Obviously, there will be various legal opinions on whether this bill in total, when it passes, accords with ILO conventions.

        It is necessary that we deal with this issue at some stage. I am absolutely certain that the structure of this bill and the way it is being put through will mean that at some time in the future we will be required to revisit workplace relations. There will be things that simply do not work or which are so embarrassing that we will have to come back here in pretty short time. So I will store up all the kind comments about people giving due consideration to this matter after the committee's deliberations. I give notice that I will be seeking to divide on this issue because, for at least 5,000 people in our community, it is a vital one.

        I promise that the next time we have an industrial relations bill—to fix up the errors in this one—I will move the amendment again. At that stage, we might have the chance to look at the issues and consider the report of the committee and, hopefully, support what is an important issue of basic human rights for a sector of our community.

         —I want to make a couple of points about this item on behalf of the Labor Party. In terms of the wider progress of the bill, I would like to draw to the attention of the chamber that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, on behalf of the Labor opposition raised with the government today the issue of sitting on the Monday evening of the next sitting week if necessary. I also understand that there are some discussions going on about using general business time this week to discuss the bill. This schedule includes the considerable majority of the concerns that we have. I certainly anticipate that the pace at which we move will considerably accelerate once we are beyond schedule 5.

         The government seeks to provide that the commission can only arbitrate as a last resort and within limits specified in section 89A(2) of the act. We want to amend this so that the commission can arbitrate when necessary. It should be noted that what we are proposing appears in the objectives of this bill and in the government&amp;hyphen;Democrat deal. Regrettably, there is no change proposed to this schedule.

        This amendment proposes the omission of section 89A and the substitution of new section 89A. Subsection 89A(2) adds two new allowable award matters—superannuation, at paragraph 89A(2)(s), and protection of outworkers, at paragraph 89A(2)(t). Three existing allowable award matters are amended. Proposed paragraph 89A(2)(a) is amended to include skill based career paths and proposed paragraph 89A(2)(b) is amended to include specific reference to rest breaks, notice periods and variations to working hours. Proposed paragraph 89A(2)(g) is amended to include cultural leave, which covers such leave as ceremonial leave for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.

Under the general award system established under section 89A, there would be no new paid rates awards.

Secondly, it must be satisfied that it is appropriate to settle the matter by arbitration; that is, the matter would not be better dealt with, for example, through agreements at the workplace or enterprise level and/or the matter is not otherwise dealt with by legislation; that is at paragraph (c).

         —Labor opposes this provision particularly strongly. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 introduces a provision which, as has been outlined, confines the scope of industrial issues and, therefore, the commission's award making power. There were originally 18 allowable matters. There are now 20, and that will go back to 19 at some point in the future when the superannuation provisions are removed. It also requires the commission to make only minimum rates awards and prohibits the commission from regulating the number of part-time and casual employees and the maximum hours worked by part-time employees. In the amendments that we will get to a little later, we delete these restrictions.

        As to allowable matters, this provision will preclude the commission from making awards about important conditions of employment, such as breaks between shifts, spans of hours and manning hours, termination change and redundancy, protective clothing, study leave, training and occupational health and safety.

This provision will preclude the commission from limiting the number of part-time or casual employees in the work force. This creates the potential for the increased casualisation of the work force.

         you need in an award system is certainty—and that is what we have in the award system today under the federal jurisdiction. Also, under the federal award system for a number of years now there has been a system in place whereby the party to an award, operating under the jurisdiction of the commission, would review their award.

If they can do it around the negotiating table then anyone can do it. That demonstrates that the system, as it currently is, is working with the assistance of the commission.

        I return to the government and ask them to look at their own policy document, Better pay for better work, the policy document upon which this legislation is based and what you say you have a mandate for.

        Nowhere in that document did you ever say before the election that you would legislate to do this. You said it would be a process of simplification under the supervision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Now what we have is the government, in collusion with the Democrats, doing the simplification on their terms, then allowing a little bit of light for the parties to go away and argue for clauses to be put back into awards, creating a great deal of uncertainty and concern out there.

        You do not have to believe me. Go and talk to employers out there in industries who will acknowledge they do not know whether some provisions will fit into the 18 allowable matters or not. It would have been far more appropriate to have left the system as it was, to have left the awards in place, to have left the clauses in those awards, which, in many cases, have been determined by arbitration or by consent, and to have allowed the processes of the commission, through conciliation and arbitration, to have simplified and modernised those awards. And that was happening. I quote further from your policy where, on page 1 of the introduction, you state:

        There is no flexibility in this section of the act at all. You are just removing, in a blanket manner, clauses of awards and then saying to the participants, `You have to go out and get them back in.' That is not flexibility; that is highway robbery. But you also go on further to state:

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        For employees who would choose to have their wages and conditions determined by an award, the award system will be made much more flexible. We will encourage less complex awards.

        This is not encouragement. You are not saying to the parties, `We want you to continue a process of modernising.' You are saying, `This is what you can have, and you can't have the rest in an award unless you can fit yourself in under the special circumstances provision. But you may be able to have it in

I will leave my remarks at that point. I have some further remarks to make as we get further into this debate.

        The matters that Senator Forshaw raises do go to the heart of the debate about this schedule, and a number of those points were raised, quite properly, under the objects schedule as well. But the concept of trying to get awards simplified and reduced to a set of core pay and conditions standards is not a matter that is particularly controversial between our two parties. It was very much what former Prime Minister Paul Keating had in mind when he made his address to, I think, the company directors association after the 1993 election, and it was at the heart of the principles of the Brereton bill back in 1993&amp;hyphen;94.

People should be aware that under the previous government, particularly between the years 1984 and 1992, the ABS labour force survey released in August 1994, I understand, showed that something like 23.7 per cent of all employees when that survey was taken—and it may indeed have increased since then—were employed on a casual basis in their main job. So it is an enormous part of the work force.

        I want to ask the parliamentary secretary to define `reasonably predictable' in relation to part-time workers. Can the parliamentary secretary tell us in detail what `reasonably predictable' means? Is the criteria for deciding reasonableness from the perspective of the employer or the employee? Couldn't many employers argue that it is unreasonable for them to be expected to predict their staffing requirements more than a week in advance? How much notice can part&amp;hyphen;timers expect to receive of their shifts? How much notice can part-timers expect to receive if an employer intends to drop their hours from 20 per week to four per week? Can Senator Campbell explain to us exactly how `reasonably predictable hours' differentiates part-timers from casuals? Why would employers employ someone full time and permanently when they can have this sort of flexibility? The Democrats might be well meaning in their inclusion of `pro rata benefits' in the definition of part-time work. How much do pro rata benefits mean to someone who is employed for six hours per week?

        Clauses 89A(4)(a) and 89A(4)(b) allow for whole industries to become casualised or to use only part-time workers. We heard evidence before the economics committee of the difficulties and disadvantages that part-time and casual workers face right across Australia. Senator Campbell, can you tell us, given that section 89A(4)(a) prevents the Industrial Relations Commission from determining the number of casual or part-time workers in a workplace, what will prevent industries such as the banking industry and the hospitality industry—which already have high proportions of casual and part-time workers—dispensing with full-time permanent employees altogether? What will happen to employees in those industries who wish to work full time? Will they have to change jobs?

Doesn't this contravene the intention of the bill at schedule 1, section 3A, as amended by the coalition&amp;hyphen;Democrat deal, of creating a flexible and fair labour market? What is fair about not getting enough work to live on? What is fair about hours being changed once an employee has accepted a job? That certainly will happen under this section. Won't employers favour the increased flexibility of having a largely casualised or flexible part-time work force? Won't this outweigh any consideration of providing a stable work environment for employees or a living wage?

        Senator Campbell, do you claim that this legislation will prevent increased casualisation and substitute in its place increased part-time work? Is that the reason for reducing protections for part-time workers? Senator Chapman asked Professor McCallum this question during the inquiry:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . in a number of awards . . . the existing minimum hours requirement has resulted in casualisation of the work&amp;hyphen;force rather than permanent part-time employment? Would you accept that the aim of this legislation in removing those hours restriction is to stop that casualisation developing and allow for permanent part-time employment with the relevant pro rata benefits therefore being available that are not often available under the casual aspect?
       </para>
       <para>
        Isn't it true, Senator Campbell, that awards could provide for casuals to have pro rata entitlements under the current legislation? It is more a matter of reducing protections for part-timers than increasing protections for casuals, isn't it? Doesn't this legislation force workers to face the insecurity of casual work, with none of the financial rewards traditionally associated with that insecurity?

        The Industrial Relations Commission is allowed to regulate the minimum number of consecutive hours an employee may be asked to work but is not allowed to regulate the maximum or minimum number of total hours—that is, shifts per week—an employee may be asked to work. The coalition&amp;hyphen;Democrat deal addresses one concern—that of maximum number of hours worked in one shift. That is an improvement. Employers cannot force workers to work 16&amp;hyphen;hour shifts. I acknowledge that.

         That was the evidence of the union's secretary. Doesn't the failure of 89A(4)(b) to allow the commission to set maximum and minimum hours leave the way open for just this sort of exploitation? Senator Campbell, I challenge you to prove that will not happen.

        This report deals with a data&amp;hyphen;matching program within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It brings together a few considerations. One is the issue of privacy, and I note that the department has paid attention to the need for privacy in the area of data matching and has, according to this report, taken note of what the Privacy Commissioner says. The idea of this program is to see what payments are made and whether any payments have been made other than in accordance with the act. It is good to see that, as a result of that, the number of cases found is very small.
        <break page="5112" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Indeed, as far as criminal prosecutions go, only two cases have been successfully prosecuted during the period with which this report deals.

        I mainly want to talk about the fact that the veterans' affairs department is a very important one because it deals with those people who have offered themselves in the defence of this country. It is very pleasing to see that the country still has regard for those veterans. We recall the Australian Remembers program last year which revived memories amongst all senators in this house of the desire that everybody in Australia has to remember those people who have gone to war.

        On Sunday I was at a ceremony in Geelong where the veterans from Korea were commemorating the part they played in that war. It is a war that is sometimes not given the prominence it should be given. I would just like to call to mind the men and women who went to Korea at that time in compliance with the call their country made. The people who turned out at Geelong to commemorate that occasion ought to be recalled at this point.

        This report deals with the financial payments made by the Commonwealth to the primary and secondary education systems in this country. It shows that the Commonwealth gives support to both state and private schools right across Australia. This report deals with a period when the previous government, the Keating government, was in power. It shows the wide range of support given to many

         schools right across the board. I would invite honourable senators to look at this report. For example, on page 55 it lists the secondary schools from New South Wales and then, if you go over the page, it lists the number of schools in Victoria that were given assistance—both state and non-government schools.

        It is important that this government—by `this government', I mean the federal government as distinct from the state and territory governments—continues to give support on a very generous basis for the education of the children of this country.

        There are other senators who may want to speak upon this, because it is a very important topic. It is a matter that is debated again and again in this chamber and in this parliament. Unless we keep debating it and come to realise that the expenditure of money on education is one of the core responsibilities of this government, then the future of the country will be less rosy than it will otherwise be.

        The importance of the rural adjustment scheme would be well known to some senators. The rural adjustment scheme is very important in the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment, particularly in my state of Queensland. The problem that we have with ongoing drought is very severe. Some people may not be aware, but there are areas of Queensland that are still substantially in drought. Even in areas where people have come out of drought, the effects of drought last a lot longer than the drought itself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For example, it might be the case that an area has undergone such a substantial period of drought that when the rains do come there is no ordinary grass coverage. The consequence of that is that noxious weeds come up very quickly. With no grass to choke them out, the properties become weed infested. In other words, they suffer environmental damage from drought. In other cases, prolonged periods of drought might mean that when you have feed on the ground, the feed does not have a lot of nutrition in it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But by far the greatest problem that confronts primary producers is that of dealing with the debt caused by drought, and dealing with the process of building up a herd or building up a flock. When you have drought, especially when it extends across the whole state, it is very difficult to find good agistment for animals. Often you have to destock in order to preserve what you have in your pasture and in order to ensure that the stock you do have has a chance of getting through the drought.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many primary producers have been involved in destocking—not by choice but out of necessity—in order to make sure that their properties, and whatever animals they have, get through the drought. It may be some substantial period of time before it is possible for a property to get back to a normal level of production.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For example, say you were a wool grower and you have been substantially affected by drought, you might not have as many sheep as you would normally have. So, although the drought ends and you get some feed, you are confronted by two things. First of all, your wool is not as fine because the sheep are
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         eating better and so the wool tends to go out to a thicker micron. The other problem is that you still do not have enough sheep to meet all the operating costs. You might have only half the number of sheep you ordinarily run so you are getting only half the amount of wool. You might also find that the wool is uneven in quality so the value of the wool is reduced.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This government, when confronted with the end of the drought in some areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales, was faced with a problem: do we just cut off the drought assistance altogether or do we say that we will extend the drought assistance to help those people affected? This is where the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council has played a role. But much of the work is that of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, in dealing with the problem and recognising that there are ongoing effects of drought that are not relieved by the first fall of rain.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We feel very pleased that the minister has been able to unveil a scheme which, over the next three years, will add some $180 million of assistance to primary producers who have been affected by drought. This is a sign of the real commitment that the coalition government has to people in rural and regional Australia. I hasten to say that this is $180 million of commitment which was not in the budget left by the previous government; it was not in the forward estimates. This is money we have put up because of our desperate concern to ensure that people on the land not only survive the drought but also get a bit of a breathing space in order to improve their financial position and to build up the capacity of their properties.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is important because those people employ workers—if they are in the wool industry they employ shearers—and the money they spend in rural and remote towns goes to ensure that shopkeepers, publicans, barmaids, waiters and a range of other people all have jobs in town. We are very pleased with this measure. It is a sign of the commitment we have made.

        I was a bit disappointed in the report of that inquiry inasmuch as it picked up a lot of what RAS does and endorsed it but it was quite clear from the inquiry that RAS does not go far enough.

        There are a number of issues related to drought that are being raised, particularly by people like Noel Kennedy, one of the Queensland representatives on the Wool Council. As Senator O'Chee pointed out, the downgrading of flocks in western Queensland has been very significant. In the Winton area, where Noel Kennedy has his property, I understand that the flock has declined from around three million sheep to around one million. Although they have had rain in the Winton&amp;hyphen;Hughenden area, the problem is what to do to restock those areas if you simply do not have the

         I rise to discuss the National Board of Employment, Education and Training's annual report for 1995&amp;hyphen;96. As many senators would be aware, this government has moved to, in fact, abolish the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, so I imagine this would be one of the last reports—if not the last report—we would see from this particular body.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the abolition of NBEET is of particular concern as the function of the national board is to develop advice on a range of employment, education and training areas, ranging from vocational education through to schools, and language and literacy policies. It has a number of boards that tie into its functions, including the Australian Research Council, the Higher Education Council, language and literacy boards, Schools Council, the Australian International Education Foundation—all providing fundamental cross&amp;hyphen;sectoral advice to this government as they have to previous governments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Certainly, the abolition of the board has been looked into by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Overwhelmingly, groups who were present, including the chair of NBEET, members from the National Union of Students, the National Tertiary Education Union, provided

         The abolition of NBEET also comes at a time when education in this country is being shaken up by the coalition government. This is not just in higher education, but across the board. We have heard in this place, recently, that language and literacy programs are all under review. In fact, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has announced that there will be a major review—a major independent assessment—of higher education in this country. So I ask: would it not be more appropriate to defer such abolition or restructuring of a body like NBEET until—

If there is one thing that Australia needs in this day and age, it is good managers.

        This is a very important report. Over many years, the Democrats have raised problems about the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals, although we are aware that it is necessary to use chemicals at different times. This annual report does address that issue. It is important that it be studied by the Senate. At this point, I have not had a chance to read it in any detail and, for that reason, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         In the 34th quarterly report of the Nuclear Safety Bureau for the period 1 January to 31 March there is mention in the advice to Commonwealth section that the Nuclear Safety Bureau program of updating the assessments of Australian ports for visits of nuclear powered warships continued based on priorities agreed by the visiting ships nuclear panel, a Commonwealth interdepartmental committee known as the VSP(N). It also talks about the fact that a radiological assessment of Cockburn Sound, WA, for visits by nuclear powered ships was completed during the quarter and a report was provided to the VSP(N) for distribution to state and Commonwealth authorities. If this is being distributed to state and Commonwealth authorities I would like to think that the federal parliament could see it. I hope the government will release that assessment. If it does not, I will want to know why?

         There was a report detailing a range of accident scenarios for emergency response planning and exercises.

         —I would like to make some comments about what I perceived as the cynical attitudes of senior officers of the Department of Health and Family Services towards the medical profession and GPs in particular revealed during the course of the recent Senate estimates hearings. I have to declare that I have an interest in the matter, having been in medical practice since 1975. That also means that I speak from a position of considerable knowledge.

        The first matter I would like to comment on is the fact that the key performance indicators of the Medicare program do not include any assessment of the views of the providers of the service, the doctors. I find it quite unbelievable that, in this day and age, an assessment of the views of the providers is not included as a performance indicator because the service providers are a major stakeholder and must be viewed as such.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my opinion, not including the assessment of the views of the service providers as a KPI in the assessment of Medicare is an unacceptable omission. It appears to me that the exclusion of the assessment of the views of the service providers can only be interpreted as strongly suggesting an unwillingness on the part of the department to consider any view that may differ from its own predetermined policy. Assessment of the views of service providers should be regarded as a standard modern management practice. Routine assessment of the providers' opinions concerning the program could help to reveal both strengths and weaknesses. In reply to a question I put on notice about including the views of the providers as a KPI of the Medicare
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         program, the department made the following reply:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Department does not believe that the views of providers is an appropriate performance indicator as clearly there would be many cases where the interests and satisfaction of providers would not coincide with the objectives of the programme.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have written to Dr Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Family Services, expressing my concern that the performance indicators of Medicare did not include as a KPI an assessment of the views of the medical profession as service providers. I have requested that Dr Wooldridge give consideration to issuing a ministerial directive that provider assessment be made a key performance indicator of the Medicare program in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another matter which concerned me was that, during the estimates hearings, a senior departmental official suggested that each additional GP in practice costs Medicare $176,000 per year in rebates paid out due to the fact that doctors encourage patients who are not really sick to see them. He said that doctors were encouraging patients to return for more visits than were really necessary. Furthermore, I was concerned that a little later in the proceedings another health department official stated that general practitioners encourage patients with colds to come and see them, clearly implying that GPs are routinely overservicing by encouraging visits from patients with the most minor of complaints. As I said, the clear implication of this remark was that GPs are overservicing to generate extra income by getting patients with trivial illnesses to come and see them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These remarks struck me as being extremely cynical and an unacceptable reflection on the professional integrity of medical general practitioners. In my experience of 20 years as a general practitioner, I have found GPs to be a group of hardworking, dedicated, professional people. As I said, I was profoundly disturbed by the cynical attitudes towards GPs exhibited by the senior officials of the Department of Health and Family Services at the estimates hearings. This is a very serious matter that should concern the Senate. Health services are very important to members of the community. The public expects there to be a harmonious and cooperative partnership
        <break page="5118" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         between the bureaucrats administering the health system and the service providers who, in this case, are the general practitioners of Australia.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is an enormous level of dissatisfaction among GPs in this country. This was revealed in a 1995 Australian National University epidemiology unit survey of GPs across Australia. There were 2,165 GPs in the survey who, on average, had been in practice for 15 years, 95 per cent of whom were vocationally registered. I had this report tabled in the estimates hearings. Senators will no doubt be concerned to learn that the report showed that 76.3 per cent of GPs were disillusioned and that 83.7 per cent cited poor remuneration as a factor in this. A figure of 34.4 per cent of GPs said that they would leave general practice immediately if they could, and 94.6 per cent felt that their contribution to Australian medicine was not valued by the government. From my impressions at the Senate estimates hearings, one would have no alternative but to conclude that the doctors were quite correct in their perception that their contribution to Australian medicine appears to be undervalued, at least by the Department of Health and Family Services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, I would like to put on record in the Senate my view that the department cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand call upon GPs to practise better medicine and then on the other criticise them when they comply with that request. In the interests of thoroughness, GPs cannot spend more time with patients, resulting in having longer consultations, ordering more tests, writing more prescriptions and making more selective referrals. only to have the most senior officials of the department cynically criticise them for overservicing.

        The circulation list for the Australian Doctor which contained the questionnaire included 16,900 `general practitioners in private practice'.

The estimated response rate is therefore approximately 18.5 per cent. However, the profile of responding GPs on a range of socio&amp;hyphen;demographic and practice characteristics was not significantly different from non&amp;hyphen;respondents interviewed in the telephone survey.

The profile of respondents to the 1991 and the 1995 surveys indicates that respondents are broadly

         —I trust that the minister on duty, Senator Brownhill, will bring Senator Eggleston's concerns to the attention of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I want to mention on the way through that the daughter of my colleague and seat mate Senator Cooney, who is Megan Cooney, has just gone through her medical exams and is now awaiting the results. Whether she will be able to practise as a doctor will be in the lap of the gods and the minister. That is of concern to Senator Cooney both as a parent and a political representative. He is concerned about his constituents in the great state of Victoria, just as Senator Eggleston and I are concerned about the impact of that decision on the great state of Western Australia. That is not the reason I chose to rise here tonight, although I want to relate it back to my electorate in Western Australia.

        So I have a vested interest in the debate that was taking place in the other place yesterday—firstly, as a migrant to this country who took out citizenship and, secondly, as a person who chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Migration inquiring into the Citizenship Act.

        Further to that, I played a small part in collecting signatures on petitions right around Australia to get the then government to change the oath that Australian residents had to take when they became citizens. Until Australia Day 1994, new citizens had to swear an oath of loyalty to the Queen, her heirs and successors. The then government changed that to a new pledge, which came into effect for the first time on Australia Day in 1994, which read:

Mr Filing was a member of the coalition parties in opposition who opposed the new citizenship pledge and citizenship oath that came into being in January 1994. Mr Filing now, as an Independent member of parliament, obviously has seen some light and wants to move to strengthen things. He did refer to the fact that during the election campaign the coalition said that they would be addressing the matter of citizenship if they were re&amp;hyphen;elected to office.

        I recall that, during a major outlook conference in Adelaide in February last year of the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research, the then shadow minister for immigration, when questioned on what the coalition in government would do with the Citizenship Act, prevaricated on whether they might indeed seek to return to a pledge of loyalty to the Queen.

We will not revert back, and the Australian population will not allow the government to revert back, to the colonial days. I have great hopes that the current minister will not want to do that.

        I think Ms Hanson, in what she said in the other place yesterday, is certainly ignorant of what becoming an Australian citizen means. I am really surprised at Mr Filing. I have sat on the stage at the ceremonies in the city of Wanneroo back home and have felt the feelings of individuals as they took the pledge or swore an oath to become citizens of Australia. We know what the feeling is and what a commitment those people are making.

        Ms Hanson has not been doing her job as a member of parliament in one sense, in that she has not, to my knowledge, attended a citizenship ceremony. If she has, she would not have made the comments that she made in the House of Representatives yesterday.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I saw Ms Hanson today on the monitor and she was reading a speech. It is not allowed here and I am not doing it tonight. I very rarely do. So maybe she was just reading somebody else's words. She might have attended citizenship ceremonies but, for whatever reason, was reading something that somebody else had prepared for her. I think it is very unfortunate that something that is as precious as what we are talking about—
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Australian citizenship for migrants—can be treated in such a manner.

        What is suggested in the revised citizenship pledge proposed by Ms Hanson and Mr Filing does not detract from the pledge; it probably would strengthen it. But it should be strengthened out there in the community. Let us talk to the migrants. What Ms Hanson really should be addressing, if she wants to change things, is her own commitment to this place. When she was sworn in here—or indeed when I was sworn in here as a senator—we had to say the following, `We swear we will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, so help me God'—a colonial thing that we as members of parliament have to swear to.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Why attack new citizens in the manner that Ms Hanson has sought to attack them? Why is she allowing herself to be used in the manner in which it appears she is allowing herself to be used? I hope that the Independent member for Moore, my local member, will wake up to what is happening around here and will, in the very near future, divorce himself from her actions, because she is bringing Australia into disrepute not only in the region in which we live but with her own constituents and residents.

         —I rise tonight to draw the attention of my fellow senators to the chronic shortage of housing for people with disabilities. People with disabilities are amongst the most disadvantaged group in this country. Not only do they suffer from the kind of discrimination and isolation which comes largely from a public ignorance and misunderstanding of their disabilities, but they also suffer the effects of acute reticence on the part of state and federal governments to take on the issues which affect them so seriously.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of my goals during this, my first term in this place, is to have a positive impact on the lives of people with disabilities and their carers. I meet very regularly with people who have disabilities and with their families, their carers and those who work with them. It has
        <break page="5127" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         become very clear to me that housing is the one area in which the needs of people with disabilities are very seriously deficient. It is no exaggeration to say that today there is a chronic shortage of safe, suitable and affordable housing for people who have disabilities, be they physical, intellectual or psychiatric.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A study of housing needs of people with disabilities conducted in 1991 by Sach and Associates identified the high demand for housing and the insufficient supply as a major issue. Conservative estimates cited in the report were that there were 51,000 people with a disability who had housing needs, 37,500 of whom lived in the community but required rehousing. Keys Young estimated that in 1993 in New South Wales alone between 10,000 and 20,000 people with a psychiatric disability were likely to need public housing compared with the 2,500 applications that had been received in the previous three years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1993 reported that the national trend to deinstitutionalise people with psychiatric disabilities had not been adequately resourced, with very serious consequences for some of the people concerned. It said at the time:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        People affected by mental illness face a critical shortage of appropriate and affordable housing. The absence of suitable supported accommodation is the single biggest obstacle to recovery and effective rehabilitation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A large proportion of people with mental illness live at home with their families, who urgently need more respite care.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Homeless shelters, refuges and boarding houses are now functioning, de facto, as a major component of the `accommodation provided by our society for thousands of Australians affected by mental illness'. This is completely unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true to say that the deinstitutionalisation of the past two decades has very substantially added to the unmet need for housing of people with disabilities. It is also true to say that deinstitutionalisation properly managed and implemented gives people with disabilities control over their own lives and their own destinies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Unfortunately for these people the process has not been accompanied by adequate sup port out there in the community. Turning people out of institutions without support or proper accommodation is not deinstitutionalisation, as I think it was intended to be; I would call it neglect. In 1994, one year after the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission study, the so&amp;hyphen;called Burdekin inquiry, I was a joint author of a study which examined the progress which had been made in Victoria in addressing the findings of that report. I found that the reality was that in terms of housing there had been very little improvement.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The 1992&amp;hyphen;93 federal budget, as I understand it, did seek to address the housing shortfall with what was called the community housing program. Its stated goal was to add 25,000 dwellings by the year 2000. I would be very interested to know how many dwellings had actually been added to the stock of public housing in our community that is suited to people with disabilities. I think it would be reasonable to say that that program has not yet met its target.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As senators will know, the federal government is currently attempting to renegotiate its housing agreement with the states and, in so doing, it is stepping back from its responsibilities for public housing, such as the one I have just mentioned. As if that were not enough, the government also plans to reduce the amount of rent assistance available to single people with disabilities who share accommodation. This is one of the most disturbing and socially regressive measures that have come out of the budget this year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        How is it that any government can choose to make it even harder for people with disabilities to access private rental housing in an environment where there is already such a huge unmet need? Clearly, the situation will only get worse if this government abolishes tied funding for housing programs for those with disabilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe this area is far too important to leave to the private sector. Not only do those with disabilities often need housing which is specifically modified to meet their needs but they need housing which is in towns and cities with facilities close to hand and employment also easily accessible. To adequately
        <break page="5128" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         meet the housing needs of disabled people requires commitment and planning on the part of the federal government to ensure that their needs are made a national priority. The federal government, in my view, should be setting a precedent for commitment for all governments; it certainly should not be withdrawing its support.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was very pleased to notice this week that Premier Richard Court in Western Australia announced that his government intends to allocate an additional $7 million to public housing for people with disabilities. I hope this goes some way to addressing the unmet needs of people with disabilities in Western Australia. But it is my sincere hope that the Senate will not forget the thousands of others throughout Australia who will simply remain on public housing waiting lists. The coalition government's intention to step back from providing grants for public housing and to provide welfare instead in the form of rent assistance will not lead to more public housing in Australia—and it is my view that it will certainly not meet the needs of disabled people in our country.

        The winner, as the Senate is well aware—and it was won in good fashion—was Saintly. That made it a very special cup in the history of the Melbourne Cup because it was the trainer's, Bart Cummings, 10th win in the Melbourne Cup; a feat that really is now unlikely to be surpassed, particularly now that the Melbourne Cup has gone international.

        Bart Cummings joins the true racing legends embedded in Australian history. He is even up there with the name of Phar Lap. For all we know, Bart Cummings may well be encased in a glass case too alongside Phar Lap. It certainly would be worthy of the two great champions of the turf.

         Those who watched the cup could not help but notice how emotional Bart was after his win. It was not hard to understand why. He bred, trained and won the Melbourne Cup with the horse. But I venture to say that it was also due to the knowledge that only he would have and the fact that, after a roller&amp;hyphen;coaster ride, Bart was back.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During those very hard years it was the talent and determination of Bart Cummings that got him through. I take the liberty to say that because Bart Cummings was my old boss. So I got a very special kick out of seeing Bart Cummings train the Melbourne Cup winner today. I spent many a good time and many good years around the Flemington racecourse. Bart Cummings is a genius with a horse. I saw that too many times to think it was just luck or even a well&amp;hyphen;learnt craft. It was something better than that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I learnt a great deal in my time with the Cummings' stable, and not just about horses. The racing game is made up of all levels of life and society from the toffs through to the battlers. So many of the experiences that I had then have held me in good stead in politics. I suggest to those in the chamber that many more politicians should take their sabbaticals in the stables because they will find that racing is much like politics. It has the intrigue of politics, the risks, the highs and lows, the need for confidentiality like politics, the determination needed in politics, a mateship and a care like politics calls upon us, and it also exposes you to just how tough life can be for so many.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Most of all, if you took your winter break in the stables instead of flying off to Europe, you would learn that to rise before 5 a.m. is in fact to rise at the best time of the day. I am sure Bart Cummings does not remember my last day before I left his services when he said to me that any time I wanted my job back just give him a call. Given the fortunes and vagaries of politics, I may yet take him up on that. Congratulations Bart Cummings.

       Estimates of revenue are only prepared for the forward estimates period, which ends in 1999-2000. It is thus not possible to provide estimates of expected real growth in petroleum resource rent tax collections for the next 5 and 10 years.

       Revenue from the petroleum resource rent tax is projected to decline by about 4 per cent in real terms over the 2 year period to 1997-98 and by around 38 per cent over the 4 year period to 1999-2000.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The projected declines in collections are largely attributable to projected falls in oil and gas production in Bass Strait. However, forecasts of individual revenue items, such as this, some years into the future are subject to considerable uncertainty. In particular, changes in the $US oil price and the $A/$US exchange rate can have a major impact on profits of oil producers, affecting collections from this source, along with changes in volumes of production.
