         —My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. In your speech to a higher education conference on 23 September entitled `The quest for truth', you said that when parties to a debate compete for the exposure of their point of view `this political scenario often means the truth, the facts and the figures are lost' and `the headline, the grab and the spin take over from rational and informed debate'. You later added, `The distortion of information carried to the voters distorts and damages the democratic process.' On the same day you attended a Senate estimates committee and raised the Wright family as an issue by answering a Dorothy Dixer from Senator Ferris. Have you not contradicted your own words? In failing to accept Mr Hollway's advice to immediately correct the record, have you not carried distorted information to the voters and damaged the democratic process? Aren't you guilty of the most blatant double standards?

What message does the overwhelming endorsement of the Liberal member Jackie Kelly in the Lindsay by-election say about the Howard government's policies? What does Jackie Kelly's re-election reveal about the attitude of Lindsay voters towards the opposition's obstruction of the 1996-97 budget?  Is this a further justification of the confidence in the coalition government that the voters of Lindsay gave on 2 March and reaffirmed seven months later on 19 October?

There is within the results some very serious messages, I believe, for the Labor Party and minority parties in this place.

There is no doubt about that at all.

        Labor tried to scare in that campaign. Labor tried to scare on the basis of the last budget—a budget which you will remember was written up as a fair go budget. But, again, rather than listen, Labor went back and said, `This is the by-election in which you the voters can send a message to the coalition government to hold back.' The interesting thing is that the voters said, `No, we want change. We are tired of Labor. We had it for 13 years. We had record unemployment, record high interest rates, record debt. We voted for change and we expect that change to be endorsed and supported.' That is the key message that came out of the Lindsay by-election and it is a message that ought to be listened to in this place.

         —Senator Bolkus, your job is to ask the question; my job is to answer it, okay?— how many times they were told that they were not on track and they were not going to get there. In September 1994 Mr Ted Evans, the secretary to the Treasury, is reported to have said that `it will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve the government's target of five per cent unemployment by the turn of the century'. He went as far as describing that as `very ambitious', which are strong words indeed for the secretary to the Treasury.

        In the same month—this is in 1994, so there was plenty of time for this message to sink in—Dr Vince FitzGerald, who headed the Keating government's national inquiry into savings, expressed concern that our national savings rate would not be sufficient to bring unemployment down to an acceptable level—five per cent or below—within the remainder of the present decade. You would have thought over 12 months or so that message would have sunk in. Dr John Quiggin, the professor of economics at James Cook University, described by one newspaper as `a strident supporter of Working Nation', said in June 1995 that the government had failed to allow for discouraged workers in its forecasts and therefore unemployment would

        It is quite obvious that, if key advisers and commentators were speaking in these terms and were in fact saying that you could not get there, how could the government itself have been blind to these realities?

         —I thank the senator for this important question which is of interest to virtually all Australians. There is no doubt that the big reductions in home mortgage rates by half a percentage point or more announced on Friday is very good news for most Australian families. The cuts announced by Westpac, St George, FAI and Aussie Home Loans means that all these substantial lenders now offer home loan rates below eight per cent. This is the first time in two decades that variable home loan rates have been this low. Not since the mid&amp;hyphen;1970s have families been able to enjoy such low interest rates in paying off their most valuable asset—their homes.

        The latest cut, for example, by Aussie Home Loans provides a benefit of roughly $45 a month or over $500 a year for a family with a $100,000 25&amp;hyphen;year mortgage. Westpac, as many senators will know, also substantially cut its first option variable rate on Friday and announced that this provides a benefit of around $10,000 to customers over the life of their loan.

         and the rates now offered by Aussie Home Loans and others are even lower. I say to Senator Cook, who is trying to interject, that the interest rates, as I said, are great news for Australian families. The Treasurer Peter Costello said on Friday, `This is a low inflation economy with interest rates falling and this will be a great relief for those Australians who are looking for loans and paying off mortgages.'

        Last week figures were released that showed that underlying inflation for the year to September was 2.4 per cent—well within our target of two to three per cent on average over the economic cycle.

        Let there be no mistake: these cuts are possible because of the decisive action this government took in the budget to rein in the deficit. By reining in the deficit, we have taken the pressure off interest rates. We have already seen one cut in official interest rates and significant cuts in mortgage and business rates. This is in stark contrast to what happened under the Labor government. Over the last 2&amp;half; years under Labor—

        This question really does not deserve an answer but, since it has been asked, let me answer it. Senator Faulkner suggests that I have alienated my department. I do not think that is true at all. I have worked very closely with the department. The department have apologised for creating the impression that the Wright family was an actual family. They deeply regret that, and we have done everything we can—that is, I have and they have—to set the record straight.

The Uruguay Round of GATT and formation of the World Trade Organisation was largely promoted in Australia as providing immense benefits to the economy.

Australia was supposed to come out $5.5 billion per annum to the good, and our agricultural sector was to be the main beneficiary and generator of wealth. Yet, on

        Certainly, there are temporary difficulties in relation to beef exports. There is no secret about that, but the future, on the basis of what has been gained to date, remains promising. An important point to remember is that, apart from the changes that we are implementing in terms of enabling Australian business to be more internationally competitive and taking pressure off its outgoings, investment itself remains a key to enhancing our competitiveness. In that regard foreign investment into the beef industry has played a fundamental role over the last decade in modernising the industry and developing better linkages with our customers overseas.

The point I was making was that only Senator Collins and his mate in the other place Daryl Melham are still trying to pretend the process was a waste of time.

He thinks somehow it is going to bring him and his party some electoral reward. It just is not so.

        The shadow Treasurer's press release is fascinating, because it does not accurately reflect government policy—although that is what it claims to do. It does not acknowledge the government's clear commitment that existing public housing tenants will not be disadvantaged by the housing reforms. The shadow Treasurer claimed in his press release that the government's policy defies logic. It is fascinating, because it is the shadow Treasurer who defies logic. Doesn't he realise that the former government of which he was presumably a senior cabinet minister—although we know he was often out of the country, perhaps he missed this—was going to implement exactly the same policy? I suggest that he and his colleagues should go back and have a look at their housing policy. It was one of the few directions that the previous government was taking which received bipartisan support because the reforms were long overdue.

        As to Dr Bruce Chapman's view that the proposed changes to HECS will skew the university population towards those who are the most wealthy in the community, it is not a view that I share. I do not say that that is a fact simply because it is Dr Chapman's view. It is worth noting, Senator Stott Despoja, that in the time when university education was free to students—that means that other people pay—the most disadvantaged people in the community got the least access.

        It is also my view that it is completely unfair to ask of a teacher, who has a low course cost and, relatively speaking, a lower income, the same contribution per annum that you ask of a doctor, who has a high course cost and a higher income afterwards. I think that is completely unfair.

        In the policy we have put forward we have shifted the HECS arrangement from being a flat charge where everyone pays the same to more properly reflect both the cost of the
        <break page="4557" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         course—that is, the benefit given by other taxpayers to that student in cash terms—and the private benefit that students receive from higher education, which is largely reflected by the income that they get. That is why we propose to keep nursing, for example, which is an expensive course, in the lower band. As you would well know, nurses do not achieve higher incomes for the rest of their lives.

        To shift to a three-tiered HECS that purely reflected the cost of the course would, I believe, be inequitable. But one that has a blend of that—that acknowledges some have lower incomes and some have higher incomes—is a good thing. In summary, what we have done here is acknowledge that what Labor did when it introduced HECS was correct. We think it is correct that there is a public benefit in a well developed, higher education student and it is without question that there is a private benefit to the students who participate. The HECS contribution is an acknowledgment of that.

        We are maintaining the excellent aspect of HECS—that you do not pay as you learn; you pay as you earn. We think that is a fairer system. Neville Wran, the former Labor Premier of New South Wales, suggested not charging everyone equally because everyone does not get an equal cost course and everyone does not get an equal private benefit. We are following his suggestion that it would be more equitable to shift to a three-tiered HECS. We think that is a much fairer way to go.

        I think what we have in relation to Senator Vanstone is growing evidence of a pattern of behaviour from a minister which is totally unacceptable. We have a pattern of behaviour with a minister playing fast and loose with the truth. We have a pattern of deceit from Senator Vanstone. I think we have from this minister no understanding and no comprehension at all of the sorts of responsibilities that a minister has to tell the truth, both to the parliament and to the Australian people.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We now have clear evidence that Senator Vanstone has again misled this parliament. First, it was the `Wright family' exposed by the Labor Party in this place. Now we have exposed another very clear breach of Minister Vanstone's ministerial responsibilities. On 19 August in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        </emphasis>
        Senator Vanstone stated that at the time of the March election her department had advised Mr Crean, the then employment minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been, at best, 6.8 per cent. The department has confirmed that after this statement was published in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        , the minister was informed by DEETYA that Mr Crean was advised about:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a range of conditions that would need to be met to achieve the former government's 5 per cent unemployment rate target by the turn of the century.
       </para>
       <para>
        The department says it did not put any view on the most likely outcome or suggest any particular level below which the unemployment rate was likely to fall.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When asked, this minister has categorically refused to make that departmental advice available to the Senate. Of course, when it was the case of the Wrights, Minister Vanstone was forced to make departmental advice available. I suggest, Minister, on this occasion, you will be forced to front up with the advice again. On 25 August, Minister Vanstone repeated her untruth on Channel 10's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Meet the Press

        . She said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Labor knew before the election that its target of five per cent by the year 2000 was unachievable; it had been told that. I know that's absolutely true.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Then on 10 September in the Senate, Senator Vanstone repeated that untruth for a third time. In answer to a question from Senator Bolkus, she said:

       <break page="4560" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That is my understanding—that the Labor Party knew well that the target it was promoting as being achievable was not achievable . . . If you want to allege I am wrong, I am happy for you to do so, and I am happy to check the matter out.

        <para>
         When asked the supplementary question by Senator Bolkus:

         statement?

         report in front of me. Certainly the statement which caused us to advise the Minister's office was the suggestion that the department had advised Mr Crean, when employment Minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been at best 6.8%. We have no such advice.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Grant added that there was no way such a conclusion could be drawn from the advice given to Mr Crean.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a pattern from Senator Vanstone of deliberately misleading the Senate and the Australian people. There is no other conclusion any reasonable person could draw but that it is a deliberate pattern of deceit on her part—on a minister's part.

        Last sitting week when we were talking about the Wright family, I did not have time to go through in detail the letter that Mr Hollway sent to Senator Tierney, the chairman of the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am writing to you direct on the matter of the `Wright family' because the fault clearly lies with the department. It was an incorrect characterisation of the case by the Department to the Minister which led Senator Vanstone in turn to describe the Wright family as a specific example in the hearings on the Committee on 23 September 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        I myself wrongly believe the Wrights to be an actual case and, like the Minister, only became aware of this and not so until after the Committee hearings. Nonetheless, as Departmental Head, I accept responsibility for the mistake.

       <para>
        Senator Vanstone has said that she was under the same misapprehension because the information came across as an actual family from the department. The departmental head also said that he was under a misapprehension. Senator Vanstone went about finding out about it as soon as she was alerted to it. She then came into the parliament and corrected it, unlike Senator Schacht—there is a stark contrast between the minister's behaviour and Senator Schacht's behaviour—in 1994 when he was inadvertently advised by his department and gave an incorrect answer in the estimates committee. He did not set in train a process to advise either the committee or the department of the error. Parliament only found out when Senator McMullan was asked a question and Senator Schacht had to come in during the debate on taking note of answers and admit that he had made a mistake.

They had been told over and over again that that five per cent was not achievable. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said himself that it was unwise to set targets.

        When we went through the exercise in the estimates committee and were given the inadvertent misinformation and a press release was produced by a member who sits opposite, Senator Ferris, based upon that answer, that press release gained a great deal of publicity.

        that that was erroneous and that advice was received by the minister on 26 September in a minute from the secretary to her department. I do not think that it is ordinary for the secretary to a minister's department to formally apologise for misleading, thereby giving the minister no cause for suspecting that the matter was not serious, and then making a recommendation in the minute that the minister issue a media release. With that minute was enclosed a draft media release. That was on 26 September.

        The secretary to the department was under no misapprehension that it was the minister's duty to correct the misapprehension—this matter of public notoriety—that was in the public arena and to do it quickly.

The secretary to the department recommended to the minister that a media release be issued and I suggest the implication is `then and there'. In relation to the duty of the minister that the Prime Minister's statement requires, it is clear that the minister's duty was to issue the media release and correct the misconception, which the minister says was caused inadvertently, at the earliest opportunity, not two weeks later. That is what the minister did.

        We have an unintentional misconception, a breach of the Prime Minister's code and a case where the department has given the lead to the secretary to the department and the minister has chosen not to take it.

The media may not always get it right, but when it is not their fault, the party at fault—in this case, it is the minister—should accept responsibility for correcting the misconception.

You talk about propriety. You have only got to go through a whole string of Labor ministers of the time if you want to have a debate about propriety.

        The pattern of deceit and the pattern of fast and loose handling of the truth, of course, stems right back to the very beginning of this government. This minister, in a press release on 18 August, indicated this about her department:

        The minister quite clearly reinforced that view in an interview on Channel 10 on 25 August and in this chamber on 10 September. Of course, the department indicated its position very quickly, after the publication of these views, in an answer to a question that was posed by the opposition. Mr Hollway indicated to us that the department had written to the office of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to draw the attention of the office to the incorrect reporting in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        That is quite clearly what the evidence was before the Senate estimates committee as well. The officials there quite clearly indicated that that was not the advice that they had given despite what the minister had said on three separate occasions. Dr Volker from DEETYA indicated this:

         Unfortunately, this political scenario often means that the truth, the facts and the figures are lost. The headline, the grab and the spin take over from rational and informed debate. As a politician I can live with this. However, as a custodian of the nation's higher education system I am perplexed and concerned that important information about such a vital sector is distorted and ignored.

         That is precisely what she has done with the Wright family. She indicated quite clearly that she has in fact misled this chamber. Some pretty important issues arise from this. It strikes me, from one of the biggest and most important government departments in this country, that such poorly constructed and consequently useless information could in fact be produced. How could that information find its way to the minister and into the Senate? The other important issue is: why did the minister take so long to correct her answer, quite clearly in breach of the ministerial

         I repeat: Senator Vanstone's quest for the truth may never ever be achieved. She will probably never be able to meet the criteria and the standards set down in terms of reasonable ministerial behaviour. As a consequence, she ought perhaps now consider her position and resign.

         —The two issues being considered here this afternoon are the five per cent target and the issue of the Wright family. Let us just go back to the five per cent target. This, of course, was a myth that the Labor Party put around for some time—that we were going to achieve a five per cent unemployment rate target by the year 2000. They kept saying it before the election. There was a lot of commentary in the press at the time about the achievability of that target. Ted Evans, Secretary to the Treasury, said that five per cent is `extraordinarily difficult' and `very ambitious'. Vince FitzGerald said `savings insufficient to reach five per cent'. The

        The only one we could find in the quotes that actually supported the government's position was John Quiggin, saying that it was achievable. He is from James Cook University and a big supporter of Working Nation. In the Telstra debate, his evidence was found to be totally not credible. A witness we had before a Senate committee whose evidence was not credible is the only person we could find being positive in relation to that.

        What has been said in the press about this matter has been completely misleading, mainly because a journalist has misinterpreted what the minister said. The minister's press release states:

        I do not know what the fuss is about, Senator Carr. It is quite obvious to everyone that this was an unachievable target before the last election. All the people at the time said that. The previous government stands condemned for trying to fool the Australian people into thinking that this was not a big issue or a big deal. You tried to fool people before the election that unemployment in this country was not a big deal. You claim it was running between eight and nine per cent when we all know, based on the inquiry you and I were on, that the real figure is at least double that. Further to that, you tried to con the people of Australia into believing that the figure was going to drop to five per cent. What humbug! What hypocrisy!

Why don't you have a target for that?' Let's have a look at your target. Five per cent by 2000—never achievable. You knew it was not achievable. Every commentator knew it was not achievable. Finally, the public condemned you for it and threw you out, which is what they should have done.

       We consider that such an action would cause serious suffering, including a severe disadvantage to women, rural communities and medical research. We believe that it is the essential right of all Australian registered doctors to have access to provider numbers that allow them to provide services to the community which attract Medicare rebates for patients. We believe that such restrictions are an attack on the most defenceless and vulnerable strata of the medical profession. We consider it to be a denial of natural justice and an attack on Medicare.

        —by leave—I simply wish to note my support for the remonstrance that has just been presented to the Senate. I know, Madam President, that it has your support as well and the support of Senator Grant Tambling and, indeed, Senator Lundy, as we are all senators of territories that are potentially affected by the private member's bill that the remonstrance is remonstrating about.

       Madam President, the action of the Northern Territory parliament, as I know you are aware, is not taken lightly. This is a rare event in parliamentary terms. In parliaments under the Westminster system around the world, it is something which is resorted to only very rarely, indeed.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The history of such remonstrances began in 1641 with events that are rather famous in terms of the history of our Westminster system. On that occasion in the year 1641 Charles Stuart, who subsequently became Charles I of England, caused the House of
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        Commons to be invaded for the purpose of arresting five of its members whose actions he was unhappy with. On that occasion, the Speaker of the House of Commons delivered a remonstrance in such hard terms to the monarch that a monarch has not dared by tradition to set foot in the House of Commons ever since, except by invitation of that house.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The action is not unprecedented in respect of the Northern Territory in that the Northern Territory presented a remonstrance to the federal government in 1962, protesting then about the fact that it was not a self-governing territory and that it should have been. The reason I note that, as the Chief Minister of Northern Territory noted in the territory parliament, of which I was privileged to be a member for 10 years, is the action was in fact a landmark action that assisted in the political campaign that was being waged at the time and culminated successfully in 1978 in the granting of self-government to the Northern Territory—a self-government which I believe has been exercised responsibly in the 18 years that we have had self-government.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As you know, Madam President, I do not say that lightly because it has been the Country Liberal Party that has been in operation for the whole of those 18 years. I have a view that I have certainly expressed in the Northern Territory before, and can I say it is not a view that has been entirely welcomed by every member of my own party: that is, having spent the first 10 years of my life in the Northern Territory under the so-called delights of centralised government and actually working under a Canberra administration—having experienced that for 10 years and having experienced self-government for 10 years—I would much prefer the Northern Territory to be governed by the worst of all possible administrations in the Northern Territory, which is precisely what we have, than the best of all possible administrations in Canberra. That is strongly my view.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I disagree very strongly with this euthanasia law. I think it is bad law. I believe the process that brought it to bear is even worse, but it is a law of the Northern Territory parliament. I did want to make that point. It resulted from, again, a most unusual practice in
       <break page="4573" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        our Westminster system—that is, a conscience vote, something which is rarely exercised in Westminster parliaments under the two&amp;hyphen;party system around the world. It is a rare event in any parliament, but on this occasion it was a conscience vote of the parliament and, again, a conscience vote in respect of the repeal bills put before the Northern Territory parliament.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I did everything that I possibly could to bring about the repeal of that act of parliament. I, along with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, interestingly enough, believe that it will be repealed at some time. I, along with Shane Stone, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who is on the public record with a statement with which I agree, believe that when people find out just how obnoxious this law is in practice the bill will be repealed. But it needs to be repealed by a Northern Territory parliament, not by an act of this parliament.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is of some interest to note—and indeed the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory noted it in the debate on this remonstrance, which has been presented to this Senate—that the previous Prime Minister of Australia did in fact receive a petition, an inquiry, from a constituent with regard to exercising the federal government's undisputed powers in respect of territories with regard to this particular legislation because the particular constituent did not like the legislation. The former Prime Minister of this country replied to that constituent in the terms that it was in fact a law of the Northern Territory, that it was in the province of the territory parliament as to whether the act remained or was repealed. Therefore, he declined to give this dreadful attack on the constitution of the Northern Territory the support that the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I regret to say, has given it, along with the extension of the bill to the ACT.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The original bill only applied to the Northern Territory. In an attempt, albeit well meant, to accommodate the concerns of people like me, Mr Andrews redrafted the bill and extended it to the ACT. In my view, that simply made the problem of the bill even more glaring than it was before and made it more difficult.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        I simply want to conclude on that point by saying that, as far as I am concerned, this is not a question of states rights at all. I have said publicly on a number of occasions, and I will say it in here again: if the Andrews bill were presented to the federal parliament and precluded from all the parliaments of Australia voluntary active euthanasia, that particular class of law—that is, the parliament of Australia giving a medical practitioner the legal right to kill a patient, and that is what this is; this is not right to die legislation, we have had that in the territory for many years; this particular act of the Northern Territory is in fact a right for doctors to kill—I would vote in favour of it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So my position on this, as I am sure many senators in here would understand, is not one of states rights. If the law applied equally to the states, I would have no difficulty in seeing the vote on this matter—and it is an important vote—being a genuine vote on the question of euthanasia, but it will not be. For all those people from New South Wales, Queensland and, indeed, from all the states who are voting in this debate, it will be a vote that they can take on this issue without the slightest impact in terms of their own constituencies. Therefore, it will not and cannot by definition be a true reflection of the position of this parliament on the question of euthanasia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is this legislation applies only to the territories of Australia discriminates only against the territories of Australia. In the case of the Northern Territory, it discriminates against a parliament which has been operating without let or hindrance for 18 years. That is what I profoundly object to, as much as I object to this particular law of the Northern Territory parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was a conscience vote that brought that law about. It was not in fact a piece of legislation from the Northern Territory executive which was pushed through on the numbers. As much as I dislike it, I cannot avoid looking the facts in the face and I have to concede that, rightly or wrongly, this was the true will of the Northern Territory parliament. Members of the government, and indeed members of the executive of that government, voted both for and against the legislation. Members
        <break page="4574" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of my own party, the Labor Party, also voted for and against the legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore, as a territory senator, I believe that on my part it would be a matter of utter betrayal of the parliamentary institutions of the territory in respect of this particular matter if I voted to support a bill which amends the constitution of the Northern Territory in such a way as to preclude an entire set of laws from being passed in that parliament. Therefore, I fully support the terms of the remonstrance that has been tabled in the Senate this afternoon.

        —by leave—Madam President, the remonstrance which you have just presented to the parliament is a very important and historical document. It is a document that was signed by all 25 members of all political persuasions in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly; that is, the fully elected parliament of the Northern Territory. As such, it has a very important place in the considerations that must come before the House of Representatives later today, when the euthanasia debate proceeds, and here, if on any subsequent occasion the same issue is pursued in this particular place.

       I was pleased to be present yesterday at the procession by representatives of all three parliaments of the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island at the front of this Parliament House when the Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the Hon. Terry McCarthy, made a particular declaration on this important issue. We then subsequently proceeded to present copies of the remonstrance as passed by the Northern Territory parliament to both you, Madam President, in your private rooms, and also to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Halverson, in his rooms.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
        It was very pleasing indeed that the representation in the procession and the presentations yesterday was in fact bipartisan, that members of the Labor Party from the Australian Capital Territory and also from the Norfolk Island parliament and members of the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Terri tory were able to be part of and present for that presentation. It is unfortunate that the leader of the Labor opposition in the Northern Territory, Mrs Maggie Hickey, and Senator Bob Collins were unable to be present yesterday at that very important and historic occasion, but I am pleased that Senator Collins has made clear to the Senate today his unequivocal support for the content and the intent of the remonstrance.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I was also very pleased that the remonstrance proceeded, because I claim some credit in that I proposed the issue of a remonstrance to the Chief Minister a month or so ago as an appropriate mechanism to make an expression in this particular way. I drew on my own experience in that area because I was part of the presentation to this parliament in 1975 of a similar remonstrance on the issue of constitutional development of the Northern Territory. At that time, I was a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly myself, and we felt very strongly about the progress of constitutional development leading to self&amp;hyphen;government, which then subsequently came about in 1978 in the Legislative Assembly.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As Senator Collins has already mentioned, it is important that previously, in 1962, the Northern Territory, under the aegis of, again, a cross&amp;hyphen;party line—with the leadership of people like Tiger Brennan, a very famous political character of the Northern Territory; Dick Ward, a strong Labor member of the Northern Territory parliament; and others from my side of politics—made a similar remonstrance. The fact that the remonstrance has been presented is a very telling moment in the life of any parliament because it forces us to dwell on and to look very carefully at both the processes of the Westminster system and the issues of the relationships and respect between parliaments and, in effect, places all citizens of Australia on an equal footing.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That is the most important part and that is what I think both Senator Collins and I find most objectionable about the legislation proposed by Mr Kevin Andrews. It strips from territorians, whether they live in the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory or Norfolk Island, the rights that
       <break page="4575" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        every other Australian enjoys and should expect in the participation that they have in the parliamentary process. Therefore, I think it is most incumbent on us to take very carefully the sage advice that has been offered in this particular way.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Unlike Senator Collins, I hold a very different personal view on the issue of euthanasia. It took me a long time to wrestle with my soul in the debate as it was processed and progressed through the Northern Territory parliament over a couple of years, led by the then Chief Minister, Mr Marshall Perron. As I said, I wrestled with my soul, along with the community. I note that, in most of the urban centres of my electorate, there is widespread support for this particular legislation. I accept that, in many of the Aboriginal communities and many of the other areas, particularly those linked to both medical ethics and to a theological point of view, there is strong opposition to the social intent of this legislation, just as Senator Collins has outlined for his particular position.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The fact that this legislation should be pushed in this parliament under the guise of an attack on territories' rights is indeed most unfortunate. I believe that euthanasia legislation is due and proper for consideration at this particular time right throughout Australia, but that that debate ought to be progressed and processed through the state and territory parliaments where it is right and proper for the regional differences to be properly exposed—as they have been in this debate—on a conscience vote issue.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I think it is premature for the national parliament to be paternalistic or in effect overriding the wishes of people of Australia without having heard the views and opinions of all state and territory parliaments before we process this issue. Therefore, I think it is incumbent on me to point out that the remonstrance, as presented today, is a very proper and telling message between parliaments and on behalf of Australian citizens who live in all territories throughout Australia.

It is a right of an individual who is dying, without hope of a remedy or remission, to be able to say, `I do not want to suffer unnecessarily or to suffer unnecessary dignity, nor to visit that suffering on my loved ones. I have a right, after a healthy and productive human life on this planet, to be able to make that determination.'

       It is a very important matter of individual rights, but it is not yet, as far as I understand it—and I have not read up well on this—a matter of universal covenant. I believe the time will come when it will be a matter of a global covenant, and then maybe this parliament will have the anchor upon which to consider the matter with more force. Indeed, this parliament quite rightly, for example, considered the matter of the Franklin River and its universal obligation to prevent the dam, which would have destroyed a World Heritage property if the state government had proceeded with that unnecessary and destructive dam in the last decade.

       So the remonstrance is something I believe we ought to all take careful note of, and I hope it will be circulated so that we can study it individually. It is, of course, a means of drawing attention to the feeling of angst that there is in the Northern Territory that this parliament, through a bill which is an artifice, might override the pioneering legislation for euthanasia, which has such popular backing in the Northern Territory. The so-called Andrews bill, which may come from the House of Representatives to the Senate later this year, is an artifice. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is purporting to be protecting states rights, but the real intent is to take away the hard&amp;hyphen;won individual rights of individuals in the Northern Territory to have

       I am a very strong supporter of the legislation in the Northern Territory. I see the artifice that is being brought into this parliament to try to override that legislation. I support both the feeling in this remonstrance and the initiating question, which is the rights of individuals to a good death when their life is ebbing, they have no hope of remission and they wish to make that determination. I dare say that it is a matter we are going to hear a lot more about in this place.

       In conclusion, I go back to a point that Senator Tambling made. I do not think it is going to be a case of this law being overturned in the Northern Territory. I think it is going to be quite the reverse—a case of this law being a light of inspiration and hope spreading out to the other territories and states of this nation, and from here to other nations around the world, to give a very important right to human beings in search of dignity.

The committee has now received replies which have met its concerns sufficiently to allow removal of the notices.

The explanatory statement advises that the Regulations partly implement a number of resolutions of the special meeting on 10 May 1996 of the Australian Police Ministers' Council, following the Port Arthur killings.

        New Part 3 of Schedule 6 provides for safety requirements for firearms.

The Committee asks whether this should be not less than 45 centimetres. As the provision stands at present the test could be satisfied by dropping a firearm from a height of, for instance, one centimetre. Of course, if the provision was for a height of not less than 45 centimetres, the firearm could be dropped from any height greater than that, which also would not appear to be the intended effect. The Committee asks why the provision does not simply provide for drops of 45 centimetres. If such precision is not required or is not attainable, could there be provision for a drop of 40 to 50 centimetres?

        I refer to your letter of 6 August 1996 requesting my advice in relation to matters contained in amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations effected by Statutory Rules 1996 No. 91. The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (the Regulations) control the importation of the goods specified in the various regulations or the Schedules to the Regulations, by prohibiting importation absolutely, or making importation subject to the permission of a Minister or a specified person.

        Following the Port Arthur tragedy, a special meeting of the Australasian Police Minister's Council (APMC) adopted a number of resolutions aimed at more effective national firearm controls. The implementation of these resolutions required the Commonwealth Government to impose a total prohibition on the importation into Australia of all self-loading rifles and self-loading and pump action longarms. The importation of fully automatic weapons was already prohibited under the Regulations. While the importation of semi-automatic weapons was at that time subject to some controls under the Regulations, controls on their importation were tightened in
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        accordance with the APMC resolutions. These amendments took effect on 14 May 1996 in Statutory Rules 1996 No. 59.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Soon after these amendments, a new and simplified structure within the Regulations for the control of the importation of all firearms into Australia was introduced by Statutory Rules 1996 No. 91. The previous structure was introduced in 1990 but, as a result of several amendments being effected to the Regulations since 1990, the controls were spread across 6 regulations and 3 Schedules of the Regulations. This resulted in great difficulties in identifying the import control that applied to each type of firearm, and led to inconsistent interpretation and administration of the controls. The new structure introduced by Statutory Rules 1996 No. 91 has consolidated the import controls under one regulation (regulation 4F) and a single Schedule (Schedule 6) of the Regulations. The amendments also introduced tighter controls on the importation of firearm accessories, parts, magazines and ammunition.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Regulation 4F provides that the importation of a firearm a firearm accessory, a firearm part, a firearm magazine or ammunition is prohibited unless the article is an article to which an item in Part 2 of Schedule 6 applies and the importation is in accordance with the requirements set out in that Part. In particular, placing both the firearms and the requirements for their importation in the same Schedule is the core of the simplified 8—structure
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         as it enables the immediate identification of the firearm, etc and the requirements with which the importation of the firearm, etc must comply.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These requirements fall into 4 broad categories or "tests": (1) the official purposes test, (2) the specified purposes test; (3) the specified persons test; and (4) the Police authorisation test (items 1 to 4 of Paright 1 of Schedule 6 refer). The requirements of three of the four tests (numbers (1), (2) and (4)) are a substantial carry-over of previous requirements for the importation of firearms. The fourth test, the specified persons test, contains a new set of requirements which arise from the APMC Resolution of 10 May 1996. This new test recognises the need of certain persons to possess semi-automatic firearms for the purposes of their occupation. Under the official purposes test, the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the Attorney-General (AG) is satisfied that the article is for the purposes of the government of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory and that the relevant government will retain ownership of the firearm. This test is a carry-over of the previous "official purposes test" for the importation of firearms.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The specified purposes test also provides that the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the permission of the AG has been given. Under this test permission may only be given where the AG is satisfied that the firearm is not available in Australia and is to be used in either the production of a film or in the development of mountings for a laser target designator. Also, the importer must hold a licence or authorisation to possess the article in the State or Territory in which it is to be used. The specified purposes test is a direct carry over of two tests for the importation of firearms under the previous Regulations (previous regulations 4D, 4DA and 4DB).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the specified persons test, the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the permission of the AG has been given. Under this test, permission may only be given where the AG is satisfied that the importer is a person who carries out the specified occupation and who holds a license or authorisation to possess the article in the State or Territory in which it is to be used. While this is a new import control test it is in the same form as import control tests, such as the film test, which were in the previous Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Police authorisation test, the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the importer of the article has been given a statement, in an approved form from the relevant Commissioner, Chief Commissioner or Chief Police Officer of the police force of the State or Territory, that the importer holds a licence or authorisation to possess the article in accordance with the law of
        <break page="4582" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the relevant State or Territory. Similar to the specified purposes test, this test is a direct carry-over of an import control under the previous Regulations.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The type of test with which the importation of the article must comply depends on the article itself. For example, most of the articles which are included in Schedule 6 to the Regulations, including, firearms, can be imported if they comply with any of the four abovementioned tests. While any of the four tests can be complied with, in practical terms the importation of an article to which the tests apply is allowed where the least stringent Police authorisation test is complied with.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, certain firearms can only be imported under more limited circumstances. For example, all self-loading, semi-automatic firearms above a certain magazine capacity, as well as their parts and accessories, can only be imported if they comply with one of the first three tests. Not only must the possession of these firearms be permitted in a relevant State or Territory, but their importation will only be permitted if it is for one of the specified purposes set out in the first three tests. All other firearms and their parts and accessories which are not expressly identified in Schedule 6 (which includes all fully automatic firearms), can only be imported in accordance with the first two of the four tests.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In your letter, you seek my advice as to whether the discretions which are exercisable by the AG or the relevant Commissioner, Chief Commissioner or Chief Police Officer of the police force of a State or Territory under the above tests are subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Firstly, in relation to the discretions exercised under the fourth test by the Commissioner, Chief Commissioner or Chief Police Officer of the police force of a State or Territory, these directions are exercised under the relevant law of a State or Territory. The licensing or authorising of the possession of a firearm, etc is dealt with in State and Territory legislation and therefore, cannot be the subject of merits review by the Commonwealth's AAT. However, it is appropriate to note that one of the purposes of the APMC itself is to promote a uniform, national approach to gun control amongst the States and Territories. Consistent and coherent administration of firearm licensing laws amongst the various administrations therefore is given an opportunity for regular discussion and review.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In relation to the discretions exercised by the AG under the first three tests, the decision by the AG to refuse to grant a permission to import an article under any of the tests is not subject to merits review by the AAT. This is because the matters of which the AG must be satisfied before he or she can grant a permission are based on the high
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         government policy considerations of public safety. As referred to above, the types of articles to which only these tests apply include all fully automatic firearms and semi&amp;hyphen;automatic firearms above a certain capacity as well as their parts and accessories. Therefore, the AG must first be satisfied of the limited use to which the articles will be put. The fact that the permission can only be granted in respect a such limited uses will ensure that articles such as firearms will not enter into general circulation. Also the fact that the AG must be satisfied of the limited use to which the articles will be put is necessary because, without the AG's permission, such articles would otherwise be prohibited imports.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In respect of the second and third tests, the AG must also be satisfied that the importer holds the relevant State or Territory licence or authorisation to possess the article in the relevant State or Territory in which article is to be used. In the interests of public safety, the AG cannot grant a permission to import an article to which the tests apply that an importer is not licensed or authorised to possess.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Therefore, if the AG is not satisfied of these matters, permission to import the article would not be granted and the refusal would be based on the high government policy grounds of public safety. It is not considered desirable to have merits review by the AAT of refusals of permissions when based on high government policy grounds such as this one. This position is also taken in respect of the control on the importation of goods under regulation 4 of the Regulations (Importation of certain dangerous goods in Schedule 2) and regulation 4R (importation of radioactive substances). The high government policy ground of giving effect to international treaty obligations is also another example for excepting refusals to grant import permission from merits review under regulations 4QA (importation of goods of Iraqi origin presently under United Nations sanctions).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the three tests, the decision maker who might refuse to grant an import permission is restricted to the AG. This restriction is seen as the necessary corollary to the exemption from merits review of decisions made on grounds of high government policy. In short, the final decision can only be taken by the Government's relevant policy Minister.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The exception of decisions to refuse import permissions from merits review under the above circumstances has previously been acknowledged by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, as has the corresponding control in such circumstances that restrict the refusal of permission power to the Government's relevant policy Minister. I am advised that in respect of the first and second tests, the Committee has acknow
        <break page="4583" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">

        I also note your comment in relation to one of the requirements for safety testing of firearms contained in item 1.6 of Part 3 of Schedule 6. Under this requirement, a firearm that is dropped 3 times from a height of not more than 45 centimetres on to a rubber mat must not discharge. While I concede the point made by the Committee that the present wording of this requirement would allow a firearm to be dropped from any height less than 45 centimetres, I am advised that, in practice, a firearm is dropped from a height of 45 centimetres. However, the Committee has identified an inadvertent loophole in the present wording which is acknowledged. In order to ensure that a firearm is always dropped from a reasonable height, subitem 1.6 will be amended to provide that the firearm can only be dropped from a height between 35 and 45 centimetres. I thank the Committee for drawing this matter to my attention.

         28B provides that nothing in these provisions affects the duty of a migration agent who is also a legal practitioner and who acts in that capacity, from the usual financial responsibility of a legal practitioner to clients' funds. This last requirements would, among other things, require a legal practitioner to comply with trust account provisions, which would give substantial protection to clients' money. The Committee asks why an agent who is not a legal practitioner does not appear to need to keep proper trust accounts? What happens if an agent who is not a legal practitioner goes bankrupt? Is the clients' money at risk? The earlier Code of Conduct provided for trust accounts, although in a permissive rather than mandatory fashion.

        The Migration Agents Registration Scheme (the Scheme) requires the registration of persons providing immigration advice and assistance and includes a complaints investigation mechanism which may result in disciplinary action by the Migration Agents Registration Board (the Board). The Scheme establishes minimum requirements for qualification for registration as a migration agent and establishes the boundaries of ethical and professional conduct within the migration advice industry. By so doing, the Scheme provides a high level of consumer protection for people who receive immigration advice from incompetent or unscrupulous advisers. The amendments to the Migration Agents Regulations are designed to enhance the objective of consumer protection.

        Section 308(1)(c) of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) provides that the Board may, at any time, require an agent to provide the Board with specified documents or records relevant to an agent's registration. The Board has exercised this power in the past, particularly in relation to complaints made against registered agents. However, in many instances, the Board has experienced difficulty in establishing the veracity of issues arising from
        <break page="4584" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         complaints because a failure on the part of some agents to adequately document their dealings with their clients. New Clause 27 of the Migration Agents Code of Conduct (the Code) is designed to address this problem by requiring that agents maintain case files which fully document their dealings with clients.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As it stood, the wording of the former Clause 28 of the Migration Agents Code of Conduct did not impose on all agents a requirement to operate separate accounts for client monies and an agent's business operating expenses. Rather it provided examples of the type of accounts agents should operate, including trust accounts. This resulted in some agents maintaining a single bank account for client and agent monies. In its report on the review of the Migration Agents Registration Scheme, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration recommended at recommendation 32 that, "Clause 28 of the Code of Conduct for migration agents be amended to clarify a migration agent's obligation to maintain client and agent funds in separate accounts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        New Clause 28 of the Code of Conduct implements this recommendation. The Clause is also designed to ensure the separation of an agent's business operating funds and monies paid to the agent by clients to cover application and agent's fees which can only be accessed once the agent has completed the relevant service and billed the client.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Legal practitioners' obligations in relation to the operation of trust accounts are the subject of State legislation. New Clause 28B requires legal practitioners who are agents to continue to operate a trust account for the deposit of client monies. However, because non-lawyer agents were and continue to be beyond the reach of State trust fund legislation, the Code now requires that they operate a separate client account, albeit in a form similar to a trust account. The combined effect of new Clauses 28 and 28A, therefore, offers clients greater protection because the separation of client and agent's operating funds is now mandatory for all agents, as well as requiring agents to maintain detailed financial records which are open to scrutiny by the Board.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You have asked about the consequences of a non-lawyer agent being declared bankrupt. Section 303 of the Act provides that, where an agent is declared bankrupt, whether a legal practitioner or not, the Board may caution the agent or suspend or cancel the agent's registration. In such circumstances, it is then open to any client of that agent to seek recovery of monies under existing bankruptcy legislation.

        <para>
         The report I am tabling today is the record of a short tour of inspection which the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade undertook in August this year. The program of familiarisation visits, inspections and briefings encompassed key defence establishments in Brisbane, Townsville and Darwin.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The program placed appropriate emphasis on the subcommittee's interest in learning first hand of the activities of the ADF. Although short, the program of visits and meetings provided very useful information for members of the subcommittee, particularly those who joined the subcommittee during this parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the program we had many opportunities to discuss topical defence issues with commanding officers and service personnel. We gained invaluable insights into capabilities and requirements in the north. However, the report we have presented does not pretend to be an exhaustive discussion of all the topics
         <break page="4585" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          raised with or by the subcommittee during the familiarisation program.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We were particularly interested in seeing what has been undertaken through the APIN project, the army presence in the north project, which has been developing mainly at Robertson Barracks in Darwin since 1989 and will continue until the final phase of the project in the year 2001. Fully realised, APIN will see the relocation of some 2,300 soldiers and 2,600 family members to Darwin. APIN represents a departure from the traditional home location of elements of the Australian Defence Force in southern capitals and towns, and emphasises instead the establishment of quick response operational units which are self&amp;hyphen;sufficient and trained for remote areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         APIN represents a major commitment to increasing Australia's defence capabilities in the north as well as a considerable financial investment. It is a clear example of tailoring modern accommodation construction techniques to meet the demanding climate of the tropics. The overall cost of the project has been estimated at around $500 million and there are significant flow-on effects for the Northern Territory economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We learned that defence is directly spending at present an average of $2 million per week in the Northern Territory. With construction added, it would be closer to $4 million per week not including construction and maintenance expenditure by the Defence Housing Authority. In eight years of operation in Darwin, the authority has injected $27.3 million on average each year into the local economy. The relative effect of direct and indirect defence expenditure is expected to be maintained at around 10 per cent of the gross territory product from 1995 to 2001.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the features of APIN which impressed the subcommittee was the continued partnership with private industry in the design and construction of facilities and amenities and in the associated tendering processes which were designed to encourage the participation of small as well as large contractors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          The Defence Housing Authority has also participated in successful joint ventures with private sector developers. We attended the opening of Fairway Waters, the latest col laborative project at Palmerston, south-east of Darwin. It provides high-quality housing for defence personnel as well as for private purchasers.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another area of major interest to the subcommittee during the northern visits was the Army 21 review, the proposed blueprint for the army for the 21st century, which had been presented to the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). This has now been overtaken by the Restructuring of the Army statement by the Minister for Defence in the last sitting week.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, given the significance of Army 21 as a paper for the future of Australia's defence as it was then, the subcommittee was surprised that the broad thrust of the proposals did not appear to be widely disseminated through the army's chain of command. Also there has been much media speculation in recent months about the new direction proposed for Australia's army of the future. The subcommittee has sought a briefing from the Minister for Defence on the restructuring proposals for the army and looks forward to receiving the briefing now that the minister made his defence policy statement in the parliament on 15 October.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I would like to thank the Minister for Defence, and the military and civilian personnel who assisted in ensuring the success of the subcommittee's familiarisation program. I also thank the secretariat of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, who worked closely with defence personnel to develop a program of visits, briefings and inspections which has provided so much valuable information to subcommittee members about defence requirements and capabilities in northern Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The central part of the visit was to see the development that has taken place in recent years of the presence of the Australian Defence Force in the north—the APIN or army presence in the north program. This is a very important program as well as being a very expensive one. The importance of it lies in the fact that it acclimatises troops who were formerly in Victoria and in the southern part of New South Wales to life in the tropics.
        </para>
        <break page="4586" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Since the prospective area of operations for Australian Defence Force troops will be either in the northern part of Australia or in South-East Asia, the acclimatisation of those troops is a matter that takes time and is a very important adjunct in their training and preparedness. At the same time it exposes their equipment and, to a certain degree, their doctrine, the way they operate, to the requirements of the climate as well. It tests them in a way that would not be possible to do at Holsworthy or Puckapunyal in the southern part of the continent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Undeniably, it is a very high cost program because you are supporting a large establishment a long way from its source of supplies. The evidence given to the committee and recorded in this report from army was that, just off the top of their head, they estimated it was costing between $15,000 and $16,000 per soldier per annum as a consequence of the location.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Clearly, the original reason for the deployment to the north taken by the Labor government was wrong. It was based on the Dibb concept of defending Australia by lining the beaches with troops shoulder to shoulder—a philosophy which, sadly, still lives on, particularly in army today in many quarters. But there are some advantages in it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Professor Dibb's basic philosophy is quite wrong. What is absolutely crucial is for the Australian Defence Force and the Australian nation to know what is going on in that area. It is also terribly important for us to demonstrate our sovereignty over the territorial areas that we claim as our own: on the land, in the air and at sea. If a nation does not demonstrate its sovereignty then people do not respect that sovereignty. We must know what is going on in and through the airspace, over and under the water and on the landmass there, but that does not mean that you put your armed combat force units in that area. Nevertheless, it has happened now. Whatever the reasons, we have got a major financial investment in the north that we simply cannot walk away from. We have got to make the most of it and use it as effectively as we can for the benefit of the Defence Force and for the benefit of the country.
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           I will be very interested to read the report being prepared by the Australian National Audit Office into the cost of the army presence in the north. The ANAO has just started to prepare the report. I say that because it is important in these times of restricted budgets for Defence that we know precisely what everything is costing us. I do not think that should be the sole determinant of what we do, what capabilities we should acquire or what force structures we should have—far from it. Defence is not a business: it is not something that presents a balance sheet and pays a dividend in a monetary sense every year. Its great dividend is the peace and security of this country, and that is a matter that cannot be quantified.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I do think it is important that we get a very accurate handle on this instead of making the assumptions that we have to make at the present time about the cost of the army presence in the north. I look forward to the audit office report being available to the parliament in a year or so.

         The committee met with Brigadier Mike Smith AM, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, and his officers. Lavarack Barracks is the headquarters of the 3rd Brigade and incorporates two infantry battalions—1 RAR and 2 RAR. The capability of the brigade is enhanced by the Townsville based allocated units, which are the 5th Aviation Regiment, the 2nd Field Logistic Battalion, No. 35 Squadron RAAF and the Operational Support Group RAAF. The 3rd Brigade is held at the very highest degree of readiness for operations and is the major combat component of the Australian Defence Force's Ready Deployment Force. A large proportion of the brigade's exercise training schedule involves joint training with the RAN and the RAAF. It also participates in combined exercises with United States and Indonesian forces. These exercises are of value in gaining new skills and ideas and in developing teamwork and understanding between defence forces of neighbouring countries.

         The army presence in Townsville contributes very significantly to the local community and the economy. I have to say that small business generally benefits greatly from the presence of the army at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. The army provides an enormous amount towards employment in the northern city. As well, the defence forces play a major community role. Many of the soldiers and airmen in Townsville are fully integrated in a very significant way within the local community.

         The 5th Aviation Regiment was established as an army unit in 1987 and now operates more aircraft than any other operational ADF unit. It provides air mobility and battlefield support to 3rd Brigade and it works closely on training exercises with the SAS. Further, 5th Aviation Regiment gives community assistance in search and rescue and flood relief operations and in relation to most civilian calamities—particularly the cyclones that we experience all too often in the north. The regiment plays a major and very beneficial role in that regard.

Eleventh Brigade is the only reserve formation in an area which stretches from Thursday Island and within three kilometres of the Papua New Guinea border, west to the Queensland border and south to a line joining Mount Isa and Ingham.

         —When I last addressed this bill, I said that the second reading speech is an interesting speech for this reason: not only does it allege various facts—which is common to second reading speeches, to form a basis for doing what the legislation purports to do—but also the proposition that has been put alleges facts which, to a large extent, would go against that proposition, which is that one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra should be sold. Many of the things that are contained in the second reading speech, as I see it, would justify not the sale of Telstra but the keeping of it.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I said on the last occasion that there was a statement in the second reading speech which suggested that the onus should be on those who want to resist the sale of Telstra to show why it should not be sold. I was saying that that is looking at things from the wrong angle. To sell Telstra, a most successful company, which, I recall, according to the second reading speech, is the biggest tax paying company in Australia, and put at risk that payment of tax to the Commonwealth seems to be a strange course to adopt. The first page of the second reading speech says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This proposal is not about marrying an ideological attachment to private ownership with the necessity to balance the books. Partial privatisation of Telstra is one element of a broader telecommunications policy aimed at giving Australians a world&amp;hyphen;class telecommunications industry in terms of not only technology but also pricing and quality of service.
        </para>
        <para>
         Much is made of the universal service obligation. It is difficult to see how selling one-third of Telstra can obtain that object. As the second reading speech points out, the government will retain the majority shareholding. Page 7 of the second reading speech says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The government will also entrench a provision in Telstra's constitution to enable the Commonwealth to appoint directors in proportion to its shareholding.
        </para>
        <para>
         It will continue to be able to control Telstra into the future. The reality is that the sale of one-third of Telstra will make very little difference. No doubt, the minority shareholders, as is pointed out in the second reading speech, will be able to go to annual general meetings and ask questions. No doubt, they will be able to put some pressure on the directors of Telstra. But it will not fundamentally change the present situation where the government is subject to questions in this chamber to ensure that Telstra is properly run. It seems a great effort to go through the process of selling one-third of Telstra simply to have some minority shareholders in a position to ask questions at the annual general meeting. Page 7 of the second reading speech also says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Placing reporting obligations in legislation is the most transparent means of retaining access to information on a basis comparable to the current arrangements.

         </break>
        </para>
        <para>
         The strange thing about that is that that sentence contemplates that the present situation does give a transparency to the way things are done. We are going to have a privatisation of Telstra and then to obtain what we lose as a result of that; we are going to have legislation to make transparent what is already transparent under the present scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation attempts to privatise a government corporation and then to provide a great deal of legislation to attempt to bring Telstra back to the very situation it is now in. The second reading speech says that the regulation of this company will now be tighter. I hope I have remembered the words correctly. It said that the provisions to have that in the new legislation will be much more strict than the regulation that was put into place under the former government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seems extraordinary that we are going to vote on a bill on the basis of a second reading speech which, in effect, when it is read properly, is aimed more at keeping Telstra in its present ownership. It would be more readily understood if the whole thing was being sold off, but clearly that is not happening and there are no plans to sell this company off. We seem to fall between two stools. Firstly, we have a company that is only one-third privatised. Nevertheless, that comes with a lot more regulation of this company. Secondly, we go down a path that would seem to be privatisation, with the benefits that can bring, but we really do not—we really are chasing a dream. On page 13, under the heading `Customer service guarantee', the second reading speech says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The coalition has long been concerned about declines in many aspects of service, particularly where there is a lack of competition such as in areas of rural and remote Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         But there is no explanation of how the sale of one-third of Telstra is going to bring about any more competition in rural or remote Australia. It is a statement that was made and just left hanging in the air. Indeed, the presumption is that there will be no more competition because of the sale of one-third of Telstra. The only thing that would happen is that it may well be that the minority share
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          holders object to the company spending money in non-productive activities in rural and remote Australia. If that is so, the effect of selling one-third of Telstra will bring some pressure to bear on the company not to provide as good a service as it might in areas which do not return as big a profit as might be desired by the shareholders. Those areas are likely to be rural and remote areas.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We had a vote on this when we were last here. Much consumer legislation is going into place in this bill. That legislation is necessary because the government perceives that people—Australians, the customers of Telstra—should be better treated. The whole purpose of privatisation and this one&amp;hyphen;third sale is supposed to be to make services better through competition. If that is so, why does this second reading speech go through the process of saying that we need all these other regulations to obtain in effect what competition, as it is expressed in this bill, cannot obtain?

         —The Australian Greens are totally opposed to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. We stood strongly against it during the election campaign and there has not been anything in the public debate or the Senate debate that I have heard since to change our minds. It is simply bad doctrinaire policy by the new government. It is doctrinaire because it is an extension of the idea that anything that the Stock Exchange can decide is better than anything that the parliament can decide. This is the fundamental principle of economic fundamentalism itself—economic rationalism, if you like—which is practised by this government with such zeal that it even puts a shine on the efforts of the previous Labor government, which, as we all know, was busy privatising such great Australian institutions as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the latter, of course, I have seen the figures from the Australia Institute which show that it actually cost the Australian public over $600 million to sell the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories into private hands. That is the long&amp;hyphen;term cost of government having to buy back services and the actual
        <break page="4591" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         conveyancing, if you like, of that sale. What an extraordinary situation it is where, on the belief that government and parliament cannot adequately run vital sections of public affairs, we actually have the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in order to sell that instrumentality into private hands.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If that was not warning enough, on this occasion we have before the Senate, in monetary terms, a much bigger sale and, in monetary terms, a much bigger loss inherent in this sale of Telstra. I have seen the figures—they are debatable—that the goodwill and the actual wherewithal of Telstra sold on the market as the government proposes would lead to losses of up to $20 billion or $30 billion. We are actually going to pay to take out of national control such an essential service as telecommunications because, for reasons that have not yet been able to be brought home because they have not been provided by the government, it is thought that, in private hands, Telstra will be a better entity than it has proved to be in public hands. That is muddle&amp;hyphen;headed and it is wrong. The silly argument brought forward by the government—that the Castro government is doing this and therefore that justifies our doing it—shows the absurdity that attends the government's argument.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The sale of the third of Telstra is said to bring in some $8 billion to the public coffers, and $1 billion out of that over the next five years or so will be put towards what is called the Natural Heritage Trust. There are two things about that. Firstly, the monetary side. What the government is proposing to do will effectively knock out one of the biggest income earners that it has got. The sale of the whole of Telstra—and that is the intention of the government in the medium to short term—would mean a loss of income of over $1 billion per annum.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the reasons the public of Australia are opposed to this legislation is that they have the savvy to know that that money can be made up only through either an increase in taxes or further cuts in public services. It means that the average Australian is going to be either hit in the pocket or further deprived of essential services such as health, education
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and security. When it gets to the hidden or indirect costs, they are legion. Many of them have been pointed to by previous speakers, so I will not go into the legion. Suffice it to say, however, that people on lower incomes and people in remote rural areas of Australia are going to be hardest hit. There is no doubt that Telstra's ability in public hands to deliver basic and essential telecommunication services to those two categories of Australians is going to be trammelled by its sale into private hands.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No matter what temporary legislation safeguarding the poor and the people living in remote areas is passed by this parliament, the ineluctable pressure of the private corporation which arises out of this sale will be in the opposite direction. It is going to be a great penalty on the pockets of remote consumers in Australia as we go down the line. They are going to find it harder to get some equality of service, let alone to get it at some equality of cost as the burgeoning communications world, the world of information, means that they too, like urban dwellers, rely more and more on the services that Telstra does provide and which it ought to be providing into the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would be much better for the government to be legislating to have a single underground cable system for all major providers in this country and for the cost of that to be borne not just by Telstra but by all providers than for the government to be bringing this legislation into this parliament with the end effect of deteriorating services to the public at greater cost to its pocket. I am referring there not to the big end of town but to the public in the main, spread out in the regional and rural areas of Australia, or those people struggling to make ends meet in the cities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="4592" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The second point, of course, is the environment. This parliament has already legislated to exclude Telstra and Optus from environmental considerations in expanding their networks. That has led to an enormous public reaction in what is arguably the most environmentally sensitive country in the world. People simply do not like cables being rolled out through their leafy suburbs at the whim of Optus any more than they like either company sticking towers on every hill, mar ring every vista in the great Australian countryside. But they can do that without fear or favour because this parliament was, I think, remiss enough to say, `We will not extend environmental laws to the extension of telecommunications in the future.' That was presumably done because it was thought that that would be a monetary cost.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is because successive governments have put all on the altar of monetary costs and none on the altar of other values in life, including environmental and aesthetic values, which the Australian public holds in higher kudos than the average member of cabinet has done in this place for a long time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But then comes the grand duplicity, the greenmail that is involved in this legislation. The government says that it is going to put $1 billion aside out of the sale to provide for funding the Natural Heritage Trust. When we look at that, we find that, in effect, the government has taken a much wider brush and is saying in essence, `If you want to have a good environment in the future, you've got to support this legislation to flog off Telstra into the private domain.' It is blackmail by old standards, greenmail by the new standards.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we were to accept that, then every time an environmental consideration is to be made by the government it will see its opportunity to play off some other totally unrelated consideration with those people in this place who hold the environment at the top of the scale of importance in the decisions we make. What will it be next? Will it be the privatisation of tertiary education around the country to raise money to protect our forests? Who knows. There would be no end to it. Once you give in to greenmail, you are caught forever.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have told the minister on a number of occasions that he can say what he likes about the need to fund the various things listed in his Natural Heritage Trust legislation but he is selling himself out in his responsibility as Australia's premier environmentalist when he says, `I won't do that unless we sell off Telstra and get the assent of the Senate to do so.' What a disgraceful philosophy. What a disgraceful way to behave as minister for the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         environment. That is the failure of Senator Hill, who purports to be the minister for the environment but in fact repeatedly acts as minister against the environment. He says, `I'm not going to look after woodlands, I'm not going to look after the restoration of the health of our rivers, the coasts can go jump and Cape York is not a matter of consideration to me, unless you flog off the telephones.' That is where he is at.

        It is a travesty of his obligation as Minister for the Environment that Senator Hill is not fighting for each of those issues on their merit. It is a comment on the bankruptcy of wider ethics and values in this place, or at least in the realm of government thinking, that this greenmail is put before the Senate and the Minister for the Environment gets up and backs it. He has certainly done so publicly outside and with me in private as well. We are not buying that. As Greens, we never could and we never would.

        When you look at this bankrupt argument by the government that they need to sell Telstra to protect part of the environment, you actually see that at the same time they are draining previous funding from environmental efforts and obligations. In other words, they are not only creating the myth that they cannot get money from elsewhere to protect the environment, but they are also creating the myth that that spending—this was a commitment by Prime Minister Howard before the election—coming out of the sale of Telstra would be for new environmental goods. It is not. It is going to be put into past environmental commitments on the broad scale. We will not have a bar of that.

         So there we have it. Telstra should remain in public hands. Telstra is a great Australian public institution. If we have ever needed Telstra in the past, we are going to need it that much more in the future as telecommunications and the purveying of information becomes an even greater component of not only entertainment, education and information exchange but our ability to make opinions without fear or favour based on that information. It is a very dangerous move on financial and democratic grounds to be giving up this great Australian institution and placing it into the hands of the Stock Exchange because that happens to be a doctrinaire viewpoint taken by the government in 1996.

        The proposed partial privatisation of Telstra is no exception to Professor Walker's arguments. When the Democrats originally suggested that this bill should be the focus of a Senate inquiry, properly scrutinised by an inquiry, the government was up in arms proclaiming this to be an outrageous squandering of public resources. I am appalled to think that the government could consider that such scrutiny and such a reasoned investigation into the proposed sale of the government's most profitable business enterprise is a waste of money.

        Yet throughout the entire debate over the sale of  Telstra, the government has failed to produce any convincing studies or analysis of the domestic situation which reveal any genuine gains to the community from the proposed partial sale.

        The financial implications of the sale, however, are only a subset of the factors relevant to decisions concerning whether public assets should be privatised or should be retained. Today I would like to canvass a number of issues, some of which I think have been largely overlooked in this debate, such as the likely impact of the sale of Telstra on research and development in the telecommunications industry.

        The Senate committee's report revealed that the government has not given sufficient—if indeed any—consideration to the impact which privatisation of Telstra will have on the Telstra Research Laboratories, the TRL, and through this on the research capacity of Australia's telecommunications industry. TRL is not only Australia's leading telecommunications research facility; it is the largest such facility in the southern hemisphere. It is a national asset which has played a significant

        With Telstra as a government owned corporation, Telstra Research Laboratories has conducted and sponsored much of the R&amp;D required for the national interest. In effect, TRL was Australia's equivalent to the CSIRO for public R&amp;D in telecommunications.

        By Australian standards, Telstra has invested large sums in R&amp;D. Last year Telstra was ranked the largest corporate investor in R&amp;D in Australia in absolute terms, investing a total of over $200 million. By global standards, however, and by the standards of its competitors, it is a long way down the scale. Telstra's expenditure on R&amp;D amounted to only 0.5 per cent of revenue, which is minuscule compared to the 4.7 per cent of revenue invested by the leading Japanese company and Telstra's competitor in global markets, Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Privatisation, however, is not likely to generate an increased flow of funds to research, but, in fact, more likely a reduction. The majority report of the Senate Telstra inquiry reflected the legitimate fear of many researchers that a privatised Telstra would not retain the same commitment to research and development and to training and supporting telecommunications scientists and researchers as it has in the past. A purely profit driven Telstra would not retain the same commitment to long-term strategic research in the national interest. But it seems that in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to privatisation senior management is intent on winding back the expenditure at TRL to make Telstra appear even more profitable and therefore more attractive, presumably, to future investors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Telstra has announced it proposes to cut staff at TRL from the present 530 staff members to 380 by the end of this year. This is a cut of 150 employees, or around 30 per cent of staff, which already comes on top of a cut of 50 researchers and support staff who were given voluntary redundancies or early retirement over the past year.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of this, it is not surprising that researchers are saying that morale amongst staff has absolutely plummeted and that there is a climate of fear and uncertainty which, of course, undermines people's ability to undertake research. Management has claimed that these cuts are not being driven by privatisation and that in fact staff numbers and reductions are deemed necessary to improve focus and productivity in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to open competition in the telecommunications industry next year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If this is the case, then the government—perhaps more specifically the minister as the representative of the current owners of Telstra, the people of Australia—should be taking a closer interest and asking why. Why is Telstra slashing staff at its principal research facility as a means of increasing its competitiveness? Why is it pursuing this strategy when the leading global telecommunications companies see investing in R&amp;D as a means of increasing competitiveness?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is clear that in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to privatisation, TRL is mimicking the strategy pursued by British Telecom post&amp;hyphen;privatisation and focusing on adapting supplied technology to local requirements. But this is a strategy that involves little more than the purchase and installation of equipment designed and built overseas. However, if Telstra no longer invests in new product or hardware development, there will be an overall net reduction in the level of research conducted in Australia, and the end result of that will be a loss of such jobs to this country. Even if this is of no concern to a purely profit driven Telstra, it is of concern to the Australian research community and it should be of concern to this government.

          The detrimental impact which the sale of Telstra is likely to have on telecommunications research in this country is exacerbated by the government's decision to slash assistance for industrial research and development in the budget, and there are a range of measures in this budget that have attacked and slashed R&amp;D spending. Australia's private sector has been notoriously poor in investing in research and development and, by OECD standards, Australia's ratio of business ex penditure on R&amp;D to gross national product remains one of the lowest. The cuts announced by the government will ensure that it stays this way.

         In our view, increasing the competitiveness of Australian firms should be focused on increasing their capacity to innovate, to undertake research and to draw out the best in their human resources.

It will not foster the development or the growth of high wage, high skilled industries. In fact, further reductions in real wages will entrench an already existing brain drain that is occurring in this country.

I would like to know what that committee thinks of the government's industry policy which is driving industry and jobs offshore, but I doubt the committee will get the chance to revisit any of these ideologically driven policies.

Anyway, on a national level this bill is going to provide an increase in our public sector savings by giving an opportunity to the government to clear $7 billion of public debt and at the same time remove an annual interest bill of around $660 million.

The person who has the experience in telecommunications management, in this country anyway, is the Telstra Chief Executive Officer, Mr Frank Blount. I do not hear you saying too much about his qualifications, but he is the Telstra chief executive. He has the experience. He is the one responsible for the very good profit result they had this year.

In other words, you are saying that if we sell Telstra we will not be so well off. The guy who has turned Telstra into a money making machine is saying that selling a third of it will make it a lot better. He is welcoming what we are trying to do.

I received many calls during the election campaign from people who had been misled on this matter.

For instance, we know that before the committee even sat the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) said they were going to oppose it. The opposition was of the same view. What was the point of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on tripping around the country supposedly taking evidence?

You, Mr Acting Deputy President, know that in the same position we

         These are the facts that the opposition will not mention and cannot mention because they know that they highlight the lack of substance in their arguments. A move to partially privatise Telstra will also have a significant effect on the performance of our national telecommunications carrier. Again, evidence before the committee showed that Telstra has around 135 access lines per employee whereas the two privatised carriers, such as British Telecom and Telecommunications Corporation of New Zealand, are both much more efficient at around 200 lines per employee.

During the last election, there was no more widely debated issue than the aspect of the partial privatisation of Telstra. There could hardly have been a voter in Australia who did not go to the polling booth in March, this year, who did not watch the television commercial, for a start, who would not be aware of the differences in the position of the

          then Labor government and the coalition on this issue. The electors of Australia made their choice; they provided a huge mandate for this government to carry out its election promises.

Those within Telstra recognise the benefits and the only ones who do not seem to are the political opportunists opposite. As the Prime Minister said, for goodness sake get out of the way and let us get on with what we are trying to do for Australia. This bill will shape the future of our telecommunications industry in the next decade and provide Australian consumers with the sorts of benefits which those overseas have enjoyed for many years.

        The partial privatisation of Telstra is what we are debating.

He knows—as do those opposition senators who have made the same claim—that that is totally and utterly wrong. There is no substance to the claim; in fact, it is quite the reverse. We gave a commitment that we would go to the people and to the parliament if we ever sought to sell more than one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra.

        If time allows I will come back to some of that information, but there are two issues that I wish to cover today: one is the duplication of cables and the other is the question of cabling. Partial privatisation within the regulatory framework that this government is currently putting in place will ensure real benefits for consumers. The bulk of international evidence suggests that privatisation, when linked with competitive reforms and consumer safeguards, provides significant consumer benefits such as lower prices and an increase of services as carrier efficiency and responsiveness improves. Something that came out consistently throughout the committee's inquiries was that Telstra is so far off the pace that only this type of initiative would see it become truly competitive in the world market.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the majority report is the report put together by the opposition senators on the Senate committee on the partial sale of Telstra. The recommendations are not directly related to the merits of whether this bill should proceed or not. Part of the plan was to divert the committee down a track that was not really part of the bill. For example, the majority report recommends that the government undertake a number of actions in relation to what the report calls `duplication of infrastructure': that the government urgently review the strategy of allowing dual hybrid optical fibre&amp;hyphen;coaxial cable roll&amp;hyphen;out—particularly having regard to evidence that such networks will be obsolete within a decade—and immediately take action to ensure that carriers enter negotiations with a view to arriving at an arrangement whereby the carriers in future combine their competing broadband cable systems into one national network.

        Firstly, it should be acknowledged that the rules that govern the roll&amp;hyphen;out of telecommunications facilities were established by the Labor government. They are currently being examined by this government. When the opposition parties started this inquiry, the coalition government had only been in office for four short months. The way they performed like trained seals about the whole issue of dual cabling and underground and overhead cabling would lead anyone to believe that it was all on our initiative. We are following on from the Labor government's 13 years of mismanagement and miraculously they blame us four months down the track for their inadequacies.

In the course of this examination the government will undoubtedly seek advice on the capabilities of the technologies the carriers are employing for their respective roll&amp;hyphen;outs.

         Secondly, the government is aware of concerns that there may be significant duplication of Australia's broadband cable infrastructure and suggestions that the government should act to minimise this duplication—and thus the investment—in infrastructure. However, facilities based competition, under which each carrier builds its own facilities to carry at least some part of its services, has been central to the development of open telecommunications markets in most countries. In Australia in the case of telephony, competition has delivered lower prices for consumers, greater investment in equipment and a wider range of choices of services for consumers. It has also provided much needed pressure for improvements in efficiency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Network deployment decisions—what to build, when to build and where to build—are matters for the commercial judgment of the carriers and their associates. Additional infrastructure investment will not occur unless there is an expectation of user demand for the additional capacity and a commercial judgment about the need for a carrier to control its own facilities rather than simply interconnecting with those of another carrier.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It should not be assumed that competing telecommunications facilities necessarily duplicate each other. The rapid changes in technology and customer demand that characterise the telecommunications industry provide significant incentives for carriers and service providers to continually explore new and differentiated product applications and therefore different, but in some cases superficially similar, forms of infrastructure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The argument that duplication is wasteful is usually made on a fairly simplistic level. If you have two sets of cables each costing $4 billion and you only need one, then you are wasting $4 billion. This argument does not hold up well when subjected to more detailed analysis. As a BZW report explains:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As an indication of the benefits and costs, the cost of duplication is a part of the $3 billion that Optus Vision is spending to roll out its network . . . However, this is a long life cycle investment lasting 10 to 20 years. So the annual cost of `duplication' is measured in $100s of millions. It is much lower than the annual revenue measured in bills for which the cable companies and service providers will
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          compete. The competition benefits—lower operating costs, lower prices, more services, greater carrier responsiveness, more choice and a leading role in emerging services—means the benefits far outweigh the costs.

         If a new investor decides it is not commercially feasible to build a new and separate infrastructure, then the current regulatory framework and that envisaged for post&amp;hyphen;30 June 1997 facilities—interconnection generally on a commercial basis but subject to appropriate competitive safeguards; and the sharing of sites, that is, co&amp;hyphen;location, where it is technically and economically feasible—would allow that investor to go into business.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The OECD has recently concluded that governments should not aim to establish a single—that is monopoly—infrastructure provider but rather seek to promote the development of applications and an efficient market which requires not only competing fixed&amp;hyphen;link structures but competing technologies and networks. Without competition, the development and diffusion of new technologies and applications will be restrained. There is also the risk that the monopoly provider could charge monopoly prices and restrict access to infrastructure. Thus, the government is unlikely to favour the establishment of a single infrastructure providing authority or carrier.

         The issue of cabling was raised before the committee. The opposition parties made sure that they wheeled in witness after witness to quite genuinely express concern about the issue of cabling. It was portrayed by the opposition parties that cabling was contained within this bill and that this bill was somehow going to facilitate the policies that had been put in place by the previous government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of recommendations, once again, which appear in the majority report of the Senate committee inquiry on the partial sale of Telstra which are not directly related to the issue of whether or not Telstra should be partially sold. To give a further example, the majority report recommends a range of measures to force cabling underground. It recommended legislating for all cabling to be placed underground, the development of a long&amp;hyphen;term program for all existing cabling underground, mandatory removal
         <break page="4606" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of obsolete aerial cabling, and at least mandating co&amp;hyphen;location of cabling where technically feasible.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This last recommendation seems to be a recognition of the difficulty of implementing the other three recommendations and that co&amp;hyphen;location of telecommunications cabling is not always feasible. Certainly, the preliminary audit of existing duct capacity that Austel conducted at the government's request earlier this year indicate that this was the case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Austel report indicated that the availability of Telstra duct space for anyone else's cable averages less than 30 per cent and is fragmented in such a way that useable contiguous duct spacing represents only a very small fraction of the total network route length. The audit also indicated that the difference in costs between overhead and underground cabling for a new network are very significant and any business case must strongly favour aerial deployment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It must be recognised that the issue of aerial cabling is a difficult one. Nobody denies that. No&amp;hyphen;one on the committee, on either side, denied that. But we need to be up front about what this bill contains. On one hand the government is well aware of the concern within the community about the visual impact of aerial cabling. On the other hand, the government is also aware of the desire within the community to have access to enhanced services and cheaper phone calls, those services which are delivered by new cabling infrastructure and are likely to be delivered faster and cheaper by aerial cabling. That was an interesting factor which was brought before the committee. The people decided that they did not want that cabling but, in the main, they wanted the facilities that the cabling provided.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also must be recognised that it is not just telecommunications cabling which is deployed aerially. Much of Australia's power cabling has also been deployed aerially. While these issues are not simple, the government is endeavouring to address them. The government undertook a review of the rules governing the manner in which telecommunications networks were rolled out. From the outset, it was evident that any new scheme would need
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to strike a balance between the need for early availability of advanced communications services and the right of local communities and their representatives to be consulted on the installation of facilities.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government issued a draft revised telecommunication national code and a draft new land access code in July 1996 and directed Austel to conduct a public inquiry into both codes and report back. The minister is currently examining Austel's report and carefully considering the feedback which the government and Austel received from a number of interested parties on the form of the new telecommunications national code. Of particular benefit has been considerable discussion with the Australian Local Government Association, which has given the minister the views of local councils concerning a number of aspects of the draft telecommunications national code.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A decision on the implementation of the new code will be made once the minister is satisfied that proper account has been taken of the comments received. The government does not believe it is appropriate to completely change the rules applying to the carriers and require them to drastically reconfigure their networks. However, the government does recognise community concerns about aerial cabling. It has included measures in the draft telecommunications national code which would require carriers to put cabling underground where there is no existing aerial cabling of any kind unless local councils agree otherwise. Remember, there is a local input there then. It is not just the council; it is the people and the community of that particular area. It would also require carriers to put aerial cabling underground when all other cabling is placed underground, again, unless local councils agree otherwise.

         The minister has also written to state and territory ministers on the issue of whether there are any state initiatives relating to undergrounding of power cabling and possible scope for participation in these initiatives by telecommunications carriers. In addition, I understand that the minister has recently agreed to further discussions with the peak body for local government in Australia, the

         It was interesting, once again, to listen to the input from senators in relation to the concerns expressed by rural and regional areas. Once again, I just happened to be absorbed today by the misinformation that Senator Brown put to the Senate. He was talking about the way in which rural and regional Australia will be badly affected by this legislation. Sadly, Senator Brown was not at the committee meetings to hear witnesses, not only the National Farmers Federation, to whom Senator Patterson referred, but also, for example, Mrs Ann Lewis, the Western Australian State President of Australian Women in Agriculture. She said:

         We rural Australian business people need a telecommunications provider who is considerate of the customer's needs and is prepared to discuss with us the technology available.

         They have selectively and religiously quoted and misquoted people who came before the committee, including people like Mrs Lewis and the National Farmers Federation, saying that people in rural and regional Australia will be worse off. In fact, the reverse is true. We had representatives of two rural South Australian councils—Mr Brazel, of Roxby Downs

        Let us get a few things straight. To my knowledge, those people responsible are not in the chamber now, but time and time again as I sat here the Friday before last doing the whip's duty most of the day, I heard senators from the opposition benches, the Democrats and the Greens—one of the Greens spoke today—talking about the sale of Telstra. They
        <break page="4608" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         repeated it that often that I started to believe it too. But we are back to a new week now. By now they should realise that we are only selling one-third of Telstra. That is what the bill is all about.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As Senator Calvert pointed out early in his delivery, the two-thirds that remains with the government and the shares that are going to be sold amount to a figure of about 88 per cent—I may be wrong, so please correct me if I am—but very little will be owned by interests outside this country. Please everyone, get it through your heads that we are selling only one-third of Telstra. I heard Senator Conroy say it for a start.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us compare this with that broken promise of the previous Labor government on the Commonwealth Bank. They claim that it was not a broken promise because they did not mention it leading up to the previous election. I suppose they could go down that line and say, `No, we never promised not to sell it; we just did not say anything about it.' I come back to the point that, leading up to the election, we were out there saying that we were going to sell a third. We said that $1 billion would go into a foundation for the environment and the rest would be used for retiring debt and not recurring expenditure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us compare the sale of Telstra with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. As I said, the Labor government of the time, contrary to former promises—even though they did not mention it leading up to the election—sold off 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. They sold 249 million shares at $5.40 each, which brought in $1.344 billion. At that time, this gave the Commonwealth Bank a total value of $4.4 billion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In September 1991, just six weeks later, the share value of each of those shares that were sold off reached $6.46. As I remember, six weeks later, that 30 per cent grew to $1.608 billion. So the $1.344 billion grew to $1.608 billion—that was the privatised part—in a maximum of two months or something like that. That already gave a total value of $5.361 billion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, in September 1993, when the government of the day decided to sell another 20 per cent, at that time those shares were
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         valued at $7.79 per share. That original 30 per cent was now worth $1.939 billion, which also gave the Commonwealth Bank a total value of $6.463 billion. The point I am getting at is that whatever the government got at the time in that first share issue was far outstripped by the increase in the total value of the Commonwealth Bank.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In other words, the 80 per cent that was left at the time in the hands of the Commonwealth government grew back in no time, in a matter of about two years, and it went beyond the total value in 1991. In other words, it went past the 100 per cent value. Of course, there was a certain amount of inflation in that. But, unless the government at the time want to say that they let inflation run rampant, the inflation did not make up for that. So you can see that by part&amp;hyphen;privatising a government entity, it does not take very long to make up for what has been sold.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In two years, the Commonwealth Bank grew to $2 billion, which was far in excess of that original sale of $1.344 billion. You ask: why does that happen? It happens because, when you go into part&amp;hyphen;privatisation, you also get private enterprise management. You get private enterprise thinking in management.

In no time down the track, this will be worth as much to the government as it is today, having already picked up in the meantime whatever the value is in cutting down the debt and certainly not using it on recurring expenditure. This includes that $1 billion that is going into the foundation, the income from which—this is something that those on the other side did not fully address—will go to the environment along with other allocations from the budget.

         Why will it make Telstra a little meaner and leaner with private enterprise management? Even though Telstra operations around the country have improved a lot over the years, there is still a lot to be done as far as work practice and attitude to work are con cerned. I can remember a person who worked for Telstra somewhere in Australia, not necessarily Western Australia, who had a private enterprise mentality about him. His job as a technician was to do certain installations. He was given a list of jobs to do for that week on a Monday morning; he came back at lunchtime and said that he had done such and such. They said, `You have done what? You have done three times the allocation that you were supposed to have done this morning.' He had to appear in front of a superior who told him to slow down a bit. I just throw that in to show you that those things are still going on. That is the comparison I have made with the Commonwealth Bank. I cannot see why the same cannot be repeated in Telstra with the two-thirds that remain.

        Senator Conroy from the opposition said that Telstra was a high performer. I agree that it is a high performer, except for a few of the things I have just mentioned. I believe that it will be a higher performer still with a private enterprise mentality and management.

        Senator Conroy went on to say that Telstra made $2.3 billion in profits. I believe that those profits will certainly increase. The way he said it, I thought the $2.3 billion was going to disappear. Two-thirds of that, if the profit is the same—I think it will be higher—will still be there. Does he not know and do others in the chamber not know that the dividends going out from that privatised section will be taxed? Has he forgotten that? Have others forgotten that? Another thing is that it will probably be taxed at a higher rate. Most of those shares will be, I hope, held by ordinary Australians like you and me.

        Senator Conroy also mentioned—I happened to be in the chamber at the time—that Telstra paid rates and taxes and all those sorts of things that a corporation pays.

        In my office a bit earlier on I heard Senator Stott Despoja from South Australia talking about the efficient suppliers of materials from Australia to Telstra, as if we were going to lose the opportunity to supply that high quality  electronic equipment to Telstra. Where is Telstra all of a sudden going to get those supplies? Are they going to go overseas just as a matter of course? No, they will not be going overseas as a matter of course. They will be buying where they have the quality of equipment they are buying now and where it is competitive. Australian manufacturers of electronic gear are doing pretty good now, so I cannot see for one moment how Australian suppliers are going to lose the opportunity of supplying that equipment to Telstra, as they are now.

One is to provide an immediate source of short-term revenue for the government.

        So much of this rationale is based on economic theory. I make this point because I am sick and tired of certain economists and the economic cheer squad of this country behaving as if they have some God given monopoly on the truth when it comes to current economic theory. I am sick and tired of them telling the rest of us to treat what are often not much more than political or economic fads as though they contain some compelling central truth which cannot be denied. I am really glad that finally, after almost a decade, we are having an extended public debate on privatisation, although we are still being told by the government that privatisation of our key public assets is so good for the community that it cannot be questioned or delayed.

        I have to say that being told that we should privatise Telstra because nearly every other country has done so is not an argument. `Behave like lemmings,' they say. This is nothing more than an appeal to fashion—an appeal which seeks to deny Australians the right to make up their own minds, irrespective of what any other country is doing, about whether partial or full privatisation of our national carrier is in our best interests, is in Australia's best interests. There is no intrinsic merit in blindly following what other countries have done. Every country has its own unique geographical, historical and cultural circumstances.

        Senator Panizza talked a lot about new investors paying tax and how the profit and loss columns will stack up. I would like to talk about the financial implications of the sale in some detail. Eminent Australian economists—such as John Quiggin, Professor of Economics at James Cook University, and Dr Allan Brown from Griffith University in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Queensland, both of whom have undertaken painstaking research into this field—have warned that the proposed privatisation of Telstra will result in a substantial loss to the net worth of the public sector. We all know the coalition does not place a high value on the net worth of the public sector, but other people do and taxpayers might be interested to know. These two economists argue that the interest savings in public debt from selling Telstra will be significantly less than the profit stream forgone.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In his submission to the Senate Telstra inquiry, Professor Quiggin estimated the value of Telstra in public ownership to be $54.4 billion. This estimate is based on comparing Telstra's after&amp;hyphen;tax profits with the net sale proceeds that would be required to generate similar savings in public debt interest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is $30 billion more than the market price that analysts believe Telstra will realise if sold. One of the reasons argued for this is that private equity holders demand a far greater rate of return on their investments than the real rate of return on government debt. According to Professor Quiggin, it is only under the most unrealistically pessimistic profit scenarios that the government's partial privatisation scenario appears attractive.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Moreover, Professor Quiggin pointed out to the Senate Telstra inquiry that, in attempting to estimate the value of Telstra—the one that they are telling the Australian public when they are weighing up what we win and what we lose—the Department of Finance made:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the elementary error of comparing the public debt interest savings arising from privatisation with the dividends paid by Telstra rather than the earnings of Telstra including retained earnings. This procedure is defended on the basis of fallacies that were refuted decades ago, such as the view that retained earnings are `locked up' and therefore of no value. This claim is erroneous since reinvested earnings will generate a higher stream of income in the future, and are just as valuable as dividends . . . Once the error of comparing interest flows with dividends rather than profits is corrected, the Department's own analysis would show a loss arising from the partial sale of Telstra. More precisely, if whole of government accrual accounting along the lines proposed by the Commission of Audit—

         But there are other facts we can put on the record, such as the underpricing of public assets, which is one of the hallmarks of privatisation in this country. It happened with the Commonwealth Bank; it happened with Qantas; it happened with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. And what that means is that a relatively small number of people—the new shareholders and those involved in the actual transaction—make a gain at the expense of the rest of the taxpayers in Australia. What guarantee do we have that that will not happen with Telstra?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But what if we assume the financial situation of the government is not adversely affected by the sale. What then? The fact is that we would not be any better off. The government would simply have realised the value in cash terms of an asset valued at that amount and the underlying budget balance would remain unchanged.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So where is value to the nation in that? Where is the good economic policy in that? Under this scenario, it can equally be argued that it is better to retain Telstra in full public ownership and use the cash flows generated into consolidated revenue to repay public debt and fund existing programs or new ventures.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, when assessing the impact of privatisation on the net worth of the public sector, we also have to take into account the costs of actually floating Telstra—namely, the fees for the lawyers, accountants, stockbrokers, analysts and advertising agents. The Department of Finance told the Senate inquiry that it estimates these costs will be in the order of $160 million. That is a lot of money.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          That is $160 million coming out of the pockets of taxpayers for the wonderful privilege of losing ownership of their valuable public asset.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What it all adds up to is that the sale of Telstra involves selling off our highest income earning public asset for what is most likely to be no net economic gain. In fact, it is true that Australian taxpayers could be paying for the sale like hire purchase—they could be paying for the sale for many years to come—and I do not see any good public policy in that either.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has relied very heavily on the claim that selling a third of Telstra will make it more efficient because private businesses are inherently more efficient than their publicly owned counterparts. This is undeniably true in some industries in some areas, but it is not a truth in itself. I do not see any reason to anticipate efficiency gains beyond those that would have occurred anyway without a change in ownership. The performance and efficiency of government owned enterprises can and has been extensively improved under public ownership. Telstra itself has improved its performance and of course it can continue to do so, irrespective of who owns it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A significant amount of research has been undertaken which indicates that efficiency and consumer responsiveness is not inherently dependent on ownership, but rather depends on a combination of good management, effective competition, technological progress, regulation and consumer pressure. A 1995 Bureau of Industry Economics study revealed that Iceland, operating under a state telecommunications monopoly, had the world's lowest prices for a national basket of call charges and that Switzerland, another state monopoly, was the world leader both in terms of revenue per employee and revenue per line, which is an important measurement used by Telstra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I do not accept that there is a direct and inevitable association between economic performance and type of ownership. The fact is that the performance and efficiency of government owned enterprises has been extensively improved in public ownership. A

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is just propaganda to claim, as Telstra management and the government do, that partial privatisation offers some magic recipe by which Telstra will automatically make these significant efficiency gains. It has nothing to do with privatisation. As I said, it is about technological development. It is about management. It is about a commitment to providing a service, and I think Australians should be seriously questioning the commitment of the government and the capacity of Telstra's current management to deliver the sort of services Australia wants and needs, irrespective of whether Telstra is sold or not.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even if efficiency gains are made under private ownership, there is no reason to assume that the benefits of those gains will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices rather than captured by shareholders in the form of profits. The government has acknowledged this by bringing forward legislation to put in place new regulations for consumer protection.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If privatisation is going to deliver automatic consumer protection, then why do they need to bring forward this legislation? It is because they know that it is regulation, not privatisation, which is the key to safeguarding consumer interests. Unfortunately, the proposed consumer protection legislation does not go far enough in protecting the most vulnerable consumers—residential customers, those in remote localities and those with disabilities. If this is not remedied, and if other privatisations are anything to go by, all that we are likely to see post-privatisation is a sharp rise in the salaries of Telstra's senior executives, efficiency measured in how many jobs can be ditched, and no great leap forward in residential customer outcomes.

          We all know the code. What has efficiency and improved efficiency really equated to in this country in recent years? Improved efficiency really equals cutting down on staff and forcing workers to undertake greater duties and longer hours or suffer poorer terms and conditions. Only a few months ago Monash University published the results of a massive study on the effects of privatisation. There were over 200,000 case studies of enterprises and agencies world wide. The conclusion is one the government does not like to hear: no efficiency benefits from contracting out in the name of privatisation. I think that the South Australian Auditor-General just recently pointed out this very fact in an analysis of asset sales in South Australia. So let us not be duped by the repetition of the mantra about efficiency.

          I am certain that we would all remember that it was only recently that Telstra announced the biggest annual profit in Australian corporate history—$2.3 billion—while at the same time confirming that it would shed over 22,000 jobs in the next three years. I am not saying that there is no room for any staff reduction at Telstra, but I challenge the depths of those cuts. Recent employer surveys, both here and overseas, show that large&amp;hyphen;scale downsizing not only has failed to deliver high productivity—that is one of the claims they made—and improved customer service but also has had a devastating effect on morale, staff commitment and motivation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The fact is that downsizing, like privatisation, is a current economic fad. While this particular fad has been in vogue in America, and is currently in vogue in Australia, the tide has changed in the United States. Earlier this year, the so-called guru of downsizing, Mr Stephen S. Roach, had a great public confession to make: I got it wrong. `Open-ended downsizing and real wage compression were recipes for industrial extinction,' he said. There is a growing number of commentators, analysts and academics who are reaching similar conclusions. This is something that we should be addressing in this country before the situation is irretrievable.

The cost of that to the Australian community, or the community at large, is really quite tragic.

         Over 25 years ago I had the privilege of living for some while in the United States. I was enormously impressed then by what the individual state based, privately owned telephone companies provided compared with what was provided by what was then the PMG in Australia. You had a courteous and prompt relationship with the operators if you had any problem. When you dialled someone, you got correct connections; you did not get wrong numbers. It was a rapid connection and you got very clear voice communications, none of the static and the other business that we had in Australia in those years. You had free local calls. You paid a very affordable and very low monthly rental. Even 25 years ago, you were billed for STD calls and they were minutely itemised—the number called, the time of the call and the rest of it—so there was never any argument about the account.

         If we look at the history of Telstra in Australia, go back to when it was Telecom and before that the PMG, you come to another conclusion—that is, there has been a gross abuse of the monopoly powers that were invested in it. The only time we have seen any improvement in telephonic communications in this country was when the Labor government quite correctly introduced some competition into the scheme. Surely to goodness, in the light of that experience now and the benefits this minuscule competition that has come in has brought consumers, introducing more competition now, more private ownership is clearly the way to go because we are still left with the legacy of all those inefficient years.

          believe, as Senator Panizza said, that we can have bigger profits in the years ahead if it is run efficiently. Profitability is one thing and the enterprise has to be profitable to cope with new technology coming on and the rest of it.

         But at the end of the day, we have to have an affordable and efficient service. I would argue that there would be room through efficiency to lower the cost to both the individuals and business in Australia, and both of those are very worthy and essential aims.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I want to briefly deal with some of the myths that are around the place. If you listened to our opponents on this subject, they would lead you to believe that Telstra was beyond reproach, that no-one had any complaints about it. I can remember a few years ago in Cunnamulla in western Queensland being assailed by a property owner who owned two properties with his wife and it was essential for them to have phones on each property, but they could not get one phone.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I was mixed up for many years in the rural telephone subscribers organisation in rural Queensland, which came into being because of the poor service that Telstra provided to the bush. While someone might say that we are going back into the past, we are not going back very far; we are only going back about six or eight years. Let us look at the recent past at the organisation known as CoT, Casualties of Telecom. This group, particularly in Brisbane, have spent huge amounts of money on FOI finding out why their businesses have suffered through the incompetence of Telstra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The compensation claims that they are lodging through insolvency of their business run into half a million to a million dollars—amounts like that. That is really big money. Only last week I had two new cases come into my office in Brisbane. It is a very tragic story of two middle-aged women who started a business, and Telstra just messed them around to such a degree that they have lost a very large amount of money—I presume a significant part of their life savings, if not all of it—purely because of Telstra's technical inefficiencies. I think they have put in a claim
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          for about half a million dollars in compensation.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whether they will get it—or any of it—I have no idea. All I know is, from talking to them, that Telstra denies all responsibility. These people have been involved in considerable expense up to the present time, and the emotional stress of dealing with an absolutely insensitive and uncaring bureaucracy has to be seen to be believed.

         I was very interested to hear Senator Woodley for the Democrats waxing lyrical about the great service Telstra gives to the bush and saying that, if Telstra were sold, no-one in the bush would get a phone. With the greatest respect to Senator Woodley—and I am sorry he is not here—I think I do know the bush a bit better than he does. As I understand it, his experience of the bush is living in a manse in a small country town. That is really quite different from living out where the dingoes howl at night.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I will just give an example of my own experience within the last month. My wife and I have a cattle property in Central Queensland. While we have mains electricity onto it, the phone is supplied by some sort of solar powered system. I do not quite know how it works. All I do know is that it does not work much more than about 40 per cent of the time. Maybe it gets to 50 per cent of the time, but the serviceability of that phone would never be above 50 per cent. That is an enormous frustration, because we do not have the property as a weekend retreat or somewhere to get a suntan. It is a business, and the business is selling cattle—whether fat cattle, steers, stud bulls or herd bulls.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very frustrating and it costs us a huge amount of money when a buyer rings up and he cannot get connected to the property. There is a real safety element involved, because trauma and accidents are part and parcel of rural life. You try to avoid them as well as you can with correct management practices, but the phone has a very real safety factor to it. We have suffered enormously with this. We protest to Telstra, and nothing happens. They just do not want to know about us out there in the bush.

          As recently as a month ago, when my wife came back to Brisbane—she spent most of this year up on the property—she picked up the phone and rang the Telstra complaints section in Brisbane. She said that she wished to record a complaint with the phone at Lillianvale. The person at the other end of the line who took the call said, `I can't take the call.' My wife mildly said, ` Why can't you?' Telstra said, `The subscriber's got to make the complaint.' My wife said, `But I am the subscriber.' They said, `How are you complaining about the phone not working when you are phoning us?' My wife said, `The phone is in the country and I cannot do it from the property because the phone is not working.' They said, `You should have gone to the neighbour and phoned from the neighbour's house.' My wife said, `That is a two-hour or three-hour drive over bad roads and I do not really feel that that is practical. I am ringing you from here.' At that point—and my wife is a person of impeccable manners, unlike me!—the person from Telstra taking the complaint just slammed the phone down on my wife.

         <para first-indent="16">
          So do not give me any of the stories that Telstra are giving a Rolls Royce service to the consumers of Australia; it is simply not true. They will do a lot better when they get a profit motive coming from one-third of their shareholding being held by Australian citizens. With those few words, I wish the bill a speedy passage.

         —Like Senator MacGibbon and all of my colleagues, I support entirely the government's proposal for the sale of one-third of Telstra. I do it because I know it is good for Queenslanders and I know it is particularly beneficial to people up in the north, where I come from.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">

         It is no surprise that the coalition parties are putting this proposal forward. It was one of the very clear aspects of our election policy and it was a policy that the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens urged the electorate to judge us on at election time. Of course the electorate did just that and gave us a massive majority both in the House of Repre sentatives and even in the election for one-half of the Senate.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am excited about the sale of one-third—and I emphasise again, one-third—of Telstra. Listening to the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats spokesmen, you would think it was the total sale of Telstra. But it is a sale of one-third only—not like the Labor Party when they promised one thing in relation to privatisation and did exactly the opposite. It is the sale of one-third of Telstra. I am excited because the sale will provide a better service for people in all parts of Australia, but particularly in rural and regional Australia. As well, the proceeds of the sale will enable the greatest investment ever into the environment capital of our nation, and that can only be of benefit to all of us, but particularly to those in rural and regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course the other aspect of the sale is that the bulk of the moneys received from the sale of one-third of Telstra will be used to reduce our debt. When our debt is reduced it has the effect down the line of reducing interest rates. Of course the reduction in interest rates, as we have seen since this government has been in power—and the reduction in interest rates that is anticipated by the markets—can only be wonderful news for home owners and small business people right throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having listened to some of the absolute rubbish that has come from those on the other side of the chamber on this debate, perhaps it is necessary to reiterate that the bill provides that Telstra will remain Australian. The bill restricts aggregate foreign ownership to an 11.6 ownership stake in Telstra; that is, 35 per cent of the one-third of Telstra equity that can be held by persons other than the Commonwealth. It restricts foreign ownership in Telstra to 1.6 per cent, and it imposes related offences and anti-avoidance and enforcement provisions. It will ensure that Telstra's head office base of operations and incorporation remains within Australia and that its chairman and the majority of its directors are all Australian citizens.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Deputy President, having listened to some of the old European&amp;hyphen;type centralists on the other side talking about these things, you
        <break page="4618" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         would not understand that that is what the bill says. The bill will enable remedial action to be taken where there has been a contribution of the ownership limits and other requirements, including applications by Telstra or the minister for Federal Court injunctions.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So it will remain. It is Australian now, and it will remain totally Australian. There will be shareholder oversight in that the bill provides for the power to require Telstra to give the minister the financial statements. There will be a notification by Telstra of significant events that might take place. There is an obligation on the Telstra board to keep the minister informed of ongoing operations, and there is a requirement to prepare, update and provide corporate plans to the minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the bill has covered it very well. There are consumer safeguards, and these are quite clearly set out in the bill. The new consumer safeguards introduced by the government will be in addition to the continuation of several important mechanisms. The universal service obligation reaffirmed in the bill will continue to require a standard telephone service to be offered to all Australians. Untimed local call obligations already guaranteed by legislation will be retained for residential consumers. There will be price capping, which requires prices for a basket of Telstra's main services to reduce, on average, 7.5 per cent annually. Then there are the prices for individual services to residential customers. General prices surveillance will apply. All of those things are in the bill. It is quite obvious that no-one in the Labor Party or the Democrats or the Greens has been bothered to use it.

        I mentioned earlier that my interest was the interest, of course, of my constituents. I want to briefly elaborate on where some of the money will go. One billion dollars of the proceeds of the sale of one-third will go to the environment. I am absolutely amazed about the reaction from parties like the Greens and the Democrats, which claim to have some environmental constituency. I might say that nobody really believes that anymore.

But $1 billion of the sale of one-third of Telstra is to go into Australia's environmental infrastructure, and $318 million will go for a major national vegetation initiative to tackle the problems of land and water degradation.

There will be $163 million to implement the Murray-Darling project.

         —This afternoon in the other place I had the exquisite pleasure of seeing Jackie Kelly sworn in as the new repeat member for the seat of Lindsay in Sydney's west. I wanted to touch upon a few of the issues which that by-election result raises. Let me just first of all point out a few of the raw facts.

        In terms of primary votes, the Liberal Party got 49 per cent of the primary votes. The ALP had a seven per cent drop from March to 33 per cent of the primary votes. That is a 16 per cent difference between the two parties on primary votes. This is in the seat of Lindsay—a Labor heartland. In the two-party preferred votes, it is not much better. It was 56 per cent for the Libs and 43 per cent for
        <break page="4619" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the ALP. So there was a 13 per cent gap there.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bottom line is that there was a five per cent swing to the Liberal Party even though Ross Free, the previous member, should at least have had a very high profile. I think the problem was that his profile was such that people knew how incompetent he was in terms of what he did for the electorate. They saw more of him during the election campaign than they had seen in the last 10 years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at the vote for the Democrats. It fell from 6.4 per cent in March to 1.67 per cent. It is a terrible shame there are no Democrats in the chamber now. That is a miserable 1,179 votes alone. That is a few big families. If you have a few big families, you have the whole of the Democrat vote. The Democrats were out-polled by the Shooters Party, the AAFI, Call to Australia, the anti-airport candidate and the Greens. It is the lowest vote on record that I can find for the Democrats in a by-election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The last by-election the Democrats ran in I think was Warringah. If my memory serves me correctly, they got something like 16 per cent of the votes in Warringah. In Mackellar, they got six per cent. When we go back a few years to Menzies, four or five years ago, they got around 20 per cent. This is a disastrous vote for the Democrats. Over the last 14 or 15 years it is the worst vote I can find.

        What does this mean? What is the message from all this? Clearly, it is a reaffirmation of the directions that the Howard government is taking.

        On the Friday before the by-election I received information from an impeccable source, which was subsequently confirmed, that the ALP government under Bob Carr was planning to stop the issuing of firearm licences and would not recommence issuing them until the new year. This meant that, where those licences expired, they would not be renewable until some vague time in the distant future. This was correct and was supported by Shooters Party MLC John Tingle, who said:

         —Tonight I rise to address an issue which is of more importance and certainly more significance to a group of people in the area of Broken Hill. Yesterday they held a memorial service for the miners who lost their lives on the Line of Lode. So far 704 names have been recorded. Many more are known to have died there and their names are yet to be recorded.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a project that is being conducted with local support from the Line of Lode Association and the Broken Hill Family and Sports Picnic Committee. Architectural students from the University of South Australia have created a design for a memorial which will sit on top of the highest peak of the Line of Lode. The memorial will overlook the city, the railway station, the town hall and the post
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         office. It will provide a stark and moving reminder to everybody who visits that city and that community that mining is an extremely dangerous occupation. To date, we know of 704 people who have died on the Line of Lode, including two whose bodies have never been recovered from the mine and whose resting place is in the mine itself.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I say that there are many more names to be recorded because I learnt yesterday from talking to the officials that, in the early days, if somebody was injured on the Line of Lode they were removed to hospital or to their home for their final care. So their death ensued away from the Line of Lode and was not recorded as a death on the line; it was recorded as a death somewhere else. Officials are now having to go through a lot of the history and the records of the community to try to ascertain the names of all those who have lost their lives in this industry. I would guess that from the time when the mine first started there will be many names that will never ever be recorded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was a very moving and fitting time to hold this memorial service: it was held in conjunction with the family sports and picnic day. It is a reminder of the poignancy, the care and the love in these mining communities. It is a reminder of the importance to these mining communities of the traditions of mining and their awareness of the dangers that go with mining that, at a family sports and picnic day, people actually take the time to hold a memorial service. There to provide the music and the hymn singing was the Victorian Welsh Male Voice Choir. They, of course, also appreciated from their ancestral roots the importance and the traditions of mining. They sang two very beautiful hymns and songs:
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Amazing Grace
        </emphasis>
        and
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         I am a Working Man
        </emphasis>
        . That song, for those who do not know it, is about someone who values seeing the light of day as they are actually able to leave the pit. They remember their colleagues who do not get to leave the pit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to send my best wishes to everybody who is involved with the project to set up this memorial to those who have lost their lives. I am sure that my fellow colleagues here would like to do so as well and
        <break page="4622" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         recognise the significance of this dangerous occupation and that this memorial will be an important milestone. When it is built it will be an important symbol which will stand over the city. Those who know Broken Hill will appreciate that the dumps and tailings stand very high as a permanent reminder that mining is a dangerous occupation, but having a monument that will stand out and be visible for many miles around will, of course, be an ever present reminder to the people there that this is a dangerous occupation. It will be an ever present reminder to anybody visiting the area that mining is a very dangerous occupation. The monument will also ensure that, for those people who go there, industrial occupational health and safety issues will always be of the utmost significance.

        To those people who were involved in the memorial service and to those families which have lost loved ones on the Line of Lode, I extend my condolences and thoughts. I really did appreciate that memorial service. I appreciated the fact that the unveiling of the plans for the memorial was conducted by the grand daughter of someone who lost their life on the Line of Lode and by someone who had been involved with the University of South Australia School of Architecture in designing the memorial. To all those involved, I wish you well. I found it a very moving tribute. I found the camaraderie and the friendship that existed in that community—in spite of the tribulations and the trials that they have had to live through—very rewarding as well. I wish them all the best.

         —In the past I have risen to honour the memory of many of Australia's finest economists, the last one being a highly respected statistician. Tonight I would like to spend a moment of the Senate's time reflecting on the extraordinary life of Sir Roland Wilson—arguably Australia's finest statistician—who, sadly, at a great age, passed away last Thursday.

        Roland Wilson will long be remembered as one who made an exceptional contribution to Australia in the field of applied economics. He was a man of remarkable intellect and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         independence of thought, who was never afraid to speak his mind. These attributes sometimes brought him into conflict with his peers and colleagues, but they also brought innumerable benefits to the field of economics here in Australia.

        It gives me great pleasure to highlight the fact that such a distinguished economist was born and bred in my home state of Tasmania. In fact, he was born in Ulverstone, a beautiful little town of some 11,000 people on the central north&amp;hyphen;west coast. After being educated at Devonport High School, Sir Roland gained his first degree—Bachelor of Commerce—at the University of Tasmania. He eventually returned to the University of Tasmania to lecture in economics after undertaking studies at Oxford University as Tasmania's Rhodes scholar. May I add that Sir Roland Wilson was actually the first boy from a Tasmanian government high school to win such an award.

         Canberra Times
        </emphasis>
        reported yesterday, it was the entry into the Public Service which caused considerable friction on one occasion because he was recruited as a professional statistician at a time when doctors and lawyers were the only graduates in the Public Service. Bringing a new academic discipline to the job, his new colleagues at the statistician's office were incensed at the threat his appointment posed to their job security. Remembering this was in 1932, during the depths of the depression, those in the statistician's office were very much afraid that their jobs were on the line. People usually started at the bottom of the ladder as an inkwell filler or messenger boy, not as a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics. They decided to go on strike for a day to make their point. However, to their honour, it was these same colleagues who, four years later, were the first to congratulate him when he was appointed Commonwealth Statistician and Economic Adviser to the Treasury, the youngest man ever to hold that position. They now endorsed him as the best person for that position.

         Once Australia became involved in World War II, he was appointed to establish the Department of Labour and National Service and he became its head. Following the war, he served the United Nations as Chairman of the Economic and Employment Commission. This appointment came just four years after the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. It is interesting to note in passing that his death occurred on the day observed by all around the world as United Nations day.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a consequence of these appointments, his time as Australia's Chief Statistician was fragmented. Finally, in 1951 he was appointed Secretary to the Treasury, a position he held until his retirement in 1966. This was not the end of his career, as he served both the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and Qantas as chairman until the mid&amp;hyphen;1970s. This distinguished Australian provided a model for all public servants in his unstinting and selfless commitment to the good government of our country. Even in his retirement, although never one to mince words, he refused to speak out publicly on economic policy and practice.

          So what appears to have happened is this: rumours  circulate that there was a potential conflict of interest in OGIA, the minister's office rings and gets those confirmed and then apparently briefs a senator or senators in the coalition who come into this parliament and dump on this particular officer. Who speaks for that officer is the question I ask? As ministers, your first requirement is to defend your department and the officers in the department. It is not to have them slandered in this particular chamber. Your job as a minister and Minister Jull's job is to defend his own.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If it is ever proved that Minister Jull's office initiated these defamatory statements in the Senate, he should give the game away. It would be one of the greatest betrayals by a minister I have ever seen if that is the case. I ask Mr Jull here in this chamber to deny whether his office passed the information on to Senator O'Chee.

This choice is reinforced in briefing sessions for homeowners and set out in more detail in the Homeowner Manual provided at briefings on the scheme. Current arrangements are that homeowners are given product description sheets for approved products which also contain contact details for manufacturers and display centre locations. The homeowner is requested to choose between alternative products prior to the visit to the home by the Project's technical staff at which the scope of works setting out insulation treatments is prepared.

       (1) The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (JCFADT) recommendation was to the previous government, which responded that while it agreed that such a centre would be useful, in the fiscal climate at that time the Government was unable to commit itself to a significant long&amp;hyphen;term budget obligation to develop a human rights centre.

       (2) The present Government is committed to encouraging the establishment of a Centre for Democratic Institutions which will focus on the promotion of democracy and assist in the promotion of human rights in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. However, as the activities of such a centre would not necessarily qualify as Official Development Assistance (ODA), a requirement for AusAID support, Mr Downer has therefore tasked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to develop detailed proposals for the Centre. This work is currently under way.
