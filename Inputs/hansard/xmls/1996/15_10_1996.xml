        —by leave—Last Thursday, 10 October, I made a brief statement to the Senate in respect of certain shares I held jointly with my wife in several Australian public companies. I must now inform the Senate that I have inadvertently misled the chamber. In response to Senator Sherry's motion concerning potential conflicts of interest I stated:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       I can assure the Senate that I have had no conflict of interest during the last six months, nor do I expect one to occur.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the time I made this statement I believed it to be true. However, since Thursday my staff and the Department of the Treasury have been double&amp;hyphen;checking all the administrative matters that have been processed through my office in the past seven months. As you would appreciate, Madam President, there has been a very large number of matters.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Yesterday, my staff discovered a minor administrative action that I processed in late June, which I must now bring to the attention of the Senate. I would like to take a moment to explain what the matter was.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The Australian Securities Commission had received an application from a company, Boral Energy (Vic) Pty Ltd, seeking a declaration that it could be included in the Victorian electricity exempt futures market which had been created by the former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, in May last year.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       An exempt futures market status is intended for specialist futures markets which are for professional, specialist investors only. Applications to the Australian Securities Commission are assessed against criteria set out in its policy statement No. 70. As I said, the Victorian electricity exempt futures market was created in May 1995 when 12 electricity companies were declared exempt by the then Attorney&amp;hyphen;General. On 27 September last year,
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        two more participants were included in that list.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In a memorandum dated 25 June this year, Treasury recommended that I approve a recommendation from the ASC that Boral Energy (Vic) Pty Ltd be declared exempt; that is, that the company be allowed to participate in the Victorian electricity exempt futures market.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The futures market is about participants hedging their risks. All participants in this exempt market are professional energy companies. The Victorian market is a precursor to the establishment of a national electricity market, which is expected to become operative next year. I accepted the Treasury's and the ASC's advice and signed the declaration on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Costello).
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As the Senate is aware, in June this year I held shares in Boral Ltd. The particular company, Boral Energy (Vic) Pty Ltd, is a related company to Boral. Six months earlier, my wife and I sold a significant volume of shares we held, including a number of Boral shares, for the purpose of financing an investment property. The details of those sales were included in my notification to the Registrar of Senators' Interests on 19 January this year.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Unfortunately, when the memorandum was placed in front of me for consideration, my memory was that my wife and I had sold all our Boral shares; and I acted on that basis. I was wrong to do so. I should not have signed the declaration and I should have passed it to the Treasurer for action.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is of little comfort to say that I regret my action. My failure to act on this matter, in accordance with accepted procedure, was not a deliberate attempt to advance my private interests. Indeed, there can be no question of putting private interests before public duty as, in this case, my duty was to grant Boral Energy the relevant declaration. By doing so, competition in the market for electricity was increased. The decision was one recommended to me by both the market regulator, the ASC, and the policy department, the Treasury. I accepted that advice and acted accordingly.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Nevertheless, I consider integrity to be of the utmost importance and the course of
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        action I should follow has been quite clear. While there was no intended impropriety on my part, it is clear to me that these circumstances could be perceived to constitute a conflict of interest and my failure to act accordingly necessitates the action I have taken.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       My error was found only yesterday and I notified the Treasurer immediately. Further checks were undertaken to confirm my mistake. Once those processes had been properly completed, I took the only honourable action possible. I now wish to inform the Senate that, with the greatest regret, yesterday evening I tendered to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) my resignation as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. This morning, the Prime Minister informed me that he had accepted my resignation.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Madam President, I have always declared my private interests to the Senate. Unlike many other employees, my superannuation from past employment was largely in shares. These shares were held jointly with my wife and were purchased long before I came to this place. They were always intended to provide income for us during retirement.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       While my circumstances will be judged by others in the days ahead, and I stand ready to accept the inevitable criticism of my actions that will undoubtedly follow, I would hope that my example will demonstrate the need in Australia for the establishment of a system of blind trusts to support executive officers of government, statutory officer holders, members of the judiciary and others. A blind trust places an individual's assets at arm's length while they hold public office.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people who have helped me in the last seven months. I thank my staff, the departmental people from the business law division of Treasury, who have been excellent to me, and the ASC and its commissioners. I particularly thank the Treasurer and the Prime Minister for their assistance and help. Australia is in good hands. I commend their actions. I commend them for their assistance and their trust in me for the past seven months. I inadvertently misled the Senate and I extend my unreserved apologies to senators.

Senator Troeth, let us look at what the special auditor found. Nineteen per cent of all organisations funded by ATSIC were in serious breach of grant conditions. Sixty organisations which received $27.8 million in their last ATSIC grant should be declared not fit and proper and defunded—and that was in your time. Mr Melham said it was a huge tick, a huge clearance of $27.8 million. Tell that to the battlers in Banks—that $27.8 million is a huge tick. I am pleased that he is not in control of the banks.

The special auditor has found a further 184 organisations were in such serious breach of grant condi tions that they require immediate and close attention.

         Today is the first World Rural Women's Day.

The date was selected to create a synergy with World Food Day tomorrow, 16 October. World Rural Women's Day recognises rural women, including those who are small farmers and entrepreneurs, who manage much of our natural resources, create jobs across the whole economy, produce most of our food and care for the next generation.

As far as I can ascertain, even with the much vaunted quota of the Labor Party, it does not have one woman representing a rural electorate.

         independent Australian research program. The government will allocate $4.5 million over five years to fund this program. The cost of the program will be fully offset by a small increase in radiocommunications licence fees to commence in November 1996. The government has been developing this radiofrequency electromagnetic energy program for some months. We have taken into account community representations and the results of an independent community awareness survey, which was conducted by AGB McNair on the basis of a consultancy awarded by the Department of Communications and the Arts on 19 July last. We have also taken account of the recommendations of the Senate majority report on the proposed sale of part of Telstra, together with international developments and other pertinent issues.

        There is still a need, however, for further research and to provide information to the public. The rapid development of communications technology and improved scientific research and interpretation techniques ensure that there are always issues warranting further investigation. The government's commitment to the RF EME program therefore ensures that the health and safety of Australian citizens and residents are not compromised by developments in communications. The government's program represents a measured and sensible approach designed to ensure that Australians continue to enjoy the benefits of new communications technology and infrastructure, while addressing any public concerns about possible health effects.

In other words, the government has been well and truly aware that there are people who will continue to suggest that there might be problems even though there is no evidence to support that. On that basis, we thought it was about time that we ensured that a scientific assessment was made that was independent of the players who might be involved in the construction of towers and other facilities.

         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer to Minister Moore's portfolio responsibility for the computer bounty. Is it not true that three of the companies in which Bligh Ventures has a substantial holding are in receipt of computer bounty funding—that is, RSM Research, which received $24,200 in 1995-96; Elpro Technologies, which received $36,900; and JTEC, which received $1,102,400? Is it not true that, of the five bounties axed in the budget, only the computer bounty was continued beyond budget night—that is, until June 1997? Why did the computer bounty get such special treatment? How can this possibly be a decision that does not in any way relate to the activities of Bligh Ventures?

Mr Moore has made it very clear that he is not aware of any investments made by Bligh Ventures up to the end of the 12-month period until he has read the annual report.

Minister Moore has made it very clear that he has no idea what particular companies that company invests in. It is a venture capital company; it acts as a minority shareholder. Until the annual report comes out, Minister Moore has no idea as to what they have invested in over what period of time. I also repeat the fact—

       Could I suggest that, if Senator Schacht wants to question every minister and parliamentary secretary who may have shares, he should perhaps take the trouble to call them privately just to see how many they have. I would have been happy to say that I have one share. Perhaps the senators' register should enable senators to reveal the fact that they only have one.

         —Thank you, Madam President. I have moved the motion in the terms that I have outlined to the Senate. What we have had demonstrated over the past two weeks of the parliamentary sittings is that the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct is in tatters. The Prime Minister of this country gave a solemn pledge to greater integrity in government, to higher standards of ministerial conduct, to the highest moral standards possible. That was Mr Howard's pledge before he was elected. Already one minister and one parliamentary secretary have resigned, and other ministers of this government are unable, or unwilling, to answer questions about their own ministerial conflict of interest.

        Mr Howard is the Prime Minister who has pontificated like no other Prime Minister in Australian political history about his written code. There has never been a Prime Minister who has waxed so lyrical about his ministerial standards and his ministerial code. He has now admitted that his code is no more than a consolidation of the standards that applied under Labor. What we have is a prime ministerial code of conduct that has been exposed as a sham, as meaningless and as a hoax. It has been exposed as a fraud both on the parliament and on the Australian people. It was nothing more than another electoral bribe from Mr Howard; it was nothing more than another non&amp;hyphen;core promise from the coalition government.

        We had Senator Short defending in this chamber his conflict of interest and defending the fact that he held shares.

It was Senator Short who self&amp;hyphen;immolated after being exposed by Senator Sherry's notice of motion and forced by the Labor opposition in this chamber to make an explanation of his behaviour. It was the Labor Party and the media that brought Senator Short undone.

        Then we had Senator Gibson. The situation with Senator Gibson is no different. The only difference you can ascertain is that at least Senator Short did try in this chamber to justify his actions. When I moved a motion yesterday, when I indicated that we would give Senator Gibson leave before the Senate to explain his actions before the Senate, he squibbed it. It was the most pea hearted and cowardly performance that we have seen from an office holder of the federal government, probably in the history of this place. He absolutely squibbed it. His behaviour was no different from Senator Short's and, finally, reluctantly, he has been dragged kicking and screaming to the ministerial and parliamentary secretarial cemetery, along with Senator Short.

        after the election—with those of 10 October 1996 when this matter was raised. At the top, ANZ shares are listed. I believe he had something like 6,360 shares. On 5 March 1996 they were worth $6.54 and on 10 October 1996 they were worth $7.28; in other words, they had risen by 74c a share. But now let us look at the rest of Senator Short's portfolio and see where those gains were. The next on the list is BHP. On 5 March 1996 those shares were worth $19.23 and on 10 October they were worth $16.12, a drop of $3.11 each—and where did anyone over that side, right down to the Democrats, mention that loss that Senator Short had of $3.11 per share?

No, they only mentioned the ANZ that went the other way. Let us go down one more. Boral has been mentioned in this Senate today. On 5 March 1996 those shares were worth $3.66 and on 10 October they were worth $3.30, which is—36c per share. Were they mentioned? No, the only ones mentioned were the ANZ ones that happened to go the other way.

He has a share to sell that you can probably buy off market for some sort of price and between you, you might be able to say that you have invested in Australia.

        The Greens have jumped on the bandwagon too. Yesterday I got a call from the media asking me, `Do you hold Wesfarmers shares?' `Yes.' `Do you intend to take part in the debate?' `No.' `Do you intend to vote in the debate?' `Yes.' `Do you intend to declare your shares?' `Yes.' And then they said, `How many have you got?' And my answer of course was, `None of your business.' That is how the Greens tried to jump on the bandwagon, as they always do at the last moment.

         —Reflecting on Senator Panizza's contribution a couple of days ago in defence of Senator Short, how a few days in politics makes a big difference! Last Thursday morning when the notice of motion was debated I highlighted that Senator Short was the Assistant Treasurer and Senator Gibson was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the economic minister and assistant minister, respectively, in the Senate responsible for economic matters, dealing with legislation and a range of specific portfolio duties.

        Unfortunately, I do not think Senator Panizza has been listening to the debate and the questions over the last four or five days because the central issue here, as was highlighted last Thursday morning in the notice of motion that was subsequently passed, is the shares held by Senator Short and those held by Senator Gibson and the potential for conflict. We argue that in a number of areas actual conflict occurs between those shareholders and their responsibilities.

         In the case of Senator Short, Senator Panizza, it occurs with respect to administration of banking laws and insurance and superannuation matters as they related to the ANZ shares that he held. It may well be that the ANZ shares are the only shares to have gone up in value. I suspect that is the case, but I understand that one of the themes from your side of politics is that the share market has been booming since the election and you have all done very well. That is one of the themes you have been advancing.

         That is not the central issue; the central issue is the conflict of interest, the failure of a minister and now a parliamentary secretary to adhere to the guidelines laid down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)—not just laid down by the Prime Minister but debated in this chamber on a number of occasions in respect to Senator Herron and Mr Anderson. Senator Short and Senator Gibson found themselves—because of their shareholdings—in direct conflict with decisions they had made.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of both Senator Short and Senator Gibson I have made the point that it is very difficult for a minister or parliament secretary, particularly in the economic portfolio area, to directly own any form of shares. Certainly, the conflict of interest was highlighted with the ANZ Bank. We have not yet had an explanation from Senator Gibson as to why he has decided to sell his shares in the Bank of Melbourne and the NAB and whether or not any decisions were taken that conflicted with his responsibilities in relation to cheques and bills of exchange.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What Senator Gibson's resignation highlights today in the Senate is the conflict that occurred in respect to another shareholding, Boral, and the decision he took in respect to, he says, a minor administrative matter in his capacity in dealing with companies and securities. This highlights the difficulty that economic ministers and parliamentary secretaries have in directly holding shares and the conflict of interest that can occur. That is the central point in this issue.

          The issue is not how many shares they own, what they are worth or whether we have shares over this side but the clear guidelines that were laid down by the Prime Minister. He set the benchmark. He set the bar that Senator Short and Senator Gibson have now tripped over—at waist height. Now Mr Howard apparently wants to revisit these guidelines, according to information from the party room this morning. He should have thought about this issue when the guidelines were laid down.

So all of the people on the other side, even though they are not now on the front bench of government, have an impact on the way the markets operate. So perhaps we should be a little more circumspect about just what the Labor Party people now have. We know that when they were in government they were not very keen on disclosing too much at all.

This was at a time when he was administering the tax acts and the taxation office. Why did he not resign? Because that is the standard the Labor Party brings into public office. Did Senator Evans or his children buy shares in the Commonwealth Bank float? Tell me about Mrs Lawrence.

         —This mess is entirely the making of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). This matter was first raised in the Senate on 6 May this year in regard to Minister Herron's desire to be a part-time minister for Aboriginal affairs and, in his own words, `a weekend hobby surgeon'. Senator Herron revealed for the first time in response to a question from me concerning that double role that a deadline had been set for 27 May to comply with the code which had been tabled in parliament with great fanfare by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives and by his representative Senator Hill in the Senate on the first day of sitting, 30 April. Much was made of the code.

        Senator Herron said that it was a matter for the Prime Minister to decide and he had made an appointment to see him. He said, `The Prime Minister is the boss and I will accept his decision.' When the same matter was raised by Mr Beazley the following day in the House, the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is true that the ministerial guide, as tabled, requires statements of pecuniary interest to be made to me by 27 May. I expect that there will be 100 per cent compliance with that request, that I will have the statements of pecuniary interest by 27 May.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later in the same response the Prime Minister said:

        The guidelines that were laid down in this document will be complied with in full.

        The clear implication from the Prime Minister was that he would ensure compliance with his code. He informed the House that he had told the minister for Aboriginal affairs that he would not be allowed to continue as a weekend hobby surgeon and would be a full-time minister.

        Clearly, there were then no further checks made by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is now attempting to turn attention away from himself and his ministers are now falling at the rate of knots. In answer to Mr Beazley's first question last week, 10 October, the Prime Minister said:

        The Prime Minister, in fact, was given more than three weeks clear notice before 27 May that the opposition would be pursuing this matter to ensure there was full compliance with his much vaunted guidelines. Clearly, given Senator Short's present circumstances, he failed to consult with any of them to ensure that, come 28 May, they were in compliance with what he is now describing as a guide on ministerial accountability and what

        The Prime Minister, in fact, has been tiptoeing through a minefield that he himself planted. He is the one who should be held directly responsible for this mess. He tabled the code in parliament; he boasted about it; he was given three weeks warning in May that it was going to be an issue that would be pursued; he said there would be full compliance. Six months later a number of ministers and parliamentary secretaries—still today, as we speak—do not comply with the code. That seems to be a point, Senator Panizza, with the greatest respect, that is lost.

I would hesitate to say that if both Senator Gibson and Senator Short had been members of a Labor government they would still be ministers.

Take Ros Kelly, for example, when she was minister for the environment. How long did it take Ros Kelly to admit that she had rorted the system and resign? It took months and months of questioning, denying and being protected by the then Prime Minister. Eventually the weight of public pressure was so strong that we saw the demise of Ros Kelly.

He was using this as an investment for his future retirement. I do not expect anybody should have to divest all of their shareholdings when they come into this place. But understand—even you, Senator Collins, agree—that a blind trust or some other way is the way to go.

The Senate may be interested to know that at one stage in the process Mr Morris actually voted against DDB Needham. Incidentally so did the member of Kooyong, Mr Georgiou. Later having seen both the advertising agencies AND the public relations companies' presentations the view of those two people and the committee as a whole was in favour of DDB Needham.

         We, the following petitioners strongly urge all senators to support Mr Kevin Andrews' bill to stop doctors being permitted to give lethal injections to their patients. Failure to support this bill will undermine the criminal code which protects all citizens. Voluntary Euthanasia, by targeting the sick and elderly, invariably progresses to involuntary euthanasia, (patient killing) permitting corruption and medical malpractice.

I am obviously doing likewise in that circumstance. It is for that reason that I take this action.

         I am pleased to table this report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the abolition of the development import finance facility, or DIFF scheme. DIFF was introduced into the Australian aid program by the Fraser coalition government in 1982. It combined grant funds and export credits to provide concessional loans for developing countries to finance high priority public sector development projects. The present government decided on 8 May this year to terminate the scheme from 1 July.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of continuing refinements to the scheme within Australia and stricter OECD guidelines for mixed credits, DIFF in 1996 bore little resemblance to the original scheme. DIFF was a development scheme with broad humanitarian objectives. By any definition, the overwhelming majority of DIFF projects
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          approved since the inception of the OECD's 1992 Helsinki rules could be classed as humanitarian aid. Many projects had a significant impact at local community level: for example, in education, renewable energy and environmental areas. It was, in fact, a very successful scheme.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An important secondary benefit of DIFF was that it enabled Australian companies to compete on an equal footing with foreign companies when vying for development projects. DIFF was not a subsidy to Australian business but extended to recipient countries terms which enabled them to consider Australian bids for development projects. Recently about 85 per cent of projects funded under the scheme were nominated by recipient countries and not by commercial interests. Projects reflected primarily the development priorities of those countries.
        </para>

         When the Australian government terminated DIFF, it decided not to proceed any further with 50 projects which had received a letter of advice but had not received a letter of formal offer. These projects had received formal notification from AusAID that they were of sufficient priority and met the general eligibility requirements but had still to pass certain formal appraisal processes. The overwhelming evidence presented to the committee suggested that companies and recipient governments regarded the letter of advice as indicating that, subject to a satisfactory completion of those appraisal processes, DIFF funding would be forthcoming. AusAID has assured the committee that, as DIFF operated, 70 per cent of projects with a letter of advice proceeded to completion.

         The committee believes that the decision not to proceed with these projects represents the narrowest possible legalistic approach to the termination of DIFF. It took no account of Asian business culture based upon development of relationships, trust and commitments. It ignored the pleas of senior ministers of recipient countries not to scrap particular projects. It took no account of considerable investments made by recipient countries, sometimes at the direct request of the Australian government. And it dealt a serious blow

         The termination of DIFF has had an adverse impact not only on the communities affected but also on Australia's standing as a provider of humanitarian relief to developing countries. The committee noted that the government has acknowledged the continuing need for concessional finance to support the massive infrastructure needs of developing countries in the region, citing a figure of $US1.5 trillion for infrastructure needs in South&amp;hyphen;East and East Asia in the next decade.

         In the next five years alone developing countries in the region will require $US8.5 billion for pollution and emission controls and $US7 billion for water and sanitation each year. These are the very areas on which DIFF projects were concentrating. The committee finds the government's decision to terminate not only the DIFF scheme itself but also specific projects in the pipeline to be inexplicable and inconsistent with its own rhetoric.

         The decision has had a severe impact on many Australian companies, which have lost projects worth $1.3 billion. The short&amp;hyphen;sighted nature of the decision to terminate DIFF can be seen in the fact that one New South Wales company alone will lose $110 million of export earnings in order to help the government save $70 million this year by terminating DIFF. The government has created an export `black hole'.

         Although a few big name players appear on the list of Australian companies involved in DIFF, most companies involved were small to medium sized enterprises—many of these subcontracted to 50 or more other companies. They will now no longer be able to employ additional staff as anticipated. Some will have to lay off staff. Many companies had invested large sums in particular projects, and considerable time and resources. These investments have now been lost.

         Vying for a DIFF contract entailed commercial risk. There was often strong competition from other Australian and overseas companies.

          What cannot be construed in any possible way as commercial risk was the government's arbitrary decision to terminate DIFF. DIFF was the basis on which all of the projects were negotiated and implemented. Without DIFF, Australian companies could not even get to the negotiating table.

         DIFF enabled Australian companies to win follow&amp;hyphen;on business in important developing markets.

In many cases DIFF was instrumental in establishing a market presence and earning credibility for a company which was then able to win further, fully commercial contracts. These opportunities will now be lost.

         In conclusion, the committee found that DIFF was an important and effective element in Australia's aid program, which delivered significant humanitarian benefits to developing countries. It also assisted Australian companies by enabling them to compete on equal terms with overseas companies for development projects. Its abrupt termination has damaged our relationships with regional countries, undermined Australia's standing as a provider of humanitarian relief and compromised our commercial credibility in the region.

          The minority report acknowledges the significance of the DIFF scheme as a tied concessional aid scheme delivering aid into Asian markets. Government members accept overwhelmingly the evidence received from Australian companies in support of commercial benefits that flowed to individual com panies from DIFF funding. Evidence was given of the export opportunities and internationalisation of Australian businesses and the opportunities for the development of technology. Expert evidence confirmed the Australian scheme had been tightened up to meet its aid objectives, with 85 per cent of aid being at the instigation of foreign countries following the implementation of the Helsinki report. Evidence was also accepted by all committee members that the government had signalled the end of the DIFF scheme prior to the 2 March election.

         As contained in the report, the announcement to terminate the scheme was made on 8 May 1996. The minister received advice on the termination and, in accordance with the advice, announced that the government would fund projects with companies that held formal offers and earmarked funds for that purpose.

They will be struggling now to re-establish that trust because, whether we like it or not, in those countries what the government does is seen as what the private sector is committed to as well.

Those Australian companies that have letters of advice telling them that they can proceed to the next commercial phase should get final letters of approval. If there is that attrition and fallout rate it will be done fairly. It will not be done by ministerial fiat. It will be done with well established rules. They will be filtered out according to the traditions of the scheme. That is absolutely important.

        —I am delighted to be able to take part in this debate. Coming from the state of Tasmania, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, you would know the importance of the forest industry and what these new regulations mean to the ordinary men and women of rural and regional Tasmania and its townships—such as Burnie, Smithton, Triabunna and now even Bridgewater, where the new mill is operated by the Briggs family.

       I am astounded that the Australian Labor Party are joining forces with the Greens on this matter. Indeed, the CFMEU—the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union—have told the people of Australia what they think of the ALP's actions in backing the Greens' motion. They have described it variously as a `sad joke' and as the ALP having `learnt nothing from its previous mismanagement of forest policy'. Mr Smith, the spokesman for this union, said:

       But of course the downside is that we would not have the capacity for three-year grants of licences. The union then went on to make a very perceptive comment. They suggested to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, that it would be best if he:

       That is the view of the CFMEU. The fact is that they have got it absolutely right. Those opposite know that this union on this occasion got the facts absolutely right when they said that the Australian Labor Party would remain in opposition because of this.

       It may be of interest to honourable senators to note the comments made by Gary Gray, the national secretary of the ALP; Barry Jones, the national president of the ALP; and Senator Sue Mackay. They delivered a report on the 2 March 1996 election to the Labor Party faithful in August this year. In that document, under the heading `Priorities/balance' the first issue they raised was `Woodchips, jobs and environment'. What did these people say about their own party? They said:

       The ALP report was not the only one to recognise the fact that the Labor Party stance on woodchips cost them a lot of votes at the last election—the New South Wales presentation also made the same comment. Under the broad heading `Campaign' and the subheading `Strategy', some perceptive comments were made by Terry Sheahan, the president of the New South Wales branch of the ALP and the chair of the federal election consultative committee, and Chris Raper, the vice-president of the New South Wales branch of the ALP.

       If you recall, the Carmen Lawrence incident was a situation where a minister of the Crown had been found to have lied under oath, and she was allowed to retain her ministerial commission.

       The ALP in New South Wales put woodchipping into the same category as the Carmen Lawrence and Ros Kelly affairs. Why? Because what the Labor Party was doing was blatantly and utterly dishonest and of no benefit to the workers that they allegedly represent. To a certain extent, I suppose I ought be cheerful and thank the ALP for once again selling out the workers to enable us to continue to garner the support of the blue-collar workers in seats such as Patterson and others in New South Wales and in Victoria.

       What we really need is an understanding of the benefits of these new regulations. It is all about security of resource. What will be the benefit of this security of resource?

But coming from the state of Tasmania, I know the game they play. Wesley Vale—they opposed it. They then formed a Green&amp;hyphen;Labor accord government, and a project that was destined for the Huon in my home state was bought out with taxpayers' money to ensure that there would not be a use and harnessing of the resources.

        Let us have a look at what has really been happening. The general uncertainty over forest policy in this country has had a massively destabilising impact on investment in this important industry. We frequently hear of literally billions of dollars of investment which would flow, in the main, to rural and regional areas—creating much needed em ployment—if there was greater security over resource supply to the forest based industries.

       These problems are to be addressed through the establishment of regional forest agreements which, in addition to establishing a comprehensive, adequate and representative—CAR—forest reserve system, will provide the basis for an internationally competitive, ecologically sustainable, value adding, native forest based industry. Woodchips have been the public face of the forest debate in this country for many years. The arrangements under which they are exported—like it or not—are fundamental to the investment equation.

       The massive damage done to the timber industry last year by Labor's foolhardy two-stage licensing system should not be underestimated. The two&amp;hyphen;stage licensing process resulted in key customers sourcing part of their needs from other suppliers because there was no guarantee they could secure supplies beyond the 80 per cent allowed in the first-stage licence. The customers never came back, nor did the jobs. The security which will be provided by the three-year licences under the new regulations will help our exporters restore Australia's credibility as a reliable supplier with obvious flow-ons for regional employment.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The new regulations made by this government provide greater security for the timber industry in a number of ways. Firstly, they restore the licence volume stripped without any logical policy justification last year and, with it, hundreds of jobs. Secondly, they recognise the reality of native forest logging operations in this country—that they are driven by the need to provide logs for the sawmilling and value adding sector.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       While a substantial proportion of the logs harvested are not of milling quality, good management practice in many of our forests demands that logging residues are removed so that the forests can regenerate. The alternative to removing the pulpwood is to burn it or leave it to rot on the forest floor. Both of these actions have negative environmental impacts and they just do not make economic sense.

        What makes sense is for this wood to be sold to help pay the wages of logging and haulage contractors, sawmill workers and other people employed directly and indirectly in the industry. Senator Lees, in her speech on the second reading of the Native Forest Protection Bill, made the point:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . export woodchipping enables the native forest industry to spread its costs over a wider base and without this native forest logging would not continue in many areas.

        What Senator Lees was conceding was that the harvesting and supply of pulpwood is an integral part of an integrated, value&amp;hyphen;adding native forest based industry. Indeed, the production of woodchips is, in itself, a value&amp;hyphen;adding activity. The value added is the difference between selling the wood for export and leaving it to waste and rot on the forest floor or simply to be burnt.

        These regulations also deliver specific benefits to sawmill operators. For the first time we have a licence category which applies to sawmill residues. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, coming from Tasmania, will recall how the Greens used to beat their chests in Tasmania and say, `You've got to look after the small sawmillers; they are the ones who are hurting.' Well, the small sawmillers support these export wood regulations, don't they? They think they are a great idea.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But where are the Greens embracing the sawmillers now? They cannot be seen anywhere because the bluff of the Greens has been called. We as a government have recognised the importance of looking after the small sawmillers and the Greens want to shut them down as well, once the pressure is put on. We have applied the blowtorch to their bellies and now they come out and say that these sawmill residues should not be allowed to be sold; in other words, the small sawmillers ought to be thrown on the economic scrap heap.

        All processing operations, including sawmills, produce waste material. If they are not certain they can dispose of the waste, for example by selling it as woodchips, the viability of their operation is undermined.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         When we look at value&amp;hyphen;added forest industry investment proposals, the capacity to dispose of waste economically is a critical factor in the final decision as to whether the investment goes ahead. If the only outlet for these woodchips is a massively oversupplied domestic market, the investment must be at risk as will, as a result, job opportunities and the lifeblood of a lot of our small towns throughout regional Australia.

        The current woodchip export licences contain conditions which require exporters to source woodchips from sawmills as a first preference. Surely the Greens must applaud that but, no, they do not. They want to dispose of these regulations. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has confirmed that these conditions will be retained in new licences, giving added strength to our commitment to value adding and job creation. These regulations ensure exporters will seek out sawmills as their first priority source of woodchip.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Additionally, the one million tonne category under which sawmill residues may be exported also covers silvicultural thinnings, the wood produced from thinning regrowth forests to improve their future sawlog yield. We thought the Greens and the Labor Party were all in favour of plantations but the Greens are attempting to overthrow today in the Senate even those regulations that will assist plantations. So their commitment is not to plantations, just as it is not to sawmills.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Giving special treatment to silvicultural thinnings will result in the industry having at its disposal in the future a wood resource that provides a higher proportion of the high quality logs ideally suited to value adding. Many people in Australia would be surprised to learn that we as a country run up a $2 billion deficit in wood products. In other words, the amount of wood product we export is exceeded by $2 billion by the amount we import. There is a trade deficit in wood products.

        What these regulations are trying to do is allow us to export some of our waste to repair that imbalance. More importantly, the three&amp;hyphen;year licensing will provide resource security. Once that resource security is there, people

        Yesterday Senator Brown attempted to intimidate me into abstaining from voting on his motion because of a token holding in both Boral and North Ltd. Both companies are involved in resource development and have subsidiaries in timber harvesting. North is essentially a mining company. I do not hold any ministerial or executive position, and my holding is fractional in relation to the capitalisation of both companies. The capitalisation of those companies, I remind the Senate, runs into tens of millions of dollars. So the opportunity for exploitation or profit by me in my vote on this issue is absolutely minuscule. Therefore, I think that objectivity has to be brought into this debate. On the other hand, I do abhor the intimidatory tactics of you, Senator Brown, on this issue.

Unfortunately, there is little market for them. This residue can be left to rot or sent up in smoke, as my colleague Senator Abetz said, in order to clear the forest floor for further plantations.

        —I should declare my interest in this debate for the information of other honourable senators. I am currently the state president of the forest division of the CFMEU in Tasmania. I guess I would be able to lay claim to representing one of the most important stakeholders in this debate: the workers in the industry. From that point of view, it is clear where I am coming from. I am totally committed to a prosperous industry and to the workers of the industry. I guess my record will attest to that. I will approach this debate from a significantly different approach and objective to that of Senator Brown.

       I can say that these regulations do nothing to alleviate that problem. These regulations are, in some respect, no different from those which previously applied. They are iniquitous and they weaken the previous criteria for downstream processing in this country. A key objective of any regulations or other regulatory measures ought to be to improve things, to bring about a better industry—one that maximises the utilisation of a very valuable resource and enhances the employment and wealth generating opportunities for the people of this country.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Of course, it should go without saying that regulations should and must take account of environmental requirements. These proposed regulations achieve none of these things. All the government has done is increase the ceiling—or, in fact, not have a ceiling—and substantially weaken the downstream processing aspects of the previous regulations. It has broadened the interpretations, particularly as they relate to degraded forests and other environmental aspects, such that they are almost meaningless.

       I just want to take some time to remind the Senate of what is happening in the industry and what has happened to date. If you look at the history of my home state of Tasmania, on which I can probably speak with more authority than any other state, you will find that we had an industry that developed primarily as a sawmilling industry. Sawmills were supplied with sawlogs that were taken out of forests essentially on a selective logging program. They were set up to cut very high quality timber.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        What happened in the mid&amp;hyphen; to late 1970s was that they realised that because they did not have the technology and the equipment to access some of the then remaining areas of high quality forests, they had to reduce significantly the volume of sawlog, particularly the category 1 sawlog, that was being supplied to the industry. They cut it by some 50 per cent. We then saw the introduction of woodchip licences, which were, at that time, designed to utilise what were residues from sawmilling operations, both in the form of head logs and the squaring of round timber.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That was a long time ago. We had two categories of sawlog in Tasmania—category 1 and category 2. We had veneer logs that were provided to the veneer industry. With the advent of woodchip licences and the export of woodchips, we have seen a dramatic increase over the years in the volume of timber taken from the forests of Tasmania. We have seen a decrease in the volume of sawlogs in category 1 and category 2 that are supplied to the industry. I think what has happened in my state is that the industry, particularly the Forestry Commission of Tasmania, has got itself caught in a situation where, because its revenue is generated from the sale of forest products, it is in a volume driven, revenue driven cycle.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you also look at the old industry—if I can describe it in that way—it never had the technology or the expertise to cut some timber species. There was a legitimate argument for exporting some of those species of trees that they could not cut or dry and process satisfactorily. The other realisation that hit some of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission people in the face—the people responsible for the management of the state's forests—was that they were taking out the best trees, they had degraded forests left, to some degree, and they really had no plantation or regeneration program of any real worth being put in place. So they decided that they would have to embark upon a silvicultural regime that led to clear&amp;hyphen;felling. In some areas, that has an application. I would argue that it has not been best applied, in many cases, in Tasmania. But all of those things added to the burden.
       </para>
       <break page="4180" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we just take one giant step forward to now, the reality is that not much has changed. We are still cutting down high volumes; we still have only two categories of sawlog in Tasmania—although some would argue that we have three; we now have a category 8, which is supposedly top end grade pulp logs. The other thing that has happened is that we now have the technology and the expertise to mill and process many of the species and types and qualities of logs that we once could not utilise simply because the technology and the expertise were not available. But it is now available.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we see is the continuation of sending to woodchip mills logs that should actually be utilised in a way that I think will both prolong and enhance the value of Tasmania's forests—and this can also have equal application particularly in the states of Victoria and New South Wales—and this country's forests. We will achieve far greater benefits from the point of view of both employment and wealth generated if we make some changes to what is currently the pathetic way in which the timber of this country is being utilised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look at how these regulations might go towards achieving that, I want to first go to the most recent regulations which were disallowed—the ones that operated when we were in government—and look at the requirements that were placed on applicants for woodchip licences. One particular aspect of the former regulations related to the applicant's commitment to value adding and processing activities in Australia, both now and in the future. That was designed to ensure that we started to focus, albeit in a very small way, on greater downstream processing in this country. I have listened to many members and senators say, `We want a pulp and paper mill in Australia. We want TPPC to build one, and we want this and we want that', and that government policy ought to reflect the opportunities and the stability to achieve that. I agree with that. But we do not see it in these regulations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I turn to the problems this country has with the commitment of major exporters to downstream processing. I can give some examples of what the major players have done in the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          past to get themselves into a position where they can comply with the requirements of obtaining an export licence. There is the case of North Broken Hill and the games that I believe they play in making announcements about their commitment to downstream processing. They have done this year in, year out. Yet we have seen no real change, no real commitment to downstream processing in this country.

We have a responsibility to the community as a whole to ensure that, if we have resources, benefits are maximised from them.

         By way of example I want to refer to a couple of press releases which were put out in late 1995 prior to the issuing of the 1996 licences. North Ltd issued one on 27 September 1995 headed `The pre&amp;hyphen;feasibility for MDF plant at Triabunna'. It states:

        <para>
         Of course it paints a very rosy picture. I do not know how you have a pre&amp;hyphen;feasibility study into a feasibility study, but I am quite sure North have done nothing about this. This was just grandstanding. What they did not tell us was that with regard to MDF plants you need a reasonable supply of water. Triabunna always has a real problem with water, even for the town water supply. I do not know where North intended to get the water from, but I do know this: they never intended and never will intend to build an MDF plant. It is a charade that should be brought to an end. A further press release of 22 September 1995 is headed: `North opens Tamar flitch mill'. It states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         North Forest Products today announced the operation of a flitch mill at its Tamar export woodchip mill at Longreach north of Launceston. The flitch mill will be managed by North, be operated by

         Of course it will. It did open. It used to be open before and it opened again, but it closed three months later. It does not operate today. The blokes who were working it are not working it today. There are no flitches being cut and nothing is being achieved with regard to any commitment to downstream processing. Again, it was a charade.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other major company involved in exports of woodchips from this country is Boral. We read, `Boral may set up flitch mill'; `Boral eyeing north-west sites'; `Boral's announcement on Thursday that it had agreed with Forestry Tasmania to feasibility studies'. They are not going to have a pre&amp;hyphen;feasibility study, just a direct feasibility study. We read that they are `examining a $100 million hardboard factory, a $10 million recovery sawmill at Longreach and a $10 million veneer plant. But I do not think there has been any feasibility study with regard to those things either. They again just represent some grandstanding with regard to the former criteria. Those criteria did require the applicant to give some demonstration of commitment to value adding and processing in Australia, both now and in the future. The minister's statement on hardwood export policy says:

         In 1992, a person named Al Corbet came to see me. He is a Queenslander who has a company called Asia Pacific Resources. He had a proposal to set up three flitch mills in Tasmania. They would have utilised about half a million tonnes of logs that were then being chipped. He went to the Forestry Commission with that proposal and also to the Tasmanian Development Authority. The Forestry Commission said to him that they were somewhat sceptical about his view regarding the potential recovery. I add that all of those flitches were to be exported. It was a totally export oriented proposal. None of them would have been sold on the domestic market.

         The Forestry Commission said a few things. It was sceptical about his claim regarding what could be recovered. He conducted some trials to prove that.

         Forestry Tasmania said, `Well, you are not a complying mill now because you have no access.' Of course, who owned the sawmill that acquired the land? It was a former management employee of North Broken Hill. You have to wonder, if there is not collusion somewhere there, why it is that somebody who says `I want to employ 25 people, I want to run a sawmill, I've got a sale for the timber' cannot get the sawmill up and running.

         I read the other day in the paper that the Country Sawmillers Association seem to have come to some agreement with North Broken Hill, I have to say under threat. A couple of people from Country Sawmillers said, `North has really got the arm twisted up the back here. They don't want us to put in an application for a woodchip licence. If we do, we're likely to suffer the consequences.' The consequences that they would suffer are simply these: the price for their residue from sawmilling operations would be reduced or refused, because under the current rules in Tasmania, that is what North Broken Hill can do. Again, that is unacceptable. You cannot allow those practices to continue. We have an obligation to ensure that in issuing export woodchip licences we do not allow that to continue. Those are just a few examples.

         As you can see from the examples that I have provided—and they are but a few—the proposed regulations do nothing to rectify these problems. I know the government will say that it is rubbish, but let us have a look at what is proposed. As I said before, under the pre-existing regulations at least two million tonnes, or around that, of wood for woodchips were sourced from sawmill residues. The proposed ceiling has been lifted by one million tonnes. But in reality, as I said
         <break page="4183" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          earlier, there is no ceiling, simply because of the degraded forest licences and trial shipment licences. This is exacerbated by the very loose definitions that are proposed, especially in the area of wood sourcing.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us go to the proposed regulations in terms of the definitions and look at what residue woodchips are. They mean `control of woodchips derived from sawmill residues or silvicultural thinnings'. It says `or silvicultural thinnings'. It does not say one thing. It does not say `sawmill residues'. There is no definition in here of what sawmill residues actually are. They could be anything. At least under the old regulations that you disallowed there was a specific definition for sawmill residues—very specific.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Page 4 says that `silvicultural thinnings' means `waste material resulting from thinning of regrowth forest for the purpose of improving the production potential of the forest'. That can mean anything. Let us go to the issue of `regrowth-old growth'. I asked the minister's office to explain to me what was their interpretation of `old growth-regrowth'. They said, `It's in the national forest policy statement.' I had a look and said, `What about the age difference?' They said, `It has nothing to do with age.'

         Let me tell you, Senator Parer, that in Tasmania regrowth forest is considered to be anything less than 150 years old. Then you take that and you think, `Hang on. Haven't we been running an argument about an 80-year rotation for the production of sawlogs?' None of this gels. None of it fits; none of it stacks up. We have an obligation in this place to do something about it.

         Again, in terms of the process, silvicultural residues and sawmill residues are not defined. `Degraded forest' is basically being left up to the minister of the day to say, `Tom, Dick, Harry or Sue have the expertise to determine what a degraded forest is.'

I will give you one example of why I make that statement, and that is the removal of funding for unions and others to participate in an appropriate forum such as the Industry Council and in a way that would allow a genuine and open approach to industry development.

        —The previous speaker, Senator Murphy, has raised some very serious questions indeed. I believe the government should look at those questions that Senator Murphy has raised and not just hide behind the fact that the management of the forest industry is essentially a state responsibility. The Commonwealth government has not shied away from using its powers under the constitution to influence states to perform better in a range of areas. I believe the government ought to do this now by using its powers under the constitution and in accordance with the Export Control Act. It may well be that ultimately the Export Control Act will need to be amended. I will come to that shortly.

       Senator Murphy has raised some very serious questions indeed. As I understand it, he is saying that there ought to be a true incentive for the industry to encourage downstream processing and that these regulations should focus on the source of material for woodchips. I concede that it does not do so. The regulations extend the definition of `residue woodchips'. As Senator Murphy indicated, the definition is broader than what was contained in the now disallowed regulations of the previous government. Under these regulations, residue woodchips mean `control of woodchips derived from sawmill residues or silvicultural thinnings'. Senator Murphy indicated it was estimated that 40 per cent of the export woodchips in 1996 were sourced
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       The people of Tasmania have often been told of proposals for future investment in Tasmania, particularly in the regional areas, and nothing has come from them. He referred to press releases from the North Broken Hill Company and from Boral. Those companies should bear in mind that they do have a responsibility to Tasmania. They always say that they adhere to that responsibility but, in the area that Senator Murphy has referred to and in the specific statements that have been made by those two companies, they have failed in that responsibility. I hope that they hear what is being said here and that they do take it on board.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That is not to say that they are not reasonably large employers in Tasmania. North Broken Hill provides considerable employment, but it does so because it is privileged to be able to exploit the resources of the state. I know the company will say that there needs to be an extended definition of what are residue woodchips and that there needs to be an additional provision for degraded private forests. I think it could probably reasonably justify its view on that, if it is talking about the long&amp;hyphen;term establishment of native forests for the purposes of ensuring a future resource, and I acknowledge that point. No doubt, that is one of the reasons that the government has specifically made provision for degraded private forests.

       I certainly will be and I think the parliament should be very alert as to how those particular degraded private forests are determined.

Senator Murphy has made some very valid points. I agree with him that further focus should be made on the source of

My problem is that, if I vote for the disallowance motion—I do not know whether it will be carried or whether it will not be—we go back to the 1986 regulations. Frankly, there were no ceilings under the 1986 regulations—none at all. From memory, even under the previous regulations there were no ceilings in the regulations themselves.

        —in reply—Senator Harradine has just outlined his argument which really is tipped in the balance by the fact that these regulations, if disallowed, would leave no ceiling on export woodchipping. That is the salient point of his argument. By interjection Senator Murphy pointed out that if the right thing was done by the timber industry these ceilings would not matter. In the last 60 seconds of his contribution Senator Harradine showed the contradiction in his position. It is not consistent and it is internally contradictory. It begs the question of voting for regulations which head the forest industry in Australia in the wrong direction.

       I compliment Senator Murphy on much of the contribution he has made, in particular the revelations about the way in which this industry is mismanaged by those at the very top. Both the Forestry Commission in Tasmania—and the same applies to forest authorities in other states—and the big woodchip companies have an inordinate power to sway the decisions on forests in their favour and against the interests of the small players who are the real job creators and who are essentially the downstream processors in this country. That is where the jobs in this industry ought to be.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The industry ought to be plantation based, and it ought to concentrate on downstream processing. But, instead of that, we have a situation where politicians and governments bow to the dictates and the power of these giant export woodchip companies. With the regulations that the government wants, we have in place toothless, parliamentary resolutions so that what happened before can happen in the future. If these regulations are
       <break page="4187" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        not disallowed, the outcome will simply be that we will see a faster rate of destruction of Australia's grand and ancient native forests on the altar of profit of a few mega woodchip companies.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The reason the ceiling does not matter is that it is so high that we do not have an export woodchip capacity. There is no requirement from overseas to sop up the extraordinary amount of forest that is allowed to be cut down under these regulations in the name of a properly regulated industry. It is a sham, and these regulations are a sham.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Whichever way one looks at it, the outcome will be that we will have the fastest rate of cutting and destruction of Australia's heritage forests in all of history, and at a time when we have less of those forests left than ever before. If that is not irresponsibility over the management of our forest resource, I ask what is.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I referred yesterday to that forest resource. Let me look at the environmental side of it. Through the nod of the minister—and I do not mean the Minister for the Environment; I mean the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the minister in charge of logging—these regulations will enhance the capacity of the industry at a national level to continue to erode into the wild forests of New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and, potentially, Queensland. Those areas include the habitats of nationally recognised and celebrated rare and endangered species such as the koala, the Leadbeater's possum, the long footed potoroo, the red tailed black cockatoo and the white goshawk.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We have forests of national estate value in several states which will face the chainsaws and the bulldozers under the direction of these regulations. In Tasmania, my home state, we have the Tarkine, the Great Western Tiers and the Picton, Huon and Weld valleys. These are forests which are recognised as being of World Heritage value but, sadly, they are outside the current World Heritage boundaries and will be targeted by the export woodchip companies as they broad deeper and deeper into these majestic, green domains.

       On top of this, yesterday in Newcastle the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        Parer—the minister responsible for so much of what happens in our forests—gave us a warning in relation to this. He said that, if the decision is that small forest reserves will come out of the current process—that is, where 10 or 15 per cent of a regional forest is set aside for protection—he is not going to abide by it. Where those forests are left standing, he is going to open the way for them to be dug up.

       What the minister has made clear is that, as far as this government is concerned, no forest reserve will be put aside without first giving access to the mining industry. Senator Parer's solution, as he calls it, for Australia's forests was this:

       So what is left of the forests—that is, what is not cut down—will be open to be dug up under the direction this government is taking.

       Why is it that 80 per cent of Australians are opposed to the continued destruction of our forest heritage yet are so comprehensively ignored? The answer is the woodchip companies themselves and the extraordinary lobby they have in this place and in state parliaments around the country. They have such sheer power, a power which the patch in the pants conservation organisations cannot hope to meet.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The fact is that at least $3 million a year is spent by the logging companies on public relations—and that is tax deductible. A large fraction of that is subsidised by the taxpayers. Who could blame the Wilderness Society for turning up at the opening of the Streeton exhibition last week in New South Wales? North Pty Ltd, the biggest forest destroyer in Australia, is trying to put a thin gloss of green over its ugly, chainsaw reputation by funding an art exhibition. That, I submit, besmirched the name of a great Australian artist.

        Beyond that is the matter of political donations. Today Senator Murray released some figures about how these giant corporations put cheques into the coffers of political parties. For example, if you look at companies like Wesfarmers and Boral, something between $300,000 and $500,000 went from those corporations to the Liberal-National Party—and even Labor Party—coffers in a two-year period.

        Beyond that we have to look at the self&amp;hyphen;interests of politicians in a more direct sense. I reiterate that you cannot disconnect a direct interest of people who are voting on an issue like this from the interests of the companies themselves. The Boral company, as compared with last year, is applying next year for a 16 per cent increase in the rate at which it converts our forests into woodchips. That is in Tasmania. In New South Wales, it wants to expand, under these new regulations, from 403,000 tonnes to 730,000 tonnes. It is applying for an 81 per cent increase and it stands to get it under these regulations. In Western Australia, WA Chip and Pulp wants to go from 750,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes—a 20 per cent increase. These regulations are paving the way for increased conversion of forests to woodchips and increased, in commensurate amount, profits that those woodchip companies make.

        There happen to be a number of senators who have shares in those companies. In leading up to that matter, Senator Vanstone referred, on 17 March 1994, to the senators' register of interests. She said that the register

        We sold the shares because I did not want to be in the position of anyone being able to say, `Look, even though you are not government, in opposition you can make a difference to these things, whether or not you agree, whether or not you create difficulty'. If a casino had gone through with our support and Federal Hotels had had the opportunity to run it, I would have been very uncomfortable.

       <para>
        Senator Vanstone also said something that I think is a very salient message to every senator, particularly to those seven senators opposite who were on the register of interests at the start of October as having shares in woodchip companies. She said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        I agree with Senator Vanstone—declaration itself is going halfway. When there is a conflict of interest, it is required that the senator or member of parliament involved go the full way. Declaration is not enough. Avoiding the conflict is what is required.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is not time for a divestment of shares, although all senators have known this matter would be dealt with in the near future. What is required is an abstention from voting in this matter.

         —When this matter was last being discussed I referred to the government's design to make the awards of this country unattractive to industry and employees by making the system weaker and reducing conditions for many employees. Those opposite want to replace that effective award system with a system of individual contracts that are to be called `Australian workplace agreements'. We are told that somehow this will empower employers and employees. I agree
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that it will give more power to employers. It will, however, severely disadvantage employees.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We should examine the government's proposition. Under their proposal, when a person applies for a job and the employer says during the interview, `I want you to sign this agreement', that person has no power in those circumstances; they are not even an employee. There can be no doubt that this will lead to job applicants signing agreements they do not like, just to get a job.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is clearly no bargaining in this type of situation; there is no power for the employee. So much for empowering new starters, particularly the young who seek employment for the first time. There will be no power for new starters. Every time a person wants to change jobs—and there are many thousands of employees who do that each year—they may well be confronted with a demand, however couched, that they sign an Australian workplace agreement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What about existing employees, those who are employed and have some form of contract of employment? What power will they have? Perhaps I should start with casual workers—and there are many in many industries. They have no guarantee of continuing employment. Some would say their contract of employment is by the day and that they start a new contract of employment every day when they start.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If an employer puts an Australian workplace agreement before a casual employee and says, `Sign', then they have a choice: they can sign, as the employer says—and probably continue to be called in for work—or they can refuse to sign and risk being dropped from the roster for someone who does. In my view, this is a form of coercion, a form of coercion that is impossible to deal with from a legal or a human point of view. These employees will have no bargaining power. Where is the empowerment of these employees that the government promises? There is a net loss to them in this bill. These employees will be as vulnerable as new starters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn to employees already in ongoing contracts of employment. What power is there for them in this bill? They can refuse to sign
        <break page="4191" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         an agreement and stay under the award. However, if the employer offers them a choice of the award or an agreement which contains matters in excess of the award which already apply to them while removing access to other award provisions, the employee will be faced with an unfair challenge and possibly threat. That is, if you do not sign the agreement, those matters which are in excess of the award may not continue to apply because you have not signed an agreement which contains them but drops other award conditions. That will mean in some situations that a gun will be held at the head of employees.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is the type of circumstance that I have regularly heard of from employers and their representatives when the question of the proper application of an award is raised with the employer. A common response—and I am talking about an employer who has not been properly observing an award—is, `If we have to meet this part of the award we will take away these particular conditions that are not part of the award.' This is the reality of bargaining in the workplace, and this system offers no empowerment to employees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Employers and employees can already reach binding agreements without any change to the law, and the minister has already conceded this. It will simply allow employers to pressure employees to give up those rights contained in awards. There is no empowerment here. Even if there is a bargaining process without this imbalance, then who will hold the whip hand? Given that the bill prohibits any employee revealing the content of their agreement, how can employees bargain with any sound research or knowledge on what is achievable, what has already been agreed, and what similar skilled and experienced employees have been able to persuade the employer that they are entitled to?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The employer in many circumstances will have this information, so I would call this bargaining by employees a form of blindfold bargaining, if any bargaining takes place at all. If this is what government senators opposite call empowerment, then I think they are deluded and out of touch with the reality of the workplace. I would not have thought they
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         would be so naive as to have that view. However, the alternative is even less flattering.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As for employees' access to unions or other outside resources in the bargaining process, I believe it is likely that this will be even less accessible than it is now. I gave the Senate an example last Thursday night of employees being advised by the employers' industrial representative as to the detail of a proposed agreement. When a union sought to circulate a document which set out some simple advice for employees as to their rights, the employers' representative directed employees to tear them up and throw them in the bin. That is the real world in many workplaces. The employer has a powerful hold over employees, and it takes a very strong person to oppose the will of the employer. Some have the strength. Some can ignore the potential economic sanction of being unemployed. Most are not as strong, and most cannot afford to put their families' welfare in jeopardy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is another question to be posed, and that is: will Australian workplace agreements become the contract of employment for employees? The contract of employment lasts only as long as the Australian workplace agreement is in force. That is, the term, whether it be one year or two, will be the term of the employment. At the end of the Australian workplace agreement, the employee is no longer employed and is in the position of a job applicant. They will have the bargaining power only if they have a skill that is in short supply; otherwise they will have no power, no empowerment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other question which arises is whether this will effectively remove access for many to the unfair dismissal provisions that this bill contains. That is, at the end of their contract they will not be an employee and therefore not have access to seeking reinstatement of their employment because they cannot negotiate a fair bargain with their employer about ongoing conditions of employment. The government's chest beating about maintaining those provisions may well be hollow claims given this possibility.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This aspect of the Australian workplace agreements provision is about empowering

        I am a member of the Australian Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union. I have spent most of my life representing many part-time workers, most of whom are women. Most of these women have had the benefit of an award guaranteed minimum daily engagement. This bill would remove that right for those women under federal awards. They are not highly paid, and they depend on a certain number of hours each day to make going to work each day worth it.

        I draw the attention of honourable senators to the cleaners employed in this building by a contract cleaning company. The impact of this bill will be to remove from the part-time cleaners employed here their current entitlement to a minimum number of hours each day. This bill will create the circumstances for a possible loss of income for the lowest paid workers in this building. The government is effectively attacking these employers with this bill. Why? There is no clear and discernible rationale available in the parliamentary debate so far on this matter. Can it be anything to do with empowering employees? Clearly not. It is in fact the opposite. Clearly it will disadvantage those employees. It will take away rights that they have now for no discernible reason.

        I want to touch briefly on the disamalgamation provisions of the bill and particularly on the comfort that this government may have drawn from correspondence and approaches it received from Mr Peter James on behalf of the Liquor and Hospitality Division of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union in support of the disamalgamation provisions of this bill.

        Mr James advised me at a meeting of the transitional national executive of that organisation that he drew his authority to support that aspect of the bill from a meeting attended by about 93 members. I further draw the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         attention of the Senate and the government to the fact that Mr Justice Madgewick of the Federal Court ordered that the office held by Mr James—namely, of the secretary of that divisional branch—had not been properly filled, and ordered that a new election be called. A ballot of members has been conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and counted. Mr James was not the successful candidate in that ballot, although he was a candidate.

        I would submit to the Senate that this is testimony of the fact that members of that part of the organisation Mr James purported to represent as supporting this part of the bill have repudiated Mr James's position and action in supporting this aspect of the bill. The government can now draw no comfort from Mr James's representations on the matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill is a disaster for employees generally in the service industries. Parts of these industries are represented by the organisation of which I am a member. In the hospitality industry, an industry that is highly casualised, the wages paid to employees will fall in real terms as a result of this bill and conditions will be reduced. Individual contracts will be imposed on employees quickly due to the high turnover of labour which now generally applies. This will have a negative effect on the morale of industry employees and will ultimately affect service and productivity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The growth and development of the hospitality industry in this country will suffer as a result of this bill. If it is passed, the industry will not be the polished and harmonious industry we would want it to be for the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. This will affect the image of Australia and Australians. The government cannot ignore these effects when pursuing this legislation. There are many other service industries employing part-time and casual employees, and I have referred to the danger this bill poses to them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In conclusion, there are many aspects of this bill which require further attention. I understand that we will have the opportunity to address them when the matter is dealt with in committee.

         —In speaking this evening to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, I want to focus particularly on the impact this legislation will have on women. The existence of a centralised system for the making of awards setting terms and conditions of employment has historically ensured a higher level of protection for employees with little industrial strength—and, of course, that includes women. Comparing award rates of pay, women do comparatively well in relation to men but, on the other hand, comparing over-award payments, which are determined outside the system, women fare badly. The supplementary payments concept introduced since 1989, which has brought minimum award rates closer to over-award rates of pay, has been particularly important for women. However, over-award payments remain a problem for women.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The role of the Industrial Relations Commission through test cases has been crucial in achieving this result in terms of award relativities, especially the 1969 and 1972 equal pay cases. It has also been responsible for the introduction of conditions of work which are especially important for women, such as the 1979 maternity leave and, more recently, the parental leave and family leave cases.

        It is this strong award system which has given Australia a higher female-male wages ratio than comparable countries. The thrust of the government's proposed changes is to actually undermine this whole award system to a minimal wages floor and replace it with a system of individual agreements. This will, over time, destroy the achievements of the award system. This will have a particular impact on women. Before the election, the coalition promised:

         But the truth is that the government is designing a system which will destroy the role of the award system in protecting the wages and conditions of the low paid—that means particularly many women. The government will do this by changes to the award system and the system of workplace agreements and by removing the commission's jurisdiction to make orders for equal remuneration for work of equal value in the over-award area.

         The safety net that has been built up over time is a set of employment conditions contained in awards. Currently, the commission can update the safety net in each award to ensure it remains relevant and secure.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is intending to limit the issues which can be included in awards. Even if the parties agree, clauses dealing with the following areas will be removed from the awards: the introduction of change, consultative arrangements, EEO and workplace harassment, redundancy, procedures for dealing with termination of employment, minimum breaks between shifts, superannuation, rostered days off, meal breaks, transport, trade union training leave, distant work, transport and fares, training and study leave, amenities, clothing and equipment, time and wage records, posting rewards, right of entry, and paid maternity leave.

         Many of these provisions give women significant entitlements. It is unrealistic to suggest that most employees will be able to negotiate these provisions in an enterprise agreement, especially without the assistance of unions or an oversighting role by the commission administering a comprehensive `no disadvantage' test.

The abolition of paid rates awards will particularly affect women in the public sector—nurses, teachers, community service workers and lower and middle ranking public servants. These workers are generally not in a position to negotiate enterprise agreements because of their employers' dependence on government funding. They will also be severely disadvantaged even if the rates in the current paid awards are maintained and frozen in minimum rates awards, as they will be unable to gain wage increases in the future.

         The federal Labor government acted on this concern and in 1994 introduced new equal remuneration provisions in part VIA of the act, which gave the commission the ability to remedy instances of discriminatory over&amp;hyphen;award payments. The ACTU, utilising these provisions, has had some major successes in negotiating the removal of clearly discriminatory over&amp;hyphen;award payments, especially among female process workers in the manufacturing industry. The government now proposes to remove these important provisions, although nothing was said to this effect during the election campaign.

        The Inspector&amp;hyphen;General of Intelligence and Security is a crucial position in the Australian intelligence community. It is the office through which accountability in our intelligence agencies is encouraged. The office is responsible for  assisting the relevant minister in overseeing and reviewing the activities of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Signals Directorate, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that these agencies act legally and with propriety, comply with ministerial guidelines and directives and respect human rights. The Inspector&amp;hyphen;General's office conducts these reviews by way of constant monitoring of the intelligence agencies and responding to complaints against the agencies directed by the Inspector-General.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I begin my comments with the observation that the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security appears to be greatly under resourced; however, it manages on the most part to fulfil all its legal requirements and roles with relative efficiency and effectiveness. The two points highlighted by the report are: firstly, the lack of resources available to the Inspector-General; and, secondly, the Inspector-General's ability to deal with its basic requirements regardless of this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The workload of the Inspector-General has increased steadily since 1986, with a small drop over the past two years. This workload increased considerably in 1994&amp;hyphen;1995 due to the work of the commission of inquiry into ASIS.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To its credit the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General's office managed to keep the average duration of the complaint process from increasing substantially. The only sharp increase occurred during 1994&amp;hyphen;95 when also dealing with the aforementioned inquiry. As the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         mentions in his report, efficient processing time has occurred with `only a very small office to help him'.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report further highlights that the work of the agency is of a high standard. This is evident by a number of results:
       </para>
       <para>
        firstly, in all cases, ministers have accepted the recommendations arising from reports completed during the years; and, secondly, with some minor exceptions, there continued to be broad acceptance of inquiry outcomes by both complainants and the organisation itself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report also illustrates the work the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General plays in encouraging internal reviews by the various agencies. An example of this is in regard to investigations of complaints against ASIO and the findings. The significant finding was as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The majority of complaints, upon investigation, are revealed to be unfounded. Nevertheless, some expose deficiencies in the manner in which the Organisation has dealt with particular matters and ASIO appears keen to learn from its experience to take corrective action, where this appears warranted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both the role of the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General in highlighting problems in the process of ASIO investigations and ASIO's willingness to improve that process are reflective of the general thrust of the report.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This brings me to the role that the intelligence agencies have played themselves in operating under the spirit of the legislation. In nearly all cases, the report illustrates cases where the agencies have established internal review procedures aimed at increasing accountability and efficiency of the complaints handling process. Additionally, the agencies have cooperated with the reviews and investigations of the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General. For this illustrated commitment to accountability and cooperation, the intelligence community should be congratulated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One area that I feel the report fails to explain adequately is point 42, entitled `Extent to which there has been a change with the Agencies as a result of my Office's activities'. This section states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of recommendations were made aimed at improving the internal procedures of the agencies
        <break page="4196" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in the course of the year, in some cases, as a result of inquiries I conducted, or in others when the Office responded to requests for assistance or advice from agencies. During the year, the agencies accepted all of the recommendations of suggestions emanating from the inquiries I concluded.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        It is encouraging to hear that recommendations to improve internal procedures have been accepted. I believe information in relation to what those recommendations were and which agency they relate to would be useful knowledge for the Senate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The most significant problem for the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General's office is fulfilling its primary role—that is, to monitor the agencies under its jurisdiction. Due to the level of resources and staffing this has become secondary to reacting to complaints that are brought to the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General's attention. This is highlighted in section 8 under the subheading `The Year in Review', where the report states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The commission of inquiry into ASIS found that the Office has become too complaints orientated to the detriment of its self&amp;hyphen;initiated monitoring activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        This issue creates the problem of the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General being unable to monitor and possibly prevent problems occurring. As a result, the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General involved himself with the intelligence agencies at a predominantly complaints level. Therefore, while the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General and the intelligence agencies are working well in areas of accountability, additional resources could further enhance this process by increasing the chances of prevention.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In conclusion, the Senate can be pleased with the work of both the Inspector-General and the intelligence agencies in their review processes and cooperation between the various agencies.

         —The surveillance of intelligence agencies is always a major difficulty for a democratic society. It is one that we manage very successfully in this country. We manage it through two mediums: first, through the appointment of the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General of Intelligence and Security, whose position was created in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, with powers equivalent to a royal commissioner to inquire into all activities relating to the five intelligence
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          agencies; and, secondly, at another level we do it through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to note the way in which parliamentary committees have developed over the years. For example, the United Kingdom for years refused to acknowledge that there were any intelligence agencies operating at all in the United Kingdom, despite all the popular novels that have been written about them. In recent years they have set up the security intelligence committee, with oversight of all the intelligence agencies in the United Kingdom. Although they have only been operating for 18 months and the Australian parliamentary committee, which looks only at ASIO, has been operating for nearly 10 years, their ambit of operations is very much wider than what we have. I think it is a requirement in a democratic society that we move more and more to oversight.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the essential parts of that oversight is the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General's office.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the things about intelligence agencies is that they are very much a closed culture. People tend to join an agency or be recruited to it and stay in it for life. It is different from the rest of the public service. If they have complaints about promotion, conditions of service or even selection itself, they really do not have the avenues of appeal that other avenues of civilian employment have. So the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General has an important part to play in that regard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The previous speaker, Senator Bishop, said something about the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General's office being under&amp;hyphen;resourced. I do not think it is lavishly resourced but I think it is drawing a long bow to say, given the volume of work—21 complaints last year—that a staff of six, as it is at the moment, is over&amp;hyphen;stretched. I would be very surprised if that were the view of the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General himself. I think for the present workload and the activities they have, it is probably adequate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Getting back to the need for oversight, the intelligence agencies in Australia are all restrained by the law of the land. The various legislative statutes that set them up are very strict in their restrictions on the organisations.
        <break page="4197" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         The agencies do observe those restrictions very much to the letter of the law, both with their own internal audit procedures on confirmation of their activities and through the independence of the Inspector&amp;hyphen;General's office. In no sense are they running around with an Ian Fleming or James Bond type attitude. They are all, in my experience, very responsible agencies.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of the five of them, ONA, DSD and DIO are intelligence assessment organisations. DSD collects, by technical means, the intelligence which it uses for assessment. So basically they do not come into much contact with the community at large.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        ASIS is the overseas intelligence gathering service. Again, it does not come into much contact with the Australian community, or no contact at all. So it is not surprising that, of the 21 cases listed this year, I think 20 of them relate to the activities of ASIO. That is because ASIO is looking after internal intelligence matters: politically motivated violence, espionage and activities of that nature. It does therefore come in contact with a large number of Australians through the year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the nature of things, there are those who feel they have been aggrieved. But, for the scale of its activities, to have only 20-odd complaints in 12 months and for the Inspector-General to find that the great majority of those complaints—probably something like 18 or 19—have no basis at all for further investigation is good testimony to the way the agency is conforming to the law and the spirit under which it was incorporated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the same time, I think the Inspector-General—both the incumbent and his predecessor—has done a very good job with respect to the legislation that sets them in their position. I look forward to their report next year. In conclusion, the whole of the Inspector-General's position costs only $637,000 a year and we get good value for it.

         This is a very important report by the Australian Law Reform Commission and an excellent report in keeping with the many excellent reports it has put out beforehand.

         On 18 August 1992 the then Attorney-General, Mr Michael Duffy, referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission for inquiry and report a large number of Acts administered by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services (as it then was). The Attorney-General did this at the request of Mr Brian Howe, then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. The Department is now called the Department of Health and Family Services and its Minister is Dr Michael Wooldridge. The Minister for Family Services is Mrs Judi Moylan. The terms of reference cover Acts that deal with Commonwealth service provision and Commonwealth funded service provision in areas including disability services, aged care, child care and health.

         The Commission recommends that the object of the new Disability Services legislation should be

         It is important that we, as a federal legislature, set our minds in perhaps a new way. It is simply not enough for us to pass legislation that ensures that sums of money of whatever size go to the people that need services as people who are disadvantaged in this community. Though money is needed, that should not be the prime objective.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The prime objective ought to be the provision of the appropriate services to those people who are in need of them. When we work out what services they need, we can then work out what money is needed. Perhaps people would say that it is a subtle distinction but an important distinction. The other sentence in the chapter 1 introduction says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The new legislation should be based on respect for the rights of people with a disability and its administration should aim to achieve high quality services to meet their needs.

        <para>
         We can only agree with that. Those two points go hand in hand—the provision of services that are needed, taking into account people's rights. That is the primary objective. Money comes as a secondary consideration to support those objectives.

         now the secretary of DEETYA, the department that has replaced DEET. I just wish to record in the Senate my appreciation of the opportunity to work with Mr Hollway as a departmental secretary.

I think he played an important role in leading this department, along with deputy secretaries Spasojevic, Trenberth and Bell.

        This is a department of many fine officers. It is a good department and one that needs to be a strong advocate for industry policy in Canberra. I say that, Madam President, for the reason that last week you would have noticed that the

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Unfortunately for Australia, the 55 chief executive officers panned Australia as an attractive investment destination. They did so for a number of reasons, some of which are quite shallow. That is not a reason to criticise them, but it is perhaps a reason to make sure that we redouble our efforts so that we are able to convince them that they are wrong in that their reasons are obviously too shallow or too superficial.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of their criticisms of Australia as an investment destination is that our industry policy is incoherent—to use their word—and I think they have a point. The budget this year cut out of the industry portfolio a number of programs which are quite central for Australia to have an active industry policy. Those programs related on the trade side to the strength of Austrade and its ability to be an international market intelligence agency for Australian business so that they have a periscope into foreign markets at minimal cost to them and they are able to take advantage of market opportunity. The export market development grants scheme was slashed, severe cuts were made to the research and development program and chops and changes were made to industry policies, including the abolition of a whole range of bounties and a reduction in support for industry.

       <break page="4199" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         This springs from the erroneous idea that we apply business welfare in Australia, to use the term applied by some elements of the bureaucracy and picked up, unfortunately, by the new government. We do not. Business welfare is a superficial term used to discredit any real debate or serious discussion about industry policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What the government needs to do in the post&amp;hyphen;protectionist era for industry policy in this nation is to ensure that, while we do not bring back protection, we nonetheless have enlightened policies that encourage Australian companies to become internationally competitive, to grow our export dollar, to take a bigger share of international markets and to make sure that our manufacturing area grows to world standards. We need to stop selling cheap commodities like non&amp;hyphen;value added commodities like wheat, wool, iron ore and coal and buying back sophisticated manufactured goods; we need to start developing the capacity to manufacture those goods in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think that this is a cheap shot: styling policies which are aimed at driving the economy in that direction as business welfare. They are all policies which have been refereed, reviewed and demonstrated to create more value than cost to the economy. In fact, as a budget item, they have been cut as outlays. But if you were to consider their impact on revenue, the net balance is that the programs that have been reduced play a budget positive or a budget neutral role. Without those programs, we have a lopsided approach to dealing with the current account deficit but, more importantly, we have removed support from Australian business in order to become exporters and to compete on the world stage. This means that the job opportunities they may offer are limited and that their prospects are reduced.

        Genetic engineering is an issue that has been an interest of mine for many years. As I think everybody acknowledges, genetic science and technology are always way ahead of both the ethical debate and the legislative framework within which it can operate. That is a great concern. We never seem to catch up. I do not think it is necessarily the fault of the scientists or the technicians; it is the fault of those of us who perhaps ought to push some of these debates a little harder.

        This is a very good report. I will be seeking leave to continue my remarks, because it needs digesting in a much deeper way than I can do tonight. By way of illustration, I refer the Senate to page 9, where there is a discussion about herbicide&amp;hyphen;resistant crops. Clearly, all of us would want to endorse that science which enables us to produce crops that do not need herbicides or which are able to resist insect pests because of their genetically engineered characteristics. But there are some dangers. I will read from the report to underline what some of those dangers are:
