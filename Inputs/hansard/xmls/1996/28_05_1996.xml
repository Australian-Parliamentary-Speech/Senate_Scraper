In view of the fact that the government will not rule out privatising Telstra by non&amp;hyphen;legislative means, has the government instructed the firm CS First Boston, which will be conducting the scoping studies to establish the value of a privatised Telstra, to include in those scoping studies the value of the sale of a privatised Telstra by non&amp;hyphen;legislative means? Would such a scoping study take into account: firstly, the payment of state stamp duty of between $1 billion and $2 billion; secondly, the non&amp;hyphen;exemption of the privatisation process from the corporations law; thirdly, the requirement to issue a full and detailed prospectus; fourthly, that there would be no exemption from certain disallowable instruments; and, fifthly, that potential investors would not be certain of what liabilities they would inherit from the existing Telstra privatised by non&amp;hyphen;legislative process?

There is a great deal of work done with any form of privatisation, even a partial privatisation. The whole question of due diligence and so on is gone into and I would expect that in any work done in relation to partial privatisation of Telstra the many issues that have to be considered concerning due diligence will be considered.

         —One of the basic reasons for introducing RSAs is because there is no such product at the moment in the retirement income market. This fills a very important niche, especially—as I have said on several occasions in the Senate—for people who are part&amp;hyphen;time or casual workers and move in and out of the work force, particularly women, and people who are nearing their retirement age. At the moment they do not have a vehicle of the nature of the retirement savings account.

        So far as the accounts and charges in relation to RSAs are concerned, that is a matter that will be looked at in very fine detail as we work towards the final details over the period ahead in wide consultation with all the stakeholders. Certainly the intention will be to minimise the charges that will relate to such accounts. Indeed, it is one of the reasons—although not the only one by any means—why the government is moving to develop this new product to supplement the range of retirement income products. The former Labor government's attempt to solve the problem of the small numbers of superannuation accounts and benefits failed entirely.

         has ranked Australia—and this is on the basis of a ranking by thousands of business persons around the world; it is done by the International Institute for Management Development, a Swiss based survey firm—on the overall ranking as 21st out of the 46 countries surveyed.

        All of our major trading partners and competitors rank above us. Many of the individual rankings are appallingly worse than even the ranking of 21st out of 46. Over the last 12 months of the former Labor government, we have slipped from 16th to 21st on that competitive rating.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Chapman referred to our rating in relation to our current account performance—that is, our performance in terms of our external accounts. He is correct that the survey puts us at 43rd, almost right at the bottom of the league table, in relation to our external accounts performance.

        The simple fact again is that, although we have all known for a long time that the current account deficit problem facing Australia has been a major problem for Australia,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the former government in its 13 years in office was never prepared to tackle that problem. The result of course was lost jobs, lost investment, lost economic growth and, as noted by the competitiveness report, lost competitiveness.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In simple terms the current account deficit is the amount by which national savings are insufficient to fund national investment and the difference is the amount we have to borrow from overseas to pay for our expenditure. The competitiveness yearbook indicates that our savings shortfall, as I have said, is the third worst of the other 45 countries surveyed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Economic commentators and governments around the world have increasingly recognised that high current account deficits can constrain economic growth. High current account deficits can lead to higher interest rates and make the economy more vulnerable to external shocks with the resulting loss and damage in the area of our national sovereignty that that brings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is particularly the case when governments contribute to the current account deficit by running irresponsible fiscal policies. The then Treasurer, Mr Keating, as I am sure we all remember, warned of the dangers of excessively high current account deficits 10 years ago in 1986, when he said that you cannot fund—and at that time it was a $12 billion a year deficit—that deficit in perpetuity every year and then the interest on that debt and on the debt before it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we have seen under this government is a continual erosion of the dangers that the then Treasurer warned us of 10 years ago—a warning that the former government took no action at all to meet. Our policy, with regard to the current account deficit, is going to be based on action. It is not going to be based on the rhetoric that we have heard for the last 13 years. We will reduce the underlying budget deficit by $4 billion in 1996-97 and in 1997-98. We will not allow the Commonwealth to continue year after year to drag down national savings and compound the competitiveness problem that is so apparent in this report.

What he is saying is that if you become increasingly internationally uncompetitive you run larger and larger current account deficits, you cannot pay your way through the world and therefore you have to borrow to fill the gap—and that is the foreign debt which the previous government ran up from $23 billion when it took office to no less than $185 billion when it lost office.

        So far as the first question is concerned, since 1989, sales tax provisions relating to recycled paper products have changed considerably. Prior to 1989, recycled paper products did not attract any preferential sales tax treatment and were taxed at the general rate of 20 per cent. In 1989, an exemption was introduced for a range of recycled paper products. The scope of the exemption was reduced in 1992, as Senator Margetts will recall.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The then government agreed to provide transitional assistance to specialist manufacturers which had been disadvantaged by the decision from 1992-93 to 1993-94, after which the assistance ceased. The remaining exemption for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products was removed from 1 November 1995. Those products include writing, drawing or printing paper, envelopes, notepads, accounting journals and ledgers. The exemption was removed, as I understand it, Senator Margetts, because it proved an inefficient method of achieving the previous government's environmental objectives.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The removal of the exemption is consistent with the recommendation of the Industry Commission in its 1991 report on recycling. The report found in particular that the exemption was difficult to administer, that it provided no assistance to less than 100 per cent recycled paper products, that it provided incentive to divert waste paper from more traditional and efficient uses to the production of paper eligible for the exemption, and also that it impeded efficient industry development.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In regard to the second question, in terms of the present government's purchasing policy, our purchasing policy for recycled paper products encourages buyers to purchase goods and services with the least harmful environmental effects consistent with value for money principles. Government buyers generally purchase their paper requirements through a common use arrangement.

         There is no data on which to base any conclusions about the impact that the removal of the sales tax exemption might have on the economic returns of paper collectors or the export of used paper and the import of finished paper products. The government will continue its policy of encouraging buyers to purchase goods and services with the least harmful effects consistent with value for money principles. Value for money does remain the essential test against which any procurement outcomes must be justified. Value for money decisions, however, require consideration of all costs, benefits and alternatives, and environmental costs are an important part of the equation.

        Well, I think, Craig, you are jumping a whole lot of hurdles at this stage. All that's happened so far is I have had a request to meet with New Crest Mining. Now bear in mind that because of the decisions of the previous Labor Government there's a legal suit going on between that particular company and the Government. And at this stage it is incorporated in the Stage Three of Kakadu. It is part of the National Park. And it would need a change in legislation. So I don't even know what New Crest are going to propose to me in view of the legal action in process.

        The situation is that, when the lot opposite had 13 years in government, while they spent up big in a whole lot of other areas they let the real value of defence expenditure fall, and the numbers have been repeatedly reduced. It was very clear that something had to happen to save the situation if Australia was to be adequately and effectively defended. So the then opposition, the coalition, put out a policy that said, `We will not cut defence expenditure; we will maintain the existing commitments.' I remember that during the election campaign the then minister, Senator Ray, was delighted. He actually talked, I think it was, on Adelaide radio saying he welcomed that; protecting the bottom line was a responsible decision.

He will recall quite clearly that a lot of people put proposals to us about the development of Holsworthy. There was nothing secret; there was nothing underhand, nothing whatsoever. In fact, we had one classic proposal that Senator Forshaw will remember very well. That was for a floating airport off Sydney. The more responsible people who put proposals to us in regard to Holsworthy were the international pilots. That was one group. There was another proposal that I recall well, from a Mr Pickering, from somewhere around the North Shore. He put a very serious proposal to us.

        The Senate inquiry, of course, had no terms of reference to look at an alternate site. What we did find was that, because of the government's procrastination and the delays in doing something at Badgerys Creek, there had been urban encroachment into Badgerys Creek. My understanding is that my colleague, Mr Sharp, has simply looked at an alternative to Badgerys Creek. If, in the event of a proper EIS—the Labor government had to be dragged into an EIS; it was a supplementary EIS—it is found that Badgerys Creek is not a suitable site, then an alternative has to be found.

I have forgotten how many people actually put that proposal to our committee, but it was quite a number, as Senator Forshaw will know. How many?

Evidence given to the committee was that, with technology the way it is today, the latter is not a problem. I am unsure of what the status is today of the Defence Forces.

They came to the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) today and he has passed them on to me—

Though Senator Hill has come in today with one more batch of documents, it is quite clear that there are still more documents that need to be produced under the return to order. Senator Hill has not shown responsibility on this matter. He came in here on 22 May and, without investigating the matter at all, claimed that the record stands as Senator Minchin has presented it—without taking one look behind the documents to see what the real situation was.

This is just one example, but, Senator Hill—and I want you to listen to this—if you look at the return to order of a week ago, it did not just cover two ministers. It did not just cover the Minister representing the Attorney-General and the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. It also covered you because Senator Minchin is a parliamentary secretary in the department that you represent—the Prime Minister's department.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Schacht today, relating to the proposed partial privatisation of Telstra.
       </para>
       <para>
        I appreciate the fact that Senator Short gave me further information at the end of question time about the appointment of CS First Boston. I was aware of that. I have been directing questions to you, Senator Short, because that appointment is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey. In the statement of 8 May he clearly appoints CS First Boston to carry out the scoping studies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no dispute with us that that process has gone through. Whatever the principles and issues of privatisation, it is a natural process to appoint a firm like CS First Boston to do it. That is not the issue I am raising. You were asked to get further information on the detail of the question. What I really want to find out is whether you have given further instructions to CS First Boston to do scoping studies on what the value of Telstra would be if it was privatised by non&amp;hyphen;legislative means.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe that Telstra would be substantially reduced in value if you privatised it by non&amp;hyphen;legislative means. In particular, you cannot avoid the issue that if you do not put legislation through exempting the privatisation process from state stamp duty, between $1 billion and $2 billion—estimates vary—could be charged by state governments in stamp duty on creating a new corporate structure. That would clearly come off the $8 billion. If not, you might try to get this very large sum of money back in negotiations with the states by threatening to cut their states grants. That would then create an argument with the state governments. If you accept paying the stamp duty, you will be down at least $1 billion on the $8 billion. You will be down to under $7 billion in value.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I raised other issues—which all deserve an answer—about the importance for the parliament of knowing whether you were giving these instructions for the scoping study on exemption issues under the Telstra privatisation bill. The process of privatisation is exempt from the powers of the Corporations Act in a number of areas. We are not arguing that it is necessary for that to be done to make it simple but if you go the non&amp;hyphen;legislative route you are not able to exempt, therefore the full power of the Corporations Act and all those things that go with it are part of the process. That could have a big impact on investors' attitudes and what they would be willing to pay for their one&amp;hyphen;third share of Telstra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is also the complicated issue concerning any disallowable instruments that affect Telstra but are in the Telecommunications Act. Where do they stand? Will they have an impact? If you go the non&amp;hyphen;legislative route you cannot change those disallowable instruments. There is also the whole question of the existing liabilities that Telstra has—debt liabilities, borrowings—and how they would be dealt with in a non&amp;hyphen;legislative way. For example, there is comment around that you cannot transfer the staff in the Telstra corporation to another corporate entity without their having some rights. How does that affect the value of Telstra?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Does the new investor have to pick up the debt which, under your bill, the Commonwealth accepts as liability? The debt of Telstra runs into hundreds of millions of dollars. All of that would reduce the value. We want to find out whether these things are in the scoping studies. If you are not putting them in the scoping studies, you are being quite irresponsible if you are going the non&amp;hyphen;legislative route. There is a political issue here, Senator Short, that you have made great reference to. You have argued that there would be $1 billion out of the $8 billion going to the environment. If the stamp duty alone is more than a billion dollars and is paid to the states, that reduces the amount to $7 billion, or even less.

          If you do go the non&amp;hyphen;legislative route—no matter how much you get, it will be substan tially less than $8 billion—does the government still make an absolute commitment to put $1 billion into the environment program, or will that be substantially reduced, proportionately, because you are getting proportionately less than $8 billion? These are fundamental issues and are why we want to know what instructions you have given CS First Boston for their scoping study.

       </para>
       <para>
        I am afraid that Senator Short's answer probably was not on recycled paper. In Western Australia an inquiry into recycling stated in its executive summary:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Western Australia is committed to the goal of halving the solid waste going to landfill (on a per capita basis) by the year 2000.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are unlikely to achieve that goal unless, as a community, we buy and use more recycled goods. We are, it seems, very good at collecting, sorting and stock piling recyclable materials, but fall down when it comes to creating markets for those materials by buying recycled products.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the `Key Finding' heading, the primary finding was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The cost of recycled paper can be significantly reduced for Government by bulk buying through common use contracts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other findings were also quite important. I will read them out in good time. I just want to emphasise this. Basically it means that if each individual department makes its decisions one by one, it is never going to make that a more competitive buying option. That will not happen unless they have a proper policy that departments in general buy those goods and make a market that is worthwhile.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to emphasise that a major effort for local and state governments over the last 10 years has been to convince people, households and businesses to recycle. The reason for this is economic. It costs a dramatically increasing amount of money to throw things away. Tips fill rapidly and new tip sites are difficult to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         find within urban areas. Transport of waste out of cities to non&amp;hyphen;urban sites is expensive. Small towns do not really want to become the rubbish tips of cities. Waste collection is expensive. Building new tips in an environmentally sound manner is often very expensive, especially if they are on top of a water mound. The situation has become critical enough globally that a few years ago the United States considered taking 10 per cent of its domestic waste and sinking it in a lagoon in the Marshall Islands.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then there are the ecological impacts of both waste disposal and of wasting material resources and the energy used to make them. In particular, paper is used and thrown away on a massive scale. We are chopping down our forests and chipping them. We are not doing it for building materials; we are doing it so we can make paper and throw it away. We are converting old&amp;hyphen;growth forests into rubbish and filling our tips with it, and it is costing us a fortune. We chip timber and we send the chip and pulp overseas. We import paper. We spend millions to collect paper from consumers because the alternative is to spend millions to throw it in the ground.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The single biggest barrier to paper collection is the low price collectors get for paper. In many cases they cannot sell it in Australia. They have to sell it to Asia in competition with the United States and Canada, who also send wastepaper to these markets. This is absurd. We have resources, both forests and wastepaper, and we sell them cheap. We import paper—that is absurd. We spend millions to encourage people to recycle.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The largest and most inexcusable component of urban waste is paper. The former government initially made recycled paper exempt from sales tax as an incentive to industry. It said it would remove the exemption when the Commonwealth shifted to virtually exclusive use of recycled paper, creating an Australian market. It has now removed the incentive to consumers and seems to be buying less and less recycled paper itself. It is abandoning the support of a recycled paper industry just as it is starting. The industry has started slowly, but it is here.
       </para>
       <break page="1194" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to differentiate between a couple of definitions of `recycled'. `Recycled' cannot mean simply cleaning up the scraps from paper making, the offcuts from pads and so on. The recycling we want and need is recycling the paper we encourage consumers to sort and recycle, the paper we collect. This is the paper we need a market for. This is the paper we need to recycle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Because of the hypocrisy of paper makers who do not use real waste, environmentalists have now had to start talking about post-use recycling to make it clear that they are talking about recycling real wastepaper. I think it is a disgrace that the Australian government does not actively pursue a purchasing policy with the express aim of ensuring that the paper it consumes—and we consume a lot—should be virtually exclusively post-use recycled paper.

       <para>
        I must say it is a very rare event that I comment on defence matters post-portfolio responsibility, but it was a classic example of a minister in this place spending four minutes in answering a question and one minute in answering a supplementary question while not addressing one word to the question that Senator Colston asked. You can make two assumptions here: either Senator Newman did not know what she was talking about or there

        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Newman talked about the extensive cuts to the defence budget over recent years. The fact is that this federal defence budget has been reduced by 2.25 per cent in real terms over the last five or six years. That is a disappointment to me but, if you compare that with New Zealand that has come down 22&amp;half; per cent in real terms, the United States that has come down 20 per cent in real terms, the United Kingdom that has come down 16 per cent in real terms and Canada that has come down beyond 15 per cent in real terms, one can see that it is quite a modest reduction.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But Senator Colston's question to Senator Newman asked, in essence: will you keep your promise to sustain the defence budget in real terms and will you avoid the scam of reducing the budget but then forcing Defence to get into a round of property sales to make up the difference? For the last six years Defence has had the absolute right to sell property and retain 100 per cent of that revenue in its own budget in lieu of any increases to the defence budget because of constrained economic circumstances.

        , I think, that there would be more property sales. Senator Newman comes into this chamber on the question of RAAF base Laverton—and I do not disagree with what they are doing there—saying there will be property sales later this year. Those sorts of property sales are likely to increase over the next three years for one good reason: when the property market was down during my tenure in the defence portfolio, we resisted the temptation of bargain basement sales. We waited until the property market improved so that Defence could garner maximum revenue advantage from property sales.

        The other curious factor was that there was no attempt to answer the second part of the supplementary question, which posed the question: will Defence get the benefit of the sale of land at Holsworthy if it transpires that that is the site for the second airport in Sydney? We know there have been secret meetings on this and secret plans made but, as I pick up the hint of that, much of those secret plans hinge on Defence having to cough up 20,000 hectares of land and hand it over to private enterprise for absolutely nothing.

Out of Senator Newman's mouth comes her true belief. Here she is, now representing the status of women for the Prime Minister of this country, sometimes getting up and answering dorothys from you over there about how significant the government is on behalf of women because of the extra number of women in the last election and how you believe in women like you never did before.

I know it is reasonable for you to poke fun at women, that women are a weapon you can utilise; but I do not think that view is shared by the community at large. I made particular note of what Senator Newman said because, bearing in mind a lot of the comments made by the coalition frontbench, it was beyond the pale. She said, `If a housewife ran a budget like that, her husband would have the right to send her packing.'

What concerns me about Senator Newman's comment is not that it endorses the fact that some women carry out a budget but what it says about the relationship between a man and woman in a marriage. Clearly Senator Newman's comments rely upon an inequality in a relationship which allows the husband to determine the value of a woman—if she does not measure up to the values that her husband specifies, then he has the right and the option to discard her as he chooses.

It was a woman saying that, if a wife were to run a budget like that, the husband ought to send her packing.

Relief from double taxation is provided by reducing the amount of the ordinary income gain or capital gain by the amount of the dividend included in assessable income or paid out of profits.

       In speaking to this motion I make the point right at the outset that this is not just another motion of the Senate. This motion raises an issue which goes very much to the core of the constitution of this place and is one which needs to be addressed. It is important because, unless we address it, as we have said consistently over the last few weeks, the status of
       <break page="1204" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        decisions taken by this place could very easily be called into question.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       This is not a question of numbers in the Senate, because we have made it clear that we would ordinarily provide a pair in these sorts of circumstances. This is putting the Senate on notice about the possible incapacity of one of our future members to hold a position here, the consequences of a doubt over that particular person and the impact that that doubt would have on the process of this place.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The first point that needs to be addressed is that the responsibility is primarily on the government. Over the years when issues like this have been raised ministers responsible for electoral matters have taken the initiative and have referred matters like this to the Court of Disputed Returns of the High Court. It is quite apparent that in this particular instance the government is shirking its responsibility. Not only are they not prepared to send this matter off, but they have taken a consistent attitude all the way through of obstructiveness and deceptiveness on this issue, trying to conceal facts and not face the music.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Given that, and the fact that it has taken us so long to get documents from the government about this matter—and we believe there are still more to come—we believe that there is no other option but for the Senate to confront this issue. It is up to us; it is part of our responsibility and is very clearly within our ambit of power.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       What is at question here is whether there has been a breach of section 44 of the constitution. Section 44 of the constitution is that particular provision which ensures that a person who holds an office of profit under the crown shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or member of the House of Representatives. That is the issue that we raise.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In respect of that issue, there are three component parts that need to be addressed. The first is whether a senator-elect is a person who comes under the ambit of section 44 of the constitution—that is, whether the period when a person is a senator-elect is covered in the constitution. It is our contention that Senator-designate Ferris has a number of problems in respect of that issue.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government would have us believe that there is advice from a QC saying, `Everything is all right. She's Jack, mate.' But it was the government's own Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, who on 3 April this year wrote to Senator Minchin and basically said, `Hold your horses. Don't go ahead with this appointment.' Why did he say that? Because he had invoked the advice of the Attorney-General in the previous Liberal government, Senator Durack, and he had invoked the precedent set by a current senator, Senator Michael Baume.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In Senator Durack's letter, which Senator Hill and others on the government side refuse to acknowledge exists, he made it very clear that the period when a person is a senator-elect is a period which falls foul of section 44 of the constitution. For those on the government side who are experts and have spoken in this debate but have not read the letter, I refer them to page 3 of Senator Durack's advice, where he says, and I quote him in full:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Although I appreciate that the matter is one on which a different view can be taken, my own opinion is that section 44 is applicable to senators&amp;hyphen;elect. I have concluded that not only is this the safe view to adopt, but that it is also the correct one.

        We have got the documentation, and we know that that documentation was only pulled together over recent days.

That advice would be irrelevant because this documentation undermines the position Ms Wheeler took as she did not have it before her. We have it, Mr Evans has it and most commentators have it.

         It makes you wonder why Senator Minchin was stupid enough to pursue this route in this way. You can understand how Senators Vanstone and Short fell for it. It was a lack of understanding of the issues, a lack of interest and a lack of application on their part. What you cannot understand is why Senator Hill took exactly the same attitude to his responsibilities as Senators Vanstone and Short did. Senator Hill rushed to judgment early in the piece.

         Government senators could have fronted the music.

Why did he not mention that he and Ferris met with DAS on 11 April 1996? Why did he not mention that he put up her pay on 1 April? Why did he keep her on after 3 April, after Jull's letter? Why did he keep her on after 11 April after they met with Mr Semmens of the Department of Administrative Services? Why did he

         We do have here a consistent attempt by Senator Minchin to cover the facts. That is why our motion does not just go to the position of Senator-designate Ferris but it also goes to the position that Senator Minchin has played in this particular matter. You see, Madam Acting Deputy President, this particular scam has stung two people. Not only has it stung Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris, but Senator Minchin's reputation as a political operator, I think, stands pretty well in disrepute at the end of this particular process.

        The other interesting issue is the basis under which the Senate is seeking to require this matter to be determined by the Court of Disputed Returns, namely, section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. I do not

        Madam Deputy President, when I referred to Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris, do you know why Senator Ray interrupted and said, `No, Senator Ferris'? He did this because he is trying to claim that she has already taken office. He is claiming that she is already sitting here. Senator Ray is forgetting that South Australia already has 12 senators sitting here. At least he is a step ahead of Senator Bolkus—but then again, Senator Ray probably drafted the notice of motion for Senator Bolkus. Senator Ray seems to be drafting most of the questions, notices of motion and other procedural matters for the opposition at the moment.

        To succeed in terms of the legitimacy of taking this matter to the Court of Disputed Returns it either has to apply to a senator or there has to be a vacancy—and in this instance there is neither. There is a provision in the act for petitioning, which would have been the correct and proper procedure at this time, when she is neither a senator nor is there a vacancy. Unfortunately, the opposition have not said it yet but they may also suffer some procedural deficiency in relation to that provision of the Electoral Act. But that is irrelevant because they have not chosen to go down that path.

        The Democrats are an amazing political party. Senator Kernot says there is a problem because there is really no reason why somebody should not be employed during this period of their election and taking office. Nevertheless, when it comes to the vote and the ALP says, `Put up your hands,' the Democrats say, `Of course, we are part of the family; we will meet the commitment you require of us despite the fact that we have introduced private member's bills to try to counter what we say is a deficiency.'

We are yet to hear from the government any serious arguments against some of the principles that have caused us to tend to support the first part of this motion. I would like to say that for us there are three issues here: firstly, the question regarding Senator-elect Ferris's eligibility or disqualification; secondly, whether an offence has been committed by her in knowingly doing something that disqualified her; and, thirdly, whether another senator has also been implicated in any offence which may or may not have occurred.

       The Greens agree with the first point, but we do not agree with the second or third points. We believe there is a question to be asked. There is doubt about the eligibility of Senator-designate Ferris. It is far too complicated an issue for us to be prepared to make a determination. We believe that it clearly is appropriate for referral of the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. We did puzzle at length about whether it was appropriate for the Senate to do that. We believe it is the Senate's responsibility to do so, not simply because it has been brought as a matter to this place and to ignore that would be negligent, but also because of section 376 of the
       <break page="1214" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       It causes the Greens no joy whatsoever to support the first part of this motion. All of us have experienced the anxiety—and impatience in some cases—about coming into this place. I certainly feel that the issue of coming here is one we all remember.

       It seems to me that there is a question about whether sections 44 and 45 of the constitution have been breached.

      <para first-indent="16">
       There is no doubt that Senator-designate Ferris is not a senator. Whether she is to be regarded as a candidate or a senator-elect is unknown to me because the writs were issued after she was holding a position which may or may not be regarded as work or taking profit under the Crown. Therefore, I believe there are questions. Did she hold an office? Was it an office of profit? Was it an office under the Crown? Does the prohibition on being chosen and on sitting as a senator apply? Was her election void? Did her place become vacant? I do not know the answers to any of these questions. I believe the Court of Disputed Returns is the only appropriate place to make such a determination.

       As I have said, we do not find it clear that the question does not need to be asked nor do we find it clear that the second and third points implied in this motion are valid—that some offences were committed by Senator-designate Ferris or by any other senator who is assumed to be, in the words of the motion, aiding and abetting. We assume that is directed to Senator Minchin.

       I did note that Senator Chamarette said that she still had an open mind, to the extent that she was prepared to listen to the debate. I simply want to say this: I am very pleased that you have not supported the second half of this motion, because the critical word in it is `knowingly.' That is the consequence of it. It talks about aiding and abetting, and borrows the words of section 353. `Knowingly' is the critical term, because you have to have contravened the electoral act, the Crimes Act or the regulations. You have to have done it knowingly. In other words, you do not do it accidentally; you do it deliberately.

       You only have to reflect for a moment that no&amp;hyphen;one in their right mind would put at risk a position in the Senate, in order somehow to pick up a couple of extra days pay. What would happen, and what happens perhaps too frequently, and what is the basis for the Australian Democrats private member's bill of 1992 and the Cleary case and others, is that people accidentally do it. Sometimes they take advice that they are in the clear, but they
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        still fall foul of the rules. No&amp;hyphen;one, I would suggest, knowingly would embark on such a short&amp;hyphen;sighted venture. So I think you are perfectly correct in saying that these three paragraphs do not apply, but you should not say that the outcome will depend upon the ruling of the Court of Disputed Returns, because there is still not a skerrick of evidence that anyone knowingly sought to commit an offence. Nor would you ever expect there to be.

It is Bolkus overkill, pure and simple. It is just an attempt to put sleaze on sleaze. If ever anything was abundantly clear, it is that Senator Bolkus for once was telling the truth when he said that he drafted it himself. It is clearly his own work; otherwise you could not possibly have even contemplated putting those particular provisions on the table.

       For our purposes, there are two stages under the electoral act: one is when you are a senator&amp;hyphen;elect and the other is when you take your place. You become a senator on 1 July, even though you have not been formally sworn in, which is when you sit. It is before and after 1 July that is critical in this exercise. They had the opportunity, under section 353, to petition the Court of Disputed Returns. They chose not to do that. They were not prepared to put their money on the table. They simply wanted to wait until the parliament resumed, so they could put the Senate's money on the table and force Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris to go off and defend herself in the High Court, which is not a cheap thing to do unless you throw yourself on the mercy of the court and go there unrepresented. That is what they are doing. They are transferring the cost burden.

      <break page="1216" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
       <para first-indent="16">
        More importantly, the whole structure of the act is that, if you are only a senator&amp;hyphen;elect, you petition. If it is in respect of either a senator, under 376, or a question concerning a vacancy, then the Senate may resolve it. It does not have to; it always retains a discretion. I would have thought what is does above all else is to look at the evidence and decide whether indeed there is a prima&amp;hyphen;facie case. You do not simply say, `There may be an issue here,' or `Perhaps there is a doubt,' or `Wouldn't it be interesting to have this resolved?' That is why I presume you use the expression `we tend to agree.' In other words, you are inclined to think that there may be something to this.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I suggest to you that it is a very unsafe basis on which to then solemnly resolve to refer a matter to the High Court. What the act requires, in these circumstances where you are out of time and have not petitioned within 40 days, is that you then must wait until the senator takes, in this case, her place in the chamber. Then section 376 applies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is likely to happen here, and I suggest will happen, is that when this matter goes to the High Court, they will ask themselves, `Are we now dealing with any question respecting the qualifications of a senator?' The answer has to be no, because by no stretch of the imagination was Jeannie Ferris a senator at the time these matters arose. As we know, by definition, there can only be 76 senators in the Senate chamber. Therefore, she could not possibly be a senator at that time, because she would be the 77th. Indeed, you could throw in all the other senators&amp;hyphen;elect as well. She clearly was not a senator, so the High Court would say, `Well, the other leg of section 376 is: `respecting a vacancy.' It does not say `a potential vacancy'; it says `a vacancy.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One can envisage a situation where, for example, a senator&amp;hyphen;elect dies.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That happened in 1938, with a gentleman by the name of Barnes. That matter was then referred back to the relevant state government and they replaced Barnes because a vacancy had occurred. It was not done under this section. There was not any resolution of the Senate requesting the state government to do it. That is the only situation in which you could say a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          vacancy occurs. Here, you have the prospect of a vacancy if the court finds in your way. What you are really saying is: we want you to presume an offence and therefore a vacancy. Then, having done that, we want to argue the case about whether there is a vacancy. It just cannot be right in logic.
         </break>
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The proper course to take is to wait until 1 July. Then you may well take the view that a question respecting the qualifications of a senator does arise because, as I think is common ground, if you are found to have taken an office of profit under the crown then that renders your term void. So it is void ab initio; it goes back to the very start. That was what Senator Wood found. Even though he had been in the chamber for 18 months or two years, once he was ineligible he was ineligible from the beginning. The same would apply here.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, to the extent that Senator-elect Ferris had contravened, say, section 44 of the constitution, which is what I think is at issue, rather than any sections of the acts, that would render her ineligible to retain her seat and she would be held not to have been a senator at any time. But the time to make that reference is at the time she is a senator; otherwise there is no section of this act that allows the Senate to refer the matter to the High Court, because there is not a vacancy and it is not a question respecting the qualifications of a senator—it is simply respecting a potential vacancy, and that potential turns on the reference of the question. So it is certainly tautological, but it is quite inadequate in terms of the proper processes.

There is a window; you have the 40 days. But the view that is clearly taken by the parliament is that there is no great harm done by allowing that person, once you are outside the 40-day period, to then enter the parliament. Then the issue arises and then it can be dealt with under
         <break page="1217" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          section 376; otherwise the parliament would simply have provided for that. You always have to proceed on the basis that if parliament does not specifically provide for an offence or quasi-offence then it is presumed to have intended not to do it.

        So, when it says that you can petition in respect of an election, that is clearly what it intended to do in respect of a senator-elect. But you have a time limit on it. If you do not do that then you are left to take advantage of section 376—again, when the opportunity arises, and it does not arise until 1 July.

        There is no harm done in those circumstances. Quite clearly, if an issue is then referred to the Court of Disputed Returns, there needs to be sufficient material to justify it. I would still argue that you need to have established a prima facie case and not just something about which some people are concerned. Undoubtedly Senator Bolkus is concerned to unload as many of his political opponents, both on this side and on that side, as possible. But that is not a sufficient basis for taking what is a very serious course of conduct.

        That is why I am surprised, to say the least, that the Australian Democrats and perhaps the Greens somehow think this is going to clarify the issue or that it helps to have it resolved. Senator Kernot's private member's bill in effect said, `This arises time and again. It's about time the parliament did something. There have been innumerable inquiries. They all come up with the same answer. The proper way therefore to resolve it is by way of this bill,' which she introduced into the parliament and which was not able to be dealt with before the parliament was prorogued in early 1993.

        I do not think others in this chamber are quite as cavalier about the matter. Therefore you ought to be bending over backwards to ensure that, if you are going down this path, you do it from the strongest possible base. If you refer this to the High Court now, you run a very real risk that the High Court will say, `This is not to do with the question respecting the qualifications of a senator; it is a senator&amp;hyphen;elect that you are concerned about. It is not respecting a vacancy because there was no

You would have a much stronger case. You would then be dealing with a question respecting the qualifications of a senator. She would be sitting in the chamber; she would be a senator. You could say that there is an issue about her qualifications and, in your view, it would be game, set and match. But, on the current view, I would have thought that you are taking a very real risk. The fact that you are prepared to take that risk speaks volumes for your bona fides in this issue. It means that you are not concerned about the proper processes.

       I would like to correct one erroneous point appearing in some newspapers that this matter could affect the balance in the Senate post-1 July. If for some reason Senate-elect Ferris cannot take her place by then, there is no way that this side would take advantage of that in a numerical sense, and we would automatically grant a pair.

       As I have said before, it is probably of little consequence to those on this side of the house whether Senator Ferris is here or the No. 4 on the ticket arrives. There will be the same numbers. It would make no difference. I understand they are of relatively similar ability, if not different factional alignment. Again, I really cannot be bothered trying to track that through.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The real key question that Senator Alston failed to address is: what happens to the validity of legislation here if Senator Ferris is not properly a senator? In the case of Wood and the case of Webster, the matters were acted upon when they came up. If this is not acted upon here and we knew with knowledge aforethought that there were grave doubts about Senator-elect Ferris's eligibility to serve in this place, we do not know what would then happen in the High Court as to eligibility. In the Cleary case, once he was challenged and knocked out, it did not invalidate any legislation because the moment the petition was taken and acted upon was regarded as the cut&amp;hyphen;off point. It would not be in this case.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are really three or four key questions in this case. The first one is: was Ms Ferris ever employed? Later I will go through the chronology to suggest very strong evidence that she was employed. It is the contention of Senator Minchin and others that she was never actually employed. That is a matter that I cannot determine absolutely, although I would say the evidence strongly points to the fact that she was. The second question to be answered is: was this an office of profit under the Crown under the meaning of section 44 of the constitution? The third question is: if that is correct, if Ms Ferris had accepted an office of profit under the Crown, does this disqualify her from the Senate? That is a question that has never been fully answered by the High Court or anyone else and would be the question they would answer in this case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The last question which is necessary to answer is: if she proves to be ineligible, would there be a count through, as occurred in the Wood case—there was a count through that brought up Senator Irina Dunn—or is it a section 15? It would be very interesting if it is a section 15. This may all become a pointless exercise, because I am sure the South Australian branch would then reappoint Senator Ferris to the post. I am fairly certain that would be the normal political behaviour of any of us. There is some doubt as to that in as much as in the case where someone dies between the close of nominations and, I think, taking their place here, the electoral act and other things indicate that there would need to be a count through.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those are questions the High Court would need to answer. I found it very interesting tonight that Senator Alston did not get to factors other than the legal factor. He tried to mount no defence of government action in this particular matter.

        The matter was first raised on the first sitting day. We were accused of filibustering on this issue. It was not us who took 19 days to answer a very simple question: had the Attorney-General's Department given the Department of Administrative Services advice on this matter? The answer, obviously, from all the documents in the return to order, is that they could have come back the next day
        <break page="1220" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and said, `Yes, but we're not going to provide any of the legal advice.' I think it is quite appropriate not to put down every piece of legal advice to government. But they could have answered it on 2 May. Instead, we had no answer for nine days, which prompted someone on our side to ask Senator Short a question and Senator Short took it on notice.

        When you read the return to order, there is all of this advice, all of these documents generated, these meetings—all of this occurred, yet Senator Short could not answer these very simple questions. Surely, he had a brief, going through all of that. Was it just stage fright? Did he just panic? Why didn't he answer those questions? And why did Senator Vanstone, on 20 May or thereabouts, answer on behalf of Senator Short those particular questions?

        That prompted our side of politics to move for a return to order. It is from that return to order and many other things on the record that one can start to understand the chronology of events. I will just run through them rather quickly.

       <para first-indent="16">
        On 18 March, Senator Minchin writes, to whom it may concern, confirming his wish to appoint Senator Ferris to the position of assistant adviser from 18 March until 28 June inclusive. He confirms the salary details of an ASO6, with a salary of $40,080 per year and a ministerial staff allowance of $11,200—very interesting pay for a volunteer. He then signs a work contract on the same day. Ms Ferris signs a work contract; Ms Dunstan witnesses that contract.

        On 18 March, Senator Minchin writes to Ms Feely of the Prime Minister's office, advising of wanting to appoint Ms Ferris. On 20 March, Ms Ferris starts travelling on the travel warrants according to her job. And where does she go? Adelaide&amp;hyphen;Canberra, Qantas 474, first class, costing $499. She returns, Canberra&amp;hyphen;Adelaide, on 21 March on Ansett 185. On 25 March, Senator Minchin writes to Minister Jull advising he has—and I quote:

        He goes on to note the appointment period of 18 March to 28 June. He also notes in the letter that Ms Ferris is a senator&amp;hyphen;elect due to take up her position on 1 July.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We then go to 28 March. The DAS pay sheet for Ms Ferris, for pay period 19, indicates that Ms Ferris is paid three days salary and three days MSA, which is a gross of $604. After tax, there is a net of $512.64. We then go to pay period 20, where Ms Ferris is paid 10 days salary and 10 days MSA, with a gross of $2,015.16; tax comes out and she nets $1,391.86.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 28 March, the Department of Administrative Services faxes a cover sheet referring to the Ferris request to recommence contributions to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Here we have a volunteer joining the Commonwealth superannuation scheme! No one knows more about this than Senator Sherry and our very gracious Acting Deputy President. They would be very surprised to know that volunteers can go into the superannuation scheme.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We then have a whole series of travel around the country, for which travel warrants were obviously signed off by Senator Minchin or one of his delegated staff members, in which Ms Ferris attends to the duties of her office. We then have the rather curious correspondence on 1 April 1996. I am conscious of the date but apparently it is actual correspondence. Ms Ferris having been in the job for 13 or 14 days, Senator Minchin writes to Ann Richards of the Department of Administrative Services, referring to his prior correspondence between himself and DAS and noting that he could appoint an adviser on a commencement salary of $49,932. He advises that he wishes Ms Ferris to go on that. Pretty good work, after 13 days, to get a 22 per cent pay rise! It is good money if you can get it. Again, a volunteer getting a 22 per cent pay rise is pretty good. We then have a whole series of travel commitments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        However, someone in the Department of Administrative Services does some good staff work. Right throughout this, I have very little criticism of Mr Jull and the Department of Administrative Services because I think they have done their job pretty well. They twigged
        <break page="1221" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to this—that this was a problem, that this may well disqualify Ms Ferris. So Graham Semmens' file note indicates he will advise Mr Jull in a submission regarding these matters. That submission goes in on 2 April. Ms Ferris is still flying around the country doing her duty.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, signs a letter, above the submission, to Senator Minchin, advising that he does not intend to approve Ms Ferris's appointment at this stage. He attaches a copy, very significantly, of Senator Durack's opinion on the meaning of section 44 as it applies to senators&amp;hyphen;elect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At that stage Ms Richards, whom I have mentioned before, urgently faxes the National Australia Bank, confirming a phone call that day to retrieve the second tranche of salary, and gets that returned. Ms Ferris does not know about that yet. The matters go on until 11 April, when there is a meeting here in Parliament House. I put on the record that I misrepresented this the other day and Senator Minchin berated me for it. I have to say the documents in the return to order are handwritten and very hard to read. Nevertheless, I acknowledge it was not on Easter Monday, but on 11 April. For that, I apologise. Nevertheless, a government which put out those documents should have gone back to the original person and got a typed version rather than a handwritten one. However, I regret that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They met here in Parliament House—that is, Ms Ferris, Graham Semmens and Senator Minchin. They discussed the fact that the payment of three days salary to Ms Ferris may have jeopardised her position as a senator&amp;hyphen;elect. They advised that DAS had discussed the matter with the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department and stated that DAS had not paid the next salary payment due to Ms Ferris, and explained why. In fact, they had paid it but they then retrieved it from the bank.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The file note noted that this was okay with Ms Ferris and pointed out that the constitutional position was not one for DAS but rather for them. And then Ms Ferris travels home, which I think is the last time she uses
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         departmental resources to travel or salary or travel allowance.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is only on 19 April—eight days later—that Ms Ferris writes to DAS returning the money and advising that she will not take up the appointment. It is only 19 April that Senator Minchin writes to DAS cancelling the appointment. So, effectively, from 18 March to 19 April, Ms Ferris was holding an office and an office of profit under the crown, if it is so defined under the MOPS act, and in fact received remuneration, travel allowance, airfares—and cab fares, as we found out today in those circumstances.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is basically the chronology of it and therefore there is a very strong case that Ms Ferris was employed. I do not think that that can be contradicted very much. And I think there is a very strong case that because she was employed by a member of the Executive Council she held an office of profit under the crown.

        The one thing I am not going to comment on is whether the High Court would therefore say that she has forfeited her position as a senator&amp;hyphen;elect. That is for them to determine; I cannot. It has been the general view, expressed not only in the Durack thing but time and time again, that senators&amp;hyphen;elect cannot take government employment. For those elected in 1980 there was an eight&amp;hyphen;month wait for those who were, in some senses, public servants. A lot of hard times; a lot of people stood out.

         In the course of this debate, a few other remarkable things have come up. First of all, I listened to Senator Hill's defence of Ms Ferris, who described this as a witch&amp;hyphen;hunt. It is no such thing. Senator Hill's contribution today reminded me of the old maxim by Lenin; he gave her the same support as the rope supports the hanging man. I really thought it was a weak defence. I was rather pleased in some way that the old journeyman middleweight, Senator Alston, the star of Melbourne's lesser magistrates courts, only really went to the legal matters and did not go to any of the matters of cover&amp;hyphen;up—and there have been plenty of those in this particular matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The one area that has not been fully explained to me regarding cover&amp;hyphen;up or veracity goes back to Senator Minchin's statement to this chamber on 22 May. I am really puzzled by this. Senator Minchin said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Following the federal election, Ms Ferris, on my advice, sought information regarding the status of a senator&amp;hyphen;elect in relation to section 44 of the constitution.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While it is my strong view that section 44 does not apply to senators&amp;hyphen;elect, I felt it prudent that Ms Ferris obtain her own legal advice before considering any public sector employment in the period after the election and before 1 July.
        </para>
        <para>
         Well, where is that advice? When did it occur? Or was this just a post facta defence of Senator Minchin that he, as a political professional, was smart enough to think of? Or is the advice that he is talking about the advice that was tabled here today? That is a critical question as to Senator Minchin's future—absolutely critical that he did not mislead the Senate on these matters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legal advice, which has been tabled by Senator Hill today and which naturally none of us has had a chance yet to read and comprehend, is dated 17 May. If there is not another set of legal advice, if this is the legal advice on which they based their activity, then Senator Minchin's statement here in the parliament on 22 May could be described at the very least as grossly dissembling. He was invited to clarify this matter by me in two speeches that day and never once addressed it. It does go massively to his credibility in these particular issues.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          A few other matters have been brought up here today. One of them was Senator Hill asking how we could, in some ways abusing taxpayers' money, refer this matter to the High Court. So I went back as he was speaking to check where he was on the day that we had the debate on the Wood case. I found that he was in divisions that day, so he must have been around Parliament House. No division was called on the Wood matter; it was referred off without a division. Implicit in that is Senator Hill's full support for that process back in 1989. And he comes in here today and says that we are in some ways abusing Senate power or wasting taxpayers' money when there we had Senator Hill himself implicitly voting to send these matters off to the High Court.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Senator Hill said that had read the advice of the Clerk of the Senate and he did not agree with it. Why not? That is only one set of advice; we now have a second set of advice before us from Ms Wheeler QC and we have the Durack advice. The point I want to make is that it is beyond my ability to reconcile that conflicting advice, and I want to suggest that that is why we pay High Court judges. That is why the Electoral Act and other matters are written in the manner they are: to let judges ultimately determine these matters.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In summary, these matters could have been addressed much more quickly by government. There is no excuse for a 19&amp;hyphen;day delay in Senator Vanstone's answer. There is no excuse that, in answering for Senator Short, all the detail was omitted from Senator Short's answer. We asked whether she had had any pay or condition. No answer. When the additional answer was put down in this place on 20 May, or whenever it was, there was no attempt to answer that section of the question.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then we had Senator Minchin coming in here to give his personal explanation, which must be one of the most cleverly crafted pieces of work I have ever seen. I have already mentioned that he referred to legal advice—presumably the Wheeler advice which was not commissioned until 17 May—as though it had been produced before 18 March. If I am wrong in saying that, where is
          <break page="1223" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           the advice? I do not want to read the advice because it may be private to Ms Ferris and Senator Minchin, but I want to know that it existed and that we were not being duped in this place just to maintain the political professional reputation of an apparatchik from South Australia. People know that I do not use that term in a condemnatory way.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I want to know whether that has all been constructed in this statement. Because, frankly, if it has been, given the Prime Minister's glorified code of conduct, Senator Minchin should be dismissed as parliamentary secretary on that ground alone. Whether he should be dismissed for political stupidity, as Senator Schacht has unkindly said, is another matter. I find it hard to understand how a so-called consummate political operator could make these basic mistakes and jeopardise Ms Ferris's immediate career in this chamber. I cannot understand how he could do it. Senator Hill is wrong when he says that we are trying to run some vendetta against Ms Ferris. There is no evidence whatsoever to point to our doing that.

          Senator Alston made the point that, in his own legal analysis, he thought this motion was being moved at the wrong time.

Even when she is sworn in and takes her place in here, I understand that the matter can still be taken to the High Court.

It should go to the High Court for determination, and hopefully we will have a determination well before 1 July. Those efforts by the government to cover up this matter have been exposed by the return to order, and Senator Minchin's dissembling statement in this chamber has now been exposed. He should come in here today to explain the sequence of events and his actions, but he has been absent. Rather than directly reflect on—

       The motion is that the various questions relating to the `qualification of one or more senators be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns pursuant to section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act'. That motion will have to be amended to `one senator', which has also been acknowledged by the statements of Senator Bolkus and Senator Ray. I do not know whom else they could be talking about. Perhaps Senator Bolkus wants to refer all of our positions or qualifications to the Court of Disputed Returns. I presume what is meant by that particular—

       There are four, actually, but there are three ways that are open to question the qualifications of a senator. Before I do that, I remind the Senate of section 44, which I will go to in a minute. But the three ways are: section 355 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which provides for a petition. That has been canvassed quite considerably here and 355 says:
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        in this Part called the petition shall:
       </para>
       <para>
        And it sets out what it shall do. The petition must be lodged within 40 days after the notification of that choice or appointment. Referring to section 44 of the constitution and referring to the question of holding an office of profit under the crown, it says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any person who—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, section 355 of the act relates to the question of the choice of the senator. It does not relate to the question of whether the senator is eligible to sit. The constitution has an `or' there:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        One would have thought that if one were incapable of being chosen to be a senator, one would have been incapable of sitting as a senator. No doubt that is a matter that would otherwise be discussed. But, so far as section 355 is concerned, the opportunity for petitioning the court has ceased; it is no longer there.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think Senator Bolkus was suggesting that the date on which the Governor&amp;hyphen;General received the writs was 21 April. If you were taking it from that particular standpoint, a couple of days are still left. But, in fact, it was the state governor of South Australia who issued the writ and the provision in the constitution relating to the return of that writ, of course, relates to its return to the state government, namely, return to the sender. The actual timing of when the state governor received the return of the writ was 11 April. So that, in fact, the time has run out for section 355 to operate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second availability is the provisions in section 376. I am not going into the question of the facts. The facts have been tabled in this Senate and there has been and will be considerable argument about the implications of
        <break page="1225" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         those particular facts. Section 376 provides that:

        Any question respecting the qualifications of a Senator or of a Member of the House of Representatives or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament may be referred by resolution to the Court of Disputed Returns—
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what is proposed here. There are a number of questions but two come to mind: whether the alleged breach of the constitution that Ms Ferris did hold an office of profit under the crown whilst seeking to be chosen as a senator, is a matter that the Court of Disputed Returns could deal with. Does the constitution, by the wording of section 44, mean a person who may at that time have held an office of profit under the crown—that is, during the time of the election and before the return of the writs—so that her incapability of being chosen would be a matter for consideration of the court pursuant to this particular resolution?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is a question the answer to which I am not sure of, given the fact that section 355 was quite specific about the time limits and that those time limits, of course, have gone. The courts may not be able to consider that matter. There is a question as to whether Senator-elect Ferris, Ms Ferris, was holding an office of profit under the crown after she was chosen—that is to say, after the writs were returned to the Governor of South Australia. I am not sure of those facts, and I do not know whether anybody around here is either. But I think the opposition should be conscious of that particular matter. The opposition may be referring this to the Court of Disputed Returns and find, if the other question is unable to be considered—that is to say, the eligibility of that particular person to be chosen during the course of the election—that that is excluded and we are back to square one.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second part of the argument, of course, is in the constitution where it states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, Ms Ferris currently is not the holder of an office of profit under the crown. Also, she is not—or is she?—currently a sitting
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         member. So is she incapable of sitting as a member? The issue really is whether a senator is a sitting senator before that senator has sat. I think that is an issue to be taken into account when considering this particular motion.

       I just want to make a couple of comments on the contributions made by some of the previous speakers in this debate. I turn to Senator Alston's remarks that you cannot take action until Senator Ferris is sworn in as a sitting senator. I wanted to refer to section 360 of the electoral act, which deals with the powers of the court, that is, the High Court operating as the Court of Disputed Returns. Section 360, clause (3), says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Without limiting the powers conferred by this section, it is hereby declared that the power of the Court to declare that any person who was returned as elected was not duly elected, or to declare an election absolutely void, may be exercised on the ground that illegal practices were committed in connexion with the election.
      </para>

       What clause (3) implies to me is that this takes effect once the person was declared elected, before they even took up their seat in the Senate. I was at the ceremony where Senator Ferris was declared elected because I was also declared elected at the same time in early April. The writ was returned to the state governor on 10 April, declaring Senator
       <break page="1227" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        Ferris elected with the other six senators from South Australia.

       I believe that is a reasonably clear indication that the Court of Disputed Returns, which is the High Court in this case, can deal with somebody who has been declared elected. It does not have to wait until they are actually sworn in, which happens some time after the return of the writ. I think the High Court does have the power. I have to concede that there are older hands around this place on legal matters with due experience who might say that that is not the right interpretation, but it does seem to me an indication that on the date you are declared elected this takes effect. I say again that I was a witness to her election being declared because I was at the ceremony when it happened, where I was also declared elected. So I think that point from Senator Alston can be dismissed.

       The issue that Senator Harradine raises with some concern is that the 40 days has run out as far as a petition to the Court of Disputed Returns is concerned. As I understand the act, that is to do with the actual conduct of the election, not with the eligibility of a person to stand. This is an area where I think the major point of dispute is, and I believe the High Court is the only relevant body to rule on that eligibility question.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I point out to Senator Harradine that the opposition has been a bit hung out to dry on this issue of the 40 days anyway. In order to seek information, we raised the issue on the first day the parliament returned—that was on 30 April, if I remember correctly. It was not until 22 May, when Senator Minchin made a substantial statement, that a whole range of issues then became clearer to the opposition, the Senate and the people of Australia. Clearly, Senator-elect Ferris had been receiving some payment, in some form or other, from the Commonwealth government of Australia. Senator Minchin said that she had received three days pay and some expenses for travel to other parts. Subsequently, when we got the return to order, we found it was much more substantial than anything Senator Minchin had suggested in his statement on 22 May.

       I say to Senator Harradine: 22 May just so happens to be 40 days after the writ was

        returned by the state government. It seems to us that there was a government plan for Senator Minchin not to make his statement until the 40 days was up so that this technical point—that the petition could not be lodged—could be raised. We do not accept that point, because it is a question of eligibility, not a question of the conduct of the election.

       The opposition thinks it is more than coincidence that Senator Minchin gave his major statement on the issue on 22 May—three weeks after we first raised the issue in the parliament. I say to Senator Harradine: you cannot, in commonsense, allow a process to take place whereby, when relevant questions are asked about what is going on, when a matter has been legitimately raised and when we as a Senate are waiting for the information to come back, someone can delay the process hoping that the 40 days falls out. I would have thought any court, under process, under administrative law, would have said that the question was first raised, information was sought, on 30 April. Of course, it was after Senator Minchin's statement that the Senate decided to put a return to order on papers and documents. The whole case spilled out when those documents were tabled earlier this week. Even today we had further material tabled by Senator Hill.

      <para first-indent="16">
       We think Senator Minchin has a case to answer about why he waited to make his statement until he could see the 40&amp;hyphen;day period was up. That is a very important point to us. Did the government take a deliberate decision to wait till the 40 days was up and then argue the case? Senator Harradine has raised that. I think we have said why we think the timing of the government's statements is unacceptable.

       Senator Minchin relies greatly on the statement of advice from Ms Wheeler. He said that Senator-elect Ferris was advised to go and get this opinion, or get some legal opinion, before she took up employment with Senator Minchin. The implication so far has been that that advice was from Ms Wheeler QC. However, the date on the document of advice that has now been tabled is 17 May, which is about a month after Senator-elect Ferris started employment on the staff of
       <break page="1228" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

      <para first-indent="16">
       There may be other legal advice that has not yet been tabled, but we are now of the view that there is a substantial case that the advice he said he got was actually the advice of Ms Wheeler on 17 May. If that is really the case, then Senator Minchin has, by at least omission—the best light you could put on it—misled the Senate. At the worst, he has deliberately misled the Senate by saying that this advice from Wheeler is the advice that Senator-elect Ferris took on board to enable her to take up the position with him on 18 March. If it is not, I think it is imperative that before this parliament finishes this week—preferably tomorrow or even before this debate finishes—Senator Minchin should tell us whether Wheeler's advice is the only advice that Senator-elect Ferris took. Then he has to explain how the advice tabled in parliament today is dated 17 May—a full month after Senator-elect Ferris took up her position.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The next question we would ask is: who paid for Ms Wheeler's advice? Was it paid for by Senator-elect Ferris? Was it paid for by the Liberal Party of South Australia? Was it paid for by the Australian government? These are relevant questions which, I suspect, in the end, if this motion does lead to the matter going to the High Court, will become matters that the High Court will become interested in. The Senate deserves a decent answer to those questions. Who paid for the advice? Who commissioned the advice? The dates are really imperative. If there is any other advice that Ms Ferris took on before 18 March, she should fire up Senator Minchin or the government to table that advice as well. Otherwise, it seems to us that there has been a clear case of rewriting history, rewriting the facts, to suit the government's case. The government has been sprung since 30 April when the parliament first sat. That case is now to us looking overwhelming.

I do not have the same view about retrospectivity from time to time, but I do accept that it is a matter you do not take on lightly. Here we may have a case where Senator Minchin has retrospectively tried to fix the advice to cover his trail in making a very stupid error in appointing—as all the evidence now tabled in the parliament shows—Senator-elect Ferris on 18 March.

       Senator Minchin says the appointment took place on 18 March; that is, before the writ was declared, before she formally became senator&amp;hyphen;elect. One notes from the appointment document, though, that he appointed her only to 28 June, two days before the term of the new Senate starts. Everybody in South Australia knew on election night on 2 March—it was the clearest cut election in the Senate in South Australia since proportional representation was introduced—that the Liberal Party had three quotas, the Labor Party had two quotas and the Democrats had one quota. Everybody knew who were the six senators who were going to be elected in South Australia.

       There was no distribution of preferences at any stage in the South Australian count to get a senator elected. The only distribution was the transfer that took place on the tickets of each of the three parties. There was a very small transfer from Senator Stott Despoja. She got 14 per cent, with a little left over. The Labor Party, unfortunately, got only two quotas with a little left over—a couple of per cent—and the Liberal Party got three clear quotas.

He knew that on 1 July she would become a senator in this place

       The next thing we come to is the advice that has been flying around as to whether the senator&amp;hyphen;elect is eligible to stand in the Senate and the impact her holding an office of profit under the crown would have. So far, we have different pieces of advice. We have the advice from Miss Wheeler on behalf of Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris and Senator Minchin, saying that there is no doubt that the senator&amp;hyphen;elect is able and eligible to take her place. We have the advice of former Senator Durack, a former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General. That has been tabled in this place. It is referred to in Mr Jull's letter warning Senator Minchin. He refers to the advice of Senator Durack—a Liberal Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, a long&amp;hyphen;serving and distinguished senator in this place. He said that office of profit under the crown means senator&amp;hyphen;elect and that there is grave doubt about the process.

          The final thing I want to comment on, which other senators have mentioned, is this section of the constitution. Clearly, I do not think the founding fathers believed that this clause would create such difficulties in interpretation in a practical sense for common, ordinary people being elected in view of the fact that many millions of people in one form or another may be claimed to at one stage or another have an office of profit under the Crown. It is something that we are stuck with. The only way to change it is through a referendum, and maybe one day there can be agreement on that. I commend the motion to the Senate.

Clearly, what we are talking about is the future of a woman who put her herself up for election, submitted herself to the people and was overwhelmingly elected.

       This is a serious matter and I do not think it reflects well on this chamber, or on those who have partaken in the debate to date and have tried to limit the scope of the debate to some fairly cheap political points.

       Senator Bolkus claims credit for this motion, and that is fine. But as Senator Harradine has pointed out, if there is going to be the deletion of subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f), then clearly the motion will need further amendment in relation to the words `one or more senators'. Also of interest to me is the contribution made by Senator Ray, who was so anxious to point out that we were talking not about a senator-elect but a senator-designate. If you have a look at subparagraph (a) of the motion, Senator Bolkus refers to the person that we are talking about as a senator-elect, not as a senator-designate. It is up to the Labor Party, who are pursuing this line, to get their terminology right and decide exactly what it is and what it ought be.

       As I pointed out at the beginning, we have a situation where we are dealing with somebody's future. I believe that natural justice ought to come into play. Senator Schacht was very big on that in his discussion, and said that natural justice demands that the matter be dealt with. He is saying that natural justice demands that the matter be dealt with in this chamber in the absence of Senator-elect Ferris without giving her the opportunity to put her case to the Senate as to the circumstances surrounding the matter.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Indeed, Senator Schacht tried to make a big point out of whether or not we could believe Senator Minchin's submission to this Senate on, I believe, 22 May 1996, about the legal advice that Senator-elect Ferris had got on the issue. Surely the only person who can answer that is Senator-elect Ferris. Senator Minchin will be going only on hearsay of what Senator-elect Ferris tells him. He does not know what Senator-elect Ferris did. She does. We are talking about principles of natural justice but we are denying the person who is at the very centre of this discussion the right to make a contribution to this Senate's deliberations on the matter. That is regrettable and unfortunate.

       It was somewhat strange to hear the comments of Senator Schacht, who was talking about such high principles as natural justice and yet was very quick to slip into some unnecessary political commentary that was irrelevant to the issue at stake. I have a copy of the clerk's opinion, dated 27 May 1996, in front of me. Nowhere does it say that there is an overwhelming case, as suggested by Senator Schacht. If he was dealing with the issue with the mature, statesman-like approach that he tried to assert he was using—before he could not help himself and he slipped back into the mud-slinging—he would have quoted the clerk's advice correctly. He would have directed us to the pages and the paragraphs. The clerk has given an opinion, but nowhere has he used the word `overwhelming'.

       Section 44 of the constitution deals with two types of people: those capable of being chosen and those who are sitting. They are

        the two categories of people. In this case, section 44 of the constitution says, `Any person who holds any office of profit under the Crown shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator.' That is the relevant piece in our discussion this afternoon and this evening.

       Senator-elect Ferris has clearly been chosen. There was no suggestion that she was disqualified from being chosen. Nobody on the other side of the chamber has asserted that. As Senator Harradine pointed out, if there were to be some dispute about her entitlement to be so chosen, there are procedures under the Commonwealth Electoral Act that can be pursued. If those avenues were not pursued, then that area is closed off.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       So we then have to consider whether or not Senator-elect Ferris is a sitting senator. Clearly she is not a sitting senator. I put this scenario to you, Mr Acting Deputy President: it is not beyond the realm of possibility that six senators are not re-elected at a half Senate election and another six are. So there would be six sitting senators waiting for 30 June and another six who are senators-elect waiting for 30 June so as to take up their seats. In that circumstance, the opposition is trying to assert that there would in fact be 18 people to whom the provisions of the constitution could apply in relation to being in the category of a senator for the purposes of section 44.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Clearly that is not the case. The constitution quite clearly says that there can be only 12 senators in a particular state. Senator Harradine made the very neat point of order during Senator Schacht's speech and asked whether the standing orders apply to Senator-elect Ferris. Of course they do not. She does not enjoy the privileges of—dare I quote the constitution—`a sitting senator'.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That is the important point that needs to be grasped; she does not enjoy the privileges of a sitting senator. Senator Harradine very neatly pointed that out with—and I am sure he will not mind me saying so—a frivolous point of order. But it made the point very neatly and is something that ought to be exercising the collective mind of the Senate.

One would have thought that the drafters of the constitution would have known that there would have been the three categories: those capable of being chosen; those who are currently, like Senator-elect Ferris, in limbo land, the senators-elect who do not get any privileges of office; and those who are sitting senators.

So there was an intention but it was never consummated. The contract was never actually entered into. That is a very important and fine point. It is interesting to see that none of those opposite have dealt with the Christine Wheeler QC opinion. They just skate over that.

        It may well be that the High Court simply says, `Under section 376, the person whom you are referring to us is not a senator and therefore we do not have jurisdiction,' and bounces it right out without even considering the argument of section 44 of the constitution. That is why we are saying to you on the other side that, if you want to overcome that hurdle and really want to come to grips with what section 44 of the constitution means, delay the matter until after 1 July. Then you will be in the situation of being able to use section 376, because then Ms Ferris will be Senator Ferris. We may well go through the farcical situation where the High Court says, `Bad luck. She's not a senator. We can't entertain your application,' and then a month or two later go through it all again. Senator Schacht talks about natural justice.

        The other matter that I refer to is section 370 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which tells us that no party to the petition shall, except by consent of all parties or by leave of the court, be represented by a counsel or solicitor. Who is going to be representing the Senate in the arguments? Undoubtedly counsel. Therefore, one would assume and imagine that in the case of Ms Ferris, even if there was not consent of all the parties, leave would be granted by the High Court. She will incur considerable cost—possibly only to be told first off that she is not a senator under section 376. Then the taxpayers will have to pay the costs of that hearing, I would suggest, because under section 371 the court may award costs against an unsuccessful party to

We on this side call those things the cheap shots of Senator Schacht. Why the indecent haste?
