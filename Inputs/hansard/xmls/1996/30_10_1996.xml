        One of the key challenges this nation faces is to preserve its natural environmental capital for the benefit of our children and grandchildren.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australians overwhelmingly believe that environment protection and economic growth are equally important. The challenge for Australia is to sustain the rapid advances in living standards that have been achieved in the 20th century in a way that protects the life support systems which are increasingly threatened.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is a challenge that all governments around the world must accept. Every society has a responsibility to future generations to leave an environment which is at least as healthy and productive as the one they inherit.

        The purpose of this Bill is to tackle these challenges head-on by establishing a one billion dollar Natural Heritage Trust of Australia.

        Let me put the initiative in its proper context.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have inherited an environment in serious difficulties. Little of our natural environment has escaped modification, and what remains is under increasing pressure. It is estimated that over 5 million hectares of native vegetation were cleared during the decade between 1983 and 1993. Once widespread species are declining. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird and 68 plant species are already presumed extinct. Many of our wetlands have disappeared and the water quality and flows of our key rivers are dramatically reduced. The productive capacity of our land has been damaged through erosion, salinity, loss of structure or acidification.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These problems have a direct impact on people in our community who, quite rightly, expect quality water to drink and clean air to breathe. They do not want to see precious soils blown away in the wind, blue-green algae spoiling our rivers and streams, or our unique flora and fauna at risk.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The establishment of this Trust enables Australia to take a dramatic leap forward in the sustainable management of our natural capital. It provides the opportunity to take a new approach to environmental protection and natural resource management, and to design and integrate programs to ensure strong multiple outcomes.

         OPERATION OF THE TRUST

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill will establish the Trust and provide for it to be known as the "Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve". The initial capital of one billion dollars to be invested in the Trust will come from the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In effect, the transfer of funds from the partial sale of Telstra into the Natural Heritage Trust represents a transfer from investment in a telecommunications company to an investment in natural capital. Maintaining and restoring this natural capital is an investment in the well-being of future generations of Australians.
       </para>

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not by chance that the Government's natural heritage package is focused around the big issues of our time—land and water degradation; coastal protection and the conservation of biodiversity.

        Each has a compelling claim on our resources, but if we were to simply deal with each separately the results would be modest. We would be perpetuating the mistakes of the past if we were to attempt to deal with each of these issues in isolation from each other.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Trust, and the range of initiatives it will support, is based on a recognition that an integrated approach is needed right across the spectrum of problems we face. The initiatives to be funded from the Trust have therefore been strategically developed around five interdependent environmental packages:
       </para>

         —We are dealing with the first schedule of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The objectives contained in the schedule provide an opportunity to make a general comment on the principles underlying this bill, as well as to comment on the particular amendments which we will be moving during discussion of this schedule in the debate. The outline given to us yesterday by Senator Campbell on behalf of the government in respect of this section were extraordinarily superficial, for what are the objectives of an act? The objectives of any act are an important indication of the philosophy and the major themes that are identified in the act.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In dealing with a matter of this significance, I find the superficiality of the approach of the government extraordinary in respect of the
        <break page="4719" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         changes that they are advancing, as well as justifying the various objectives that are outlined. Frankly, that does not come as a surprise, given this government's attitude to industrial relations, which is extraordinarily superficial generally. Their approach to industrial relations is marked by grandiose claims about the requirement for industrial relations reform in order to regenerate the economy.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some two or three months ago, the grandiose claims included reduction in unemployment. They have dropped that line in recent months. They are now taking a much lower profile as a justification for reducing unemployment. I am sure they are doing this because they have looked at both the official estimate in the budget and the official projection for unemployment—which they refuse to release—which, I have no doubt, will show that unemployment is likely to remain high for some years and that the contribution that industrial relations reform makes in that area, at best, will be very minimal.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have the superficiality of the government in dealing with the objectives clause. The grandiose claims they make—the jargon they use about the requirement for flexibility, releasing the chains and shackles of the industrial relations system, the surge in productivity, and the absolute guarantee that the Prime Minister gave that no worker would be worse off—are the sorts of superficiality that we contend are manifestly incorrect and untrue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When looking at the objectives of the act, I want to comment on the agreed statement of the Australian Democrats and the Liberal government. It is a fairly extraordinary document. In my six years in the Senate, I cannot recall a time when the government moved amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as they are in this objectives section and, indeed, will be doing right throughout the bill. There may be some strategic advantage for the government in moving the amendments first, but I am surprised that the Australian Democrats would accept and adopt that position.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         The document itself, containing some 100 pages including 171 amendments and, obvi ously, some amendments to the objectives in schedule 1, is almost like a peace treaty in its breadth. It is a fairly extraordinary position that the Australian Democrats and the Liberal government have adopted in terms of the process. The unusual approach that has been adopted by the Democrats and the Liberals does not end with the objectives. We find that this agreement, as it relates to objectives and to all other schedules in the bill, is essentially an outcome that we could foresee, but it is a regrettable outcome because it confirms our worst fears about this industrial relations bill.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What has emerged will bring about some improvement of the government's initial proposal. I draw the attention of government senators, particularly backbenchers, to the policy that they took to the election. Look at what Minister Reith laid down when he first released the bill some two months ago and look at what has now been agreed between the Australian Democrats and the Liberal Party as a consequence of their deal which is reflected in this document.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        From our perspective, the bill which was released two months ago with the objectives contained therein, was an atrocious and unfair bill. I and my colleagues spoke extensively in the second reading debate on behalf of the Labor opposition about the various aspects of the unfairness and the atrocious position which this government and to some extent the Australian Democrats have now adopted as a consequence of this document. We will deal with that in considerable detail in this committee stage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What they have done by this agreed statement of position is turn an atrocious and unfair bill that we fundamentally oppose—and will still continue to fundamentally oppose, albeit we will be moving a significant number of amendments—into an unsatisfactory bill that still contains many areas that are unfair and unsatisfactory. This is certainly highlighted in the objectives of the bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as we are concerned, this deal—this agreed statement of position—between the government and the Australian Democrats will continue to leave Australian workers at a significant disadvantage. There will be less security for Australian workers concerning
        <break page="4720" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         their wages and conditions. Australian workers will be less secure about their jobs. They will be exposed to an increase in individual contracts and their right to collectively bargain will be significantly undermined. As I said earlier, now not even the strongest advocates of this bill are saying that it will do anything to reduce unemployment by the end of this century.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, with respect to this agreed statement of position and deal between the Democrats and the Liberal government, I can recall some two months ago when we foreshadowed extensive amendments—some 300&amp;hyphen;odd amendments that we are pursuing in the committee stage—the shock and horror that the minister, Mr Reith, expressed about how dare we foreshadow such an extensive range of amendments. How dare we do that. They had a policy and they were determined to pursue it. They had legislation. Why should we as a Labor opposition put forward such a range of amendments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yet here today, and for the first time publicly released on Sunday—we had the opportunity to read them in some detail yesterday—we have 171 amendments from the government and the Australian Democrats vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis their deal. Contrast that with the statements from Minister Reith some months ago complaining about any foreshadowed range of amendments that Labor put forward. Yet we are given one day's notice of what was worked out between the Liberals and the Australian Democrats.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn to the objectives of the bill. We make it very clear in paragraph (a) that the act is to provide a framework for cooperative industrial relations, not just cooperative workplace relations, as is provided for in the government's objectives, and supported by the Australian Democrats. It is important to understand that industrial relations is not just about workplace relations and workplace negotiation. That is an important part of industrial relations. The objectives of the government purely focus on cooperative workplace relations when there should be an industry wide focus in addition to a workplace focus. This should be contained in the objectives of the bill, and it is not.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also add a requirement in paragraph (a) to encourage the pursuit of better pay. How many times has the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, reminded us that industrial relations and their approach is all about better pay for every Australian worker? Why isn't it in this bill as part of the objectives? Better pay for everyone is the nirvana that the Prime Minister promised. Where is that in the objectives of this bill? All their rhetoric has been focused on this issue.

         —The Greens totally oppose the philosophical directions that are so apparent in the principal object clause of this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. It is important to clearly state that the principal object clause is not just a superfluous item of rhetorical flare. Potentially, it can be used in any legal interpretation of clauses in the bill which are deemed to be unclear in intent or ambiguous. Debate on this clause is therefore very important. For example, the government's principal object clause states that the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia can be achieved through achieving such things as `international competitiveness' and `a flexible labour market'.

        This is the latter day equivalent of the trickle&amp;hyphen;down effect and it is, in effect, a code for the reduction of pay and conditions for the vast majority of workers, particularly unskilled or low skilled workers. These workers will be forced to compete with the low wages and conditions that are endemic in developing countries. The alternative is unemployment as Australian corporations chase those low wages in developing nations. It is all part of the international race to the bottom that is a part of the new internationalism that was started by the previous Labor government with the strong support of the coalition.

        As I say, I believe that a lot of the issues revolve around this belief that was started with the ALP in relation to the push for international competitiveness in order to try to make up for the deficiencies in what was meant to come as the huge benefits of free international trade. The issue is whether or not the worker is primarily responsible for Australia's current economic situation. I believe the principal object of this bill says that. It actually points to the average worker and says, `It's your fault. If only you would work harder. If only you would be prepared to work odd hours for the same rates or didn't require penalty rates or didn't have to have penalties for working when you would prefer to be with your family. If only you would be prepared to do that, we could all be better off.' I think that is erroneous and I think it is not admitting what the real economic issues are in Australia.

        I was thinking this morning of a way to describe the whole situation in this bill, and this is probably a good time to put it. What we had with the original bill, as is embodied by this principle, is the cutting off of legs in relation to bargaining power. It would be pretty awkward for many people to survive without a leg. With the amendments, we only have the feet cut off. So we have people who cannot walk without assistance apart from hopping, one would assume. But we are going to put into the bill that people are quite free to walk—there are no restrictions against walking. Isn't that terrific! You haven't got a foot but there are no restrictions. There is nothing in this bill that says you are not able to walk. But, if you are going to walk, you will need assistance—and that is what I think you need with collective bargaining.

        That is the parable that I am putting. These amendments are better—you are only cutting off a foot; you are not cutting off the leg—but you are taking away the crutches. You are taking away the assistance that people will need to be able to walk and bargain with any

Whilst I will agree to the amendments Nos. 1 to 7 in relation to these principal objects, I will speak later on my own amendments and what I think would be more appropriate in the principal objects of the bill. I certainly recognise that the ALP's amendments to the principal objects have better elements than the current general gist of the Democrat&amp;hyphen;government amendments. However, they still embody what I think was the beginning of the farce and the beginning of the con of workers in Australia—that if only they could be internationally competitive, if only they could work faster and harder for less wages and more flexibly, they would stop the damage that they are doing to the Australian economy. It is time for honesty.

        On considering the commentary with respect to the agreement, and in the context of how well the objects continue to reflect that, I had a look at the description of the overall bill from the Senate Economics References Committee. I will take us back to just one comment in that. At 1.2 in chapter 1 of the overview, the majority of the committee stated:

       </para>
       <para>
        This agreement still does all of that, quite clearly. In my remarks, at this stage, I will concentrate on the confinement of awards, because I do not believe it is just a confinement. These changes, despite the agreed amendments, will destroy the award system that we have had in Australia for near a century. We are not just talking about some remodelling to fit the current economic circumstances; we are talking about changes which destroy Australia's award system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I applaud the Democrats and their agreement for bringing the government to the position of including fairness, because as we travelled around Australia, that was one of the very clear and obvious things that the government continued to try and ignore in its ideological bent with this bill. I applaud that we now have reference to fairness in the objects but, as Senator Sherry has pointed out, the objects should reflect other things, such as the government's election commitment—their commitment to better pay, their commitment that workers will be no worse off—as I think Senator Murray also referred to in his report.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At this stage, I would like to focus on and ask the government: whilst we understand the need to emphasise workplace relations and accept that, why now do the objects not more adequately deal with the award system other than as a minimum safety net? This is perhaps an obvious question, because I think that the changes which occur in the bill highlight the point that I made earlier. The objects no longer reflect a description of awards as other than the minimum safety net, because there is no intention that they should.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no intention that we should have a vibrant award system to protect workers. There is no intention that we should be able to describe awards, as the act currently does, or that the system should provide the means for establishing and maintaining an effective framework of protecting wages and conditions of employment through awards—not just minimum safety net awards.

         Just to highlight where I think the object should be improved, references regarding awards providing relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions should be maintained in the bill. They have been removed later in the bill. I think it is quite clear to us why that is the case, because we will only have awards as minimum safety nets. I am not sure it is clear how changing the objects and changing the thrust of the bill affects awards to some of the parties.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In this sense, unfortunately, despite all of the good intentions that the Democrats have made in previous policy positions and in their report after the inquiry, I think that they have been duped on this question. I do not think that they quite understand that the overall thrust of our industrial relations system has been destroyed by this change to awards. It may only seem like a small area, but it basically destroys the unique system that Australia has had in place for near on a century.

         The other area I would highlight where changes need to be made with respect to the objects, and following from these comments that I have just made, is that arbitration should occur where necessary with respect to dispute resolution—not just where appropriate. That has been the nature of our award system. They have been vibrant living things dealing with industrial disputation and promoting industrial harmony. I commend the Greens on their amendment in that respect.

         The whole thrust of awards promoting industrial harmony and dealing with industrial disputation has been destroyed. Now, at the very stretch, the government has agreed that we will have arbitration, where appropriate. When is `where appropriate'? If you look a bit further on in the bill `where appropriate' is the 20 allowable matters and `in exceptional circumstances'. At this stage, the government is going to have to be quite clear about what it means by `exceptional' as well.

As I said, it ends an era in Australia. It ends an era in which, in recent times—for about the last decade—we have been able to introduce bargaining flexibility in an environment of security, fairness and trust. This will change.

         Just to remove one of the illusions which were reflected in the objects and the general commentary to date on the bill, opposition to Australia's unique industrial relations system is not new. The thrust of this bill and Howard's industrial relations agenda is not new. Some people have this perception that it is a new thing to deal with our current economic circumstances and international markets, et cetera. It does not simply reflect the need for reform to deal with our economic circumstances.

         It reflects the ascendancy of the New Right in the Liberal Party over the last several years and their ideological agenda. That is quite clear. This has been obvious by the approach to the bill to date in ignoring substantive concerns, concerns which the Democrats picked up in several areas throughout the inquiry and in their report, but concerns which seem to have been lost in some areas particularly with respect to awards in recent times. On my perception, the Democrats have been duped, by Reith, away from their position as they reported it.

The Democrats accept that removing award conditions after 18 months just because they did not fit into the 18 allowable matters was a breach of this commitment. The commitment that the Democrats have referred to in their report was that no worker in Australia, under Mr Howard's industrial relations policy, can have his or her award conditions taken away.

What it reflects is that awards have historically been those vibrant things that deal with industrial disputation for the general public interest.

         I suspect that Mr Reith, the minister, said to the Democrats, `Don't worry about occupational health and safety because there is legislation that deals with occupational health and safety.' But what exists in many awards are provisions specific to particular industries. We heard about provisions for shearers, for instance, which are not clearly provided for in industrial legislation. I know of retail award provisions dealing with health and safety issues which are not adequately provided for in industrial legislation. Let us not delude ourselves. Employers are not going to bargain and agree to those sorts of provisions no matter how many small little prods the government thinks they might be given. They will not bargain unless they have to.

         In fact, strangely there will be a reward for people not on paid rates awards since compulsory arbitration is being removed from several areas and there will be a reward for people who undertake industrial action which causes severe harm publicly. In those circumstances, you will have access to arbitration but bad luck to anybody else. Let us cause more industrial disputation because that is the way we will actually get the commission to do something. It does not make much sense.

It is important that the objects are consistent with the detail of the legislation and that the legislation is consistent with the objects. There has been some improvement as a result of the coalition-Democrat deal, but I think the most significant thing is that, even despite the coalition-Democrat deal, the legislation is still consistently bad. The objects that the Democrats have agreed to are inadequate and flawed.

It is all very well for professional people to have a career path, but we want, if industry is to be effective, for there to be industry solutions. An industry&amp;hyphen;wide approach makes it more difficult for the individual bad employer, for one exists in every industry, to become dominant.

That is an example of this government's resentment about a sector—in this case a sector of the printing industry. In this case, they are taking away from an industry that had planned its future the ability to gain markets or to keep those markets it has in Japan and other places.

         of the last two days, you will see that the general officers of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the Australian Workers Union, the LHMU, the STA and the CFMEU have all been quite direct and critical of the content of the bill. It has been extensively criticised in both public and private by the ACTU for adding a little dross around the edges.

        Thirdly, this is a bill expressly designed to hurt, harm and disadvantage low paid and female workers. There should be no doubt
        <break page="4728" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that it harms the direct financial interests of low paid female workers. These workers may be found, as we all know, in hotels, restaurants, the hospitality industry, process aspects of manufacturing, retail, supermarkets and sales. The Australian Democrats are a party that ostensibly advances the interests of women. It attempts to solicit the union vote and proudly parades the fact that five of its seven members in this place are female. There is no reference in the objects of this bill heeding the interests of this group of workers, and they are explicitly ignored in the bill by that party. This bill deliberately sells this group of people down the river.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fourthly, this is a bill that the ALP is proud to repudiate: we are proud to reject it, and we are proud to have no part of the amendments proposed by the government and the Australian Democrats. This is a bill that only those two parties can claim title to and ownership of. We are very pleased now, in the medium term and in the long term to be isolated from this vicious piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would forecast that, over the next six to 18 months, unions in every shop, factory and warehouse will have one thing to say as they explain the meaning and intent of this bill. As people complain of cuts to their hours, loss of guaranteed weekly minimum hours, loss of guaranteed weekly maximum hours when working part time, as they suffer the loss of guaranteed daily minimum hours, guaranteed daily maximum hours and as they suffer a loss of security, there will be only two parties to blame: the government and the Australian Democrats and their leadership. We will be very vociferous in pointing out to every part-time and female worker who suffers a cut of hours where the responsibility lies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Fifthly, it is clear that the Australian Democrats have paid little heed to the 13 key principles that were outlined in Senator Murray's report. It is true that a number of aspects of those key principles have been incorporated in the agreed amendments which are before the Senate. However, there is no support for a comprehensive up-to-date award system. There is no suggestion that the award system will remain relevant over time.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Additionally, there is a limitation on arbitration, there is no reference to industrial democracy and there is no recognition at all of the legitimate role of trade unions. Members opposite like to swing off and make comments about the fact that trade union membership is somewhere around 30 to 35 per cent of the Australian work force and dominates in key industries and sectors of industries. This bill deliberately ignores that fact. It offers no comfort, no protection, no purpose and no role to those organisations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, there is what can only be described as a `sleazy deal' on secondary boycotts. They are apparently proper and legitimate—authorised to be legal. By definition, public policy is to encourage secondary boycotts of a consumer nature or on environmental issues. But if a worker or group of workers wishes to protect their living standards, wages and health and safety issues, that is to be outlawed. So there is more value in insects—flora and fauna—as has been outlined in other debates, than there is in the working conditions of Australian workers. That apparently is to become public policy in this country in a deal between the government and the Democrats.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Sixthly, there is little protection for part-time workers. Therefore, I will turn to the more distasteful aspects of the bill and the fact that they are not addressed in the objects. Particularly, I will refer to the shameful treatment of part-time and female workers. I will relay to the Senate my experience in Western Australia over the last few years, as we have had a nearly identical system in that state, and I will refer to the submissions of the Commissioner for Workplace Agreements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is my direct observation from the independent supermarket industry that my comments are equally valid concerning unskilled workers or low skilled workers anywhere. Unions in awards, enterprise bargaining agreements and certified agreements in low skilled and unskilled industries essentially achieve in negotiations a margin above what the market will pay. That margin extends to wages and conditions and establishes for that group of workers a higher standard of living than they would be able to achieve otherwise.
         <break page="4729" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          There is no doubt about that, and that is agreed on both sides. That is the purpose of awards—to achieve a rate above that which the market establishes.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Awards of that nature have little relevance to professional people, to high skilled people and to highly educated women. The market sets a high rate for their pay based on skill, and they do not need awards or other instruments to increase it or to maintain it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the last three years in Western Australia, as workplace agreements have been introduced in a range of low skill, low value industries, the results have become clear. The market price for retail workers in independent supermarkets and allied firms has fallen by up to $5 per hour. The rate has gone below the award rate, which was in the order of $12 or $13 per hour, down to a rate of $7 to $8 per hour, depending on the suburb and the locality. That rate of $7 to $8 per hour in Australian dollars is remarkably similar to the $5.25, $5.55, permitted in the US minimum wage law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the results are clear from Western Australia—perhaps less clear in Victoria because there are not the detailed records—that the introduction of workplace bargaining via individual contracts to low skilled, semi&amp;hyphen;skilled and low value industries results in a cutting back of above market wages to market levels of some $7 to $8 per hour. This bill is explicitly designed to achieve that outcome. It is designed to achieve that outcome on the backs of low paid workers who are principally female and in retail and hospitality industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the life of me, I cannot understand why any party—let alone the Australian Democrats, who seek to parade the interests of female workers, of female voters—would deliberately establish a policy and agree to amendments in a bill that would have the direct consequence of decreasing their wages. I can understand why the government would want to  do that, and I can understand the financial drive behind that objective. Why the Australian Democrats, with their five female senators, who have proudly outlined their principles in their maiden speeches and other efforts, would seek to drive down the wages of their own gender is beyond me. But that is
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the direct purpose and will be the obvious outcome of this bill.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In summary, it is proper to highlight the deficiencies in the objects clause. It is entirely proper to sheet home the blame for that to the government, but more particularly to the Australian Democrats, who have engaged in that secret negotiating process which they apparently, until now, have repudiated. It is proper to highlight that the objects of the bill and the express provisions that we will discuss later are designed to harm the interests of low paid workers and female workers in a range of service industries. It is proper to place on the record that we wish to have no part of it, that we oppose it and that we will go into the community and into the workplaces and outline our concerns, explain our principles, and properly and accurately outline what the Australian Democrats and the government have sought to achieve in this bill.

         —The workplace relations bill was born out of an ideological obsession by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the coalition parties to devalue the award system of this country, to destroy the role of the trade union movement in this country and to reduce the wages of ordinary workers in this country. Notwithstanding all of the rhetorical flourish of the Prime Minister's policy launch, launched when he was Leader of the Opposition, prior to the election, notwithstanding the high sounding rhetoric of some of the objects of the bill and notwithstanding the recently announced agreement—or secret deal, as Senator Bishop so accurately describes it—one can still see that this bill will damage, maybe irreparably, the position of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I particularly refer to those workers in low paid jobs who rely upon the industrial awards system of this country for protection. Let us remember that we are here today dealing with legislation of the parliament, legislation which the Prime Minister claims is one of the hallmark, central pieces of his government's program.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have always understood that legislation is about protecting and maintaining the interests
        <break page="4730" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and welfare of Australian citizens. That is what the former Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the Industrial Relations Act have been about. Certainly, they are not cast in stone. It is appropriate from time to time for governments and the participants—employers, employees, unions, employer organisations—to look at updating or revising the provisions of that act as circumstances warrant. Indeed, the history of industrial relations in this country is that that has been the process.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Certainly, that was the process engaged in by the former government when it brought in the Industrial Relations Act. It is an act which sought to establish a new development in industrial relations in this country, that is, more emphasis on enterprise bargaining. It is an act which sought to also recognise the increasing complexities of the labour market and international impacts upon it. But at all times it recognised that a fundamental system needed to be retained, that is, a system of industrial awards regulated through the processes of conciliation and arbitration by an independent umpire, namely, the Industrial Relations Commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill heads in an entirely opposite direction. That is evident when you look at the objects of the act, because what is so stark is what has been removed from the objects of the current act. What is also so stark is the inconsistency—I would suggest hypocrisy—of the coalition government's position with respect to their electoral promises and the legislation now before the Senate. That continues to exist and has not been remedied by the agreement between the government and the Democrats. I have to say to the Democrats that they have walked away from some of their own election promises and pronouncements on this issue. I will come back to that in a minute.

        . The Prime Minister went to great lengths to assure the Australian work force that no worker would be worse off as a result of his zeal to reform—in his words—the labour market. Why is it then that, if one of the twin objectives of this legislation is the achievement of better pay, there is no mention whatsoever in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the objects of the act of that fundamental commitment? According to the Prime Minister, two things are supposed to flow from this legislation: firstly, improved employment and, secondly, better pay.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will see in a couple of years, if not sooner, whether those results were achieved. It is our belief, based upon years of experience, that that will not occur. You would think that, if you were being honest with the Australian people and you were going to stick to your commitments, the one object that would be staring out at you from page 1 of this legislation would be an object to promote better pay. You would also expect an object to be in this act which said that no person, as a result of this legislation, should suffer any diminution in their wages and working conditions and other entitlements. But that is precisely what is going to happen as a result of this legislation. When we get to discuss some of the more specific aspects of the legislation, such as those dealing with allowable matters, you will see very clearly how workers will suffer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A lot of people place great store upon the objects of legislation. Indeed, it is correct that one should look to the objects of the legislation: firstly, to see what is actually supposed to be achieved by the legislation and, secondly, to see whether it can be an aid in resolving issues relating to a lack of clarification or uncertainty in the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I can recall what happened in the Senate inquiry proceedings. On a number of occasions when it was pointed out by witnesses that various protections which existed in the current act had been removed, Senator Crane and other members of the coalition said, `Oh, but it's in the objects of the act.' Any industrial relations practitioner with a minimum of experience will tell you that, in the absence of specific provision in the legislation, the objects of the act—no matter how grand—may, nevertheless, deliver nothing. In the absence of specific provisions in legislation, for instance, dealing with matters outside of the 18 allowable matters under section 89A, the objects of the act are not going to enable either the Industrial Relations Commission or
        <break page="4731" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the participants in the industrial relations negotiations to fill in the gaps.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, that is what the government wants. What they want to do through this act is force people out of the award system. They say that it is designed to encourage people to utilise enterprise bargaining. The very provisions of section 89A coupled with sections 44 and 45, which prescribes by legislation that awards cannot contain provisions other than those listed, is completely contrary to the so-called object, which is to encourage conciliation—it was as a last resort, but I notice that it is proposed to be amended—and arbitration.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Prior to this bill, the current act placed great emphasis on conciliation and arbitration. We now also have in the act the parallel system of enterprise bargaining. The two have worked very well together, as the recent report of the Industrial Relations Commission indicated. But in this bill conciliation and arbitration has been reduced to a mere by&amp;hyphen;line, notwithstanding that the constitutional power for this bill is derived from section 51(xxxv)—that is, the power of the Commonwealth to make laws dealing with the conciliation and arbitration of interstate industrial disputes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under this bill, the role of the commission is reduced to virtually a rubber stamp. I am not surprised about that because we have also seen that the other sections of the bill, such as those dealing with the Employment Advocate, were going to be rubber stamp processes too. Nobody was going to have any opportunity to scrutinise whether or not the tests of fairness and of equity had been met.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No doubt we are going to have a lot more opportunity throughout the day to look specifically at some of these objects. But let me just point to a couple of the problems that I see. Firstly, as I have indicated, there is no object which relates in any way to the maintenance and protection of current wages and working conditions of employees. Secondly, this bill removes from the act the existing provision which encourages the registration of democratic organisations of employers and employees. Nothing has been done to restore that position in the deal that has been made between the government and the Democrats.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Might I also say in relation to that deal that I find it hypocritical to the highest degree that legislation which is supposed to be about encouraging employers and employees to negotiate and reach agreement will ultimately, it appears, get through this Senate because of a backroom deal—an agreement where the very participants have had little opportunity or no opportunity to be involved.

        I think it behoves the chamber to look at what is happening in other states, particularly in relation to economic activity. That is what I would like to talk about. As a member of the Senate Economics References Committee that dealt with this bill, I, together with a number of others, travelled around Australia and looked at the various industrial relations systems in the other states and at the overall impact that this bill would have in relation to other states, the economy, workers' rights and so on. As a precursor to that exercise, my office and I worked out precisely what productivity figures were on a state-by-state basis and then matched those to the relevant industrial relations systems that each of those states had. It proved to be a very interesting exercise indeed.

        The definition of `productivity' became a bit of a vexed question in the hearings that were held. Because I have an interest in this

         area, I asked many people who gave submissions, particularly employer groups, what they regarded as the definition of `productivity'. Quite frankly, their definition of `productivity' was probably best put by the chamber of commerce from my own state. They said, `Senator, how long is a piece of string?'

        I found this quite a disappointing response from a chamber of industry that signed up to a bill that has as one of its objects increased productivity, increased international competitiveness and higher employment levels. If you cannot determine or if you do not know what higher productivity is, how can you have it as an object? The reality is that it is a parenthood statement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The definition of `productivity' is very simple. There are two definitions that you could use. They are: gross state product by the number of hours worked—that is to gain productivity per hour—or by the number of people employed to gain productivity per employee. This is the ABS formula; this is not something that this side of the chamber has plucked out of the air.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When you use the formula used by the ABS and apply it on a state by state basis, the results in relation to productivity increases become very interesting when, as I said, you look at the various industrial relations systems that these states have. I will go through them, because I would like to put them on the record. I will go through the results from 1991 to 1995. It may be a bit tedious, but I think it is very important for people to understand precisely what is going to happen in relation to this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and what has happened in other states that have attempted similar moves.

       <para first-indent="16">
        New South Wales, for example, in 1991 had minus 0.4 per cent productivity growth; 1992, plus 2.7 per cent; 1993, plus 3.4 per cent; 1994, plus 1.5 per cent; and 1995, minus 1.3 per cent. That will hopefully improve through the changes in the industrial relations system and the election of a Labor government. I am sure it will. Tasmania, my home state, is the worst—surprise, surprise—because of having a state Liberal government for such a long period of time. Tasmania also
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         introduced industrial relations legislation based on, as Senator Collins mentioned, the New Right agenda, the agenda of the H.R. Nicholls Society, and so on. The productivity levels in Tasmania were as follows: 1991, plus 0.8 per cent; 1992, plus 9.3 per cent, which seems a bit of an aberration; 1993, plus 1.95 per cent; 1994, minus 5.73 per cent; and 1995, minus 2.02 per cent. That was the worst economic performance in Australia.

There was no productivity growth at all. Queensland: 1991, plus 3.6 per cent; 1992, plus 4.34 per cent; 1993, plus 1.87 per cent; 1994, plus 1.43 per cent; and 1995, minus 1.61 per cent.

        Now it gets really interesting. In Victoria we have Premier Kennett lauding his industrial relations package as being, to a large extent, responsible for the purported improvement in the Victorian economy. You would think there would be a fairly gargantuan increase in relation to productivity there, given what has happened in Victoria with regard to the low wage outcome that has been deliberately perpetrated in that state. Victoria: 1991, plus 1.5 per cent; 1992, plus 3.3 per cent—these are the years when we actually had a state Labor government, which, incidentally, was absolutely pilloried in relation to economic management by senators opposite—1993, plus 4.3 per cent; 1994, no productivity growth; and 1995, 0.3 per cent. That is not a very good outcome given how many Victorian workers have suffered.

        Now the piece de resistance. We come to Western Australia, where Minister Kierath has actually lambasted this government for not going far enough and for doing the deal with the Democrats in relation to this bill. His view is that the industrial relations system in Western Australia, as currently constituted, is the appropriate way to go in relation to improved economic performance and improved economic indicators. Let us look at Western Australia: 1991, plus 5.6 per cent; 1992, plus 2.5 per cent; 1993, plus 2.4 per cent; 1994, plus 1.5 per cent; and 1995, minus
        <break page="4733" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         two per cent. In 1995, Western Australia had an economic productivity growth of minus two per cent, the second lowest in Australia. Minister Kierath had the nerve to say to this government in relation to this bill, `You should have gone as far as we did. You have not gone far enough. Had you gone far enough, you would have had the outstanding economic record that we have achieved in Western Australia.' Excuse me! I do not think the second lowest productivity rate in Australia is a particularly good outcome, given the impost and the pain that the workers in Western Australia have had to go through.

        It was very interesting in the hearings in Western Australia to hear precisely how the Western Australia government actually presented this so&amp;hyphen;called terrific economic record. Just for the interest of the Senate, in their submission they used a period of wages growth of three years, a span of three years, to illustrate the economic record. For employment they used a span of three years. For working days lost due to industrial representation they used a span of nine years. For productivity they used a span of one year. Listen to this: they actually said that, for the May quarter 1994 to the May quarter 1995, it was plus 3.6 per cent. Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of economics knows that there is no such thing as a May quarter. They were silly enough to use this in their submission to support the government's bill.

        The difficulty in relation to the bill—and the difficulty in relation to the Democrats' position, quite bluntly—is that it is not going to assist the economy at all. The amendments that have been negotiated between the government and the Democrats are not going to assist the economy. They are not going to assist those productivity rates. They are not going to assist employment levels. The only way that they would actually assist employment levels—this is something that both the government and the Democrats should bear in mind, and are, in fact, very well aware of—is if you have a low wage outcome. The only way that you can increase employment through this bill is by having a low wage outcome. You have actually cut workers'

         wages. You only have to listen to what Senator Childs said with regard to the situation in the United States to understand precisely the impact that has.

        Let us have a look at international comparisons again. I think Senator Childs has adequately covered the United States. During the speeches in the second reading debate on this bill, I quoted some statistics with regard to New Zealand. I understood it was pretty clear that the government regarded New Zealand as a relevant model to actually base this bill on. I was interjected upon several times by government senators saying it is not based on the New Zealand bill.

        New Zealand's productivity growth has not been good. It has not even matched Australia's performance. This is under the Employment Contracts Act, this great system that was supposed to provide economic nirvana in New Zealand. Our national growth rate has been higher than New Zealand's—that is the reality. New Zealand's reforms have had very little impact on efficiency. This is clearly not a good sign. They also said in the report that much of New Zealand's recent strong economic growth can be attributed to temporary factors and they go on with the most telling point that the report made:

        Quite clearly, what I have attempted to demonstrate here by using empirical data, not simply by using rhetoric in relation to productivity, is that those states that have chosen to adopt a new right or radical industrial relations system have not seen the gains in relation to productivity. They have not been realised at all. I turn to to the deal between the Democrats and the government. Economic outcomes have not been addressed here either. There is no way either the fundamentals of this bill or the government/Democrat amendments have done anything to improve those economic outcomes.

        The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, as has been said by previous senators, will not create jobs unless workers' wages are battened down. That is the only way that job creation is going to occur. And what kind of jobs will you have? We will see the same sort of situation as in New Zealand where you have largely part&amp;hyphen;time workers. But they are not really part&amp;hyphen;time workers in the sense we currently know them; they are actually casual workers. I say to the government and to the Democrats that the amendments that have been put forward and the bill in its entirety will not assist Australia's economic outcome. In fact, it will make it worse and it will make the lives of ordinary Australians worse.

         I think the only flexibility that the bill will introduce into the labour market will be a downwards flexibility for the low paid, for young job seekers and for casual and part&amp;hyphen;time employees. We ought to remember that the government is responding to pressures from the business community who are demanding a more flexible labour market and labour market reform.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us have a look at how flexible and fair the labour market is. I refer to an article in today's

         which talks about what has occurred in our labour market in the last couple of years. It does not just fix on the pay of ordinary working people; it fixes upon the increases that have been paid to business executives, as well as the general labour market. On the front page of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The pay packets of senior management rose by 6.5 per cent on average in the year to September—the same pace as in the year to June, and faster than the figure in early 1996—according to the latest survey by

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         That acceleration has taken place at the same time as general wage and salary pressures have eased from a peak of 5.1 per cent in late 1995 to a two&amp;hyphen;year low of 3.5 per cent in September.

        </para>
        <para>
         What is fair about this and what is the bill going to do to address this? It is all very well for the Prime Minister to make high&amp;hyphen;minded calls, but this bill is the government's, and apparently the Democrats', response to these sorts of circumstances.

          think it really is reform, because I thought reform was about improving things. I do not believe that this bill, particularly as it is described in its objects, will do anything to improve the situation. As I said earlier, it is talking about flexibility. But when you look at the rest of the bill, the flexibility will be downwards for the majority of Australian people, particularly those who are without power in terms of their employment relationship.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We looked at that particular object. As amended, it talks about a flexible and fair labour market. At the same time, we looked at what is actually occurring in the labour market and who is benefiting. Those who are in positions of privilege have obviously helped themselves at the same time as calling upon those who are in a position of disadvantage—those in an ordinary employment relationship—to take hold of their expectations and to accept less.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of that power relationship, the Senate Economics References Committee looked at the question of bargaining and the Australian Democrats' position, as I think represented by Senator Murray, was set out in its report. At page 339 of the report the Australian Democrats' recommendation states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is recommended that the bill seek to expressly encourage collective over individual bargaining, but allow for individual bargaining of AWAs where the conditions of the AWA as a whole are superior to the award, and that the employee genuinely and freely agrees to the AWA.
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not believe that anywhere in the objects clause is there effectively reflected an object which expressly encourages collective, over individual, bargaining. I make that point because the Labor Party will be moving an amendment to the objects clause which will have the effect of giving that importance to the issue of collective bargaining over individual bargaining.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          Clearly, individual bargaining is not in the interests of ordinary Australians. It may be in the interests of business executives in a position of power and in a position to influence their boards to give them increases far and away above the sorts of pay increases that have traditionally been available to the ordi nary Australian worker; that is, the majority of the community that this parliament is supposed to be serving. We are not here simply to be serving the interests of business executives who repeatedly, allegedly in the national interest, call for this workplace reform agenda, as they call it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Another aspect of the objects clause of this bill that I wanted to touch upon was the question of the organisation of employees and their responsibility for the maintenance of the award system. As I said in my speech on the second reading, it is the trade union movement that actually maintains the award system. Object (d)(ii) states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . to ensure that there is an effective award safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         It is proposed to be amended in the government&amp;hyphen;Democrat deal to read:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . to ensure the maintenance of an effective award safety net of fair and enforceable minimum wages and conditions of employment . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         On its face, that seems a reasonable amendment, although it could go a lot further. In terms of what happens elsewhere in the objects to the bill, there is no proper recognition of the fact, in the amendment or in the bill as it stands—when I say `the amendment', I refer to the government-Democrat deal on the amendment to the objects clause—to the importance of the trade union movement to that process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is fine to have high-minded objectives for maintenance of the safety net system but, on the other hand, elsewhere in the bill—even as it is proposed to be amended by the government and Democrat deal—it seeks to diminish organisations' ability to organise and, in fact, gives primacy to individual contracts over the award system, thereby undermining the ability of the union movement to maintain that safety net for the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am sure that the union movement will do an excellent job with limited resources, but realities are realities. I believe it is an object of this legislation to make the maintenance of the award system a more difficult task for the union movement, specifically by not recognising their importance in the objects—as they would be recognised if those objects were

         there is an article by the economics editor, Mr Mitchell. I wanted to refer to that because I think it is giving us a few clues as to where we are going in the context of the objects of this bill. On page 17 of today's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         , in a story entitled `Consequences of compromise', there is reference to the deal between the government and the Australian Democrats. I relate this to the objects of the bill that I have just referred to, in particular, the importance of the trade union movement and how the objects do not particularly give the importance that the trade union movement has to the maintenance of the award system. Alan Mitchell says:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The other important compromise made by Mr Reith was on the question of freedom of association. The Government's intention had been to abolish the "conveniently belong" rule under which unions have been granted effective monopoly rights to represent particular classes of workers.

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

         That is, incumbent unions will be able to maintain their monopoly rights to represent particular workers if they can demonstrate to the AIRC a) that the workers "could more conveniently be members" of the incumbent union and b) that the workers "would be more effectively represented" by the incumbent union.

         Apart from the fact that I believe that Mr Mitchell is particularly ill&amp;hyphen;informed on the subject of the representative character of unions, I want to go to what he said about the

         Mr Howard must also take every opportunity he gets to reform the AIRC itself, to populate it with commissioners sympathetic to reform.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, the newspaper that seems to be the advocate of the business community is saying that the Prime Minister should nobble the outcomes of this legislation by fixing the jurisdiction with biased opponents. That is what the article by Alan Mitchell is suggesting, and that, I think, is a fundamental problem with this bill—the objects clause does not properly express the role of the trade union movement in making the award system a fit and proper one for the Australian community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With that in mind, I think we have to have a good look at this objects clause. The Democrats no doubt will mount some sort of cogent case for the deal that they have done. But let us wait and see about that, because I believe that they need to further consider their position and consider the Labor Party amendments on these matters.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Prior to the election in March of this year, one of the flagships of Mr Howard's electoral messages was in the industrial relations area. He said, `No worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her award conditions taken away.' That was a commendable and admirable statement made in the context of an election. One would have thought at the time that this was a core promise. This was one of the promises that was not going to be broken—like the almost 100 other promises that have been smashed in the eight short months that the government has been in office.

        When the bill was introduced into this place in June of this year, everybody, not only those on this side of the chamber, recognised that core promise as smashed, breached and meant for nothing.

However, the work that was to be done on the part of the government was to get into bed with the Australian Democrats. I thought I had lived a long time and seen everything. I never thought I would see the day when the joint party rooms would consist of the Liberal Party and the National Party, a very unholy alliance at the best of times, and the Australian Democrats.

        But I come back to the objects of this very important bill. The Democrats also went to the election with a core promise launched with great fanfare. The core promise, and I am quoting here, was they `would keep the bastards honest'. I understand `bastards' can be an offensive word and, indeed, it is offensive to some. Now with the joint amendments by the Australian Democrats and the government to the bill which is before this chamber, we find three main political parties breaching the core promises upon which they went to the election. We had Mr Howard's promise that under his government's industrial relations policy no worker in Australia can have his or her award conditions taken away. Those people have been done. That promise
        <break page="4738" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The Democrats, who went to the election saying they would keep the bastards honest—meaning that Senator Murray, Senator Kernot and Senator Stott Despoja would keep John Howard to his promise that no worker would have his or her award conditions taken away—have reneged on that agreement as well. I suppose that is politics for you. It is not a comforting thought that that should happen in this day and age. It is no wonder indeed that some people in our community are disillusioned with politicians when you see promises of this nature worth nought when push comes to shove and bills are brought before the parliament.

        Now, I am hoping that somebody from the other side will come up to try to correct this impression—even from the Australian Democrats.

I hope somebody will be able to come up to refute the claims that I am making about these core promises that have been breached.

        If the promises were going to be fulfilled, where should they have appeared?  They should have appeared in the bill that was presented to the parliament in June this year. They did not.

I know during the brief times I had the opportunity of sitting in as a participating member of the committee, in my home town of Perth and also here in Canberra, that question was addressed on many occasions to various witnesses appearing before the committee: will the bill before this committee hearing maintain Mr Howard's promises to the electorate prior to the election?

        We look at schedule 1, the very beginning of this bill. It talks about higher productivity and a flexible labour market. It talks about the fact that the primary responsibility of determining matters affecting the relationship between employees and employers rests with the employee and employer at the workplace or enterprise level. I will start with that one.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I gave my speech on the second reading I expressed concern that if employers and employees are going to be negotiating and reaching agreements then there has to be an assumption that both sides are equal—both sides have equal power, equal rights, equal knowledge, equal information. For every other legal contract in this country there is an assumption of equality. If it can be proved that it is not so, it is overruled in courts of law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But what is going to happen here? You cannot tell me that a 16- or 17-year-old person, who is just out of school or doing part-time work while they are still at school, shares equality with their employer. Usually at that stage when people are seeking those
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         jobs there are more people after the jobs than there are jobs available and they are basically forced to take what is available—take it or leave it. Nobody at the age of 17 can be considered to be in a position of equality with their boss.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other thing that will happen with these negotiations is that they will be done in secret. You could have a work force where each employee does not know or technically should not know what their peers are getting. So it could be a case of the boss rewarding what he or she sees as better work, despite the fact that there may be other circumstances or other factors involved. I will keep going back to the fact that you cannot have an agreement where there is not equality between those entering into the negotiations.

        I have spoken about young people. I also have concerns about the self-confidence of women re-entering the workplace after they have been at home maybe raising children. For the first time back into the workplace after four or five years out—it is a changed circumstance from what they left—they are being expected also to enter into this negotiation. There is no way that those people are entering into those negotiations in a position of equality. That to me is something that is eminently unfair. I wonder about the legal ramifications of it as well.

        We also see that the bill talks about building upon a foundation of minimum standards. When we look at the minimum standards we find there are some major points being missed.

        I spoke on the adjournment on Monday night about a memorial service I had attended in Broken Hill to the miners who had lost their lives on the Line of Lode. Up to date they knew of 704 names but there were many more. There were many more because at the time the mine started and for some considerable time afterwards if an accident occurred at the mine and miners were taken away alive to receive health care, surgery or whatever treatment was needed, be it at home or in the hospital, and they subsequently died, those
        <break page="4740" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         deaths were not recorded as deaths on the Line of Lode. They were not attributed to the fact that they were injured at the mine.

        I put to you that this lack of setting occupational health and safety as a minimum standard leaves it open for the return to the bad old days such as on the Line of Lode in Broken Hill where hundreds of men lost their lives—two men remain in the mine, their final resting place—as a result of accidents on that line. We do not know how many; we are still trying to find out how many actually lost their lives as a result of the work on the Line of Lode.

        I put it to you that these are very important issues.

        The bill also talks in this schedule about higher productivity. I am wondering how you measure higher productivity in a number of areas. I can say from the health scene—from a nursing perspective—that productivity is extremely hard to measure. The work that is undertaken has changed quite markedly in the last 30 years. Procedures, diagnoses and surgical intervention that are undertaken now could not be made 30 years ago, or, if they could be made, the treatment was just TLC—tender loving care. The TV program
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I worked at that hospital over 20 years ago 99 per cent of babies born at that birth weight died. Now it is quite apparent that the figures are almost totally reversed. Being able to save and to have a great outcome for these individuals means that a hell of a lot more care is required. They require a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         lot more intensive care than normal weight babies; they are much sicker. How do you measure that with productivity? The advance in technology has changed the outputs and the outcomes for many people in the health area.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Productivity used to be measured, and still is in a lot of areas, by bed days occupied. But what you have in those beds are people who are a lot sicker than would have been the case 20 years ago and who are being discharged earlier than we would have thought possible, or even acceptable, 20 or 30 years ago. And you are telling me that you want to increase productivity. I, as a former registered nurse and someone who is still a member of the College of Nursing in this country, am asking you: how are you going to measure productivity in that particular case? I do not want my nursing peers to have somebody say, `You've got to increase productivity.' When you have a ward full of unconscious or semiconscious patients and they are totally dependent upon you for every one of their needs, how can you possibly increase productivity?

        Earlier today when I raised this issue, somebody made the facetious statement that you put roller skates on them—and that is about the only way you can do it. Here it is, stuck in this bill with no cognisance of what the real world is like out there. It is just typical of how totally out of touch this coalition government, which now really does deserve the title of coalition because it is the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats, are. They really do not understand that particular issue. They have obviously never gone and spoken to anybody in the health field about it.

        In recent times I have also received some material from the AMA. The AMA is not known as a supporter of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, there are a couple of members of the AMA in this chamber. There is one on our side and three on the other side. That is probably the ratio of membership and their attitudes. What they are concerned about is promoting a positive occupational health and safety culture, and they are doing it for themselves. They want a safe system of work.

       <break page="4741" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         What do they want in this safe system of work? We know from reading section 3D(d)(1) that they want a foundation of minimum standards, but I do not think what the coalition is putting up as minimum standards are the same minimum standards as the AMA wants. The AMA want a maximum number of hours per shift. They want minimum uninterrupted rest breaks between a shift. They want minimum uninterrupted periods between shifts. They want consecutive shifts and shift patterns. They want adequate minimum breaks between shift changes to ensure appropriate rest and recovery. They want adequate rest and recovery periods to be taken at night and the frequency of on call commitments of medical officers to enhance the value of rest and recovery periods.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is from the AMA. This is from the doctors who are one of the health providers for this nation. Why do they want this? They want this so that they are able to be fresh and deliver high quality care. They are obviously indicating that, if people are operating under circumstances where they are not fresh, alert and awake, the quality of care is not the optimum that they would choose to deliver. That is highly commendable. It should ensure that people look very closely at this, because occupational health and safety and things like maximum hours per shift and minimum breaks between shifts do have to become a minimum standard.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I remember 30 years ago working a shift pattern that had only an eight&amp;hyphen;hour break between one set of shifts. You finished at 10 o'clock one night and you started again the next morning at 6 o'clock. That meant you got fewer than eight hours sleep. Some 30 years ago when you were nursing, whilst your shift might have started at 6 a.m., you were expected to be there at 5.30 at the latest and you had to get up half an hour before that to get ready. You did not go to sleep immediately at 10 p.m. because you were flat strap getting off the shift at 10 o'clock—you usually got off at 10.15—so you were down to five and six hours sleep. Our efficiency, our productivity, was shot to pieces and not particularly good.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Even now, when people are coming off night shift and going on to day shift, employers are attempting to have people finish their night shifts at 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the morning and front up again that afternoon at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock—and that is without even having a sleep at night. So, basically, in 24 hours they are expecting people to work two shifts, and it is not of their own volition. These are the sorts of things that will be able to be done under this bill.

        At some point, I would like to know from the minister whether the listing of these objects affects the interpretation of the act. If a matter were taken, for example, to the High Court, would the High Court have to consider whether or not a particular action by the commission itself was conducive to higher productivity or to a more flexible labour market? If the court had to make that deci

        What purpose, if any, do the objects as listed have in helping either the commission or a court interpret the act? If it does not have any effect, why is it in there?

        Why do you want to pursue a flexible labour market when the reading of that particular clause says you have to get higher productivity through other means? That particular object says the object should be `higher productivity and a flexible labour market' as if the concept of a flexible labour market is divorced from the idea of higher productivity.

        In the same section, why does object (a) encourage the pursuit of high employment rather than simply encourage high unemployment itself?

Does the commission, and ultimately the High Court, have to be satisfied that the employer and employees have an equal input?

       <para first-indent="16">
        How do the particular clauses (c), (d) and (e) affect the legislation, and in particular how do they affect workplace agreements? If the commission or the court were considering whether or not a workplace agreement came within the provisions of this legislation, how far would (c), (d) and (e) affect that exercise?

        . . . ensuring that employee and employer organisations registered under this Act are representative of and accountable to their members . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Does that clause do any more than provide for the present situation under the present act where there are many sections dealing with the financial propriety of the particular organisation in question and the proper means by which people are to be elected? Does (g) go beyond what is contained in the present act?

       </para>
       <para>
        An amendment to that object has been signalled which, I think, is to delete the words `as a last resort' inserting instead the words `as far as possible'. Could I ask: what difference do the words which are proposed to be substituted make to the effect of item (h)? In other words, what is the difference between the expression `as far as possible' and the expression `as a last resort'? It might be thought that doing something `as far as possible' is much the same as going on to the next step, `as a last resort'.

       <para>
        How does that particular item gel with the rest of the principles? The rest of the principles are devoted, it would seem, to encouraging higher productivity, flexible labour markets and low inflation. How does (i) marry in with the rest of the objects? I know that we cannot say how that marrying in will be effected finally, but what does the government consider the effect of (i) to be when measured against the rest of the objects? What would it consider the commission and the courts would do about trying to marry those two together? In fact, as I have asked before, do the principles as set out here have any legal effect in any event?

         Its meaning is self-evident, but it would be interesting to know where in the bill there is a manifestation that that particular object is going to be carried out. I do not expect to get the answer to this question now, perhaps as time goes by I will: are there any specific parts in the bill which form the carrying out of each of the 11 objects that are set out?

         —It is appropriate that I follow the nightwatchman because he has raised a number of issues that are dear to my heart in respect of the objects of this workplace relations bill before us. I share the same concerns as Senator Cooney. When I read through the objects, I wondered what the purpose of the objects is and who the objects are addressed to. Are they addressed primarily to the courts—and to this parliament—employers, industrial relations consultants, unions or employees? To whom do they have the greatest application? Are there areas that I have mentioned to which they have no application whatsoever?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that the objects of anything—a bill before this parliament, an award, an organisation, whatever it might be—are to play a significant role in how an organisation or a particular piece of legislation should perform. In this case, the objects have quite clearly missed the mark. I believe that in time there will be difficulties in interpreting where these objects are best placed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        From a cursory glance at the objects, one would interpret that many of them have been
        <break page="4744" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         made specifically for the employers. When I look at the objects piece by piece, I become confused as to how they dovetail in to the piece of legislation before us. That was indicated by Senator Cooney. In particular, with object (a) I see a missed opportunity for both the government and the Australian Democrats to address one of the prime issues that confronts this nation—unemployment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst the object says `encouraging the pursuit of high employment', at no stage do we know what that means. We do not know whether it means the pursuit of full-time employment, the pursuit of part-time employment or the pursuit of casual or contract work. Of course, the form of work is particularly important. This bill could have been—should have been—the means and the opportunity for the government to address the issue that I have raised in this place before, that is, the changing nature of work. This would have been an ideal opportunity for this bill to address and redress that issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats, of course, sadly missed the mark, as did the government. So, when the first principle says `encouraging the pursuit of high employment', we are none the wiser as to whether this means that it is the government's objective to pursue more full-time employment and more meaningful employment for people in the community or whether it is an employer objective—I think it is meant to be—which sees more people thrust into part-time and casual employment. So this is not addressed, to my way of thinking, in the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Clearly and sadly, it is a missed opportunity on the part of the government, particularly when unemployment is on the increase, particularly when something like 25 per cent of all the jobs in the work force are part-time, particularly when about 6.5 per cent of the work force are underemployed and particularly when people are overworked in our work force—37 per cent of the full-time work force are estimated to be working 49 hours or more per week, and full-time workers are already averaging 42.6 hours per week, which is an increase of two hours per week over the last 10 years.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         One then questions: where does this objective fit in? What is its purpose? What is its role? As I said, the government and the Democrats have sorely missed the mark of being able to address this fundamental issue which goes to the very heart of the livelihood of people in this nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If one looks further at that, the pursuit of high employment, are we talking about part-time, casual or contract employment, all of which have, over a period of time, been replacing standard jobs? My concern in this of course is that, when you look also at downsizing, you will find that there are about 300 senior people at Westpac to go, over 20,000 at Telstra to go, and so on. We have this problem that is persisting and I cannot see how it will be addressed in the objects that are currently before this chamber in this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other issue that it fails to address—and it is not reflected later in the bill from my reading of it—is the issue of full-time junior employment. Full-time junior employment, from my experience in service industries and the retail industries has collapsed over a long period of time. Junior rates, whilst they were available to employers, saw no lifting in the employment rate of young people. Here we have a thrust of pursuing high employment in an era when we have high levels of junior unemployment. We have very low levels of juniors being employed full time. So I really question what this objective means.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second object that I want to look at briefly is object (b). Object (b) refers to:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         ensuring that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with the employer and employees at the workplace or enterprise level;
        </para>
        <para>
         This objective, as one of my colleagues said earlier, fails totally to take any cognisance of the role of the trade union movement in the industrial relations arena. This objective, by my interpretation, seeks to exclude—more so than include—the trade union movement. One would think that this is a negative path to be going down.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Object (c) states:
        </para>
        <break page="4745" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . the most appropriate form of agreement for their particular circumstances, whether or not that form is provided for by this Act;
         </para>
         <para>
          That is most inconclusive indeed. It is certainly very open-ended. It leaves a lot to be questioned in terms of young people who will be exposed to the vagaries of this act. It is not clarified in any way within the act itself, as far as I can see. Therefore, it takes up very clearly the point that was raised by my colleague Senator Cooney before I stood here today.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If one looks further to object (d), it talks about the foundation of minimum standards. Whilst there are certain minimum standards within this particular act, there seems to be no indication in either the objects or within the act itself as to how those minimum standards are to be moved over time. Or, having once been established, are they established forever more? It does not give any indication in the objects when the standards are to be set in place; in other words, where the line in the sand would be drawn in terms of the particular standards that are to apply. I find that particular object within the act quite difficult to come to grips with.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One also finds, within object (d)(ii), the reference to ensure the maintenance of an effective award safety net of fair and enforceable minimum wages and conditions of employment. This particular objective is going to be difficult to put into practice because of the reduced role that the Industrial Relations Commission will find itself having under this particular act. Whilst it is an objective, it is not an achievable objective in the longer term.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Object (e), effectively, as I understand it, destroys the award system by stealth because—as I read the particular objective—it talks about agreement making rather than focusing on the basis of the award, which, in another part of the objectives, seems to be the underpinning and underlying safety net for those people without any form of industrial muscle, without any voice, without any form of representation. I find that particular objective at odds with the purpose of the act.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I come to objects (f) and (g). The particular concern that I have with object (f)—and this
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           is one that I think needs to be addressed—is that it refers to:

         </para>
         <para>
          That really is quite open. Again, on reading of the proposed bill, it in no way covers some quite bizarre possibilities that could come about as a result of that objective.

As I understand the Democrats' position from their public comments I have read, there is very little likelihood of them being able to accommodate any arguments put to them in this debate because they have signed off on a written deal with the government and the government will hold them to that deal in the sense of not allowing them to stray from the deal even if arguments put to them would convince them that further amendment is necessary.

        It is tempting to start a contribution by doing what a lot of journalists in this country have done, which is to look at the government bill and then look at the amendments to be moved by the Democrats and the government, analyse their impact and say this is what this debate is about—the difference between the original bill and the new deal offered by the Democrat and government amendments.

         That is the latest expression of 92 years of encouragement of the role of employee and employer bodies in the industrial relations system in this country. Ever since the original Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, we have encouraged the role of employer and employee bodies within our industrial relations system.

         We have regulated them, but we have given them positive encouragement and set out their roles and responsibilities and ensured that they play a key role in ensuring fairness and the proper resolution of industrial disputes in this country. This bill does not do that. For the first time in Australia's history, employer and employee representative bodies will not be encouraged. They will be regulated, but they will not be encouraged. In my view, that is the key difference in this bill.

        I am writing to draw your attention to the 1996 ANU Students' Association elections that were held in the last week of last term, and where the Labor&amp;hyphen;endorsed ticket, "Rage" were caught with their hand in the ballot&amp;hyphen;box so to speak.

        . . . the current SA President is William Mackerras, a member of the Labor Club. His Treasurer, Daniel Jenkins, is also a member of the Labor Club, and was the Presidential candidate for the Rage ticket. Due to the SA electoral regulations, it was up to the current executive to appoint the returning officers. William delegated this job to Daniel (despite the fact that he was a presidential candidate) . . . Five student officials were appointed . . .

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Polling took place and was uneventful (except for a failed attempt at a beer&amp;hyphen;stack by the Labor Club) until the last afternoon. An impartial and apolitical student observed one of the Rage candidates (and Labor Club member), . . . attempt to stuff a wad of ballots into the presidential box. He was initially unsuccessful, but was seen trying again a little later and this time succeeding. A complaint was lodged, and special care taken when opening the Box for counting the following Monday.

       <para>
        Believe it or not, Mr Mackerras is currently conducting an investigation. In other words, Labor is going to investigate Labor. It is likely that even if the candidate had not been seen placing the forms in the box they would have been caught anyway, because the ballot papers were stuffed into the ballot box in wads, rather than as single sheets, which is how they would have appeared if placed there by legitimate voters. This sort of corruption of the student union process at the Australian National University ought be a matter of great concern to everybody.

         It is interesting to note that, although there were only about 1,000 votes cast, even with the introduction of the 146 votes the Labor candidate still did not win.

          This is a student association which people are compelled to belong to. They have to belong to it if they are to get a tertiary education. That is a matter that a number of sena tors on this side have raised from time to time.

Through his interjections, Senator Forshaw is basically telling the Australian people that that is a fair and reasonable system. Yet they still wonder why they were so overwhelmingly rejected on 2 March! You see, people believe in a fair go and those who believe in a fair go would say you ought be entitled to a university degree—in fact, the right to enter a university—without the need to join a student association. The joining of the student association might somehow be desirable in some people's eyes, but these students are old enough to pick their own courses, they are old enough to decide where they are going to live and which university they are going to study at. Surely they are old enough to also determine whether or not they want to belong to a student association, because those students who are forced to belong to the student association then have to make a determination whether or not they can afford the time to fight the sort of skulduggery that I brought forward earlier in my speech.

           Labor opposition senators have been interjecting and, in doing so, reinforcing to the people of Australia that they support this system of compulsion and that somehow they would explain away the corruption that took place under the auspices of the Labor Club at the ANU in trying to rort a ballot.

They ask people, `What do they call a failed trade union leader?' Answer, `Senator.' That is where they put failed trade union leaders these days.

I would have thought that, rather than having a situation where students are not allowed to sit exams at the Australian National University and have their results withheld because they are not members of the student association, that when they find all those involved in this incident they might like to bring some discipline to bear and deny them the right to their education and to sit exams and be given their results. Then the university may gain some credibility in this very sordid matter.

From there they just seem to graduate and go on to bigger and better things. Of course, the prime example of that was the former failed Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when he was preselected for his own seat.

Of course, I would concur with him that any tampering with any democratic ballot process is objectionable to this side of the Senate, just as it is to those on his side. I sought to remind him—perhaps I should not have interjected—about what took place in Tasmania where the Liberal government, under the then Premier Gray in caretaker mode, obviously tried to corrupt the electoral process of the whole state and there was a royal commission into it. I have not heard too many comments from Senator Abetz to deprecate that action. Indeed, the Groom government made sure that the costs of the perpetrators were paid, including a convicted criminal, Rouse. So let's not get too pious about which side of the Senate has clean hands.

        And that is why John Howard's squirming about in awe of Hanson's poll numbers is so pathetic.

I am rising to speak for another generation of Australians who are being asked to pay a price that some of us have already paid. I am rising to speak on behalf of the young school students who are ethnic Asian, but farther in heart from Asia and far closer in heart to Australia than anyone can possibly imagine. I am speaking in this place because it is about time that those young Aussies, the flower of the next generation, received the respect that they deserve in the schools which they attend.

        In the other place, an honourable member has said that we should halt Asian immigration. There have been claims that Asians are responsible for tuberculosis, that Asians are responsible for crime, and that Asians are responsible for the forthcoming civil war. As every honourable senator knows, each one of those claims was outrageously false and outrageously ill informed. I want to deal with each of those claims briefly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Last century, it was believed that Asians were responsible for leprosy. That was false, just as it is false to say that Asians are responsible for tuberculosis. The facts are that no ethnic group is more susceptible genetically to tuberculosis than is any other ethnic group. Tuberculosis is a consequence of one's environment. Asians coming to this country cannot be responsible for the introduction of tuberculosis, because every person seeking permanent residency in this country has to undergo a health check before they get their residency. Of course, there are those who say, `Oh well, it is the Asian tourists who bring
        <break page="4752" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         tuberculosis.' If that is true—and it is hardly likely, because it tends to be the people who have the best diet and the best health in Asia who come down here—and we are to close our borders to these people, then it also follows that we must close our borders and stop Australians going overseas, lest an Australian get tuberculosis overseas and bring it back here. So Asians are not responsible for our health crisis.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Asians are not responsible for our crime rate. In fact, to the extent that the Bureau of Criminology keeps statistics of crime rates of different ethnic groups in this country, the ethnic Asian community has one of the lowest crime rates in Australia. You only have to go and sit in the criminal courts of any city in this country to see that that is a fact. There are very few ethnic Asian defendants in court cases, because there are very few ethnic Asian criminals. So that is also an outrageous and ill&amp;hyphen;informed comment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then, of course, there is the suggestion that the Asian community in this country is going to cause a civil war. Why would we want to cause a civil war? This is our country; it is our precious homeland in which we were born, in which we were nurtured, and in which we strive to live in freedom and in peace. We have no interest in civil war, we have no interest in strife, and we have no interest in division. Our interest is in peace and equality and freedom.

        That brings me to the claim that freedom of speech is paramount. Freedom of speech is important. It was one of the things for which our Anzacs fought and died. It was one of the finest, most wondrous gifts which we inherited from the Westminster system. But freedom of speech counts for nothing unless the citizens of a nation enjoy freedom from fear, freedom from violence and freedom from persecution. Together, freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom from violence and freedom from persecution are the four great freedoms on which this nation was built. But none is more important than the others, and those who exercise freedom of speech must ensure, just as those who exercise the freedom to drive a car must ensure, that their freedom does not come at the expense of the freedom

        If she truly believes in a united Australia, in one Australia, one people and one flag, it is about time that the honourable member for Oxley, Mrs Hanson, called on her supporters to cease the intimidation and the violence against young Australians of ethnic Asian background. Unless she does so, she gives lie to her claim that she is interested in one Australia. Unless she does so, she divides this country. Unless she says that racial persecution must stop, nobody in this country can have any faith that her comments about building one country are anything other than mere rhetoric.

I understand how Mrs Hanson can feel discriminated against when she sees people getting special treatment on the basis of the colour of their skin, and to a certain extent it is discriminatory. But that is nothing in comparison to the real discrimination and fear that these wonderful young people feel as the clock comes round to lunchtime.

        I really believe that this country is far finer than the vision of hate and division which has been created in the last couple of months. This nation is about upholding the fundamental truths which attract people from the four corners of the world. As the people come to us from the four corners of the world, I propose a four&amp;hyphen;square deal for all Australians because there are four truths that underpin
        <break page="4753" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         everything in Australian society. They are as follows. Freedom—freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom from persecution and freedom from violence. A fair go—equality of opportunity regardless of circumstance, regardless of the colour of your skin, regardless of the wealth or poverty of your parents. Mateship—loving one's countrymen, respecting them and treating them as you would want to be treated yourself. And reward for effort—looking after those who seek to look after themselves.

        Those are the four great truths upon which this nation was built. They marked the upward passage of our society and turned us from a convict settlement into one of the greatest nations on the face of the earth. They encouraged young Australian men and women to spread these truths to other countries and to other people less fortunate than ourselves. They are the four great truths which we should seek to uphold in this place. Protecting the weak, the needy and the vulnerable are a consequence of the four great truths.

        If this nation is to have any meaning, if this society is to have any value, we must ensure for all of our citizens the four&amp;hyphen;square deal which I outline here today. But, most importantly, unless you have lived with fear, unless you have felt it well up in your throat, unless you have come scarred and battered from the battlefield of the intolerant mind, freedom of speech, which is won with little effort and paid for with no sacrifice, is freedom of speech in rhetoric only. It is really freedom to be intolerant. I believe the finest thing we can offer is a tolerant Australia.

At the end of the day, despite our differences across this chamber, we are here because we love what Australia can be.

Before I turn to the subject that I specifically wish to deal with, I will make a couple of brief comments about the speeches of Senator O'Brien and Senator O'Chee. Firstly, I read the article in today's paper by Malcolm McGregor. I do not normally agree with the articles written by Malcolm McGregor when they relate particularly to what may or may not be happening in the Australian Labor Party in the New South Wales branch but I have to say that today's article is one of the most beautifully written and poignant articles that I have read on this issue and I congratulate Malcolm for that.

I wish that the Prime Minister had been as quick to respond to the comments of Mrs Hanson as he was to respond to the editorials in Asian newspapers of recent times.

        Whether one agrees or disagrees with that—I was one who believed we should not be there—the fact is that we were in their country and certainly not at their invitation.

We have invited them and we have welcomed them. Therefore, on that score alone, we should exercise and preach tolerance and acceptance rather than the division and hatred that is currently being expressed. That is an issue that I intend to speak about on another occasion.

        I turn now to the matter that I want to speak about today, which is also a matter of public interest. It is a matter on which I have spoken before: the potential for the building of a Sydney second airport at Holsworthy. If this proposal comes to fruition it will impact upon the lives of hundreds of thousands of residents in south-west Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I bring to the attention of the Senate some of the more recent developments that have occurred in relation to this issue. The government is letting the people and the community of that region in Sydney down, and it stands condemned for doing that. When Holsworthy was put on the list of two potential sites to be investigated for Sydney's second airport, the people, and the community of that region, were promised the most full, open and transparent environmental impact assessment that had ever been conducted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister is on the record as having stated that on a number of occasions. For instance, on 28 May, in response to a question from the member for Hughes, Mrs Vale, Mr Sharp said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there will be a full environmental impact study on both Badgerys's Creek and Holsworthy. The study will follow the guidelines established by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise which
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         involves full public consultation, full industry consultation and its being a transparent process. The honourable member for Hughes is concerned to ensure that residents of her electorate will have their views considered in this process. I assure the honourable member for Hughes that that will be the case: their views will be considered and given great weight in the process of determining the environmental impact study.

       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, that is not the case. The government has not lived up to that commitment and, unfortunately, as each day and each week goes by that commitment continues to be ignored.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, as we know, at no stage prior to the election did the coalition parties indicate that they intended putting Holsworthy back on the list as a possible site for Sydney airport. They went to the election, like the Labor Party did, with a commitment to build an airport at Badgerys Creek. The electorate of Hughes and surrounding electorates in south&amp;hyphen;west Sydney were deceived by this government because they had been told on numerous occasions that Holsworthy would never be the site for Sydney's second airport. And we all know the reasons why it had been ruled out many years ago.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many people have settled into that area, purchased land put up for sale by the Defence Housing Authority and made their lives in that region. But notwithstanding the decision to then put it back on the list, commitments were made about a full and open process. Of course we know that the amount of time given for community responses to the draft guidelines was initially limited to four weeks. It was only through community agitation and representations by parliamentarians, including myself, that that was extended by another month—still not sufficient time for people to adequately get across a very complex issue regarding the environmental impact of such an airport. Nevertheless, the government was forced to back down in its haste to rush this process through.

         The fact is that the process is about halfway complete. The consultants are due to report by early next year—only two or three months away. The consultants have already been appointed. They have already commenced discussions with the councils and other groups in the area. They have already started to compile their information on this particular site, which is the Holsworthy army base and, still, the government has not appointed the auditor; they have only just called for expressions of interest. The media release put out by the minister goes on to say:

Nobody knows who these consultancy firms are except, presumably, the minister and the department. I am beginning to wonder whether or not DDB Needham have been put on the list. We may find that out in due course.

         But there is a further concern that arises. The responsibility for overseeing this process in terms of the environmental aspects rests with the Environment Protection Agency. We know that this government really does not think too much of the Environment Protection Agency because at one stage it was their policy to get rid of it. But they have not done that. What they have proceeded to do is to nobble it so that it will become merely an arm of the government, rather than an independent authority charged with ensuring absolute integrity with respect to the EIS process. And what have we seen in recent days? The Executive Director of the agency, Mr Barry Carbon, and the Assistant Secretary, Mr John Ashe, have both resigned.

         —I also rise to speak on the issue of race that has been discussed earlier today by Senator O'Brien and Senator O'Chee. I am moved to speak on it because I have always held the view—which was just reinforced for me by Senator O'Chee—that unless you really are a victim of racism, unless you experience it, then you do not really understand it fully. That is not to say that those who do not experience it do not understand it. But when you are the victim of it, you know the de

        What I would like to do today is put on record some of my thoughts about the current bushfire that is pervading our society, and also put it into some sort of context. As a young person—and, I must say, not just as a young person, but even in recent days—I was also the victim of racially inspired abuse. When you are told, `Go home, you wog,' and you are told that directly in the streets of Australia by people who do not know you but who make that assertion on the basis of what you look like, then you do not feel you are really wanted here as much you thought you were. You do not feel the security that you think you deserve to feel, having been born in this country.

        One of my motivating factors for joining a political party—the Labor Party—was the issue of race. I was inspired by people like Whitlam and Dunstan in the late 1960s. Consistently through my time in politics I have had a very firm view about how we should treat those who are of different ethnic backgrounds, colour and political beliefs to ourselves. You cannot be a `former' minister for immigration. Because once you have been a minister for immigration the experiences that you have in that job stay with you for the rest of your life.

        One of the experiences that stays with me from the three years that I was privileged to hold that portfolio is the enjoyment of the richness and the diversity of our society. Another experience that stays with me is that consistently wherever I travelled in the world as a representative of this country, I felt proud when religious, political and business leaders recognised the degree of tolerance and respect for diversity that Australia, under the multicultural banner, was recognised as achieving internationally

        One of the other motivating factors that makes me get up this afternoon is that in recent weeks—in particular, the recent seven or eight weeks—I have had quite a number of calls from people in our community, from all parts of our community. Only a week ago, I was with some Chinese Australian friends—I was, in fact, experiencing some acupuncture—

        She kept discussing this and telling me about how the daughters of some of her friends have had their hair pulled and how they have been taunted on a racist basis at school. She said that that was bad enough, but the fact that the parents of the kids who did this did not even bother to ring and apologise for this unprovoked racist inspired action hurt her very much. Senator O'Chee, she was saying that, having lived here for quite a number of years, she did not feel the sense of security that she deserved.

        They are not the only circumstances that make me get up this afternoon. Members of the Aboriginal community are ringing me. Some of my Asian Australian friends, people who have actually been born here and have made a great success of business life here are getting spat at in galleries, and so on, and being told to go home. This is not the way that Australia needs to go, nor is it the way that we should go.

        One of the galling things about this is that these victims do not have their experiences paraded in our media in a way that, for instance, the person that lit the bushfire has her experiences paraded in our media. We do not see the end result of the bushfire that she has lit. We do not see the victims because, firstly, it is hard for people to come up and be brave enough to go on the media and say what they have experienced, and secondly the media is not accessible to them.

        Pauline Hanson is of the advance Australia backwards school. Her comments are unfounded, they are ignorant, they are illiterate. It is a position of prejudice, of ignorance, of fear. She has lit a bushfire and it is bushfire which is contrary to our national interest. It is not our destiny, and never has been, to be a monocultural nation that Pauline Hanson dreams of our being. It is not in our national interest. We are judged as a nation on what we stand for, how we respect each other and how tolerant we are of each other.

Those prospects have been enhanced by the diversity here.

How we handle the issue of race is not just important to the way that we develop as a society within Australia but it is important to our global image. Unless we get it right, we are going to suffer.

         I might be a lone voice in this—I do not think so—but let us not undervalue the importance of immigration to this society. We are a nation of migrants. Not many of us would be here if it was not for planned and unplanned migration programs. If we look at the history of Australia this century, we will find that whenever there has been a depression or a recession, conservative governments, particularly, have responded by bringing in people to stimulate growth and, through growth, to generate employment. If we look at the regions of Australia over recent years, where there has been population growth, we will find economic growth and less unemployment. That is a factor that should not be ignored. I come from South Australia where we have an aging population. We would like to have more population to ensure a critical base there and to ensure a market.

That is the particular point that really needs to be understood by the Prime Minister.

But the one community that benefited consistently from migration—and always used to come to me in my consultations on the migration program—was the business community, always wanting more. It would be really good if they got into the debate now and stressed to the Australian public, from their position of status in our society, the positives that we have achieved and the positives that we continue to achieve, if we work together constructively to overcome the Hansons, the voices of prejudice, ignorance, hatred and fear and build on that enormous diversity we have here, for our social and economic future.

In the profiles process engaged in with the universities, if universities attempt to do the wrong thing, they will be paying penalties. It is as simple as that. We have an absolute determination to ensure two things. Given you have the goodwill and the good sense to allow Australian students to buy a place at an Australian university, just as international students can, the government funded students will be properly protected.

        The first is that universities cannot enrol or sell a full fee place to an Australian student unless they have filled their quota of government funded places. That will ensure that universities do not do what they otherwise might choose to do, and that is take a lot of full fee paying students in the expensive courses—because the money from full fee paying students, of course, goes straight to the

       </para>

        There is a second requirement on universities, and that is that, even when they decide they do want to sell places and agree that it is perfectly acceptable—it does not matter whether they agree or not actually—they have to fund their government funded places first and we will only allow them to make up an Australian student body with 25 per cent full fee paying places. That will ensure that, in any one course, the government funded students form 75 per cent of the load. That will ensure that the fearmongering raised by some people on your side and others comes to nix, because in each course there will be 75 per cent government funded students.

I will simply tell you that some people have said that this is nothing but a substitution exercise—that I can talk to you in terms of the fact that you have got to fill your government funded load before you can sell full fee places, that I can talk to you in terms of the full fee places only being 25 per cent of the total Australian population and that that somehow would be misleading because what the government really wants to do is to cut the number of undergraduate places.

         —I thank Senator McGauran for that important question. As he said, there have been very good signs that Australia is settling into a low inflation environment. Of course, this was confirmed by the recent CPI numbers released last week by the ABS. Underlying inflation for the September quarter was 0.5 per cent, down from 0.8 per cent in the June quarter. Underlying inflation for the year to September was 2.4 per cent, in the middle of our target of two to three per cent on average over the economic cycle. The budget forecasts of course that inflation will continue to be at low levels for this year.

        These low inflation figures are very welcome indeed. They provide the opportunity to take the pressure off interest rates, getting higher investment and more growth. With inflation low, employees no longer need to negotiate big wage and salary increases simply to maintain their buying power. As the Treasurer said:

        Wages no longer need to chase prices.

        What Australia cannot afford in terms of interest rates, investment and jobs is for high wages growth to jeopardise the maintenance of low inflation. In an ever more competitive world, a firm cannot pass high wage increases on to consumers as it will lose market share.

        I also point out that wage restraint does not mean static real wages. Rather, the path to better living standards for employees is not to chase high wage claims that firms cannot afford, but to seek out higher real wages through productivity growth. Higher productivity is a key objective of this government; higher productivity through the IR reforms we have negotiated with the Democrats; and higher productivity through micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform in all areas where reform notably stalled under the Labor government.

        In any event, do not assume for one minute that anticipation of a new differentiated HECS and do not anticipate that implementation of the recommendations of Neville Wran, the former Labor premier of New South Wales, is necessarily what is going to have any particular impact. For example, you might imagine that some things that might have an impact on enrolments would be comments by people like Lori Faraone, the president of the National Union of Students, who made a remark to the effect that you need $30,000 to study at university. That sort of thing might put people off.

        If people were to believe some of the stories they have read in the paper, some of which have been supported by people on the other side and down that end, that this government was cutting $1.8 billion out of higher education, that might worry people too. If they read the fine print somewhere in some journals and papers that were prepared at least to print the real story and found that the cuts are something like $680 million over four years against $20 billion of expenditure, then they might not be so worried. If students could read that funding per student was remaining effectively the same, then they would not be worried.

        Senator, if there is any drop in enrolments—and we already know that in Queensland, for example, there is not but we do not know the figures—do not look simply to the implementation of more equity in the HECS system or to a situation where we are not going to charge a teacher the same as we are going to charge a doctor on a per annum basis as being the reason for that. Look amongst your own colleagues at some of the reporting they have given to what is happening in higher education and ask them whether they feel responsible.

         —I thank the honourable senator for his question. It is true, unfortunately, that we are witnessing another unfolding tragedy in Africa. The figures I have are that between 700,000 and one million people are on the move in Zaire, made up of both refugees and Zairean citizens. I understand that efforts to repatriate refugees to Rwanda have been largely unsuccessful. Of the 4,000 people recently arrived in Rwanda, approximately 700 were Rwandan refugees and the remainder were Zairean asylum seekers.

        The Australian government obviously wants to make as constructive as possible a contribution to a solution to this difficulty, both in providing an environment for political stability within which these people can start to, hopefully, live normal lives again, and, in the meantime, in dealing with the human tragedy in terms of food and the other daily requirements of these people.

        I am advised also that, in terms of the immediate needs, as the honourable senator would be aware, Australia has provided financial support in the past—some $45 million, I understand, in terms of humanitarian relief for the region since 1994. In that spirit, we are obviously prepared to continue providing financial support. We stand ready to cooperate with international agencies and non-government organisations in the provision of that urgently needed humanitarian relief.

        The situation is that some people have great difficulty in looking for work, even where some jobs are available, because they perhaps have a fixed view of which geographical area in which they will look for work or they have a fixed view as to what kind of work they will do. The law, which was administered by the previous government—or was supposed to have been administered by the previous government; it is not a new law—requires that people must take a job, not the job of their choosing. They are also meant to travel for up to 90 minutes to look for work and to take work. Some people need help in widening their jobsearch activities.

Both countries signed a statement of intent to cooperate on activities implemented jointly to mitigate greenhouse gases.

         The signing of the statement of intent with Indonesia demonstrates Australia is following through with the commitments it made in Geneva in July 1996 at the conference on climate change. It is the first bilateral agreement signed by Australia and, coincidentally, it is the first such agreement also signed by Indonesia. It is also important that it was signed in the presence of private sector representatives, which reflects the key role the private sector will play in implementing AIJ projects.

         Indonesia has signalled the project based cooperative activities to limit greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia will focus on improving forest management, efficient energy use and production and agricultural land management and livestock related emissions. Australian companies have already indicated substantial interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through such means with Indonesia. That will rebuild on the greenhouse challenge program, which so far has been highly successful—that is, the voluntary program undertaken by Australian business in conjunction with governments whereby business agrees to reduce its emissions which, as I remind the Senate, not only provide a good environmental outcome but also provide a good economic outcome.

That is a further signal of a developing environmental relationship which will be for the benefit of not only communities within both countries but also the international community.

In the end they convinced me that this scientific work, this research, is soundly based scientifically and is necessary to ensure that the fishing that is allowable on the Great Barrier Reef is not threatening the sustainability of any of the fish species. This is, of course, an experiment proposed by the Cooperative Research Centre on research designed to gather the information necessary to manage commercial and recreational fishing in the marine park in an ecologically sustainable way.

        Madam President, as you know, line fishing is a permitted use within the park, but estimates of the level of pressure being placed on the reef are difficult to establish. I am told that it is even less certain what the long-term effects of this fishing will be on the ecology of the reef.

        In many respects, existing fisheries management, I am informed, is more guesswork than science. That is why this research program has been put together. It has been put together to the background of a history of fisheries that are prone to collapsing from overfishing, without forewarning. This is the concern: that, although the evidence available from reefs that are currently fished suggests that the resource is sustainable, history demonstrates that that resource can drop away alarmingly quickly, and that is why there needs to be a comparison between reefs that have been fished for some time and reefs that have not.

But to more than balance that, eight current reefs that are open will be closed for a period of five years. So the fishing industry is actually complaining to me that the net result of this will be a loss of resource to the industry. Nevertheless, that loss is something that will have to be borne by the industry because it is necessary to ensure that the fishing that does take place on the reef is taking place in a sustainable way and, as I have said, that we are not threatening the fishing resource of the

          the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, when he described the federal Public Service Act as `a dog's breakfast of arcane, outdated and cumbersome regulation'? In the light of these comments, will the government be considering the introduction of individual work contracts for public servants in order to achieve, in the words of Mr Max Moore-Wilton, `more flexible remuneration'? Also, would part of this more flexible remuneration include the payment of differential wage rates for public servants doing the same job but in different states, as is suggested by Mr Moore-Wilton?

Interestingly, at the end of the last parliament—just before you got here—we tabled in this place the latest information on income levels which showed that lower paid public servants were actually falling further behind. Interestingly, under Labor higher paid public servants did well and lower paid public servants did not do as well. I guess it reflects the attitude of Labor to the community at large.

The latest death occurred in the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre and involved 30-year-old Edmund Auda. Mr Auda was found hanging from the bars of his cell on Monday morning. I understand that he had been transferred to Queensland from the Northern Territory in 1991. He had been released to work on 17 January 1996 but returned to custody on 3 April after being charged with various counts, including indecent assault and rape.

        Mr Auda was housed in a single cell in the Murri unit at the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre and was due to face court yesterday. I am sure that all senators share my concern that there has been a continuing high rate of deaths in custody since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody released its findings. Compounding the problem, of course, is that incarceration rates for indigenous people continue to be at an unacceptably high level. This is particularly so with young indigenous people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only conclusion that can be reached is that the process of implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has not effectively addressed these issues. This government came into office with the commitment to hold a Commonwealth-state summit on Aboriginal deaths in custody and the causes for the continuing high incarceration rates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Through the staff of my office, ATSIC, the Attorney-General's office and department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Office of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, we formed a steering committee that meets regularly to plan the summit. A consultation process involving indigenous communities and organisations will be coordinated by the Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee in the lead-up to the summit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An indigenous preparatory meeting will be held on 17 and 18 February next year prior to the summit, which is scheduled for 1 and 2 May 1997. The ministerial summit is open to Commonwealth and state territory ministers with responsibilities for indigenous affairs,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         law and justice, policing and corrective services and juvenile justice. The intended outcome of the summit is that there will be a renewed commitment by all Australian governments to reduce both indigenous deaths in custody and incarceration rates.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The areas identified for discussion in consultation with Aboriginal justice advisory committees are juvenile justice, diversionary strategies and policing in prisons. Obviously, Senator O'Chee and the Senate will acknowledge that—unless there is involvement of the Aboriginal people in the process, and their advice should be taken—no changes will occur in this regard until we get an effective strategy that has the support of the indigenous community itself, particularly in keeping young indigenous offenders out of custody.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There has been considerable discussion in that regard as to the manner in which this can occur. There have been pilot programs whereby young offenders are taken not into custody but to facilities where they are trained in work activities. This allows them to be trained in horse breaking and in activities that will give them the encouragement to enter the work force. So useful occupations will ensue out of this and also give them the opportunity of access to their family members, which was one of the major factors involved in the process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The summit is in line with recommendations 62 and 188 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I would hope that—as a result of this process and the summit that does occur with the involvement of indigenous people—an effective outcome can be achieved where at long last, after the expenditure of that vast sum, something can be achieved.

        Equally, I think it is incorrect to assert on the basis of this report that only in Korea would students enrolled in public universities be contributing proportionally more than Australian students. I understand, Senator, that you may be referring to the World Bank study table comparing tuition fees as a proportion of recurrent expenditures. If that is the case, it is very important to examine the table in that report very carefully. What that table does is compare fees as a proportion of total recurrent expenditure, not as a proportion of total tuition cost; that is, recurrent expenditure includes many activities other than tuition—in particular, research. That ratio should not be confused with the proportion of tuition costs recovered by the HECS scheme.

         Senator, I conclude by saying that, if you put so much faith in this report, you will accept that it says that the children of the well off are the most subsidised by a publicly funded higher education system, you will accept that we are asking those students therefore to pay more to reduce the subsidy and you will understand that, because it is largely the children of people who are well off who are heavily subsidised, that, by refusing to support the increases in HECS and a differentiated HECS, you will be reinforcing the social and economic advantage that those students receive.

Following the federal election and my appointment to cabinet, there was a need for more office space to accommodate extra ministerial staff in my Launceston electorate office, which I have used since my election to the Senate in 1986. Discussions started in March with a DAS officer based in Hobart. Rather than fit&amp;hyphen;out and relocate to a new office at considerable expense and effort, it was decided to occupy the lower floor of the same building.

Again the removalists had to be called in to assist with the moving of furniture and equipment with the help of staff. It was then necessary for the office to be closed for two days. Wiring work was continued on 20 June, and the carpet, now looking the worse for wear, was being relaid. Some office furniture was put back in place and the rest had to be despatched to storage for the duration of the refit.

Her poor successor did not know any of this detail and had to go through it all again and guess what some of it was meant to be, because I was very busily engaged at that time in Canberra, getting on top of the portfolio of social security, as you well know.

       In fact, I was not in the office very much at all, and I was certainly not bothering any workmen. There was certainly extra cost because of the lack of supervision by Works Australia. Nevertheless, having said all that, the total was still miles less than for my colleagues in Tasmania. For Senator Murphy, as I just pointed out, it was about $109,000, Senator Lundy, $104,000—

       The inference and the reflection on both the department and the workers in Senator Newman's answer yesterday was that, regardless of the cost, the cost of the fit&amp;hyphen;out was due to the stuff&amp;hyphen;ups that she claimed happened. Your staff member, Senator Newman, reiterated again today that, indeed, the cost of the fit&amp;hyphen;out could have been reduced by half had it not been for the stuff&amp;hyphen;ups. Minister, that is totally incorrect. That is a gross misrepresentation of the facts and, indeed, a total misleading of this parliament and of the public. The reality is the responsible minister, Mr Jull, approved a budget for a fit&amp;hyphen;out of only part of your

You said and your staff have reiterated your words that the cost was due to stuff&amp;hyphen;ups. As I said, Minister Jull approved a budget of $60,000 for fit&amp;hyphen;out only of the extension of your office. Contrary to what you said, the cost came in at less than $60,000—I think it was $53,400 or something—and, indeed, came in on time.

       I would suggest that maybe Senator Newman talk to Minister Jull and ask him about a letter I understand he may have received to ascertain that that amount of lighting was fitted into the office because there are Australian standards that must be complied with. You, Senator Newman, through you, Mr Deputy President, requested specific lighting because of the nature of the building. When they started the work they discovered that there was a false ceiling in the building, which is part of an old building, and they had to change the nature of the lighting, which gives the appearance that there is an excessive amount of lighting. But that has to be the case to comply with the Australian occupational health and safety standards. That is about workers.

        Again, Senator Newman has clearly misled this parliament. She has made a claim that is totally false. The minister ought to be called upon to apologise to the Senate for doing it. More importantly, she should be called upon to apologise to the workers she has reflected upon. This really raises the question with regard to the Department of Administrative Services and the minister responsible.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I just have to wonder whether or not the Minister for Administrative Services will ever stand up for the workers that he represents and the department that he represents. Quite clearly, he is not prepared to do so. He is prepared to allow a minister in this Senate to get up and condemn them without any defence from him. If there ever was a person who should take a good look at themselves and this claim about representing workers, it is Minister Jull.

        When you look at the costs that were involved you see that, of the $53,000 spent on the fit-out, $31,000 was for electrical work. Senator Newman has been in that office for over 10 years—I have visited it on many occasions—and it is an old house. It is certainly not grand. Half the time you have to sit outside on the veranda at the back to get a bit of extra room.

        Senator Newman was trying to save the taxpayer money by fitting out a couple of old rooms underneath for her staff. Most of the money was taken up in electrical work. I guess, if you had had a professional quote done on that place in the first instance, they probably would have advised the minister against doing anything. They probably would have advised her to move somewhere else. Senator Newman, being a true Tasmanian, spent $17,000 on new furniture for extra staff. I looked through the $17,000 and saw where the furniture came from. It came from Tasmanian Executive Furniture. It is all Tasmanian furniture.

        Let us have a look at some of these other figures. Senator Sherry, when he had his fit-out, spent $27,000 on furniture. You could buy a house in Launceston for that, Senator Collins. That is $10,000 more than Senator

         Newman spent. Let us have a look at former minister Duncan Kerr, who only had to move into the Commonwealth offices in Hobart. The offices were already there; all they needed was a fit-out. There was $80,000 spent just on fit-out. We are talking about ministers. How much do you reckon he spent on furniture? He spent $33,000. That is almost the amount the minister spent on all the electrical work.

To reflect on Senator Newman in such terms after the work she has done for Tasmania in putting together the Tasmania package, which is something the Labor Party could never do, I think is a bit rich coming from Senator Mackay.

There is no-one, apparently, able to put their case and it is left to the Labor Party to put the case again on behalf of the employees, who are under the direction of the minister.

By this, I mean the questions raised by Geoffrey Blainey, Lauchlan Chipman, Stephen Rimmer and others—they are good examples—and by the then Leader of the Opposition's One Australia speech at Esperance in 1988 and by the FitzGerald report in the same year.

       I think leadership is incredibly important. Leadership sets the tone of this country. It defines what we are and  what we aspire to be. Leadership leads to understanding, and I think there has been a failure of leadership in one important area, which has led to the capacity to exploit people's fears about difference. I think that failure of leadership has been on the pace of change in this country as a result of the economic rationalist policies of the last decade or so, a simple failure to say, `Of course we are living in an era of global capitalism; of course there are adjustments this country has to make; yes, there will be some pain on transition; yes, we are planning to ease the pain of transition.'

       Mr Howard may say he abhors racism and he may hope that this motion proves that, but it is my view and the Democrats' view that it will take more than a resolution of a couple of hundred parliamentarians to redress the deep hurt and offence that has been caused to so many Australians. It will take more than this motion to redress the damage that has been created by 50 days of qualified shameful silence. Make no mistake about it—the damage that has been done is long term and it is deep. The healing that we were hoping would happen as we move into the next century has irreparably been set back.

        this week showed that a Hanson-led party would win 18 per cent of the Senate vote if there were an election now.

Would the Hanson party demand substantial and discriminatory cuts in immigration and foreign aid? Would compulsory national service be the price for letting government legislation through?

        —The Australian Greens join earlier speakers in totally deploring the turn of events in this country since Pauline Hanson made her inaugural speech in the House of Representatives. It was a sheer coincidence that, at the very same time she was making that speech, I was making a speech in this house reflecting Greens policy for an egalitarian country where everybody, without fear or favour, felt proud to be able to demonstrate their own feelings, their own culture, their own creed and their own zest for life. It was a call to this country, this lucky nation of ours, to take a lead in a world where we are no longer apart, but part of a global village of six billion people. If we cannot do it in this country with the inherent advantages we have, then we cannot expect people elsewhere to do it.

      <para first-indent="16">
       I like to think that it was a good thing that that speech I gave got no coverage in the Australian press, but the next day headlines everywhere covered the racist epithets in particular from Pauline Hanson. What I was saying reflected more clearly and closely the real feeling of Australians, and what she was articulating was the absurd, abhorrent and anti&amp;hyphen;Australian viewpoint. However, things have proceeded in a downward spiral on the slippery slope towards a more divided Australia and, as a consequence of this debate on racism in this country, an Australia with its reputation impugned. There is little evidence to say that we are off that slippery slope.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       To me, there is still a simple factor in this—the touch point to this unseemly debate that has taken up Australia—and that is Pauline Hanson herself: Pauline Hanson, the member of the House of Representatives, who knowingly took her first opportunity to exhibit this unseemly discourse on racism and bigotry which is now a matter for universal comment, not only in this country but increasingly elsewhere around the world, to our detriment.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       While I support this motion wholeheartedly, I still believe it pulls the punch. It still fails to take the confrontation for those of us who feel appalled by Pauline Hanson's philosophy to that member of the House of Representatives. Moreover, it fails to come to grips with
       <break page="4793" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        the reality that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself has failed to take her head&amp;hyphen;on. He has gone out of his way to avoid naming her as the spark in this conflagration against our nation's interests. I do not believe it will be until he, as the leader of this nation, as head of government, joins all of us in condemning her that we will start to put things back to rights.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I think that the Prime Minister has made a mistake in believing that, by ignoring her, in some way or other she will go away. In fact, what has happened, sadly, is that her notoriety is inversely proportional to his recognition of her central role in what is happening. It is essential that he take her on as an individual who must take major responsibility for this awful debate that is taking place in this wonderful nation of ours. Therefore, I move an amendment to this motion in the following terms:

      <para>
       I do so because I believe, otherwise, we too are pulling the punch and we are not going to the core of the problem. Until we do, we are not going to be able to face the problem, dampen it down and apply the medicine that is required. The newspaper comments which increasingly say that the Prime Minister has failed or has made a mistake in his decision not to take on Pauline Hanson are correct. I believe that this motion falls short in that it does not do so either. Pauline Hanson ought to be taken to account in this motion. The Prime Minister's failure to recognise her central role in this, and his repeated refusals to do so, even under fairly intense inducement from journalists in this country, has been a mistaken policy.

       I do not believe it is going to give her greater kudos or  add anything to her bailiwick.

Of course that is nonsense. It couldn't have been.

       This nonsense about political correctness was simply code, particularly for those of us who are in this business of throwing words around and understanding them. It was code for, `Although I am being politically correct in saying the things I need to say, to rebut the things that Pauline Hanson is saying, I nevertheless quietly—wink&amp;hyphen;wink, nudge&amp;hyphen;nudge—am giving support to them.' He was far more explicit about this. The federal Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, said, `I disagree very strongly with the things Pauline Hanson said.' He was right up front.

The motion reaffirms our commitment to the rights of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or religion. Of course, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. I feel that what has passed for debate thus far has caused division and distress to a large number of people. Again, I say the media have a lot to answer for.

        The motion reaffirms our commitment to maintaining an immigration policy, wholly non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory on the grounds of race, colour, creed or origin. It reaffirms our commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society united by an overriding commitment to our nation and our democratic institutions and values. We denounce racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are—at least I hope we are—and certainly the kind we want to be.

        —The debate today is about an unseen guest, and her name is Pauline Hanson. I feel very strongly on this issue for a number of reasons, and I will be supporting the motion. It is a good motion as far as it goes, although one could debate whether or not it goes far enough.
       </para>

      <para first-indent="16">
       One of the reasons I feel strongly about this issue is that I am a politician who is in Pauline Hanson's way. Having had some members of the Liberal Party in Queensland speak to me about this issue, that is their assessment of the politics of the whole debate. I am also a Uniting Church minister, and have spent almost all of my life in Queensland confronting this issue for it is one that surfaces in that state regularly. I have tried to promote what I believe is a Christian vision of a tolerant and caring society. I do not believe that you can have a caring or a Christian society if it is not a tolerant one.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There is and has been in the press, particularly in Queensland, a lot of speculation about whether or not Pauline Hanson will run for the Senate. Apparently her staff believe this is where the action is. If it is her intention to run for the Senate in order to gain some kind of balance of power in this chamber, I guess I will be at the epicentre of that struggle. Some say it would be my seat she would have to take in order to get here.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       If, in any sense, I am under that kind of challenge, I certainly accept the fight. It is one I have been involved in for many, many years. I will be glad to continue to fight for the justice of this issue and for the kind of society that I want my children and grandchildren to grow up in. I do not expect to lose.

       I suspect Pauline Hanson's push for the Senate would be very similar to the old `Joh for PM' campaign or, if you like, Bronwyn Bishop as leader of the Liberal Party—a phenomenon that is like a brief comet that wends its way across the political firmament and then expires. Believe me, I can assure you that Mr Pasquarelli is no Sir Robert Sparkes—and Queenslanders will understand that reference.

        There are greater issues in this debate than my political future and any challenge that Pauline Hanson might represent. I have a lifelong experience in those issues. I do not think people understand what can be unleashed when you make room in our society for extremists, and it actually happens. When you begin these kinds of debates, they never stay within the bounds of people who seem to think the debate is about freedom of speech or about the right of people to say what they think. The debate never stays within those boundaries. Once we have unleashed the debate, it is one in which we make room for extremists.

        One could dismiss that as a lot of stupid nonsense, except that it was followed up for weeks by phone calls to my home that were in the same vein. Whenever my son or I answered the phone, the person who was calling would hang up. But when my wife or daughters answered it, then a message of that same kind was given to them.

         That is what happens when we open up this kind of debate and make space for extremists—and extremists certainly exist within our society. I do not want our society to go down that road. I have seen the effect that it has on people, particularly my own family. In the end, of course, we had to approach the police and other authorities in Queensland. Eventually, Telecom monitored our phone and we were able to stop it. But it did have a very serious effect on my family.

         —When we were previously discussing the objects of the workplace relations bill, I was trying to make the point very clearly that for the last 92 years this parliament has supported the encouragement of representative organisations of employers and employees. We have given positive encouragement to those representative bodies because that gave fulfilment to our commitment to collective bargaining. So it has been a central tenet of industrial relations in this country for the last 92 years at the Commonwealth level, and for most states as well, that unions and employer organisations were encouraged by the parliament.

        The government is proposing that those organisations continue to be regulated, to be limited and to be fined for misdeeds but not to be encouraged or promoted. We are going to recognise that they exist, but the whole emphasis of this bill is to concentrate on issues like the rights of individuals not to join unions or on the requirements for unions to be representative and accountable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have no difficulty with any of those concepts, but what is interesting is what is removed, what is left out. The encouragement that has been provided for years is no longer there. We have the punishment, the regulation, the fines and the restriction, but we do not have the encouragement and promotion that we have had for 92 years. Basically, the government does not want to promote unions of employers and employees. It is trying to focus industrial relations back on the individual negotiation between an employer and an employee.

         that individual negotiation was resulting in employees being exploited. The bargaining power between an individual employee and an individual employer was not fair and was not equal. Because of that unequal bargaining power, we created in this parliament a Conciliation and Arbitration Act that gave encouragement to collective bargaining and gave encouragement to organisations that represented employees and employers in order to provide for a fairer, more just and more equal system of industrial relations in this country. This is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia that this parliament is looking to remove that encouragement for those organisations.

The Australian public and the parliament are not surprised by this move on behalf of the government. The Liberal Party has made its opposition to trade unions and trade unionism very clear over many years—despite the members of the farmers union and the doctors union who sit on the government benches. Their rhetoric, their whole policy position, has been to oppose trade unionism, to oppose the functions and role of trade unions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What does surprise me is the position of the Australian Democrats in this. It is not in keeping with their traditional position to support a bill and amendments which try to strike out the role for trade unions in this country and ensure that the promotion and encouragement of trade unions no longer occurs.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at the policy that the Democrats took to the last election, you would be surprised by the position that they are adopting in this debate. Ironically, their general policy was called `Getting the balance right'. Their industrial relations policy had basically four major elements under the heading `Role of unions'.

        <para>
         That is interesting. Where is that policy position reflected in this bill? It is not there. The Democrats went to the election saying that they support the continuing and important role of unions as the principal representative of workers, but there is no expression of that principle in the amendments that they are supporting.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no support even for collective bargaining, per se, except for a small reference in the objects to `meeting our international obligations'. Those obligations include, of course, support for collective bargaining, but how do you give support to collective bargaining if you do not support collective bargaining agents? If there is no encouragement for unions of employers and employees, then how do you get collective bargaining? The reality is that the bill represents an attack on collective bargaining because it seeks to give primacy to individual negotiations. So there is no expression in the bill in relation to the first aspect of the Democrats policy on the role of unions, and it is particularly not expressed in the objects.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is the second element of their policy:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We support unions having the right to be heard on matters before the AIRC which have the potential to impact on their members, including test cases and the registration of enterprise agreements with significant flow&amp;hyphen;on potential.
        </para>
        <para>
         What is clear throughout this bill is the restriction on the right of unions to be heard, the restriction on the role of unions to play any part in the negotiation of Australian workplace agreements and to be heard when they have concerns about those agreements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, again, we see that the whole structure of Australian workplace agreements is based on secrecy. It is following the Western Australian workplace agreement model by providing for secret agreements to be registered and for unions and other parties—with an interest in proceedings—not to have access to the detail of that information and not to be involved in the making of those agreements. Clearly, the policy position the Democrats are adopting is contrary to the second point that
         <break page="4805" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          they stressed in their election policy document as being their position.

         It is interesting, though, in terms of their third and fourth major policy positions, in respect of the role of unions, that they are all in here. They are in here in spades. The third one is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Democrats believe that workers should not be discriminated against on the basis of membership or non&amp;hyphen;membership of a union or coverage or non&amp;hyphen;coverage by enterprise agreements.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is right up there in the objects of the legislation: no discrimination against people for not being members of a union. They have been very faithful to that policy prescription.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Their fourth one:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Democrats will continue to oppose compulsory unionism and closed shops.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, that is given full weight in the bill and the amendments that they are supporting. You can see the dichotomy of their position. They say their policy is about getting the balance right but what we have here is not getting the balance right at all. What we have is an expression of that part of the Democrats' policy as it relates to regulation, control of unions and penalties on them and protection for those who do not want to belong to unions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have no problem with that protection. But what we do not see is any expression of the Democrats' position in terms of encouragement and the giving of a primary role to trade unions. That is what they said was in their policy. That is what they said was essential to getting the balance right. The Democrats have not got the balance right because those aspects of their policy, that go to the rights of trade unions and the rights of employees to bargain collectively, are not represented in this bill and are not represented in the objects which give very clear expression to what this bill is about.

The Democrats have failed to live up to their policy commitments and I would urge them to think carefully about some of the Labor amendments that will be moved in this sec tion which try to re&amp;hyphen;insert support for promotion and encouragement of representative bodies of employers and employees. It is essential that that statement of encouragement be contained in the new act.

It does not matter how many times you put `fair' into the text of this bill; you will not bring about fairness without putting in place the structural support to make sure that you get fair outcomes. Putting in the word `fair', or `motherhood' or `apple pie', does not deliver the result. The structure of the bill has to provide the ability for people to get fair outcomes. That means allowing them to bargain collectively and allowing them to be represented by organisations that represent them collectively. This bill is about attacking that right. That is a right we have recognised since 1904 and this parliament ought to think very carefully before—for the first time since 1904—we seek to remove from our major piece of industrial relations legislation in this country that promotion and encouragement of representative organisations of employees and employers.

         I know the Liberal Party and the conservatives generally have concerns about union power but if you know anything about industrial relations you know that individual employees get their power from their ability to bargain collectively. That is why the ILO and the other international organisations have given primacy to that collective bargaining right over many years. If you take away the right of employees to bargain collectively, if you take away the encouragement and promotion of unions of employers and employees, you take away power from those individual employees. All the weasel words and nice&amp;hyphen;sounding amendments will not overcome that change in the balance of power.

This commitment is crucial to those who are most vulnerable within the workplace, especially apprentices, trainees, casual workers and so on.

         (Australian Capital Territory) (6.18 p.m.) With respect to the principal objects in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, there are a whole range of issues that really go to the heart of what the workplace relations bill is all about. First of all, I would like to address my comments to the distinction between the term `workplace' and the term `industrial' in terms of relations. When we talk about industrial relations, it is an issue that goes far beyond each individual workplace. Having come from an industry where, in fact, it is quite hard to define what your workplace is, what appears to be something of semantic value becomes a real and tangible issue, particularly when it is put in the context of being part of the objects of this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On that definition of industrial and workplace relations and the distinction between the two in, for example, the building and construction industry, it is actually very difficult to define what a workplace is. There have been difficulties in assessing that definition under a variety of acts, including, of course, the various state occupational health and safety acts. In the construction industry a workplace may be a place which is under the control of the particular employer, but it may not. Quite often work takes place in an area in someone else's workplace, for example, during refurbishment, repatriation work or something like that. The definition becomes very blurry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other issue about the distinction between industrial relations and workplace relations is that it really does preclude approaching those issues on an industry basis. This government is signalling quite clearly a move away from approaching industrial relations on an industry basis down into individual workplaces. That really symbolises the move of this bill away from collective bargaining and away from approaching wage setting and conditions of employment across a whole range of classifications in a given industry down to the individual workplace. That raises questions of equity as well as collective bargaining.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The industry&amp;hyphen;wide role is a crucial one in industrial relations and must be recognised in the objects of this bill. If it is not, then the workers in those industries will be the ones that will be split and divided. Their ability to retain their existing workplace conditions and wages will certainly be jeopardised. The ability of those workers to operate and organise themselves collectively is quite fundamental to maintaining decent conditions. It is no secret that in the industrial movement it is those workers in the well&amp;hyphen;organised sectors that can organise effective campaigns to improve their wages and conditions and who help move along and bring up the wages and conditions of those workers in the industry who are not in a position to organise themselves collectively.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This been a feature of industrial relations and the evolution of industrial relations in Australia that has brought some equity to wages claims and to the way that they are progressed through the system. The transitional movement from solely centralised wage fixing and awards to enterprise bargaining has meant that there is still some ability for workers organising themselves collectively in an industry to look after those at a greater disadvantage in the industry. But, under this bill, and in terms of the objects here defined, that ability will be vastly diminished.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It will be those workers who cannot pursue a fair and equitable outcome, who are not in a position to bargain with their employer, who will be at the greatest disadvantage. That is what we are really talking about when we look at this bill and see where the damage will be done. It will be those workers who currently rely on the stronger sectors of the work force to bring their wages and conditions up to par.

           This system does not provide for any mechanism of that nature to occur. In fact, what it sets in place is the very opposite. Yes, it provides for some workers to enter into workplace agreements, if they are in a position to do so, but then it leaves all the other workers totally exposed. The protections that were in place before this bill was introduced, by allowing unions to actively intervene on behalf of workers if they suffered a disadvan tage, are also being removed. The need to protect those in our work force who are not in a position to bargain goes right to the heart of what our amendments to this bill are all about.

Yet, we see in their policies phrases like `better pay for better work' and all the rest of it. Tell me where, in these objects, they talk about a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. There are many inconsistencies in this government's approach as to what they say and what this bill contains.

The issue of better pay for better work is something that has been embraced in Labor's industrial relations policy and provided the means for people to pursue better pay.

It is crucial in the language of Labor and in the language of working people, which allows them to join the trade union that is involved in that particular workplace and, subsequently, allows that trade union to play an active role within that workplace in collective bargaining.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           If there is one signal that is patently clear in this particular bill it is the fact that this government is all about breaking the trade unions and destroying their ability to collectively bargain on behalf of the people they represent. Never mind that working people choose to pay their subscriptions to their union so that the union can represent them. Never mind that for 100 years the union movement has led the way with the development of awards here and improved the award wages and conditions which have flowed on into the areas where perhaps union membership is not so high. Never mind that that is the movement that has made all the difference for working people in Australia.

           This government is so narrow-minded in its ideological pursuit that it does not matter what it takes in this bill—dress it up how you like; it is about undermining that fundamental ability. I think this is where the Democrats' deal really needs to be called to task. It is one thing to say certain things, having come to a balanced outcome and all the rest of it. How can you have a balanced outcome in the Industrial Relations Commission if the unions are not allowed under this act to operate effectively as the collective representatives of workers?
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The Industrial Relations Commission has not awarded these wage rises and improvements in conditions over the years from the goodness of its heart. It has not said, `Well, in our view we think it should go like this.' It has been the fact that we have had the balance of powers between the employer organisations and trade unions arguing the toss. The unions are saying, `The workers are worth more because they do this, this and this
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            and they are working these hours and this is the nature of their work and the cost of living has gone up this much and they have transient employment, which means they deserve some sort of severance or redundancy pay or some TCR provision or superannuation so they can have dignity in retirement.' On the other hand, the employer says, `We don't want to pay anything. We can't afford to pay.' That is where the balance lies.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The balance lies in the Industrial Relations Commission being able to come between those two parties and come to a position that satisfies, hopefully, the needs of the working people in improving their conditions of employment in a way that also satisfies the public interest. That is where the balance is. You will create an imbalance by undermining the role of trade unions in the Industrial Relations Commission, and that is what this bill does.

         —I want to speak on the objects of the bill, which are before the committee. I want to do so by prefacing my remarks with the observation that when I spoke last there was not a publicly notorious deal between the Australian Democrats and the government. There is now. That does reflect the complexion of this debate in this chamber and it reflects the complexion of the clauses that we have here before us. Clearly, such a deal enables an act to be carried in the form that the majority of this extended coalition will allow.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is very important to put on the public record some of the concerns and also sound a note of warning about some of the potential results of that deal in a practical world. That deal was struck on a two-party basis without the Australian Labor Party being involved and without the immense knowledge and background that the Australian Labor Party has in this field. It was a deal struck by the Democrats, with the greatest respect to them and an acknowledgment that their intentions were honourable. Nonetheless, without that information base, I would submit strongly to this chamber, it is a deal flawed. Without that knowledge base, it opens up the workplace to exploitation.

       <break page="4811" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In looking at this bill, I think the first and obvious question that anyone asks themselves about a bill before a parliament is: what is the head of power in the constitution of Australia that the parliament draws on to enact this legislation? In the case of the original Industrial Relations Act in this nation, the head of power was that clearly set out in the Australian constitution by our constitutional forefathers, allowing the parliament of Australia to make laws governing the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes going across the border of more than one state. It is set out in the constitution. For clearly a century we have drawn from that head of power.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the last two parliaments we extended that head of power to include the foreign affairs power. We did that for a very good reason. The international standards in this field, with Australia moving into the international economy, are important issues. The arbiter of international standards—the United Nations, if you like; certainly it is a UN agency—of international labour relations is the ILO. I know that the government has made a great deal of sport publicly by misrepresenting the ILO. The ILO is called the International Labour Organisation—L-a-b-o-u-r—because it deals with workers and employers and the labour force. When it was the opposition, the government tried to pretend that it was a `Labor Party' international organisation, which is of course a public lie and not true.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ILO is a tripartite body. It is unique among international bodies in that sense. It is tripartite in that it has three parties that appear in it as the stakeholders—governments, employers and workers. For a convention of the ILO to be proclaimed as a fair labour convention, all three parties must concur. Where all three parties speak with the one voice internationally through economies that cover developed countries and developing countries and countries in various stages of economic growth, there has to be an overwhelming unanimity of view. Conventions are given birth when there is. Because they are, they carry a certainly international moral as well as political force as to what the fair standards of behaviour should be in modern

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seemed appropriate to the former government that, as a good international citizen, through the foreign affairs powers of the constitution, we should draw on those international powers in setting standards in Australia. That still remains a fundamental principle. It is one the government rejects. The government is wrong in that and the government is captured by its own tawdry rhetoric on this subject. What this bill does is go further and draw on another head of constitutional power which our constitutional forefathers never intended but which this government has pressed into service for the sake of the expediency of this legislation, and that is the corporations power in the constitution.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We had an interjection from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Senator Campbell), who is at the table, to Senator Lundy, when she was talking about some of the things in the objectives of this bill. He said, `Why didn't you do it?' We did not do it for the reason that we had not used the corporations power as the head of power to legislate. But this government is using it. I think there is an arguable case whether it should but, for the sake of improving industrial relations, my party at least accepts it for the time being. But there is an arguable case as to whether or not that is a legitimate expression of what was intended by the constitution. It is a way of managing the constitution for modern legislation. We all know how difficult it is to bring the constitution up to date.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With those remarks, let me say that the objectives of a bill ought to reflect indeed the full intention of the bill. The two most important clauses, I always think, in a piece of legislation, are these. Firstly, what are the objectives of it? If they are clear, how you then encode those objectives or give expression to those objectives is what the rest of the bill is about. The second most important part of the bill is what its scope is. In other words, what is the extent of its coverage? One of the most vexed questions in Australia over history has been: what is an industrial question?
         <break page="4812" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          What matters can the arbitration commission deal with—that is, matters prescribed as industrial questions? What matters can't it deal with—that is, matters that are not prescribed as industrial questions?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the truths is that the limitation of the constitutional head of power has limited the objectives of previous acts—and limits the scope of them—and left outside a number of things that, in the modern workplace, are clearly industrial but, nonetheless, the commission were not clothed to deal with. I also foreshadow, when we come to the question about the scope and power of the industrial relations commission, that that is a matter of quite considerable importance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Just turning to the objectives part of the bill, I will not take these necessarily in order because, in the time allowed to address the committee, I do not have sufficient time to go through this in the type of detail that I would like. It is convenient for me to start with the opposition's proposed amendments—firstly, as I read it here, paragraph (l). In this we say that we need to add in to the bill the provision:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (l) ensuring that labour standards meet Australia's international obligations.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is convenient only because I have just addressed the committee on the ILO. I think that is a fundamental provision. As I say, we, as a nation, need to be sure that the labour standards applied in Australia are labour standards that are reasonable by the international measure and not just by our own domestic measure. The court that determines that is that tripartite body the ILO. Unless the objectives of this bill reflect the ability to do that, to encode ILO conventions and recommendations, then we fall short of what is necessary in modern industrial relations. Indeed, by excluding it, the government reveals, I think, its hand in that it wants to not meet those internationally declared standards or it wants to provide a bit of ice for itself to slide below them or to manipulate them where it suits its needs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most sensible thing here is to say that the ILO does have power in this field; its role is respected; it should be recognised. We should have, in this bill, a provision that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          explicitly does so. I support strongly the opposition proposals on that score.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If one needs to look at all the amendments that we are proposing, without in any way derogating from the significance and importance of any one of them, the one that I would place as the pre&amp;hyphen;eminent change that is necessary to the objectives of this bill is the provision that we insert in the objectives of this bill that no&amp;hyphen;one will be worse off.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I say that for a number of reasons. Firstly, I believe this bill is a public confidence trick by the government. The government has hijacked Labor rhetoric to sell a bill of goods to the community and reassure the community that it will be all right. If this bill gets passed as the package that has been agreed and comes into force and is shown to be flawed and the people begin to realise that the promises made blithely by the government at election time are false and fraudulent, then they will rebel—but then it will be too late.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the role of the opposition is to hold the government strongly to the position that it put to the people, which the government sought a mandate for. The fundamental thing it said to the people in the election debate was that no&amp;hyphen;one will be worse off. That is what the government said; that is what the government should have in this bill. That should be a fundamental objective of this bill. If that is what it sought its electoral mandate on, and it got a mandate, that is what it should be made to encode in this legislation. If it does not do it, it is the first step towards eroding its own mandate or crawling out from its own election promise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No-one could say that that was not a core promise. You would all have to say that that was a fundamental promise. The reassuring noises the government made to the Australian work force and to Australian employers that no-one would be worse off and that this would bring harmony into the workplace were, I think, quite a significant undertaking by the government in the run-up to the election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Not only is it important to hold the government to its promise; it is important that it be there in order to protect vulnerable members of the work force, in particular trainees and
         <break page="4813" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          apprentices, who have virtually no bargaining power in the present labour market. They need the force of law to guarantee them a protection.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We heard just last sitting week that a Newcastle firm had advertised for 40 apprentices and that something like 1,900 applicants turned up for the job. No-one can believe that, in the queue for those 40 jobs, any one of those 1,900 young prospective workers had any bargaining power at all in negotiating with that company, a major Newcastle firm, over the terms and conditions of their employment. I think a provision such as this is necessary in order to provide some clear direction in this act, as a key objective of the act, to ensure that those people are not exploited.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again I say: if you leave that provision out—if that is what the package between the Democrats and the government does—then this has to be declared, frankly and openly, to be a reprehensible package that should not pass in the public interest, and certainly not in the interests of those who are vulnerable in the workplace.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also draw attention to provision (c) in our amendments, which states that, whilst we accept that the act must ensure that primary responsibility for determining employment matters should be at the workplace, we in the opposition wish to add the necessity for this to occur within the framework of the act and with the protections of the commission. I think that is pretty fundamental because the act should not recognise, even in a de facto way, determination of employment matters at the workplace outside of the framework of the act itself; that is, informally or without the protections of the commission and without review of workplace agreements by the commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The only umpire in this field is the commission. If you tie the hands of the umpire behind his back, put a blindfold over his mouth and prevent him from speaking, then injustices will occur. The only way you can guarantee that is, I think, by accepting the principle we have set in terms of this legislation.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are a lot of other things I could talk on in relation to the objectives, but I do not have time in the allocation available to me now. One of the other ones I draw particular attention to is (f) about effective bargaining—not just agreement making, as provided for in this bill. Bargaining, to succeed and to hold, must be fair. If the parties cannot conduct fair bargaining, if it is just an agreement, it is a fraud.

       <para>
        We are in disagreement on many aspects of clause 3 of the bill, which deals with the principal object of this act, but we certainly would not, any of us, disagree with the sentiments set out in that particular object.

There must be a start to that with the original inhabitants of this land.

        This is another very important section of our society that needs to be noted. These people classify the material we watch and the computer games that we play. They often come in for great criticism. I notice that the director of the classification board is John Dickie, who has done a lot of work over the years in classifying material that is sent out for us to consume in the community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I know he has come in for a lot of criticism, but he has done a grand job, as has everybody else on the classification board. Indeed, while I am still on my feet, I should mention the Classification Review Board. It also has done good work. It is always a very difficult problem to decide what should be censored and what should not. People have heard these arguments over the years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is one aspect about all of this that is of interest. The classification scheme in Australia needs the cooperation of not only the federal government and the state governments but also the territory governments as well. So all governments in Australia must come together to get an efficient classification scheme. It is a part of a national scheme.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One problem with those sorts of schemes is this: because there are agreements between governments, it becomes difficult for parliaments to give the scrutiny that should be given to the underpinning legislation. I see in the chamber the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch. She is a great parliamentarian and she has worked over the years on this and she would understand the importance. And, of course, Peter O'Keeffe is in the chamber, too, who was my secretary on the regulations and ordinances committee, which was directed towards supervising what governments do.

        I would like to take a few moments in relaying to this chamber exactly where the National Museum is at. Many will be aware that, in its endless search for construction, the National Museum of Australia has been, once again, forced to jump through several hoops in its quest for a physical presence in the nation's capital, Canberra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This particular report really highlights the very grand efforts of the staff of the National Museum in times when it must be very difficult for them to keep their morale as high as they obviously do in their work. Particularly, it is worth noting the work that has been done in taking the National Museum around Australia. One of its key result areas as noted in the report is access and making the collections of the National Museum accessible to people right around Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many senators will know that the bulk of the National Museum's collection is in a couple of warehouses in Canberra. Funding is provided on an annual basis to ensure the collection is maintained in adequate form for when the museum is ultimately constructed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If honourable senators have not taken the opportunity yet to peruse the collection of the National Museum of Australia in the suburb of Mitchell, may I suggest that they do so and ask the very helpful staff to conduct them through the hallways, warehouses and storage areas of the National Museum of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So where is the National Museum going? It is still waiting, as it has for many years, for a decision by this parliament, or by the government of the day, to move to construct for it a permanent residence. The nature of that permanent residence has changed over the years with funding constraints, other pressures and contentious issues, such as the siting issue, impacting upon the museum. We will move slowly, but I am hopeful it will inevitably be towards the construction of the museum.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Its nature has also changed in that we are now talking about a hub of a collection that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         will be transported regularly around Australia. The innovative CD ROM collection the National Museum is putting together means that schools have the ability to access the collection through multimedia as well. The siting study that is being conducted at the moment is going through its own throes of uncertainty with new sites being introduced by the ACT government and others all the time.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At this point in noting this report, I would like to commend the work of the staff of the National Museum. I say to them, `Keep your spirits up. Keep the morale high.' I am hopeful that we will see the construction of a National Museum and am hopeful and ask that this government honour its commitment to construct the National Museum of Australia here in Canberra. It would be preferable at the Yarramundi site, but the siting study will no doubt provide some recommendation with regard to that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Perhaps one day we will ultimately see what will prove to be one of the most exciting and innovative modern museums this country has ever seen. It will truly be a museum that not only we in Canberra, in the nation's capital, will be proud of but also every Australian will be proud of and hopefully visit.

He was crucial to the setting up of the Trade Union Training Authority and, unfortunately, may I say, that initiative has now been frustrated. Nonetheless, there is a need for people

        This scheme has been set up by the Victorian Trades Hall Council. The secretary of that council, Mr Leigh Hubbard, is the person who took over from Mr John Halfpenny and has done very good work since he came into office. This latest venture is certainly amongst the best that he has undertaken. The person who has done much of the work in getting the actual nuts and bolts together is Mr Greg McConville. I think it is an appropriate time to go through some of the work this organisation will perform.

        It will get under way and start teaching people in January next year. It is interesting to see the topics this particular program will deal with.

        As I go through the list of subjects this institution will be dealing with, I can see that it is very comprehensive and very essential. A fee will be charged for the various courses, but it is an initiative that is funded completely by the trade union movement.

        Education gained through this organisation's proposed initiative will enable workers' representatives to have the same abilities and conduct themselves in an equally skilled way as those with whom they will be negotiating—the employers and their representatives. It is a most essential initiative because, when the new industrial legislation we have been discussing today has been passed—as now seems inevitable, there being agreement between the coalition and the Democrats—there will be a crucial need for people to be able to handle themselves well in negotiations and for unions to be on equal terms with those they will be negotiating with.

         position on reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians. Instead, we had Senator Bob Collins using the whole of his 20&amp;hyphen;minute contribution to the debate not to advocate and uphold those worthy values but to attack the Prime Minister  (Mr Howard) of this country in an appalling, ugly and party political manner which I thought brought no credit to himself, the motion or this chamber.

        It is a great pity that people like, in this case, Senator Bob Collins cannot help themselves. Any opportunity to exercise a party political position seems to be too attractive. In his attribution of very cynical and populist motives to the Prime Minister, I thought he was disgraceful in the way that he attacked him. It was nothing more than a personal attack on the character of the Prime Minister. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to make a statesmanlike statement on the important values that maintain this nation cohesively, he instead attacked the Prime Minister personally.

        It seemed to be that Senator Collins was insisting, by his personal attacks on the Prime Minister, that the Prime Minister should be personally attacking Pauline Hanson. Of course, that is what the media seems to be demanding—that none of us should stand up without attacking Mrs Hanson personally. I have heard the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) do just that in radio interviews—attack the very character of Mrs Hanson.

        I want to take advantage of this opportunity tonight to say that this is becoming an ugly feature of public policy debate in this country. I do not want to get party political, but it must be said that the former Prime Minister encouraged this particular feature of Australian debate—you do not talk about the merits of issues, the merits of proposals put forward by your opponents, but you personally attack them. You attack their character, you attack their motives, you attribute false motives to them in any way you can. Public debate in this country is far less civilised in that sense than it ought to be in terms of contributing to the sensible debate of public policy issues.

        Tonight I want to refer briefly to what Mrs Hanson actually said, and what has, I guess, generated this debate and the motion today. The feature of her speech that has drawn most attention is this statement:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, she said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Immigration must be halted in the short term so that our dole queues are not added to by, in many cases, unskilled migrants not fluent in the English language.
       </para>
       <para>
        That seems to be the guts of Mrs Hanson's speech that has caused the most anxiety and concern in the community, and those statements were obviously inaccurate, insensitive and uncalled for.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point I want to make is that the Prime Minister has repeatedly and often stated, as a consequence of that speech, and subsequent to that speech, the government's position in relation to the issues raised by Mrs Hanson. He has dealt with the merits of the issues raised by her and the policy proposals put forward by her, and he has refrained from personal attacks on her. He has repeatedly stated the government's position on immigration: we are committed to an immigration program based on non-discrimination on the grounds of race. He has said that over and over again.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He has repeatedly stated this government's commitment to tolerance and equality regardless of race or the colour of one's skin. He has rejected her views on Aboriginal Australians. He has acknowledged their particular disadvantage and this government's commitment to dealing with that particular disadvantage. That is why I was disappointed with what Senator Collins said. He attributed false
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         motives to the Prime Minister and then ignored the fact that the Prime Minister has dealt with the issues raised by Mrs Hanson in her speech. He did not, as I said, attack her personally, which seems to be what Senator Collins wants the Prime Minister to do.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am not quite sure what Senator Collins wants the Prime Minister to do. Does he want the Prime Minister to order that Mrs Hanson be locked up or something? He has dealt with the issues raised by her in a matter of fact way. He could not have done more to repeat the government's position on the issues raised by her—this government is committed to non-discriminatory immigration policy. He has dealt with those issues raised by Mrs Hanson with great dignity, with great responsibility as the leader of this whole nation. I am sorry that Senator Collins in his contribution did nothing more than play party politics with a very important issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Both parties had worked together to draw up this statement and make it a bipartisan statement. Instead, Senator Collins used his opportunity to speak to just attack the Prime Minister for what he has allegedly not done or what his alleged motives are.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Collins also seemed to attack the Prime Minister because he acknowledged that a lot of Australians agreed with Mrs Hanson. So Senator Collins seems to want the government to also deny reality as well as personally attack Mrs Hanson. The fact is, like it or not, many Australians do agree with many of the policies advocated by Mrs Hanson. That is a fact of life, whether we like it or not. Newspoll found that 71 per cent of Australians now want lower immigration. The
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Bulletin
        </emphasis>
        today says that 66 per cent want to stop immigration in the short term, and 51 per cent agree that Aborigines should get no special advantages. The Prime Minister has been attacked for simply acknowledging the reality that those are the opinions of a lot of Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The paradox is that much of the state of public opinion in this country, which presumably Senator Collins does not like, can be attributed, in part, to the 13 years of Labor rule that we had in this country. The Labor Party's policies over that period—which were
        <break page="4820" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         roundly attacked by one of its own ministers, Peter Walsh, in his very good book—were an out of control immigration program, a roller-coaster immigration program, massive unemployment and vicious government attacks on anyone who criticised any of the former government's policies.

        I am afraid to say, as someone who has quite honestly respected Senator Collins in the past, that his contribution today, which I thought sullied what is otherwise a good bipartisan motion on these issues, represents the fact that the Labor Party apparently is not capable of meeting the challenge which Professor Lake has described in her very good article, which I think all Labor supporters and members ought to read because it sets out very clearly the great dilemma facing the Labor Party after its 13 years of government.

        We all deplore the fact that so many Australians seem to agree with much of what Ms Hanson has said, but we must deal with that reality. It will serve this parliament no good if we pretend to ignore that reality or deal with this issue on the basis of personal attacks. Let us deal with the merits of the arguments and attack the arguments on their merits. I therefore conclude by saying I hope that Senator Collins's contributions will be constructive.

He stopped in to see the lessee of one of the local hotels, a bloke called Terry Smith. In a previous life, Terry Smith was a prominent member of the Australian Labor Party in the Northern Territory. He was a quintessential territorian. He followed me, in fact, as leader of the party in the Northern Territory. He quit politics in 1991, a few months after he became the sole target, as leader of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory, of one of the most personally vicious advertising campaigns in Australian political history, which certainly had an effect on him personally and also on his family—his wife and children.

        I think we know the answer. It is because the minister chose to be selective and he did so because it suited his political purposes.

         schools start with an advantage because a lot of their students come from highly literate households, on the other hand a number of schools are drawing students from families that don't have English as a first language or who suffer some other educational disadvantage. What parents want to know is not so much the starting point but whether the school is able to add value.

        I get the feeling here that the minister is confusing our children with products and industry when he talks about adding value. However, Jane Figgins on Radio National again tries to get the minister to address the question of what the government wants to achieve. She says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I would have thought that being consistent with what you are saying is that you would really look for some absolute standards and, no matter what background a child came from, it would be unacceptable if they did not reach those standards.

       <para>
        The minister replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well, I think as a community of course we aim to do that, we aim to have every child literate and we will be seeking out of the National English Literacy Survey to set national standards for literacy for years 3 and 5. We need to make sure that teachers have available to them a way of assessing their entrance into grade one so that they can identify those students who have already achieved a good level of literacy—

        and those who are going to need particular attention. We will need to look at the curriculum and say, `Does it allow sufficient time for students to gain literacy skills?'
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not repeat the remarks which I made here yesterday about the absurdity of such simplistic approaches to solving problems associated with literacy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister told us today that there is research which suggests that there are many students who simply do not find the time in the curriculum, and that many teachers are frustrated at the moment because of the amount that they are being asked to do. I would like to suggest to the minister that one way of dealing with this would be to see that class sizes are reduced so that teachers can spend more time with individual students. As a teacher, I can assure the minister that there is a far better chance of being able to deal with literacy in all its facets with a class of 20 children than one with 25 or 30. I remind the minister that in
        <break page="4824" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         my home state of Victoria the state government has actually increased class sizes and reduced support services for teachers. The minister also needs to be reminded that teachers often cope with composite classes of two and three levels in which the literacy achievements of students are highly varied.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another matter I want to address is the question of broadbanding and literacy. As the Senate will be aware, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996, which is before the Senate committee, includes a proposal by the government to do what is called broadbanding for government programs. This involves reducing the number of programs of targeted assistance from more than 40 to just five. One of these is literacy. These 40&amp;hyphen;odd targeted assistance programs did just that: they targeted assistance to those students who were most disadvantaged, educationally and socially. They acknowledged the direct relationship between social and economic circumstances and education outcomes. They were a genuine attempt to introduce some across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board equity into primary and secondary education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Literacy may well be one of the five priority areas under the government's broadbanding proposals, but it is not going to deliver real improvements in literacy in the absence of a solid commitment to equity and to reducing disadvantage. You will notice that Minister Kemp never mentions that word `equity'. Perhaps it has become a dirty word. In any case, it seems to have disappeared in relation to education. The government, it seems to me, is saying that if it lets parents know the truth, if the government develops a policy and if we get literacy programs in place, then it is all just a matter of students knuckling down and getting on with it and—hey, presto!—every student will magically be able to master literacy or learn to read; we are not sure which the minister is aiming for.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Disregard the circumstances of those students' lives, disregard their cultural backgrounds, disregard the standard of equipment, the class sizes, and all those other factors which impact on a child's ability to achieve standards of literacy. We all know that this is simplistic arrogant nonsense. An education
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         system that fails to acknowledge the connection between socioeconomic status and school outcomes is a system which will fail many, if not all, of those disadvantaged students.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Take the STAR program, for example. That program assisted schools to identify students most at risk of not completing secondary school, and it encouraged their participation through a range of school based projects. Because of the sorts of students involved in these programs, many STAR projects actually focused on basic literacy and numeracy skills in combination with addressing the health, housing and other needs of students. In short, STAR did not just try to get students reading and writing in isolation and it did not simply give them more English classes instead of sport; it took those problems in context and it recognised that poor literacy and numeracy skills were a consequence—and an exacerbation, I might say—of those other social and economic problems. I remind the Senate that STAR has, of course, been abolished by this government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the words of Joan Brown, the Director of the Australian Centre for Equity Through Education:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Nowhere in the government's new programs is there recognition that students are coming to school with complex social and health problems that schools and teachers are not trained or resourced to deal with.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge the minister, for the sake of Australian children, to start to listen to what educators are saying instead of alarming people with his predictably simplistic phrases about information not being available to parents, about competition and choice—whatever those words mean—in the context of an education system serving 70 per cent of Australian children, and in the context of the many students who, in some way, are less advantaged than others.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        By failing to explicitly address equity issues, the minister's broadbanding effectively ends any federal government commitment to nationally target those students and communities most in need.
