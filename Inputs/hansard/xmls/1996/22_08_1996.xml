        —by leave—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I would like to report to the Senate on the delegated legislation under which the recent census was conducted. Most public comment on these legislative provisions was concerned with the fine of $100 per day for failing to fill out the form. It is, however, not widely known that the whole conduct of the census was based on legislative instruments made by the executive, some of which were not only not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, but also were not even required to be tabled.

       The enabling act for the census is the Census and Statistics Act 1905, which is a short act with provision for the collection of general statistics as well as for the census. The legislative scheme of that act is to provide the barest structural bones, which are to be filled out by delegated legislation. The act provides for a census to be taken in each fifth year after 1981, although these may be increased by regulation. There is nothing objectionable in this because the entire process so far is under parliamentary control, with any such regulations being subject to scrutiny and possible disallowance. However, the act then provides for the actual census day to be appointed by proclamation. Again, there is nothing exceptional in such a provision. Indeed, it may be the most appropriate and practical option. What is exceptional is that there are no formal procedures for any parliamentary scrutiny of this action.

       The Governor&amp;hyphen;General in fact proclaimed 6 August 1996 as the census day, sealing the
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        proclamation with the great seal of Australia. This proclamation was made on 13 June 1996 but was not gazetted until 26 June 1996, two days before parliament rose. This lack of parliamentary control will, however, be corrected with the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996, which provides for scrutiny of such proclamations.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Two notices given by the Australian Statistician are also of concern because they are the basis for the obligation to fill out the census form. Here also both notices were only made and gazetted on 26 June 1996, and there is no requirement for them to be tabled or subject to scrutiny. One notice required every occupier of a private dwelling to fill out the census household form, while the other required people not counted in a household to fill out the census form. This is another instance of legislation regarding which the parliament may at present have no knowledge but which will be subject to full scrutiny under the proposed Legislative Instruments Act.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The position is more satisfactory in respect of the contents of the census questions, which were prescribed in the census regulations which commenced as early as 6 September 1994. This was entirely appropriate because the early tabling ensured that these regulations satisfied the two essential criteria for delegated legislation, which are parliamentary control and adequate time for that control to be exercised. The census forms themselves are actually not at present subject to tabling or disallowance but, again, would be under the new bill.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The position was also satisfactory in respect of other delegated legislation necessary to implement the act in its application to the census. As well as providing for the questions in the forms, the census regulations prescribed other relevant matters. The related statistics regulations provided for persons to be engaged for the purposes of the census and for such officers to maintain secrecy in relation to the forms. Finally, the statistics determination, which under the act is a statutory rule, provides for the disclosure of information collected in the census. All these instruments are subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.

      <break page="2881" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
       <para first-indent="16">
        In summary, then, the taking of the census involved two separate series of principal regulations made by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General—one principal series of statutory rules cited as a determination and made by the minister, one proclamation by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General, and two notices and two forms made by the Australian Statistician. All this was done under an act which is only seven pages long.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The taking of the census illustrates the diversity and variety of delegated legislation and its central role in modern public administration. It also reveals that crucial aspects of important legislation, affecting, in this case, the entire population of Australia, are subject neither to parliamentary disallowance nor even to tabling. However, as mentioned earlier, that problem should be solved by the Legislative Instruments Bill. The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is taking a close interest in the provisions of that bill to ensure that the interests of parliament are protected, and I will report to the Senate in detail in due course.

         of motion No. 190 standing in my name for today, relating to political prisoners in Jakarta, before asking that it be taken as a formal motion. Yesterday I gave notice of general business notice of motion No. 190. I had the opportunity to discuss the motion as I had given notice of it with a member of the staff of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer. It was suggested that, perhaps if the motion was amended slightly, it would have the support of all senators in this chamber. I would just like to put on the public record that I do appreciate the effort that Mr Downer went to to ensure that this particular notice of motion went forward in an appropriate way. Therefore, I seek leave to amend the motion to delete the word `extreme' and after the word `political' replace `prisoners' with `activists'.

        On 23 May this year, the Senate referred to the Senate Economics References Committee, for inquiry and report, the matter of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The committee was given just three months to hold public hearings and draft a report on the legislation. The
        <break page="2885" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         length and complexity of this report reflects the enormity and importance of the subject of industrial relations in Australia. The committee received more than 1,400 submissions, over 1,000 of which were from individuals who expressed concern about the legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The committee held 18 public hearings in all capital cities and some regional centres over a period of just 21 working days. This is believed to be the most concentrated public inquiry phase ever undertaken by a Senate committee. Given the concentrated process, I think it is appropriate now, rather than when I may later run out of time, that I acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the staff of the secretariat. In particular, I would like to mention Rob Diamond, the secretary of the Economics References Committee secretariat, research officers Pippa Carron, Geoff Dawson, Merrilyn Pyle and Maurice Chalmers, executive assistant Diane Strong, and seconded departmental officer Leah Edwards. Also, given the taxing nature of the public hearings, I think it is important to acknowledge the work that occurred in the Senate print room and the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard

        and SAVO contribution in ensuring that we met the report&amp;hyphen;back date today. Overall, the contribution of all involved in the process has been outstanding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is with mixed feelings of pleasure and disquiet that I now table the report. Aside from reaching the end of such a concentrated and demanding process, I take pleasure that the process and the outcome has well been worth while. This has obviously been an extremely controversial subject matter. But my determination to manage the process by consensus has been successful, with the overwhelming support of all of my colleagues on the committee.

        Despite the fact that it was accepted from the outset that government members of the committee would diverge on the conclusions and the recommendations arising from the inquiry, I believe, and committee members other than those of just the opposition have concurred, that the process of this inquiry was balanced and that the overall presentation of the evidence in the report is also balanced. Minister Reith has, however, sought to undermine this inquiry by suggesting that the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         inquiry lacked some credibility regarding the selection of witnesses. It is a credit to the media that they did not run with this story, which has no basis in fact.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Unfortunately, the media did run with the story that coalition sources claimed that I had deliberately designed the hearing schedule to facilitate my desire for a long weekend in Cairns with my husband and son. I wish I had had the time. I am pleased to note that coalition senators on the committee dissociated themselves from this story, which was an obvious attempt to deflect attention from the main issues at hand—to play the man, or the woman, rather than the issues. So much for women in parliament and so much for assisting workers with family responsibilities!

       <para first-indent="16">
        What leads to my disquiet is that the government feels the need to resort to this type of conduct. But what also leads to my disquiet is the widespread community concern put before this committee. What leads to my disquiet is that the government is not listening.

        This bill represents a radical reshaping of Australia's industrial relations law. It encourages—and the majority of the committee would say it forces—a move away from a reliance on award conditions towards enterprise bargaining and individual bargaining. While there have previously been moves towards a more enterprise focus in industrial relations, this bill represents a major step towards a deregulated labour market—and the implications of this are profound. Thus, it is not surprising that this inquiry attracted quite a lot of interest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Pages 4 to 7 of the report summarise the responses received by this inquiry to the bill. But I would like to highlight, in directing senators to those pages, that responses came not only from a large number of unions and some employer organisations but also from a large number of community groups, churches, religious organisations, youth, women's organisations, organisations representing the ethnic community and the disabled—all, or the vast majority, of which raised significant concerns with this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a complex bill containing a large number of proposed changes, the full effect of
        <break page="2886" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         which can be appreciated only by looking at how they interact with each other. For example, award conditions will be limited to 18 allowable matters, and conditions on other matters will lapse. That means that award employees will not be able to maintain their status quo by doing nothing; they will not be comfortable and secure. They will be forced to negotiate to try to win back their present conditions, outside the 18 allowable matters, into an agreement.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The evidence showed that in many fields conditions outside the 18 allowable matters are very important to workers. It is not just a matter of hot water, as Minister Reith has referred to dismissively. At the same time, the existing no disadvantage test in negotiating agreements is to be repealed. That opens the way for employers to force employees, where possible, into agreements with conditions less than their previous award.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Worse, under section 152, employees might come under pressure to accept state agreements with minimum wages and conditions worse than the award's minimum condition for federal agreements. Exploitative employers will be able to shop around for the jurisdiction that offers the lowest common denominator and, worse, good employers will be forced to compete.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Meanwhile, the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as independent umpire will be reduced. The commission will have no power to arbitrate on disputes outside the 18 allowable matters which may well lead to an increase in industrial disputation. Similarly, with the Employment Advocate there will be no vetting, no public scrutiny, limited union access and no independent umpire. Many submissions from expert commentators said it was absolutely essential to have an independent check of Australian workplace agreements to prevent illegal exploitation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are just some examples. The important thing is that the effects of the bill must be seen as a whole. The majority of the committee has no doubt that the overall effect of this bill will be to worsen the lot of many workers in our society—workers who, for one reason
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         or another, are in a limited bargaining position for negotiating agreements.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill makes a mockery of John Howard's rock&amp;hyphen;solid guarantee that no worker would be worse off. People in less skilled labour intensive jobs are more likely to be in a poor bargaining position and they will be worse off. Women, young people and people without good English are also in a limited bargaining position and they will be worse off. Part-time employees are more likely to be in a poor bargaining position and they will be worse off.

        According to the committee's evidence, this is exactly what has happened in New Zealand since deregulation in 1991. According to the committee's evidence, this is exactly what has happened in Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania since deregulation during the 1990s. The same result will be likely under this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have said earlier, the bill is a complex document and the majority of the committee has many detailed concerns, which I do not have the time to mention now. They are dealt with in the report, alongside a balanced presentation of the overall evidence given before the committee. But let me focus on just one matter of personal bias.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government claims that this bill is friendly to part-time employees and employees with family responsibilities. The government is proud that it has in the object section special reference to these matters. Employers generally support the government's claims. In fact, page 133 presents their arguments perhaps all too well. I note at the bottom of page 133 that it does not clearly delineate what is obviously an employer assertion from what is more point to the fact outlined in 5.17.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The majority of the committee cannot agree that this bill will assist part-time workers or workers with family responsibilities. We do not see anything concrete in the detailed provisions of the bill that supports this worthy object.

        I notice that Rob Diamond, Pippa Carron and Merrilyn Pyle are in the chamber, but there were others mentioned by Senator Jacinta Collins who worked on this. They were certainly put under pressures that I do not think any secretariat should be put under.

        From the outset let me say that, along with the debate that occurred prior to this reference being sent to the committee, we believed that this inquiry was an abuse of the Senate committee system. It was an abuse of the system because for the first time since October 1994, when the new committee structure was put in place, a bill was sent to a reference committee and not to a legislation committee, which is properly set up for legislation. That was done for obvious political reasons.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We heard Senator Jacinta Collins talk about majority reports. The only reason that there is a majority report in this case is because the reference committee, as you know, is dominated by a majority of Labor senators, which is not representative of the state of the numbers in this chamber. It should have gone to a legislation committee and not to a reference committee. If that had happened, then you would have seen a different report.

         I can say that from the outset it was obvious that this was not the Labor Party's inquiry or anybody else's inquiry; it was the ACTU's inquiry. It was facilitated by Labor senators, all with strong union backgrounds and strong ACTU backgrounds. It is easy to follow the conduct of the inquiry, the way things happened during the inquiry and the influence that the ACTU had on this inquiry from its very commencement.

         Compare this with the last major change in industrial relations—Brereton's 1993 bill. At the time many people said that that 1993 bill was a major change to the face of industrial relations in Australia. But what did we have then? One submission representing employees, and that submission was from the ACTU. And how long did that inquiry last? A total of 26 days from the time it was introduced into the Senate until the time the committee report was made, which included calling for submissions, I think two or three days of public hearings and then the report being brought down.

         We might ask: why the response this time? I guess we would have to look at the situation over the past number of years of falling union membership, of let us grab an issue, of let us put Bill Kelty's plan into action—his pre-election statement that it will be war and there will be blood on the streets et cetera. So we have the ACTU using this bill to facilitate their own program to enable them to make a public plea for their own membership to try to increase their numbers.

         Sometimes we really have to ask how sincere members opposite are in relation to any strike that might take place or their attitude towards this bill. I remember one particular hearing in Perth. At the start of this hearing Senator Mackay made an announcement to the inquiry that that day was a day of national strike action by the CPSU, and she announced to the inquiry that the hearing and the committee had been granted an exemption. She said she was a member of the CPSU and she and other members present who might be members of the CPSU could continue with the inquiry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Senator Mackay was the only member of the CPSU present that day. I urged her to join her comrades in solidarity if she thought the strike going on was justified, and I guaranteed that I would maintain a quorum for the rest of the day to allow her to do so. Did she join
         <break page="2889" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          her comrades? Not on your life. No way in the world did she think the strike was justified enough that she should take part. So we had a situation where there was a national day of strike action and Senator Mackay, a member of the CPSU, did not feel obliged to take part.

         In conclusion, it was a sad day that this reference ever went to a references committee rather than a legislation committee. A legislation committee has the same powers to call witnesses. It has the same responsibility to ensure that legislation is looked into, and it would have been. The government gave that guarantee by saying that they would support this going to a legislation committee. But members opposite knew that by using the system they could use a references committee, where they had a majority—although they have a big minority in this place—to conduct this inquiry in the way they wanted it to be conducted; that is, they wanted it to be an inquiry managed by the ACTU and not by Labor senators opposite.

         —I commend my supplementary report to the house and I hope that it will help contribute to the passage of a better workplace relations bill. I would like to precede my remarks by complimenting both our chair and our deputy chair for their conduct in the inquiry. I personally found that the manner in which the hearings were arranged and organised and the manner in which they were conducted were a credit to the Senate. I found that the way the senators conducted themselves throughout what was a very passionate inquiry was a credit to the Senate and reflected well on the independence and integrity of the people concerned.

        The second point I want to make is that I believe the opportunity for the presentation of individual submissions as well as submissions by organisations was particularly helpful. I think it was Senator Crane who first introduced that practice to the Senate and, once again, I would like to commend the house for the most democratic and appropriate way of touching the pulse of the people. My third introductory remark relates to the professionalism of our secretariat—they were just outstanding, quite frankly—and the diligence of the Hansard team was much appreciated by all of us, as Senator Ferguson has clearly outlined.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My fourth point is that, most of all, this process put enormous pressure on all of us to
        <break page="2891" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         get on top of it, and to produce a tabled report like that within a month and a half is an outstanding activity. It does, however, necessarily result in the reproduction of some typos in our report. I am sure both sides of the house have some; we certainly do, and we plead for your indulgence for any typos you may pick up.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My fifth and most important remark is that there have been questions as to whether this process was vindicated. Senator Ferguson has indicated that possibly it should have gone to another committee, but he has not said that it should not have gone out to the people. I think that is a very important concession from the government, because there is a view among some of the more hard&amp;hyphen;headed that this was an exercise in futility. We as the Australian Democrats say that there was no other way in which we could have understood what people were saying and feeling and we ourselves took particular note of the submissions that were put to us from both sides of the argument.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We, too, believe that the coordination of submissions by the ACTU, the ACCI and the BCA were very helpful, and we do not regret that process one bit. But we should make note in our introductory remarks that one&amp;hyphen;third of employers and one&amp;hyphen;third of employees are represented by organisations, and it is the two&amp;hyphen;thirds of employees and the two&amp;hyphen;thirds of employers that the Australian Democrats have also tried to focus on—people who were not properly represented in submissions to the committee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We believe that it is entirely appropriate for government to bring forward this workplace relations bill to correct and to improve inadequacies in existing legislation—inadequacies which were reflected in remarks both by employees and by employers. We do not hold to the view that the bill should not have been introduced and we do not hold to the view that it does not have some positive characteristics.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Democrats have broadly supported the government views on issues such as no compulsory unionism, on essential freedoms, on unfair dismissal reforms, on the potential usefulness of workplace agreements

         and on the introduction of the office of the employment advocate. We do, however, believe that the bill will need to be amended to provide a fairer balance between the rights of employees and the rights of employers rather than being stacked, as we think it still is, against weak and vulnerable workers, particularly women and young people. We will be seeking amendments to beef it up in that respect.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Democrats' recommendations flow from three key principles: the maintenance of a strong award system as an absolutely important protection for low income workers and for small businesses; the need for a strong and impartial umpire in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to protect employees and employers with weak bargaining power against those with excessive bargaining strength; and, most importantly from the government's point of view, we want to ensure that you do keep your election promises, particularly that no worker will be worse off and that the balance between work and family responsibilities will be improved. We are sure that we will get their cooperation in making sure that those promises are implemented.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also need to ensure that the industrial relations system delivers the flexibility necessary for employers and employees who are capable of making a fair bargain to be able to do so freely and jointly at an enterprise level. That is an important acceptance. On these grounds we do reject proposals such as extending the scope of secondary boycott provisions to include consumer and environmental boycotts. We do oppose the excessive restrictions on the right of union officials to enter workplaces. We do oppose the watering down of the AIRC's powers to enforce equal remuneration for work of equal value and the abolition of paid rates awards.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are prepared to support the thrust of the unfair dismissal reforms, the establishment of the employment advocate to assist the small business enterprise sector, in particular in enterprise bargaining, the accelerating of the modernisation of the award system and the ending of union closed shops and preference clauses. We particularly take note that the

         —I will be speaking briefly today in relation to this report from the Senate Economics References Committee on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. There have been comments from the government today during the debate that, if the bill had been submitted to a legislative committee, the outcome would have been different. That is an interesting comment. There were some different members on that committee, and the assumption is quite right that people generally vote along party lines.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the problem with a legislative committee for this kind of inquiry: it does not actually reflect the voting power in the Senate. In reality, when parties do vote along party lines, they do not vote as, say, 38 members; they vote as one. That means it is important, when you have this kind of very controversial issue, that, as far as possible, the outcome should reflect the level of debate, the realities of the voting, the opinions and the ability for representation within the Senate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There has been mention of an abuse of the Senate processes. I find that extraordinary because, while we were debating the reference of the committee in the first place, I mentioned the Senate's history and in fact the average length of Senate inquiries used to be longer than it has been in recent times. So by pushing for more bills to be simply put to a legislative committee, we are limiting the debate.

        In fact, on this issue, we were not just talking about what the implications of this bill were. It was important, in my opinion, to be able to look carefully and qualitatively at the comparisons between the Australian experience and that of overseas—and a great deal
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of evidence was taken in this committee in relation to the experience of various states' legislatures. This is extremely important because of the nature of this bill, which allows a movement between federal and state legislation in industrial relations, and because, if workers are vulnerable under the current situation, they will be even more vulnerable, in my opinion, if this new legislation goes through.

        I join others in commending the work done by the committee secretariat, the chair and the deputy chair. I would like to add a comment about one very good aspect about the conduct of this committee inquiry: the bill was placed on the Internet. Apparently, rather than reduce the number of sales of the bill at the government bookshops, this has increased the interest because people had access to see what the issues were. Some people, I was told, found it by accident: they were surfing the Internet and found workplace relations and thought, `Wow'. I believe that in the first couple of days there were about 37,000 visits to the Internet site.

It is a bit like the Telstra bill: it is basically going in the wrong direction and pretending that this technology does not exist and that the world is not going on, is not moving in a different direction. I am not a technophile but I do believe that there was a lot of excitement in the community at being able to have at least this access into the parliamentary process. I think that, because there were a number of visits, we should be thinking that this should be a regular part of the process. There was obviously a very high level of community interest.

        It was necessary to take the inquiry to the people and, personally, I think we should have had a greater level of community inquiry in the 1993 bill as well. It is true that unions have played a greater role in the process, but I also know that not everybody was gung&amp;hyphen;ho happy about the bill in 1993. There were concerns in 1993 that there was a process of bad or worse, and many people felt it was
        <break page="2893" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         necessary to try to make some protections against what were considered to be worse options in the case of Western Australia and some other states like Victoria.

        There has been a lot of personal evidence given to this inquiry, which has been very important. When people say, `Where in this legislation does it say that an employer can exploit an employee?', of course there is not going to be a workplace relations bill that says, `This bill allows an employer to exploit and behave unfairly or treat an employee unfairly.' Of course a bill does not say that, but that is why it was necessary to speak to the people who are in individual contracts, who are in different award situations and do not have the current protections that are available under the federal awards, to find out what their experience has been, how things work on the ground, with even the best of intentions, and that is being generous. The results were very disturbing.

        The Greens have followed this issue carefully and will continue to do so in the committee stage of the bill. I think the process has been extremely important. We would not have served the process well if we had restricted the bill to a short committee of inquiry. The most appropriate process has been followed and it has extended the debate significantly to enable us all to make better decisions when we deal with the bill.

Nonetheless, I want to raise a number of matters about this inquiry. I begin by reinforcing what everybody else has said about the outstanding effort by Rob Diamond and his team, Sound and Vision, Hansard and all the others involved. This was an inquiry into the workplace relations bill and dealing
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          with conditions in the workplace. However, in Perth, we had Hansard sitting there for five hours before opposition senators called for a toilet break. I found that one of the ironies of this particular inquiry. Even though it was a long and hard process, those very important little courtesies were hard won.

        What came through the inquiry was that when you deal with matters the bad is never as bad as the doomsday merchants claim it will be and nor are the boons as great as the optimists claim they will be. Although there were a number of notable submissions, because of the orchestration there was continuous misrepresentation.
       </para>

        In the report by government senators on the committee we have endeavoured to put the other side of the positions that were put in that orchestration. As I was probably the key author, I spent a lot of time on the report. I particularly refer people to read chapter 2 on the two sides to the story.

        I also refer to the amount of repetition in the submissions. We even had three submissions where the first 40 pages were virtually the same word for word—and you can relate that to the

        It was important that the committee did get around Australia. Nonetheless, it should have been done through the legislation committee which could have conducted exactly the same hearings and gone to the same places. Then we would have kept the processes that were put in place in forming the legislation and references committees to do that work.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Interestingly, to the day exactly the same amount of time was given for this inquiry as was given for the 1993 inquiry—and I served on both of them. Many of the stories were the same. Of course, there were variations between the submissions. But, once again, because there was no orchestration by the ACTU at those hearings in 1993, the only part of the union movement that appeared was the ACTU itself, which I thought put in a very good submission in representing the particular views of the union movement.

I concede there was some variation but, once again, the same could be said about the employers' submissions, except for one aspect: this time they dealt with the situations which exist in the various states.

That rally was intended to relate to the presentation this week of this particular bill in this chamber.

        If I can deal with some aspects of this: I have worked on both sides—I have been an employee and an employer. As I have said in this place before, I shore around shearing sheds in Western Australia for 20 years so I have a pretty good idea, in a practical sense, of good employers and good employees. That was highlighted in these hearings in terms of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the good and bad. My life experience—and I have never heard anybody dispute this—is that 99 per cent of employers are damned good employers and damned good people and 99 per cent of employees are good people and damned good workers. They organise themselves in the workplace in a very good, positive and strong manner. They get on well together and do an outstanding job. It does not matter what legislation you put in place in terms of dealing with that, you will not change that factor.

        What amazed me in terms of these submissions, laid against this bill which is before us now, is that we had complaints of malpractice in the workplace going back 15 years. Can you believe it? Can I also say that one of the very disappointing aspects of it for me was the performance of some of the academics and lawyers. When you have people appear before you and you ask the question, `Have you read the bill?' and the answer is, `I glanced at it,' or, in one case that we highlight in our government senators report, `No,' you start to ask questions about the credibility of those people and the damage they do to this process. It does no good to them or the process we went through.

        Similarly, when dealing with the issue of right of entry in Brisbane a witness there, who from memory was a member of one of the maritime or seafarers unions—I just want to use this as an example—made reference to the right of entry. I said, `Have you read the other sections with regard to the right of entry?' He said, `No,' and then went on to explain—which I did not pick up at the time—that less than 24 hours ago he had got back from a ship. He had not read the bill or the submission that had been prepared and put before him, in terms of the position. That does not do the process any good.

        I want to say in conclusion that I certainly appreciated working with all the people on the committee in what was a very strenuous 18 days of hearings, and for most of us another six or seven days of travelling. We kept ourselves in good humour and good spirit, and we worked very well together. I say that to the Labor Party people, particularly Senator Murray in his first excursion into

         —I would like to make some brief comments on the quality of the government's minority report. Before I do, I would like to analyse briefly the breakdown of the submissions received by the committee. This committee received 1,398 submissions in total: 180 from unions, 90 from community groups and academics, 44 from employers and employer organisations, 14 from law firms and organisations made up of lawyers, and over 1,000 from individuals.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of the 44 received from employers and employer groups, 39 supported the bill, three had major concerns about the bill and two opposed the bill. Of the 14 received from law firms, 12 opposed the bill, one had major concerns about the bill and one supported the bill. Of the 12 submissions received from academics, 10 opposed the bill, one had major concerns about the bill and one supported the bill—guess who? It was Judith Sloan.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Coming to community groups, not one supported the bill in total. Every single community group expressed major concerns with aspects of this bill. As you can see from what I have just said, this did not give the government much to work with when they sat down and prepared their minority report—but never let the facts get in the way of a good story. The government's minority report largely consists of great slabs of quotes from the small number of groups that supported the bill, not to mention great slabs of quotes from government senators—but I will come to that a bit later.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said before, 42 employer groups supported the bill. If you have only 42 submissions that are supporting you out of 1,398, you need to make maximum mileage out of what they said. Nobody could accuse the government of not doing that. Let's go through a breakdown of the government's
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         evidence. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry get quoted quite a bit—seven times in fact. Hamersley Iron are quoted quite a bit—also seven times. The Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry get a guernsey four times and the National Farmers Federation are also there four times. The Housing Industry Association get mentioned three times and the Business Council of Australia do a bit better with five mentions. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Hotels Association are mentioned three times and the Master Builders Association are mentioned twice.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The poor old MTIA only got a go once, probably because they had major concerns with aspects of the bill. The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce were also mentioned only once, for the same reason, and we finish with the Australian Retailers Association which similarly get mentioned only once for their temerity in having concerns with the bill. This adds up to 42 out of 1,398 submissions—not enough, think the government. So what do they do? To substantiate their case and pad out the report they then quote—wait for it—the Department of Industrial Relations. The fact that the department, at the minister's direction, wrote the bill should not really bring into question their impartiality, according to the government. I suppose that if you are scratching around and clutching at straws, you do not have much option than to quote your own department.

        However, never let it be alleged that this government does not think that the minority report is not balanced. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission gets an acknowledgment even though it had grave concerns with this bill. Women for Workplace Justice get two acknowledgments, although they also had grave concerns with this bill. Judith Sloan predictably gets two mentions. But that is still not enough, says the government. So what do they do? They start using the rhetoric of their own senators as evidence.

         —There have been extensive discussions regarding the timing of the estimates hearings for this particular sittings. There have been some constructive proposals put forward by various parties and the government has responded to those proposals. A great deal of work has been done this morning in trying to bed down the final dates. I think that has now happened. My understanding is that, though some people are not wildly enthusiastic about every date mentioned, there is general support for the motion before the chamber.

         —by leave—The proposition before us is an amalgam of the various issues that have been raised in recent times. The government proposed that two sitting days be allocated for estimates hearings. We thought it necessary to have a broader array of discussion to ensure there was greater accountability. As a consequence, the government has picked up that initiative. In return, the opposition has proposed that there be two Fridays allocated for government business only to consider the legislative program. That too has been picked up in this proposition. We think it is important that there be adequate examination of these estimates and we welcome the government's response to initiatives that we have proposed.

However, this morning I have had discussions with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Kemp). I understand—I would like to put this on the record—that the government will consider any suggestions that we might have about the Democrats being able to have leave for one of our number for some of that Friday.

         —Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise to support this legislation and to place on record both the opposition's support for it and the opposition's concerns about a number of aspects of not only the legislation but also the government's response to the events which occurred at Port Arthur just a few months ago.

        We see this bill as the next important step in the introduction of uniform national gun
        <break page="2900" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         laws. It is worth placing on record that much of the work that has been reflected in the outcome from discussions since the Port Arthur massacre has been built on the work that was done in the previous government by my colleagues the then Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, and particularly by the then Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr. The nuts and bolts of the uniform gun laws legislation, the whole raft of measures that go to questions of licensing, classification and every other aspect of the legislation, bar one, were being prepared by the previous Minister for Justice in particular. That one exemption, of course, is the extension of the ban from what was proposed before Port Arthur to now cover the semi&amp;hyphen;automatic weapons that are being covered in this bill.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is reflected in this legislation is an approach to national gun laws that was, in fact, being prepared before the election. This bill appropriates money to the states for the purposes of the firearms buyback and to compensate gun dealers for loss of business. The bill will also compensate the states for the cost of implementing the resolution as agreed to by the Australian council of police ministers on 10 May 1996 and 17 July 1996. It is a fundamental piece of legislation which provides the umbrella statutory power for the scheme to be implemented. In endorsing the scheme, we support the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But there are a number of concerns that we have with the bill. These matters have been raised with the government, but the government has chosen not to support them. That is unfortunate, but it is the case. Our overriding objective in this particular process was to maintain a spirit of bipartisanship. As I said the day after Port Arthur, the opposition was keen to enter into a bipartisan arrangement with the government to ensure that the combined strengths of the major parties and other parties in this place would mean that those who would otherwise want to blackmail government into one position or another would have to take on the whole political process. I think that bipartisan approach has been important so far. It is that bipartisan approach which leads us to raise issues of concern today. But, once again, with the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         objective of not trying to blow away that bipartisanship, we will not move amendments to affect, in particular, the agreements of the council of police ministers of the dates that I mentioned earlier.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have a number of concerns. They are worth placing on record because I think the government may have to address them down the track. The first concern that we have is in respect of the amount of compensation to be paid by the Commonwealth to the states for implementation of the scheme. Our understanding is that compensation originally agreed to would cover some two&amp;hyphen;thirds to three&amp;hyphen;quarters of the costs incurred by the states, and we are concerned at recent suggestions that the government may seek to squib on this commitment and provide only some 50 per cent of the costs. That, of course, would be contrary to the expectations of state ministers and would throw a barb in the successful implementation of these reforms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is my understanding that there is a commitment from the office of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that the limit will only be set once agreements have been reached with the states and territories. What I would like from Senator Vanstone as the representative of the Attorney-General is an undertaking to the effect that any agreement on the amount of compensation will be consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the resolutions agreed to by the police ministers; and, further, that the limit will only be set once an agreement has been reached with each and every state and territory, in accordance with the above terms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is an important factor to place on the table at the moment. Any weaseling out by the Commonwealth on commitments given in terms of cost coverage for the states is something we would be concerned about—not just because it may be seen to be a breach of commitment, but also because it may inject into this process a bit of ill will which is quite unnecessary and could be quite damaging to the way the scheme is implemented.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other major concern we have is one that emanates from the way this issue has been handled in my home state, the state of South Australia. It is of real concern that in
        <break page="2901" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that state the pressure from the backbench of the Liberal government has meant that the government has had to make concessions which are not in the national interest, concessions which do in some respects undermine the national operation of this legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For instance, South Australia has sought an exemption from the national amnesty, which is to apply until 30 September 1997. Instead, for South Australia the amnesty will be in effect only until the end of this year. That, of course, throws it out of kilter with the rest of Australia. It will lead to a situation where, whilst it will be illegal to own a prohibited firearm all around Australia in the new year, you will be safe from prosecution in every part of Australia until 30 September 1997—with the exception of South Australia. That could create problems, for instance, with people who move to South Australia during this period not knowing of the different law that will apply there. Those problems are obvious.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But what concerns me is that the reason for the difference in timing demanded by South Australia is not so obvious, other than, as I say, unreasonable irrational pressure from the backbench of the government in the state of South Australia. I would have liked—and I am sure the Commonwealth would have liked—to have seen a scheme operating consistently across the country. But, as I say, in South Australia, for some irrational reason, the state government has chosen not to stay in line with the national response.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The direct impact of this is that the buy-back scheme will only apply in South Australia for a more limited period. Our concern is that, whereas all other states and the Commonwealth Attorney-General have deemed it appropriate to have a longer period to maximise the scheme's impact, in my home state it will not be able to operate for as long as we would have liked it to. We would have preferred the South Australian exemption not to have been agreed to by the police ministers. The result, as I say, is contrary to the principle of having a national gun law. But, because we are keen not to reopen the agreed position of the ministers, we raise our concerns at this stage and, of course, urge
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         South Australia to reconsider its irrational position on this.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second problem with South Australia is an even more important one—and I do not know what has been driving the South Australian response in these matters apart from, as I say, irrationality on the backbench. South Australia will be the only state in the Commonwealth that will not compensate owners of unregistered prohibited firearms. This is bad policy—and it is so for a number of reasons.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For a start, unregistered prohibited weapons are the weapons that we most want to remove from the streets. Registered weapons can always be tracked down. But it is the unregistered ones that are most likely to be the ones that we want to remove from action, and these are the ones that the South Australian response will ensure are not brought forward. An amnesty covering as wide a range of weapons as possible is desirable; an amnesty covering unregistered prohibited weapons is something which we would have thought would have been essential. But South Australia has chosen not to go this far.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is even more irrational because the Commonwealth is footing the compensation bill for these weapons. As a result of the passage of this act, there is no cost in terms of compensation for the buy back of weapons to be incurred by the state of South Australia. So I have to ask the Premier of South Australia, `Why aren't you going as far as the rest of Australia? Why are you allowing this loophole for South Australia, particularly when it will cost you nothing?'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The concern is there, the concern is real and the concern is that, because of the gutlessness of the Brown government, the firearms that we most want removed from our streets will not be picked up in South Australia. It is of concern to South Australians; it should also be of concern in the national interest.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whilst the Attorney-General and the Commonwealth authorities have complained to South Australia about this position, I would have liked to have had this issue forced upon that state, particularly given the fact that the other states have agreed to the extension to cover unregistered prohibited weapons. Once
        <break page="2902" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         again, we would have supported an amendment to the bill effectively to force South Australia to provide compensation to all firearm owners. But to have done that, I think, would have led to a reopening of the arrangement at a critical time of the arrangement's implementation.
        </break>
       </para>

        I will now discuss the federal government's response to the wider issues emanating from Port Arthur. We obviously agree with the response of the government which has given us uniform national gun laws. But we need to look at two other matters that have arisen out of Port Arthur, and we need to look at them in the context of what could have been a broader and more visionary response to this particular problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had instances in the past with Hoddle Street and Queen Street, and there were responses to those—and I will go to them in a few minutes. But the federal government's response here has gone to national gun laws, it has gone to review and tightening of censorship guidelines and review of the national mental health strategy. My concern is that these are issues that were chosen more because of their populism than because of good broad visionary policy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In terms of censorship, there was some concern straight after the massacre that Mr Bryant had in his possession some 2,000 allegedly violent videos. As a consequence, newspapers reacted very strongly to that and claims were made that we would need to tighten up our censorship laws because they caused Port Arthur. But, with the exception of three or four videos, the rest of those 2,000 were predominantly 1930s and 1940s musicals—the Shirley Temples, the Fred and Gingers, the Judy Garlands and so on. A knee-jerk response was something that we could have done without at that particular time. Yes, we have embarked upon a review of censorship laws but we should not allow ourselves to act as cultural cops when we in the Senate revisit the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another concern is that we targeted mental health when all the evidence seems to indicate that, despite the popular media response at the time, Mr Bryant was not a schizophrenic. When the Queen Street and Hoddle Street
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         massacres occurred, the then federal government set up a National Committee on Violence. That committee gave some 140 recommendations on how our society could tackle the issues of violence.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those recommendations went to the following: organised crime; the use of drugs, legal and illegal; providing family infrastructure; providing education and support services to parents to provide safer family environments, recognising that all too often violence is within the family; resourcing anti-violence education campaigns; looking at domestic and family violence; and helping people with intellectual disabilities. There was a whole raft of measures going to the problems of youth, accommodation, access and support for conflict resolution services, and so on. The committee was also looking at the treatment of issues of violence in schools and in the workplace with responses such as education and training opportunities; looking at producing Commonwealth laws to tackle domestic violence and relationship breakdowns; and looking at training police forces.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What I am saying is that, when those massacres took place, the government at the time took a broad response. We said, `Well, let us recognise that the sorts of underlying problems that bring about the Port Arthurs and the Queen and Hoddle streets are not just simplistic ones; they are not just superficial ones. They go to the very fabric of society and of family problems.' My concern is that we could at this particular stage of our development have revisited the National Committee on Violence agenda and made an assessment of how far we have progressed since then and of how we need to build on that agenda. But we have not done that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is a lost opportunity for Australia that we have not revisited the broad spectrum of issues and tried to build on the government action of the past. Instead, what have we done? We have, in fact, cut back on some of the most critical areas that go to law enforcement and control of violence in our society. In the last 48 hours, we have seen cutbacks in a raft of law enforcement areas which are quite unreasonable in the circumstances in which the particular organisations that have
        <break page="2903" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         been affected are having to meet them. It is also unreasonable in terms of the growing incidence of not just crime but organised crime in our society.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When you look at what this government has done in recent days to the resource capacity of the National Crime Authority—particularly when it means that for my state of South Australia and for Western Australia in particular the resources will be about one-third of what they have been in the past—there will be cutbacks of some $11 million over the next three years. Cuts have been made to the Australian Federal Police—an organisation which is stretched in its capacity already; an organisation which has to meet growing demands; and an organisation which, together with the NCA and Customs, will have added responsibilities as we go towards the year 2000 Olympics.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Cutbacks to Customs will mean that our borders will not be checked as well as they have been, as well as they could be and as well as they need to be. Overall, some $130 million over the next four years will be cut back from our law enforcement capacity. I think that is something that this government will find very hard to justify as part of this nation's response to illegality and violence in our society. Not only do we find ourselves having lost the opportunity to build on the social policy response but also we find that, at a time when we need to build our resources against particularly the organised crime part of our society, those resources have had a monumental cutback.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         Returning to the legislation, let me say that the opposition supports it. We recognise that the response of the government has been a strong one. We also recognise that we have a role to play in maintaining our bipartisan support for the legislation to ensure that we do not go down the American road when it comes to the use of guns in our society. At the same time, we do say to the government that this has been a lost opportunity in terms of how we could have broached other underlying issues in our society. Not only is it a lost opportunity but also it comes at a time when the government's ideological fixation on cutting back the capacity of federal govern ment means that our law enforcement agencies—agencies with their primary role being to protect families in our society—will be cut at the knees in terms of their capacity.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In closing, can I say that we commend the government for going this far. The legislation is important. I am sure that, as we proceed towards the year 2000 and thereafter, the Australian public will be grateful that this legislation is on the statute books and that this parliament has been able to come together—to put political issues aside, to put party politicking aside—and agree to a bill which, despite some problems, is a major step forward for gun control in any Western society.

         —On behalf of all my parliamentary colleagues and probably the entire general membership of the Australian Democrats, I am happy to support the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1996. The passage of the bill will take Australia just one step closer to fully implementing the resolutions of the police ministers' special meeting on firearms on 10 May. In relation to those resolutions, I would agree with Senator Bolkus that all agreements on levels of Commonwealth funding for compensation must be honoured by the Commonwealth.

        The Democrats have always supported tighter gun control.

We welcome the move to tighter uniform gun legislation. We congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and, indeed, all our federal leaders, who are showing such a united front in support of gun control, as well as the state and territory premiers and all those other Australians who have worked so hard to ensure that these essential reforms are adopted.

          Senator Bolkus and Senator Bourne on the matter of compensation. The Commonwealth did agree to pay compensation in full, and that agreement stands. It also agreed to make a contribution to set-up costs. That matter is still under negotiation—that is, the extent to which those set-up costs will be met by the Commonwealth. As I am advised, there was not an agreement to pay the set-up costs in full. But the agreement to pay compensation in full stands. The only thing now to be discussed is the level of contribution—and it is still under debate—for the set-up costs. I thank Senator Bourne and Senator Bolkus for their contributions. Senator Bolkus introduced a couple of partisan points with respect to one state, sadly, into a bipartisan debate, and I will give him answers to those questions at a later time.

         (11.48 a.m.)—Last evening when we were debating these airport bills, I had already responded to the comments of the Senate committee report on this important airports legislation and to the comments Senator Bob Collins made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the interruption of the debate, I was responding to the comments Senator Woodley made on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We had reached the point of talking about competition between airports. I had indicated that the government was going to do all that it could to encourage competition, but that it would in a direct sense occur only at the margin.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Nevertheless, that margin can be vital, as Senator Calvert observed. Even Senator Bob Collins implied that Alice Springs, Launceston and even Melbourne do see themselves in competition with other airports. You only have to pick up any newspaper to see that Victorians are desperate to allow themselves to own their own airport and compete with Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Woodley raised the issue of the Federal Airports Corporation's profit. Yes, the FAC has done an excellent job in earning a profit, although its rate of return is not as powerful as he suggested. In part, this is because its assets remain undervalued. For example, the runways in Brisbane are on the books at only $25 million. So its returns are inflated by a low asset base. It is obvious that Democrat economics would not get past the auditor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me say that the sale is not a punishment for the FAC, rather it is a culmination of a job well done. There is no longer a development need for local airports requiring cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies of the kind referred to by Senator Bob Collins. The network approach has done its job. It is now time to harness the innovation skill of the private sector to take over the asset and improve services to the travelling public in the same way as private airports in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe have done. We can be sure that services will improve because this bill allows service standards to be established and used as a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         means of scrutinising the performance of new operators.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Calvert raised the issue of local government rates being paid by on&amp;hyphen;airport businesses. Currently, this is done by discretion by the FAC. Under the leases to be offered to private purchasers, this obligation should be picked up by the new lessee. I appreciate that Senator Calvert's concerns for the challenges to Tasmanians are particularly on behalf of the tourist industry that he is so closely associated with.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Margetts foreshadowed amendments in relation to environmental issues at airports. The government has indicated a preparedness to consider these up to a point. It will be interesting to see at the committee stage how effective these changes are likely to prove. I think some are not wise from an environmental point of view, and we have attempted to provide advice on these.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I hope it will be recognised that giving states the ability to override Commonwealth environmental standards is not traditionally what green groups have sought and that seems singularly inappropriate here. Making the task of regulating to support environment standards difficult and riddled with delay is also less than helpful to the management of environment issues at airports.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Crane outlined how effective the Senate committee process has been. This puts great credit on the positive approach taken by the government to the committee process in the Senate. Indeed, some of the issues raised here could and should have been given an airing in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee rather than being rushed in at the last minute yesterday and perhaps today in the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Murphy wants to ensure that local bodies can control airports. We too have an interest in this area. As I noted yesterday in comments on Senator Bob Collins's remarks, I have spoken to the Tasmanian local government representatives and found them very understanding of the government's desire to have an open tender process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me turn to the comments by Senator Harradine, who wanted to ensure that proper
        <break page="2906" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         oversight of prices occurs. I can assure him that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will put a strong focus on constraining aeronautical prices to keep them below the consumer price index over the next five years. Airport operators will definitely not be able to charge what the market will bear. Prices to airlines, their customers and the travelling public will fall in real terms over the five years. The only remaining question is: how far?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government will not be regulating immediately to assure this. We have seen the Prices Surveillance Authority work well without mandatory regulation power prior to its incorporation into the ACCC. We believe that operators will respect the ACCC's view. If not, however, the government has said in the paper on pricing at airports, which is currently circulating and which was provided to the committee, that we reserve the right to impose by legislation the pricing policy if the ACCC believes that to be necessary. Thus the intent of Senator Harradine's concern is met. I can give him an assurance to this effect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senator Harradine also raised the issue of local government taxation applying to leases. We have already indicated an intention to ensure that leases reflect this. As well, Senator Harradine wanted to have our views on local ownership. I have already indicated that we share an interest and are considering options in this area within the context of an open bidding contest. I use the specific examples of Launceston and Hobart.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, Senator Harradine raised the aerodrome local ownership program. In committee hearings, departmental representatives indicated that no ALOP existed anymore. A future policy question will be whether the equivalent of such a scheme can be applied to the airport lease sales. Obviously, if bidding interest is not strong and local communities remain interested in taking over ownership, the government does not rule out any option for the future. I can go no further than that at this point in time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also appreciate the interest that all senators, including Senator Calvert and Senator MacGibbon, gave to addressing the very
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         important considerations in this regard and to supporting this legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I now turn to the amendment that has been moved by Senator Bob Collins for the opposition. That second reading amendment is in four parts, entitled (a), (b), (c) and (d). The first tenet of Senator Collins's amendment relates to the effort to ensure that the local community acquires the lease. I mentioned this issue in my response to Senator Harradine, but I would like to add a bit to it. The government has made clear its position on local community involvement in the leasing of airports other than major capital city airports. I mention, however, that I do not recall the previous government, the Labor government, suggesting this approach under its own proposals when we were considering them for the leasing of airports.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second tenet, part (b), of Senator Collins's amendment relates to the diversity of ownership issue. The government has also made its position on this issue quite clear. There will be separation of ownership and control of Sydney with Sydney West from Melbourne and Sydney again with Sydney West from Brisbane. This will ensure that there is no private sector monopoly of the major airports on the eastern seaboard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government considers that the powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, coupled with the provisions of the Airports Bill, are more than adequate to protect the interests of the community and airport users. While the smaller airports effectively do not compete with each other or larger airports, the government, in conducting the leasing processes, will have regard to the support various parties have expressed for diversity of ownership being achieved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third tenet of Senator Collins's amendment relates to the EIS guidelines for the proposed Holsworthy site. I indicate that the government remains committed to building Sydney a second major airport of full international standard as a matter of priority, subject to the results of an environmental impact statement. In Labor's 13 years in power, they achieved nothing for a second airport. They fast&amp;hyphen;talked and slow&amp;hyphen;tracked development of an inadequate overflow airport development.
        <break page="2907" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         While Badgerys Creek remains the preferred site, the government considers it prudent to consider Holsworthy as an alternative in case Badgerys Creek proves to be environmentally unacceptable.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is committed to a thorough, objective and transparent EIS process with extensive consultation and independent auditing consistent with the recommendations of the 1995 Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. The draft EIS guidelines will be finalised by the EPA after considering all comments by interested parties. I will certainly arrange for the issues raised in this debate to be referred to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill—in fact, I already did so yesterday in discussions with him—and the EPA for full consideration.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me say that the development of runway configurations and master plans is being addressed as a matter of priority. It is envisaged that the output from this consultancy will be made publicly available and will of course be a key input into the EIS.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fourth and final point of Senator Collins's amendment is that the government should not proceed with the sale of leases at Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports. The target is to issue a draft EIS by early 1997. All comments received on the draft EIS will then be fully considered and further information incorporated where required before the final EIS is prepared. The government will then be considering issues associated with the proposed airport based on the EIS and financial feasibility studies. The government will be giving further consideration to the leasing of Sydney and Sydney West airports once the site and scale of the development have been resolved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is certainly not attracted to supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Collins. In fact, we encourage all senators to look at the very close and clear objectives that have been outlined for this legislation, to reject the opposition amendment and to then fully support the proper and principal proposals that have been put forward in both of these pieces of legislation—the Airports Bill 1996 and the associated bill.

         This Act commences on the day after the day on which a written agreement, signed by representatives of all local government councils which are located within a 20 kilometre radius of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) or Sydney West Airports, and certifying that a satisfactory plan to provide for equitable sharing of the noise and air traffic burden over Sydney and implementation in a way that cannot result in an inequitable or onerous noise burden in the future has been agreed to, is laid before both Houses of Parliament.

        Last year the coalition while in opposition effectively scuttled the ALP's airports transitional bill by putting an amendment that said management at Sydney airport could not be sold until the noise problem was resolved and the noise burden shared equitably. There is no such measure in this bill. Presumably, the coalition believe they have solved the noise problem in Sydney and the noise burden is now equitably shared. This may be news to the residents of Sydney. Personally, I do not think the noise problem has been solved. It has certainly not been solved to the satisfaction of people who live under the flight paths.

        The coalition, by discarding its own amendment, has shown itself to be hypocritical. The amendment last year was obviously a spoiling tactic not designed in any way to actually address the problems of the real people who are suffering. All the tears shed by the coalition may have been crocodile tears and, now they are in power, the amendment has gone. The concern for the people of Sydney is not very much evident and you are ready to sacrifice them for the pleasure of selling off public assets.

         My amendment asks you to take cognisance of your own words—your own supposed concern—to behave with integrity and to put your money where your mouth is. The amendment simply says that this bill will not commence and that you cannot sell off the airports until you have demonstrated that you have worked to solve the Sydney noise problem, or done it as equitably as possible. It requires you to do exactly what you as an opposition demanded the former government should do.

         My amendment goes a bit beyond yours. For one thing, I ask that you not only attempt to solve the problem in the present but work out a way to ensure the problem is not simply deferred and that you solve it permanently. I ask that you solve it to the satisfaction of the real stakeholders, not to the satisfaction of government, parliament or the Treasury. The real stakeholders are not the Treasury or the buyers who hope to make money from this. The real stakeholders are the people who must live under the planes. I ask you to work to solve the problem to the satisfaction of the councils that lie under the flight paths.

         I was concerned during the original debate, and put it on record, that we were only dealing with it as if it was a problem in one part of the country. It was defining itself in one part of the country but we had not worked out mechanisms to deal with it in any other part of the country either. There are problems of compensation, noise and safety everywhere there is an airport. Once you go to the point of privatising it, dealing with those issues becomes extremely difficult unless you have a management plan to do so.

          If you can work a plan to solve the problem of Sydney, you will have a model for resolution. Both state and territory government, local government and the lessee companies will have a good idea of what to expect, which is fair, and you will be able to plan ahead to make resolution of future problems easier and less expensive. Sydney is therefore a test case. If you cannot resolve this problem, I do not believe that you should be allowed to recreate it under a regime where government has even less control—that is, after we have sold the leases to the airport.

          The amendment is simple and modelled on your own. It says that the noise burden must be equitably shared and that it must be clear to councils that this equity can be maintained and that equity does not mean equal but increasing pain but, rather, that the noise problem should not become too onerous. It requires you to get the agreement of councils whose bounds lie within a circle of a 20kilometre radius of the airport and to table that agreement in parliament before this bill, which allows the sale of airport management, can commence.

          I commend this amendment to the coalition and Democrats who put forward and voted for a similar amendment last year. But, in my opinion, the amendment last year was hastily written and perhaps had implications for safety which this specifically does not because it deals with working out a plan. It does not specify the plan regardless of safety. It says `. . . to work out a plan which is agreeable' and it looks at a plan for the future, which means that you can factor in safety as part of that.

          Providing noise insulation should acknowledge that the noise problem is significant. It is a potential problem in any large city and should be resolved prior to relinquishing control and responsibility. There are other amendments to the Airports Bill which I will be putting later which deal with the specifics of noise management. However, this, I believe, should provide a model to deal with the future and not just Sydney. We are dealing with every FAC airport in the country and we are dealing with proposed increases in traffic which may increase the noise and traffic

        In equitably sharing the noise burden around all of those councils, you would have some amazing flight paths around Sydney airport.

        The real effect of this amendment proposed by Senator Margetts would be to delay the lease of airports, probably forever. It would frustrate completely the government's plans for leasing the airport by making the lease of every airport conditional on an agreement about aircraft noise being signed by Sydney councils. It is therefore not a high hurdle; it is an impossible dream.

         —The amendment is not only about noise; it is about air traffic as well. I am well aware that there are a number of airports around Australia which are not frequently part of this debate but which have a problem with air traffic. You have only to drive south down the Mitchell freeway in Perth to find there are a great many small aircraft using Jandakot airport. That is a traffic problem as much as or more than a noise problem. The idea of such a model is to look at ways to have councils somehow involved with the plan. I think councils are sensible enough to know there are good plans and not so good plans. At least that ought to be taken into consideration when those plans are developed.

        They were promised all sorts of things which governments said they could achieve in relation to the third runway. Many people felt that what did come about did not relate much to what they were promised in the first place. What people and councils are hoping for is a written agreement so there is something they can come back to when people make promises about the future. It does not mean aircraft going every which way; it means there is some participation in the process and that governments have to make an effort to listen to that concern and talk about what the issues and choices are. If, in the end, this means

        Perhaps this is a lesson that we should be learning, that instead of involving councils and the community at a late stage in the process it is best to involve them at an early stage so they are part of it and have realised what the implications and choices are or are not, and the decisions they can make. I am sure there are ways of devising this process so that councils can see that there are optimum outcomes and that that is what they will be working for. I am sure it is possible to devise a system where councils can agree to an optimum outcome.

         —I will just make a few brief comments with regard to this amendment and the proposition put by Senator Margetts. I absolutely have to agree with Senator Tambling and Senator Collins. I draw the attention of Senator Margetts to the committee report. I must also express my concern, in view of the fact that we had state and local governments present evidence to our committee, that the Greens did not see fit to present their amendment to get a response from the state government and the councils which appeared—a significant number.

        I believe the concerns you raise about consultation and having input have been covered by those recommendations. I will not read them out now because we dealt with them yesterday. But I wish to point out that we did deal with that. The minister has accepted the importance of having local governments, state governments and their regional and state plans included in the consultative process. I believe the concern you have expressed, which is not really consistent with your amendment, has already been accepted by the minister in terms of the processes.

         —There is one point I want to make. It is my understanding that the majority of Sydney councils and Sydney constituents are not arguing about the privatisation or otherwise of Sydney airport; they are arguing about the noise problem. I thought I should add that basically there was an assumption there that the bill would have been scuttled if the amendment had gone through. I do not think that that was necessarily the case. There was an incentive for agreement to be reached, and I think the majority of councils around Sydney airport actually felt that the desire was to work to the best possible arrangement.

         I could not tell you—and I do not know whether anybody has any information to say—that the majority of councils around Sydney airport do not want the airport privatised. My opinions on that might be different from theirs. I do not think we can assume that they specifically did not want the airport privatised. I thought I would make the point before we voted on the bill that it was unfair to assume that there would be an inbuilt criterion with any arrangement between councils that they would scuttle the privatisation. I think they wanted an outcome and they wanted the means to reach that.

           —At the time the Airports Bill 1996 was debated in the House of Representatives, the opposition moved amendments which would have reinstated the cross-ownership provisions included by the previous government in the Airports Bill 1995 and limited the scope of the ministerial exemption from consultation provisions on draft master plans and environment strategies. The minister indicated these proposals would be given further consideration before debate in the Senate.

          The minister subsequently wrote to the Senate committee considering the airport bills to advise the government's preparedness to reinstate the cross-ownership provisions, the government's preference to remove the two exemption clauses—sections 71 and 117—and the government's intention to make a technical amendment to clause 14 of the schedule to the bill to ensure the provisions related to foreign persons, not foreign companies.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I will now address the issue of cross-ownership restrictions. The amendments moved by the government will reinstate the cross-ownership provisions of the Airports Bill 1995 and so will achieve the identical position taken by the previous Labor government on the matter. This change is expected to meet the concerns which have been expressed to the government about the need for separation of the ownership of Sydney airport from Melbourne airport and Sydney airport from Brisbane airport.

          The amendments will include in the bill a requirement that the airport lessee and management companies for Sydney airport and Sydney West airport be controlled separately from the lessee or management companies of either Melbourne airport or Brisbane airport. For this purpose, the bill as amended will deem a holding of more than 15 per cent of any of the paid up capital, voting power and rights to distribution of profit and capital to

          With regard to consultations on draft airport plans, during debate in the House of Representatives the opposition proposed amendments to limit the power of the minister under clauses 71 and 117 to exempt certain draft master plans and environment strategies from the public comment processes established by the bill. The intention of the provisions in the bill was to enable the minister to exempt draft plans in circumstances in which it would have been unreasonable to require public comment and consultation, such as when proposed changes to a plan had resulted from public comment. The government considers that removing the clauses would be simpler than adopting the amendments which the opposition proposed during debate in the House of Representatives, as they are likely to be unworkable. This matter, as I mentioned earlier, was certainly flagged to the Senate committee and considered.

         <para first-indent="16">
          With regard to technical amendments to clause 14 of the schedule, clause 14 applies the 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership to holding companies for airport companies. The clause is intended to provide that the 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership will be applied on the basis of ownership of the holding company. Therefore, for example, a foreign person could own up to 49 per cent of a holding company, with the holding company in turn wholly owning one or more airport operator companies. Without a special provision, such as clause 14, this would not be possible, as the holding company would be characterised as a foreign person and so could hold most of the 49 per cent of an airport company. Commercially, this outcome would be unrealistic.

         <para first-indent="16">
          To ensure that clause 14 serves its purpose, references in it to `a foreign company' need to be replaced by references to `a foreign person', because the foreign ownership limitations in the bill relate to a foreign person rather than a foreign company. The government's amendments address the substantial

        In Western Australia, particularly at Perth airport, a number of concerns have been raised by people who have a link with and a fascination and a support for the bushland around that airport. I took the opportunity a few weeks ago, with Senator Margetts, some friends of the Perth airport bushland, some conservation groups and also the member for Swan, Don Randall, to do a detailed inspection of those bushland areas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many members of the conservation movement in Western Australia who are supporting the Perth bushland have indicated that they are opposed to privatisation, and of course that is their right. They are opposed to it, as they told me and have communicated to me in a number of letters, because they are concerned about conservation outcomes as a consequence of the privatisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        From my own experience in investigating those sites, it would be fair to say that there are some unique qualities and some beautiful patches of typical Western Australian sandy based bushland which have been recognised by the Australian Heritage Commission in their listing on the national register. The problem is that areas like Mundey's Swamp—one of the unique areas that has been listed—have become overrun with weeds. It has had virtually no money spent on the management of it. Some of the other areas have been spoiled by fires from, we presume, kids getting in there and burning cars or having camps on Saturday nights and by lots of
        <break page="2919" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         litter—rubbish, broken bottles, used car bodies—scattered throughout them. It is an area that has some unique, natural qualities and because it is required to be a buffer zone for airport noise and other safety elements around the airport it will, in large part, stay as natural bushland for generations to come and should be considered worthy of rehabilitation and long&amp;hyphen;term conservation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a conflict with plans for the future expansion of Perth airport, particularly the development of a further runway when the traffic at Perth airport requires that to be built. The Federal Airports Corporation informed me that that may not be for some 20 or 25 years, based on traffic projections. Nonetheless, as all of us know, the construction of new airports is not only a very expensive business but also a very important business to get right environmentally, as we have seen with the controversy surrounding the Sydney West proposals. It is very important in this bushland around the Perth airport to achieve a sensible balance with the needs of conservation and to ensure that we have our biodiversity and remnant urban bushland protected for a whole range of values, one of the most important being to ensure that the very good people of Perth have the opportunity to see what their countryside looked like before it was developed for urban use. There needs to be a balance for the future needs of Perth airport as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would be environmentally stupid to say that these areas could not be developed in the future, because we would then be required to find another patch of land somewhere near the Perth metropolitan area to develop another—probably $1 billion—airport facility. My own view, which I think is supported by evidence in many parts of the world, is that the privatisation process creates a unique opportunity to see private sector funds being channelled into important rehabilitation of those areas and into long&amp;hyphen;term conservation. I think that sensible environmentalists, as I am sure most of them are, should see this as an opportunity and not as a loss for the environment. The successful bidder for Perth airport will be encouraged to submit plans for a whole range of operations at the airport and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         I think the environmental plans that those tenderers put forward should form an important part of that process.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is quite crucial, if we are seriously concerned about conserving the areas around Perth airport, that money is spent on rehabilitation. The weeds need to be controlled. Access by feral animals and access by the public need to be controlled so that particularly the flora and the fauna, the biodiversity qualities and the unique natural heritage qualities of the Perth airport bushland can be preserved and conserved for the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I conclude by saying that I will be working in conjunction with the member for Swan, Don Randall, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, with whom we have already had a meeting to discuss this and who is very keen to ensure that the privatisation process is good for the environment, particularly the environment around the Perth airport. I encourage those people who care about the Perth airport bushland to be involved in this process. I encourage them to interact with the people who place bids for the Perth airport. I will certainly try to facilitate that as the process goes along. I certainly hope and expect that the outcomes for the environment around the Perth airport will be good ones. It should be a win&amp;hyphen;win situation for the budget, it will be a win&amp;hyphen;win for the travelling public and it will be a win for the bushland around the airport. I support the government's amendments.

         —The opposition does not oppose this bill. However, we do feel it necessary to make a few points. The principal act of this measure, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act, was first dealt with by the parliament in 1991. Essentially, that occurred in the context of the emergence of quite a substantial overseas student services sector of the education industry in this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Educational services to overseas students were threatened quite significantly by the emergence of some quite extraordinarily unscrupulous providers in the private education sector, some considerable difficulties in regard to the unevenness of quality of both the services provided and the support structures that were available for students, breaches by students of visa conditions, and the financial collapse of several private institutions with the consequent adverse publicity that occurred in overseas countries as a result of students losing considerable sums of money.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principal act was aimed at trying to restore Australia's reputation for sound educational practice. In particular that act was aimed at overseas countries; it was to ensure that people coming to this country for educational purposes would be treated with some equity and some fairness. Of course, there was an understanding that Australia's reputation had to be protected in so far as the national government had a responsibility to
        <break page="2921" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         maintain high quality education and training within this country while, at the same time, balancing out that responsibility with those of the states—which, sadly I note, have yet to respond adequately, as a consequence of which this measure is required. Also, the principal act was aimed at ensuring taxpayers funds were not required to compensate any international students who had been let down by unscrupulous providers, and that unscrupulous individuals were not being subsidised by public moneys.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as concerns of the review process that was undertaken, the original report came out in 1992. However, in 1993, upon my becoming a member of the education committee, these issues were revisited. The report was, in fact, quite a good one and has added substantially to our understanding of these issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has relied quite heavily on the reports of the consultants Ernst and Young which sought to make a contribution to this debate by seeking an extension of the act for a further two years because of the states' failure to respond adequately; by recommending the simplification of existing legislation to ensure that better and more appropriate responsibilities of the Commonwealth be defined; that simpler provider accounts and auditing requirements be instituted; that expanded scope for exemption of detailed financial regulatory requirements be ensured; that there be adequate consultation between the Commonwealth and the states and industry bodies with a view to making sure that this matter was properly reviewed by 1 January 1998; and by ensuring that there be a sunset clause within the current arrangements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems to me that the government's reliance upon regulation in this regard is the means by which the simplification will occur. As I understand, Minister, that is the mechanism which you are seeking to use; that is a regulatory framework. I am not altogether certain how widely understood that regulatory framework is. I would appreciate any comment the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Vanstone) would make in that regard. In terms of the changes, it is likely that there will be an extension of the financial matters in regard to the operation of the tuition assurance schemes, where groups of providers jointly guarantee, on behalf of each of their number, that the provision of tuition is paid for overall.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, this is the real problem: that, in the current general climate of deregulation, as I understand it, there has been very little support amongst stakeholders in favour of industry self-regulation. The principal concerns centre on Australia's international reputation in the provision of education services and whether the industry currently has sufficient maturity to ensure self-regulation. These were the issues that the Senate committee examined and reported upon. I am just wondering, Minister, whether or not there has been any change to those circumstances. I look forward to your response in that regard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I understand it, stakeholder agreements between the Commonwealth and the providers would continue to have a regulatory function but that regulation entirely by the states or territory governments is not desirable nor is it feasible, given their record in this area. I draw your attention, Minister, to the consultant's report which stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there was a need for some continuing Government role in regulation of matters relevant to international students for the foreseeable future and that there was no case for substantial changes to existing policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the opposition does support these measures, I raise those concerns with the minister and I would ask her for a response.

        Registration at the Commonwealth level is based on state or territory approval of institutions and courses. Education providers contribute through the tuition assurance scheme, which guarantees that the student's tuition is paid for. I note that Senator Carr raised a concern about the maturity of the industry. I think there is a general understanding that the industry has matured quite substantially over the last couple of years and that the tuition assurance schemes offer an opportunity for that contribution to self-regulation.

        While it is said that this is a joint responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states for regulation of these providers, it ultimately comes back to the Commonwealth in terms of its international relationships to ensure that there is high quality provision and an adequate regulatory regime in operation in this country.

         —The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill 1996 is supported by the opposition. The original bill was introduced during the period of the last government. Essentially, it was brought in to ensure that third party personal claims were not paid out, that moneys owing to the Commonwealth for Medicare, and possibly nursing home costs, were repaid before the plaintiffs received their funds.

        Although essentially worth while and effective in having Commonwealth funds repaid, unfortunately the legislation had the unhappy consequence for many plaintiffs that, because of the time delay required for the assessment of funds owing to the Commonwealth, in fact they had to wait for very long periods. I am advised by members of the legal fraternity, in particular, that there is a huge backlog as we speak. Essentially, this bill resolves the matter by allowing 90 per cent of the funds to be paid out to the plaintiff and for 10 per cent to be retained until the assessment of moneys owing to the Commonwealth is made. Evidence suggests that, in the vast majority of cases, this will cover the money owed to the Commonwealth, which appears to be, on average, in the range of seven per cent.

         I suppose there are circumstances, though you would think unusual, where the money owed to the Commonwealth will be in excess of that 10 per cent. In those circumstances, I have been assured that the plaintiff will be contacted and some convivial arrangement will be made for the repayment of those funds. I am told that there will not be any unfair pressure put on plaintiffs; that nothing will be repossessed that might make their lives difficult or generally cause problems; and that arrangements will be made, in an orderly fashion, for the repayment of anything beyond that 10 per cent.

         Essentially, the opposition supports the legislation. There is, I understand, some retrospectivity in this bill. Generally, in a situation where the effect of legislation adversely affected members of the general community, you would have to be very concerned but, in this case, the retrospectivity acts to the benefit of those members of the public who are affected. That being the case, I am very happy to support it.

        These amendments are designed to immediately clear the backlog of cases. Senator Neal has referred to the retrospectivity involved and this is one of the issues in which there is an element of retrospectivity. There is hardship going on, and it is being experienced by a number of people who are compensable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since the bill was introduced, much work has been undertaken in ensuring a more efficient and equitable system, and the further amendments improve the bill even more. These improvements are achieved by making the advanced payment process available to all cases, right back to the commencement of the original act on 1 February this year, rather than from the date of the passage of this bill. Since this backlog is quite significant, this will mean a significant benefit to a large number of people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would also like to give some assurances about recovery of debts by the Commonwealth, where the amount owing to the Commonwealth is greater than 10 per cent of the advanced payment and where the compensation payer makes an advance payment to the HIC. The settlement of any additional moneys owed to the Commonwealth is negotiated between the HIC and the person. There are a number of steps in that process which I think will allow a sensitive approach to that recovery. If there is disagreement after that process, there is a right of appeal to the AAT, and it is binding on both parties.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question of 10 per cent might be an issue. Let me address that briefly. There may be a substantial number of cases where the amount owing to the Commonwealth is more
        <break page="2925" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         than the 10 per cent advance payment—that is, that the figure which has been chosen is not the correct figure. By way of a disallowable instrument, the minister can determine a higher percentage. That would ensure that, in most cases, the amount held by the Commonwealth would cover the debt and not place an additional burden on the person. Of course, if it goes the other way and the average amount owing to the Commonwealth is less than 10 per cent, the regulations allow the minister to decrease the advance payment percentage to be held. I think that is a very fair and appropriate method which allows flexibility and a commonsense approach.

I understand that some misinformation has been put about about the question of funding to the hospitals.

        The Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr  Wooldridge, has made it very clear that of recent years there has been massive cost shifting in the public hospitals of the states onto the Commonwealth. As a result, the Commonwealth has looked to see what it can do to regain some of the finances that are being used contrary to the Medicare agreement by the states.

        Although the cost shifting has, in fact, increased by a substantial amount, the amount that is being clawed back by the Commonwealth, I understand, is simply a small proportion of the amount which the states are benefiting from by the cost shifting, which is not really endorsed under the Medicare agreement.

It might be disappointing to the Labor Party, but it certainly has set the framework for growth, jobs and greater prosperity—and that is something to be applauded. I will just remind the Senate of a few examples of what has been said—and I do not state them in any particular order. I will start with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

        Just what we would want to achieve. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, representing the owners of pharmacies in towns and cities throughout the country, welcomed the budget. In particular, it welcomed the announcement that they would be able to become Medicare agencies because, it said:

        That is an excellent endorsement. The Motor Traders Association—the motor industry being vital to the Australian economy—commended the government on the reforms to the capital gains system, the rollovers for businesses that I spoke of yesterday. It also made special mention of the exemption on the sale of small businesses for retirement, which is something I had not mentioned yesterday. It has picked up the good points there. The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission said:

         —On 16 July I put out a 2&amp;half;&amp;hyphen;page press release which went into a great deal of detail about some proposals in relation to the ABC. It did not of course relate to just funding proposals. It related to the establishment of a committee of review by an eminent Australian, Bob Mansfield, to look at the roles and priorities of the ABC. It made it quite clear that we were honouring our election commitment because we had said that we would maintain existing levels of funding for the period of the current triennium. That is why—

But we went on to talk about ATV and tendering out the proposals. We talked about taking back the unspent money for pay TV.

        So what was the response of Senator Schacht, who, after all, is the nominal shadow minister for communications? Twenty-four hours later he managed to put out six lines. What were they about? They were about ABC industrial action being totally justified. In other words, he thought he had better raise himself up, give the unions a bit of a free kick, bag management, as usual, and put out six lines—even though those six lines were fundamentally wrong.

It was about bagging ABC management, expressing his concern about reports that ABC staff were under increasing pressure not to raise the issue. So he called on management to defend the right of staff.

Looking at supplementary questions over a considerable period of time, it is very clear that that has for some time not been the practice—that supplementary questions have been asked supplementary to the original question and not

To rule this out of order at this point would change the whole structure of supplementary questions as they have been asked and dealt with over the last couple of years or more. If that is what you want to do, then I think it is a matter that the committee should have a look at as to whether the fundamental structure of supplementary questions is to be changed.

        I do not expect Senator Schacht to be terribly familiar with the Juneau report on Canadian broadcasting or even the recent changes to the BBC, but I would have thought that the opposition might have had something to offer on these very important issues. That is the great tragedy of this debate and that is why Hugh Mackay says, `Who is the opposition spokesman on the ABC? Would you believe me if I said it was Senator Schacht?' Quite frankly, I would not; because if you look at those press releases you see that the first two were obviously attempts to try to muscle in on the industrial relations portfolio. When he got the flick on that, the last one on Triple J presumably is an attempt to get the youth affairs portfolio. That does not help the debate on the important issues in this country.

It is a matter of some concern to me, because if people genuinely in need of income support are not to be demonised in our country then their receipt of benefits has to be regarded as being produced by a clean and efficient system where only those eligible for benefits actually get them. Having said that, there has been considerable evidence over some time that the more resources that go into protecting the system from fraud and abuse the more the system produces savings. So it is cost&amp;hyphen;effective to put more work into trying to locate those who would cheat the system.

        The debate often gets bogged down in how many of this and how many of that. The fact remains that there are people who were abusing the system under the previous government, and they made some attempts to do something about it. But the senator is new enough not to know, for example, that it took Senator Patterson in opposition to discover that prisoners in gaols were being paid social security benefits when they were not entitled to them. In other words, we must have good and accurate information on which to base eligibility.

As I say, I think I am answering it and certainly it is clear that the shadow minister, who did not ask this question, does not really understand the basis on which the government believes that these savings are available. There is a great deal of need to clean up this system after 13 years of Labor mismanagement. Some of the savings that we believe will be made under this $2.6 billion heading relate to the extraordinary complexity of the system that Labor developed over those 13 years.

         So we then picked up the responsibility not only to keep the promises that we made during the election but also to address that enormous deficit. What we have been able to do, and we stand here proudly claiming we have been able to do, is to, within the course of this parliament, get that budget into surplus. And that will be a fantastic achievement for the benefit of everyone who wants a job in this country; for the benefit of those who are in jobs, because Labor's record was not only high unemployment but also falling real wages; and for the benefit of small business so that they can grow because it keeps pressure off interest rates—something not only the Labor Party but, I would respectfully suggest, Senator Kernot should applaud.

          —Madam President, on the point of order: in accordance with the standing orders of this place, Senator Kernot sought leave to table a document. Leave was granted in a churlish way by Senator Hill. Nevertheless, leave was granted. Then Senator Campbell came down and said to Senator Hill, `What a wimp you are, Robert. Deny leave.' That is what happened. And now the pretender to the throne, Senator Alston, gets up to try to undermine Senator Hill. Have the guts, Senator Hill, to stick with your word.

        Her question was, in effect: does the record of the last government demonstrate the need for a charter of budget honesty. The answer, obviously, is yes because the Australian people were deceived at the last election by a Prime Minister who was not prepared to open the books. Now there is a lot of criticism subject to that because promises have been made on the basis of figures that turned out to be false. That will not happen again, as a result of our decision.

         Of course, that may not be fascinating material for an opposition that ignored it while in government, but it gives security for future income for older people, and that has to be the most basic promise that you could possibly keep. In addition we promised, twice a year, to index the pension. And that is being kept. In addition, we promised low income retirees that they would have an effective tax rate comparable to that of pensioners. That we have kept. Despite what we heard from Senator Neal last night, we have increased by 6.7 per cent the funding for the HACC scheme, which is of course of very great importance to older Australians.

As I said, we are now moving as fast as it is possible to do to provide improved accommodation for older Australians after the stewardship of the Labor Party over 13 years.

          In addition, we have had to face other decisions which are not as palatable. And why have we had to face those? Once again because of the stewardship of the Labor Party in government and their mismanagement of the government books. Why else are we faced with these difficult decisions? Having protected older Australians to that maximum I have just outlined, we have had to take some savings decisions that we would have preferred not to have taken if we had not had the books left in the state they were in. That is the problem.

        I want to put paid to the untruths that are being bandied around, scaring older people about going into nursing homes. I find what Senator Neal said in the adjournment debate last night offensive and I find what Senator Crowley said today offensive. Let me put on the public record that the changes to nursing homes will, in fact, be along the lines of contributions that are made to hostels now, contributions which were brought in in 1988 by the then Labor government. The changes that we have brought in to nursing homes will not impact on full pensioners, who make up 65 per cent of residents of nursing homes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For those opposite to stand there and say that people will pay $26,000 to go into a nursing homes is wrong, wrong, wrong, and they should know it is. Senator Crowley is just trying to scare older people. People going into nursing homes who can afford to make a contribution will do so on the same basis as people who go into hostels and can afford to make a contribution. For all full pensioners entering nursing homes this will continue to be the case. Entry fees will not be set by government. People entering a nursing home will negotiate an entry contribution with the provider. The government will ensure safeguards. Entry contributions will not be charged to full pensioners or existing residents. Anyone who has assets of less than $22,280 will not be charged an entry contribution. Entry contributions will not apply for short stays of up to six months, and that applies to many people who go into nursing homes. I can give you an example of my stepfather, who died in April. He was not in the nursing home six months, so he would not have been required to make an entry contribution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The provider can only take out of that contribution $2,600 per annum over five years. The balance of that is then left to go back to the resident or back into their estate. So even to say that they are paying a $26,000
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         entry contribution is, in fact, a furphy. There will be no draw&amp;hyphen;down for the first six months and the maximum that can be drawn down over five years is set at $13,000. This means that where the entry contribution is $20,000 or $50,000 the maximum draw&amp;hyphen;down is $13,000.

        How can you have sat over there for years and protected people who had huge incomes and not required them to pay an entry contribution to a nursing home? Millionaires were able to go into a nursing home and have no other additional cost other than the pension. That is what you did, and you let nursing homes degenerate. Professor Gregory said $300 million would be needed to bring nursing homes up to an acceptable level. That is what you let happen, while millionaires went into nursing homes paying no entry contribution. Now what you are saying is, `Don't let them pay. We can't let millionaires pay to go into nursing homes.' How ridiculous! All members of the industry have been saying there ought to be a contribution.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People who are on low incomes will be protected. If the Labor Party goes out telling older people that they have to pay $26,000, it will cause grief and distress amongst thousands of older people who should not be facing that grief and distress from being told fibs, lies and untruths by the Labor Party. I find it offensive, totally un&amp;hyphen;Australian and appalling that they would do that to older Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me just say how the contributions work, just to make it clear. The contributions will be based on a person's ability to pay. Let me say it again, just so the Labor Party can understand. It will be based on a person's ability to pay. It will not be that everyone pays $26,000. Pensioners will not be required to pay. People's assets will be assessed. Even now a lot of providers do not ask for an entry contribution, even though they are allowed to do it. A very small percentage of them—I think it is about six per cent—ask for the maximum contribution. It has worked well. There are checks and balances to ensure that people are not deprived. They make a contribution according to their ability to pay and it allows hostels to have capital upgrading.

All I can say in response is that, if this is a caring budget, she certainly knows how to kill with love. A few comments have been made by some people in the community who really do care—and they are not overwhelmingly supportive. I would like to read an extract of an article that appeared today relating to comments made by ACOSS. It states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Welfare groups yesterday accused the government of betraying unemployed youth and of unfairly hurting low income earners with spending cuts in the budget. The Australian Council of Social Service said that low income earners were the target of 30 per cent of the principal cuts. The ACOSS paper tallied cuts in labour market programs, social security, health and family services, Aboriginal affairs, education, and the justice system. It found that of the $11 billion in significant cuts over the next two years $3.4 billion would mainly hit low income earners

        What did Mr Howard say in response to this? He dismissed the criticism, saying that he had `kept the core promises'. Obviously, there are a number of things that he does not consider to be core promises—and certainly Senator Newman does not either. She obviously thinks commitments to the elderly people and the less well&amp;hyphen;off elderly people in our community are not core promises.

         Let us look at what this budget has done to elderly people in the community. Look at the concessional pharmaceutical benefits. There have been cuts to those for pensioners and health card holders—an extra 50c each time. As we know, pensioners use a lot of prescriptions. They are probably the biggest users of prescriptions in the community. Is that 50c each pop, each prescription being compen sated for? No. It is being taken out of pensioners' pockets and they are not getting anything back.

        Where else have pensioners lost out? The Commonwealth dental scheme has been abolished—a scheme that was set up to deal with the waiting list of pensioners and health card holders. Before this scheme was introduced, the states had a scheme that had a 24-month waiting list. Do you know what that meant? It meant that pensioners who had problems with their teeth had those teeth extracted; there was no time to give them treatment. That is what we are going back to. Pensioners will have to either go in there and have quick treatment, a quick extraction, or, alternatively, pay for themselves. Has this loss to be suffered by elderly people been compensated for? No.

        Let us look at HACC services. The minister, after a day, was able to work out what had happened to HACC services—or at least some part of it. She came in and told us that there would be more money in there. That is fabulous. But the only problem is that every individual will have to pay for those services. In the line items in the budget, it says `increase user charging in the home and community care program'. So what you are saying is that everyone who uses HACC services—the frail and the aged, the young and the disabled—will have to pay more in user charges. But that is not where the pain stops.

          for the elderly stop in this budget. Nursing home entry fees! The more they squeal, the more you know it is true. You have introduced or allowed to be introduced nursing home entry fees. Yes, we do not know the exact amount of these fees because the minister will not tell us. None of the people in private industry know because the minister cannot tell them. But, on average, present entry fees for hostels are $26,000. So it is reasonable to assume that it will be much the same in relation to nursing homes. But, again, that is not the worst of it. The maximum they can charge you is $88,000. Minister, you may feel that it is caring to charge elderly people $88,000 to get into a nursing home—but, personally, I do not think it is.

Secondly, they have not been abolished—get your facts right. However, Senator Neal, if you are really interested in this question they have been reduced in the budget papers because there is an expectation that a number of proprietors will prefer to take alternative forms of funding from the Commonwealth grants for which they currently have a commitment. It is up to the owners of the nursing homes as to whether they continue with the grants for which they have a contract or whether they move to another arrangement.

These measures are tough, sure, but they are fair.

         The very fact that there has not been a cry from the nation, along the lines that Senator Neal and some of her colleagues have been making in this place, demonstrates how people recognise there was a need to take stiff measures for Australia to get its budget back in order again. The Labor Party does not like to hear that because it was responsible for the mess. But if Australia is going to get up off its knees again, we are trying to make sure that we do it as soon as possible and in the fairest way possible. Older  Australians are not fools. They understand that we have to get it right for the sake of their children and their grandchildren. If there is any fault in this budget at all, we know where the guilty party is.

        I believe that I have the answer, if I can be so presumptuous as to suggest it, as to why there is such confusion here in this place on what the government has done in relation to the measures we have been discussing this afternoon. The answer lies here in your statement entitled More Choice for Women. You did table a statement—I am sure that is welcome in many quarters—but you did not maintain a 12-year precedent of presenting a women's budget statement that would have detailed to a considerable extent the measures of this budget and how they would impact on women and families.

It is not too late to go back to the Office of the Status of Women and the various government departments that are responsible for many of the measures in this budget and ask them to do that analysis and then come back to this place and table a proper assessment of the impact of this budget on women. I would challenge the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to allow this to happen.

What was clear to me from Senator Hill's body language was that he had not been extended the normal courtesy, which has been extended on virtually all occasions during the years I have been in this place, which is to ensure that when you seek leave to table a document you inform all senators, particularly the party whips and party leaders who are on duty, independent senators and others what it is that is to be tabled.

         —This proposition goes to the question of this government's integrity when it comes to the issues of higher education and other educational programs. As I understand the talk around this town, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, explained to a number of people before the budget was brought down that, after the budget was brought down, she would be the most unpopular minister for education in the Commonwealth's history. I think that is one promise she has kept. There have been very few others that she has kept.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What we see in these budget papers is an attempt to disguise and deceive, just like the election strategy of the Liberal Party from its very commencement. You promise anything, you say anything and you do anything you think is necessary to get you a few votes and then in practice you do very little of what you promised and what you committed to. We have seen again and again this strategy being followed. These budget papers follow that practice by suggesting that there are increases in education expenditure when, in fact, the opposite is the case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Minister, as I gave your papers a bit more careful reading rather than just the superficial reading your press relations people would encourage us to do, I found that, over the next four years, the total cuts to budget programs administered by your department will amount to something in the order of $5.8 billion. That is $5.8 billion worth of cuts being administered by this minister in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. That would have to be one of the greatest levels of cuts that any Commonwealth minister responsible for
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question is: is this just a case of the minister's incompetence or is it a case of the ERC imposing on her decisions that no other minister would accept and, therefore, is it just a failure to administer her department and to defend her constituency the way she ought to as the minister responsible for such an important area of government activity?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We looked at the detail very clearly. We were promised by this government before the election that it would maintain existing programs in the schools area. If I recall the promise made by Senator Hill in February this year, he said, `We will at least maintain Commonwealth specific purpose payments to schools in line with the forward estimates recurrent, capital and targeted equity programs.' When you look at the budget papers that clearly has not occurred.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When you look at the other higher education areas, the promise was simple: `We will maintain the level of funding for operating grants to universities and there will be no cuts in university places.' According to the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </emphasis>
        , `Iron&amp;hyphen;clad commitments have been given that the overall funding for universities would be maintained.' So it goes on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The same pattern is emerging out of every area of activity undertaken by this department. As I read it, it is a very simple proposition. With Austudy the lies and deceit continue. For instance, the statement issued by this government says that the coalition government is firmly committed to maintain the level of benefits to eligible families which Austudy provides. You would think that that means that it wants to spend money on Austudy and maintain the level of benefits. Nothing could be further from the truth because, when you read the budget papers carefully, you find cuts in excess of $514 million being made to Austudy. So, with such things like case management of homeless students, you see that quite significant cuts have been undertaken—quite contrary to the commitments given before the election.
       </para>
       <break page="2948" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         We see in the case of Abstudy and Austudy that the age of independence has been raised to 25 years. We see that the tightening of the various eligibility tests will produce substantial savings from the government's point of view. We see breaches being made in English as a second language and in TAFE programs. We see cuts to operating grants, to growth funding, to the states, to TAFE colleges and to the VET sector generally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, in higher eduction the case is abundantly clear. In relation to HECS funding, in total some $2.4 billion overall has been taken away from Australians and taken out of the higher education sector as a result of this government's programs—$2.4 billion! Nothing could be clearer: in terms of discretionary funds $214 million has been taken out; in terms of raising the independent allowance for students receiving Austudy payments, some $241 million; in terms of tightening the means test, $817 million; and in terms of lowering the threshold, $312 million. We see similar sorts of figures in terms of differential HECS. Some $623 million in operating grants will also be taken away from this sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what we see is a government that has quite clearly been caught out, a government that cannot keep its word. In a whole range of areas—in the operation of universities, support to students and equity programs—quite clearly this government has not maintained its commitments and has quite clearly breached them. We see that not one extra dollar has been put into equity programs—not one extra dollar! What this government is seeking to do is repackage Labor programs, re&amp;hyphen;announce them, reclaim them as its own and say, `Oh, yes. We're keeping our commitments.' That is not what it said before the election. In terms of up-front fees, quite a significant impact will be had upon the disincentive rates—that is, people being forced out of universities—as a result of the actions being taken by this government.

         Aboriginal education is one of the clearest areas I can point to where fundamental breaches have occurred. These are not big sums of money at all but, in terms of the principles at stake here, in terms of the equity

          arrangements entered into by this government and in terms of the importance of education in trying to provide a better, fairer and more productive society, this government has failed dismally.

         We were told that Aboriginal education would be exempt from the moves on ATSIC, that that program would be left apart from any changes. But what do we find today? We find—although we do not see this too clearly in any of the budget papers; that is part of the game, isn't it, making sure that as little information as possible explaining what is happening in the forward estimates is available—on page 8 of the budget statements, which deals with direct assistance in Aboriginal education, that there have been quite specific cuts to programs in the coming year. Of course, over the next four years these cuts will become even more pronounced. I notice there has also been a significant cut in tuition assistance. The vocational guidance program has been cut. The Aboriginal parents program has been cut. In terms of the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program, $1.5 million will be taken out next year, and this cut will grow to $31 million by the turn of the century.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we are seeing will have quite detrimental effects on Aboriginal tertiary education assistance. This is quite contrary to the claims made that education would be exempt from cuts relating to ATSIC. This is another set of lies, more deceit, more deception. We all understand what that means in terms of equity, because we understand that education provides a vehicle for many people to change their life circumstances.

         Of course, this is yet one more opportunity for the rich and powerful to maintain their influence in this society. The minister goes on and on about how hard life was under Labor, but her complaint was that we spent too much, that Labor did too much. She said the way to fix that up is to make the poor pay more. She has offered a few scholarships—a miserable 1,000 scholarships, I think. There

         —Senator Carr, with the greatest of respect, you did yourself no service whatsoever in that presentation. You displayed either a capacity to be deceptive with the truth or an incapacity to understand it—one or the other.

        You raised the point, Senator Carr, that you think it is all a pack of lies—the usual claim from the Labor Party. I just invite you to consider what your own national secretary said contributed to your losing the last election. In the cold light of day, after Gary Gray had had plenty of time to consider it, he said:

        We in this chamber have some differences of opinion as to what way we should take higher education in the future, and I want to concentrate on that aspect in particular.

        that $2.4 billion has been taken out. That is either a misunderstanding or a deception because it is simply not the case. When you put together a savings package—he may not know this but other members here would—part of that savings package comes from bringing revenue ahead and some of it
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         comes from, yes, making cuts—cuts against forward estimates; that is, what people were planning on spending in the future.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important people realise that the higher education sector, through operating grants and research, will actually get more next year than it got this year. In future years it will end up with less than it was expecting to get, yes. There are reductions. I make no bones about that. They are very small, though—one per cent next year against a forward growth estimate, three per cent the year after, one the year after that and one the year after that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are not significant savings to ask from a sector which cannot be immune from the savings task. People in higher education, whether they are going through it or teaching in it, are amongst some of the luckiest people in Australia. To ask a contribution of 1&amp;hyphen;3&amp;hyphen;1&amp;hyphen;1 against their operating grant plans for the future is not a lot to ask.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bulk of the savings in the higher education sector comes from two things. Firstly, graduates are asked to pay back more quickly than they otherwise would have—that is, to reduce the point at which they start to pay back their HECS contribution. Isn't this a lucky country, Mr Deputy President, where anyone can access higher education, as they ought to be able to, on their merit. They are asked to make a contribution and they do not have to pay that contribution until they start earning.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We support that system: a system introduced by the Labor Party; a system that acknowledges that, yes, there is a very public benefit in higher education, but also a private benefit; and a system that says to graduates who benefit from that, `You're going to have to pay something back. You're going to have to make a contribution.' We support that system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had this enormous savings task to fill the Beazley bankcard. We have kept the promise to keep charges to existing students the same; their charges and their debt levels do not go up. I freely admit that we say to them, `I'm sorry; you're going to have to start paying back a bit earlier—when you're earning $20,700.' I hear people saying,
        <break page="2950" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         `That's too low an amount. Students couldn't possibly make a contribution then.'

        People need to understand that people who get the benefit of higher education—as Neville Wran understood when he did the Wran report—are the luckiest people in Australia. They have an unemployment rate of 3.9 per cent; it is less than half the unemployment rate endured by other Australians who have not had that opportunity of higher education. Their starting salaries are higher than average salaries and their periods of unemployment are far less. We do not think it is unreasonable to ask for a contribution back and to ask now for a higher contribution back; other people may disagree.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But we need to understand who pays for higher education. There is no such thing as free higher education; there never was. We need to understand who is paying for it. In other words: when you put a contribution in through HECS, to whom are you giving it back? You are giving it back to low and middle income earners who by and large are paying for the privilege of higher education for people who still come from higher income levels.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to understand that the households with the top 20 per cent of incomes enjoy 38 per cent of the benefits of higher education. The bottom 20 per cent of households enjoy only seven per cent of the benefits of higher education. So it is pretty clear who is getting the benefit. It is not unreasonable to say to graduates, `You're the ones who are getting a very substantial benefit out of this and we are going to ask you to make a bigger contribution.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is equally very fair to put some more equity into the HECS system. I accept it puts equity there for starters: everyone can get in on merit; no-one has to pay back until they have started earning an income. But they all pay the same. Teachers who have a low course cost and a lower income in later life than doctors who have a high course cost and a higher income are asked to make the same contribution as doctors. Members opposite might think that is fair; we do not think it is fair. We think a differentiated HECS contribution that acknowledges the benefits you are
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         going to get out of it and which has some interplay between the cost of your course and your expected later income is fair.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, that is what Neville Wran thought when he did the report of the Committee on Higher Education Funding. He actually recommended to the previous government that they shift to a differentiated HECS; that they acknowledge that some people for the rest of their lives get more out of higher education than others. He, just like us, did not put forward a differentiated HECS solely on the cost of the course. That would have ignored the fact that nursing and science are expensive courses to run but that those people in those courses do not end up with the same private benefit, they do not end up with the high incomes that doctors and lawyers do. For that reason, we have put nursing on the lowest level that Mr Wran recommended and science in the middle. We think that is a very reasonable thing to do.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not think for one minute that we have let down the higher education sector. In addition to restoring equity to the HECS system in that sense, we have also allowed universities much more flexibility. We will allow Australian students to buy a place, just like an international student can. The students who do that will be made up of a number of people.

        Do you realise that if universities take one per cent of their students from full fee paying students they will get an extra $17 million. As they take up two per cent and three per cent of full fee paying students in addition to their government funded load, with penalties if they try to sell places without filling their government load, every per cent they go up will pour more and more millions of dollars not into general revenue but straight into universities. So people opposite who want to

You run your argument if you want and you ask yourselves whether you think it will be successful.

        In addition, there are more flexibilities provided to Australian universities. Under the previous government, if universities made the mistake of over&amp;hyphen;enrolling—which they often did, because you penalised them when they under&amp;hyphen;enrolled—you would not give them the HECS contribution that you had taken from those students. You just took that HECS contribution and you put it straight into general revenue.

        We want to change that. We want to say to universities, `If you over&amp;hyphen;enrol, and we take a HECS contribution from those students, we'll give it back to you.' So the universities are going to be in a much better position if we can get this package passed. We have not let them down; we have given them the greatest opportunity they have ever seen.

         —I rise to contribute to this matter of public importance: the government's betrayal of Australians who are reliant upon higher and other education training programs. Interestingly, we could easily be debating today this government's betrayal of Australians. It is a betrayal because, as others have spelt out, particularly Senator Carr and Senator Stott Despoja, every promise in this area has been broken, with more abandon than any other of the broken promises, by this Howard coalition government introducing a classic Thatcher Tory budget. The budget will have a very dramatic impact on not only Australians but also Australian families and Australian society.

        It took an immense commitment by the previous Labor government to get the investment into education, higher education, training and skills programs up to the level it was. When we came into office, 37 per cent of children finished year 12; when we left, it was over 80 per cent. Some figures would put it in the high 70s, others into the 80s, depending on where you were in Australia: a massive turnaround. And there were 650,000 places in the tertiary sector when we left office.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Australians had begun to realise the importance of training, education and skills to the benefit of this society. You cannot talk about recovery of small businesses if people are not able to understand how to run a small business and if they are not skilled and trained to do it. You cannot talk about people taking

        The dramatic cuts and the broken promises of Austudy and HECS have been spelt out very well indeed. But I am particularly interested to draw the Senate's attention to two documents that came down on the night of the budget: More Choice for Women and Strengthening Families. Interestingly, both these documents are absolutely silent on education, as though strengthening families does not need to address the question of education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yet sometimes the opposition wants to talk about the strain on families through the pressures to work and so on. One of the most important reasons families have a second income, as many thousands of women will tell you, is, `I've gone back to work particularly to ensure adequate education assistance for my children.' That is what they want. What has the coalition done? It has dramatically increased the costs of education on families and individuals. You have actually gone to the core of what families are on about in their investments in their own children's future and that of this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These broken promises in education not only cut the education sector and the fabric of our society but they cut what families are on about—families who are committed to improving the opportunities for their children. That has now been knocked for six by these vicious increased costs and charges on students and tertiary institutions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the other document that I cited, More Choice for Women, again there is no mention of education. Although Senator Stott Despoja pointed out there may have been evidence of no change in the population of university students, she did not highlight the evidence that one of the great dramatic changes in tertiary sector education is the presence of women. After at least a century of being denied access, forbidden and prevented from getting into secondary education let alone tertiary education, we created opportunities for women which they took up in droves. Even the figures earlier this year showed girls achieving extraordinarily well, achieving higher prizes and results than boys in our
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         schools to the point where people are now wondering about boys' education. Girls and women in tertiary sector employment are also achieving splendidly.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What has happened? Having just got in they are now going to find that the costs and the charges to maintain their presence are going to dramatically increase. So many of those women entered tertiary education because of our commitment to righting the injustice of the costs and the difficulties for women coming from inadequate training through secondary school. We set up those specific programs directed to equity and justice to assist people with disadvantages, Aboriginal people and, in particular, women. They embraced those opportunities with open arms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is no wonder you do not say anything about education in your More Choice for Women document. There is very little choice for women with these increased charges and the prospect of increased debts. That is what you are giving to women. Many women who are still advancing into tertiary education with some trepidation have to ask themselves, `Gosh, do I anticipate that I can cope with the sort of debt that I will have when I leave the tertiary sector?'  No longer do they have to be able to earn $28,000 before they pay it back; it is now $20,000. These are people who are very well below average weekly earnings. They are struggling with all the other commitments that come with an income of $20,000. Yet they are now going to have to pay back their tertiary education charges.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These changes were guaranteed not to happen. There were to be no changes to HECS, no increase in costs, no cutback in services, no restrictions on places and no cuts to operational grants to universities. We have seen absolutely all those promises broken. The damage is already evidenced by the anger portrayed by vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors, university staff and students.

         —I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance concerning education. It is some time since I have spoken on this area and I am delighted to have the opportunity to highlight the misinformation that the opposition is peddling. It is peddling misinformation about nursing homes and education. The shadow minister for education and youth affairs, Mr Baldwin, released a press release on, I think, 21 August, headed `Government misleads on vocational education'. Let me just say that in that press release what the shadow minister did was mislead the public. The claims made by the shadow minister, Peter Baldwin, were scandalous but they are understandable, I suppose, given the figures you can expect from a graduate of Labor's magic pudding school of budget planning. The first claim Mr Baldwin made is as follows:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the face of it, the Budget contained an increase for non&amp;hyphen;government schools of around $210 million over four years, while government schools faced a net cut of around $70 million over the same period.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wrong. The budget papers reveal that for 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Commonwealth spending on government schools was $1,124 million. In 1996&amp;hyphen;97 that spending will be $1,167 million, an increase of $43 million or 3.8 per cent. Over
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the next four years, spending will have increased by more than $240 million on government schools. There is no evidence that the states' contribution to filling Beazley's magic pudding fiasco will reduce funding to schools. It is for the states to decide how they make that contribution. In addition to the $305 million of extra funds for literacy, school to work, languages and civics, two&amp;hyphen;thirds will go to government schools. On that claim he was wrong. He also claimed in the press release:

        Federal expenditure on literacy—the need for which Dr Kemp has dishonestly sought to exploit as his own discovery—is $6 million less than Labor's commitment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wrong. The federal coalition focused on literacy because the previous Labor government had done nothing about it. We have not had a survey of literacy in Australia for the past 16 years but evidence gathered from some of the research that has been done is that literacy in this country has declined. Labor's commitment to literacy was to cut the funding for the early literacy program. When the minister asked the department, `What is going on about the literacy program,' the answer from the department was, `Minister, it was a program for which there was no money in the forward estimates.' What the government is doing is putting in $45 million of extra money.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me remind those on the other side that illiteracy is really one of the worst forms of poverty. Literacy opens the door to opportunity and achievement. What Labor was going to do by not having that spending or that funding in the forward estimates was take away from our children the key to opportunity that literacy gives. Literacy opens the door to the whole world. What the previous Labor government did by taking it out of forward estimates was take away that key, in particular from low income families with children, and adults who had difficulty reading. Another claim the shadow minister made was as follows:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The New Schools Policy, under which the Federal Government funds non&amp;hyphen;government schools, will be abolished at a cost of $150 million over four years. This will be done in the name of choice and savings to the public purse, even though it could
        <break page="2956" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para first-indent="16">
        The new schools policy was a travesty. It has been eliminated because it took away and restricted parent choice. It failed damnably. Under the new schools policy the percentage of students in non&amp;hyphen;government schools kept increasing. The policy discriminated against parents whose children were in low cost non&amp;hyphen;government schools that were established in the early 1990s. The policy was abolished in the name of choice but, if parents do not exercise the choice to send their children to non&amp;hyphen;government schools, there will be no change in funding for government schools. So the shadow minister was absolutely wrong.

Again, that is wrong. The budget papers reveal that in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Commonwealth spending was $1,124 million, and in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 there will be an increase of $43 million.

         One of the other issues that have been neglected by the previous government is in regard to young people who are leaving school who do not go on to university, young people who fall between the stools. The minister has indicated there will be a $187 million school to work package, a package which supports and assists young people who are going into the work force from school. The program will involve $80 million to expand vocational education and training in secondary schools; $40 million for workplace training opportunities for students; $38 million for up to 200 work placement coordinators to facilitate structured workplace learning opportunities for students; $23 million for implementing vocational education in schools, including employing extra teachers and professional development for teachers to ensure they have up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date industry experi ence; school based paid apprenticeships and traineeships, and $6 million in the next two years for a jobs pathway guarantee program to support the transition from school to work.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The program is part of the federal government's new modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system, continuing the reform and streamlining of Australia's trainee system. It will allow students to combine their secondary school certificate with practical work skills and qualifications recognised and valued by a broad range of businesses. That is what employers are asking for. They are asking for young people who come out with literacy skills, who come out with a good basic education, and also come out with an understanding of work and training and skills that will fit them for the workplace. That is what we are doing; not creating mickey mouse jobs but training young people, giving them the sorts of skills that will make them work ready.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another area involving training is the professional development of teachers, an area that has been neglected. Teachers are a group of people who have in their hands an enormous responsibility. When I was teaching I saw it as a great privilege to be able to teach young people. These teachers require a continual upgrading of their professional training and experience. The features—

        With these massive expenditure cuts, you will be reducing by around 30,000 the number of university places that will be available. The government is turning back the clock. In our period of government we almost doubled the number of places, from 350,000 to 630,000. In one year you will reduce that substantially. You are ripping around five per cent out of the higher education budget. You are placing at risk the future of regional universities—universities in northern New South Wales, in western Sydney and in other states such as Victoria and South Australia particularly. Just as those universities have got off the ground, have got the capital investment and expenditure in them and are attracting more students into higher education, you are threatening their very existence. For instance, of 16,000 student places in regional universities throughout Australia that will go by the board, approximately 2,400 of them are in New South Wales. That will mean a massive reduction of $24 million out of regional universities in New South Wales.

This government's ultimate disgraceful approach to regional higher education can be seen when you look at the statement delivered by the Hon. John Sharp on budget day entitled Rebuilding Regional Australia. You will not find one mention anywhere in that document of the word `education'. Education in regional Australia is not important to this government.

The minister was trying to cover his tracks—that is the best way I could put it—on the broken promise of the coalition.

       Senator Alston has been caught red&amp;hyphen;handed in misleading the Australian people throughout the election campaign and on election night about the coalition's commitment to the ABC. Since election night, we have seen a concerted, deliberate campaign not only by Senator Alston but by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, in attacking the ABC politically. Senator Alston started off by attacking the management qualities of the ABC. Yet only last year, in the report of a Senate committee which he chaired, he gave the management of the ABC a big tick. The report, which Senator Forshaw has with him now in the chamber, is called

        —It was their title. Senator Alston chaired the committee and signed off the report, saying that the management of the ABC was okay. Once he became minister, once the political attack started, he began saying that the management had a lot to answer for. That was followed by remarks by Mr Howard, which I think are the most serious remarks, outlining the political intent and outlining what the coalition really thinks of the ABC. Several times—it was not an accidental slip of the tongue or a Freudian slip—Mr Howard said that the ABC coverage was biased, that it was too politically correct, and that you heard only one view on the ABC. Subsequently, coalition spokespeople have been reported as saying that, for example, there is too much emphasis on Aboriginal affairs on the ABC. Mr Howard has apparently said that himself.

       What Mr Howard would like is to have any issues that are uncomfortable to him, or that do not make Australians feel relaxed and comfortable, taken off the ABC altogether. He does not want issues reported and then have people on both sides of the argument put their

       Then, of course, we have the Treasurer, Mr Costello. When the National Commission of Audit report was released—which, in most areas, the coalition ran 100 miles away from and ignored completely because it had too many uncomfortable things in it for even Mr Costello to contemplate—it made a suggestion that the funding for the ABC as an institution be removed and that all programming money be put out to competition. This would gut the ABC and would mean that we would no longer have a national broadcaster. That was their recommendation. It was not covered in detail in the report. There was no great explanation about it. It was almost a one&amp;hyphen;paragraph throw&amp;hyphen;away line, but Mr Costello chose to emphasise those remarks in his statement at the time of the release of the audit report. He chose to say that ABC management is not up to the mark.

       We clearly have a pattern. First of all there was a softening up of the public debate by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Communications and the Arts attacking the ABC. The next stage of the program was the announcement of the efficiency dividend cut of $10 million to $11 million a year which has been applied to all agencies—this was immediately a breach of their election promise. But then, of course, we had the sudden announcement, announced boldly and coldly by Senator Alston on behalf of the government, that there would be a cut of $55 million a year starting from next year and that every year thereafter that cut in the base funding would continue.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       So over the next four years of outlays—this is not an estimate on our part, but an absolute calculation—when you put the efficiency dividend cut in, plus the $55 million a year for the following three years, it totals $209 million. Yesterday and the day before Senator Alston was attempting to say that I had that figure wrong in my statement. I think he also tried to say it today. Yet today's Melbourne
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       Senator Alston is trying to explain to people that the cut only has one year and thereafter it is restored. I do not think he understands that, compared with what we had put in the budget for future outlays and what we had committed ourselves to and what people had expected for the next triennium, there will be a $209 million loss to the ABC. This is not just tinkering and removing a little bit of fat from the edge. This is the deepest and most significant cut to the operation of the ABC since it was formed in the early 1930s. This is going to destroy the ABC as a national broadcaster covering a broad range of programs to a broad range of Australians in all sorts of areas.

       Only yesterday in the Senate adjournment debate my colleague Senator Ray paid great tribute to the ABC radio coverage of the Olympic Games from Atlanta saying that it was excellent, that the quality of the broadcast and the commentators were a real credit to the ABC and that it was very informative. He pointed out that, if you make the big cuts to the ABC, the organisation will lose its institutional skills, its memory and its backup to have available the people with such a broad range of skill in broadcasting 30&amp;hyphen;odd different sports at the Olympic Games.

       The ABC does not just broadcast for a few elite or a few significant minorities; it broadcasts for everybody across Australia. That is in the charter. When the Labor Party was in government back in the 1980s it put legislation through this parliament that gave the ABC a broad based charter for all Australians. That is the charter this parliament adopted. It is the existing charter. But what do we find? On the same day as they announced these drastic cuts to destroy the ABC they announced the appointment of Mr Mansfield to review the charter.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       One would have thought they would have put the review first and then justified some cuts. This is the classic case of putting the
       <break page="2960" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        cart before the horse. They have put the cuts in anyway, irrespective of what Mr Mansfield may find. Mr Mansfield has terms of reference that almost predict the outcome of the review. They are narrow. They are aimed at restricting the ABC from being a broad based national independent broadcaster.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I do not know whether Mr Mansfield realises what he has stepped into by accepting the invitation of the government to conduct this independent review. Mr Mansfield has had a long, successful history in Australian industry. He was the chief executive of McDonald's fast food chain when it was going through its most expansionary period. He then became chief executive of Optus when it started to become the second telecommunications carrier. Then, for a short period, he was chief executive of Fairfax until he fell out with its foreign owners when he tried to run the company as an Australian company.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We have to be honest, and I do not think Mr Mansfield would dispute this: Mr Mansfield does not have much of a history or interest indicated in Australian public broadcasting. Nevertheless, he has had broad experience in industry and he is conducting this review. I suspect he was more than a little surprised at the immediate public reaction around Australia to the announcement of the cuts in the ABC, the appointment of himself and those rigged terms of reference which the government gave him.

       There have been rallies of tens of thousands of people in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle, and so on. I attended one in Fremantle. What was striking about those rallies was not that a small group of people from one segment of our community turned up but that—and this is from my observations at the rally in Fremantle—the group that turned up was notable in its diversity. There were people ranging from those who were clearly what I would consider to be coalition supporters to those who would be well to the left of the Labor Party. There were young people, old people, ethnic representatives, working class people, retirees, and so on. You name it, they were represented in the audience.

        At the end of the meeting after the guest speakers had spoken, those people had a chance to make their views known. I had never heard for a very long time such passion from all these people when they stood up at the microphone and articulated their views. `Leave the ABC alone', `Restore the cuts', `It's our ABC', they were saying to the government, and in particular to Senator Alston—`Leave it as it is'.

        We know that some members of the coalition consistently complain about ABC bias in some form or another. We all, as politicians, complain about bias when we do not quite get our press release read out the way we would like. That is the nature of the beast. That will always be the case. But from time to time there have been just as many people in the Labor Party who have been upset about the way the ABC has covered something as there have been on the other side.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, what I think is most noteworthy is that all the surveys show the bulk of the ABC traditional audience being coalition supporters. Despite the so-called bias that Mr Howard goes on about, coalition voters are the ones who overwhelmingly are the listeners and viewers of the ABC. Despite Mr Howard's concern about bias, they continue to listen to and watch the ABC. I believe that coalition voters by these actions have told Mr Howard: we do not think the ABC is biased because we like listening to it and watching it. Absolutely, and in one fell swoop, those surveys have destroyed Mr Howard's own argument about bias.

         I would say also that in non-metropolitan Australia, in regional Australia, probably 90 per cent of listeners to the ABC, particularly in some rural areas, would be coalition or National Party supporters. What I have seen sometimes of ABC rural and regional radio, the local radio station, in western New South Wales or in the Riverland area of South Australia is that, because the local federal member and state member are overwhelmingly coalition members, they get an extraordinary run of their statements being broadcast—as they should. From the Labor Party point of view, we do not get an equal say; unfortu nately, of course, we are not the elected members in those areas.

        But to say that the coalition is being harshly dealt with by the ABC in rural and regional Australia is hypocrisy; it is just madness. All the evidence goes to the opposite. I ask rural Liberal members and anyone from the National Party, in particular: give us examples of occasions when your press release was not run, when you did not get a chance to make a comment on the ABC regional morning news service when you had something sensible to say. They cannot give one example.

        One area where some people in the coalition—not all, but some—get themselves stirred up is programs, innovative programs like the new Triple J network which has spread across Australia. We have Mr Bradford, the member from the Gold Coast area, publicly asking that the ABC completely close down Triple J because occasionally it uses some four-letter words—occasionally. Triple J occasionally talks about things about which he feels uncomfortable, and so on. But I say to Mr Bradford, the coalition and everyone else: do they realise that each week 2.5 million to 2.8 million young Australians listen to Triple J? What an astonishing performance; what an astonishing consumer reaction, if you want to put it that way. The young people of Australia have voted with their ears: they want to listen to Triple J.

        But Mr Bradford, a back bench Liberal member, I will concede—and thank goodness for that—wants to close it all down. Does he realise that of the total ABC radio audience each week Triple J has half? The audiences of all the rest of the ABC radio stations comprise about 2 million people. Triple J is the other half of the total audience—which, again, is an amazing success.

        The other point about Triple J which I want to mention is that it is not just about passive listening, the putting out of music. It is about promoting young Australian rock-and-roll popular music; it is about developing Australian culture in popular music. I am told that Silverchair, that popular band from Newcastle for young people, first got its break on Triple J—and I have to admit that, as I turn 50 this year, Mr Acting Deputy President, it may be a bit beyond my league.

In any organisation as big as the ABC and with a budget as large as it has, there is no doubt that somewhere in the organisation there will be a manager who is not doing his job absolutely the way he should be. There will be some wastage of money and that should all be looked at. They should always be aiming to improve the management and the structure.

          —Of course. I then find it even more extraordinary, Senator Patterson, that the coalition would put at risk the ABC and its future and such a network as the ABC FM fine music network. The interesting thing is that, when the announcer thanked everybody and in particular thanked the ABC fine music network for making this a national event, the applause from the audience for the ABC was bigger than even for the actual winner. I find that a very interesting indication. I suspect that the bulk of that audience listening in the Sydney Opera House were overwhelmingly coalition supporters like Mrs Bishop; yet, when they had a chance to show their support for the ABC, they applauded long, loud and hard. When the organiser was interviewed later on, he again made the point that the Sydney International Piano Competition could not exist if it were not for the ABC, which has made it an international event.

         These are the programs; these are the cultural things that are under attack by this drastic $55 million a year cut to the ABC budget. It costs $3&amp;half; million to run Triple J across Australia. Even if you did knock that off, you would still need another $52 million savings somewhere else. ABC FM fine music probably costs $4 or $5 million a year to run. They are the savings you are going to find in closing down all of those sorts of programs to get to the total of $55 million.

         The amount of $55 million is more than the total cost that the ABC spends each year on Australian drama. No more Australian drama on ABC television? That would be catastrophic.

        —I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Schacht relating to the ABC. I find it interesting that Senator Schacht is speaking about this today and is indignant about the fact that there have to be cuts to a large range of services and government programs when I think about the waste that occurred when Labor was in government. Sometimes the amounts must have seemed small to the Labor Party, but they added up to the sort of amount that we are now looking
        <break page="2964" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         at taking out of the ABC's budget. I note that Senator Schacht is now leaving the chamber.

       I think of the millions of dollars that were lost in the Midford debacle and the millions that had to be paid out by the public as a result of his ineptitude as a minister. Another example is the $5 million, which I pursued, that was spent in selling the disability reform package. The company was insolvent when it got the contract. I could give example after example of the mismanagement that we endured under the previous Labor government.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We are now being called to account for that. We have a responsibility to the next generation. One of the reasons I came into parliament was that when I was growing up—and Senator Schacht and I are about the same age—the world was my oyster. Whatever I wanted to do I could do. As I got a bit older I saw those opportunities slipping away for young Australians—the sorts of kids who now listen to Triple J. They do not have the same opportunities that many of us in this chamber had when we were growing up.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       This is because we have wasted golden opportunities. The Labor Party wasted quarter after quarter of growth. It took no advantage of that. We have been left with a budget deficit. We have a hole of $8 billion to $10 billion. That is the reason we are discussing this today. No&amp;hyphen;one likes to be involved in looking at programs and deciding where cuts have to be made. Even the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, indicated that it is possible to make adjustments of $4 billion in each of the next two years.

       We admit that the ABC is one of Australia's primary institutions with a very significant and valued role to play in the Australian community.

       For the opposition to come in here and say that we are going to destroy the ABC is absolutely wrong. Belts will have to be tightened. An assessment will have to be made of the various programs. A process has been put in place to do that, and I will discuss

       Before I move on to discuss the cuts that are being put forward, I will quote what Gareth Evans said about cuts to the ABC in 1988 when he was Minister for Transport and Communications. Senator Schacht has not mentioned that the Labor government made cuts to the ABC. Gareth Evans said:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       While there has been some decline in funding for the ABC over the past two Budgets, as compared with the peak year of 1985&amp;hyphen;6 . . . this does not reflect any loss of affection for the ABC or any decision to squeeze it harder than anyone else—the absence of new policy approvals has been a function of the pressure which has been applied universally to government departments and agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have inherited a problem that resulted from the previous Labor government's mismanagement. The words Gareth Evans used in 1988 when outlining cuts to the ABC apply now. He said:

      <para first-indent="16">
       The ABC will receive around $530 million in 1996-97 and $500 million in 1997-98. I have to say that we are taking a $10 million cut here in Parliament House. We do not walk around saying, `Parliament will have to close down because we have taken a $10 million cut.' We have had to tighten our belts, make some savings and adjust to that.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The funding I outlined before—the $530 million in 1996-97 and $500 million in 1997-98—represents a very strong commitment in a time when financial restraint is necessary. It seems extreme to argue that $&amp;half; billion a year in funding for a quality national broadcasting service is destructive. That $&amp;half; billion will not mean that the ABC will be destroyed. It puts paid to the opposition's claims that the cuts will destroy the ABC.

For example, if teachers in tertiary institutions have a particular philosophy, my view is that they should educate the students, give them the various options and give them the skills to choose. To try to inculcate them with your views is not appropriate.

         The government made a commitment to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. Senator Schacht has said that we have not kept that commitment. Despite the pressure to make budget savings—and some areas have been asked to make those savings immediately—we agreed to maintain ABC funding for the remainder of the current triennium, less the generally applied two per cent cut in running costs, which the government clearly signalled in

We have kept our commitment to maintain their funding until the end of that triennium unlike what we have had to do in other areas. That again was not mentioned by Senator Schacht.

If we get it right—and I am sure we will—the ABC should be thinking about how to expand its programs in the future.

         I agree with what Senator Schacht said on that occasion: the government does have to make tough decisions about priorities right across the board in running the country and provide money for many projects which are worth while. We promised to improve the economy and the situation of Australia for all Australians, and that is what we are doing. We are making these cuts not because we want to, not to fix our mistakes, but because we have to, it is economically responsible to do so and, finally—and this is more to the point—to make up for, to correct, the mistakes of Labor's mismanagement. We did not enjoy making the cuts; however, we have to overcome the irresponsibility of the previous Labor government and get Australia back on track.

         I also remind the opposition that, had they been honest about the state of the economy before the election, we could have allowed for it in making our policies in relation to funding for all areas, including the ABC. In light of the fact that it is budget week, I remind the chamber of the deception of the previous government in hiding the immense size of the budget deficit until after we came into power. In the May budget last year, in 1995, Labor announced a surplus. I can remember the headlines. There was euphoria about a surplus of $720 million for 1995-96 and a headline surplus of $3.4 billion for 1996-97. What a joke! Do you remember that, Senator Herron and Senator Panizza—a $720 million surplus? That is what they told us and ran out and told the press.

If those opposite had been on a spaceship orbiting the earth, they would have been off to Mars. That is a popular place to go at the moment, and that is where this opposition ought to have gone a long time ago, because they put Australia so far off course it did not matter. We were right off course. They had a bit of a rejig, they got themselves back in line and they told the public and the financial markets that, oops, they made a mistake, that we did not have a $720 million surplus—only a $115 million surplus. So we went from having a $720 million surplus to a $115 million surplus. They rejigged it to get back on course a bit.

         From this point on, when the coalition realised things were going from bad to worse, we called on Labor to release updated Treasury estimates of the budget position. Labor maintained that this could not be done, arguing that the figures were not available, still leaving us to believe we were going to be in surplus. We had some doubts about that, but what did Mr Keating say? `Trust me.' Unfortunately, the Australian public did for far too long, but then they saw the light. The figures were not available right up until the week of the election. That argument was used right throughout the campaign.

On 12 March, the Treasurer, Peter Costello, released the revised Treasury budget estimates for 1995-96. These revised estimates revealed that the budget for 1995 had moved from a surplus of $720 million to—we were on Mars—a deficit of $280 million. How on earth can you have a budget surplus of $720 million and then in February—not even the end of the year—be $280 million out of kilter?

People out there in the community understand that our paying $10 billion a year is making no dent at all on what we owe.

          It has been 15 years since the last independent review of the ABC—the Dix review. The broadcasting and communications environment has changed immeasurably. Not only is there greater competition amongst broadcasters but there has been a significant increase in the nature and availability of other forms of audiovisual entertainment.

          . . . nobody has suggested that the Government and Parliament should not have a decisive role in defining the ABC's role and objectives, as set out in its legislative Charter. And however much we might all hope that resources and funding problems could solve themselves without having to be the subject of any kind of political involvement, the reality is that the Government and Parliament will go on being involved, year by year, in decisions that are obviously crucial for the ABC's future, and in particular its capacity to translate those Charter objectives into real&amp;hyphen;world activity.

          That is exactly what the coalition is doing in setting up this review: looking at the roles and objectives of the ABC. So, in conjunction with having to address the budget constraints that are placed upon us, what we are doing in a responsible way is putting into place a review—with enormously wide consultation input from the community—of the various roles of the ABC, the various groups to whom the ABC appeals and the groups of people it reaches to ensure that with a budget of approximately half a billion dollars the very best service is given to the Australian community through the services of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

        —Senator Patterson has just enlightened us with some quotes from former senator Gareth Evans. I would like to requote something that has already been said. It is a quote from the current minister, Senator Alston, from election night when he was on the ABC election coverage. Jim Middleton of the press gallery asked him, `Do you maintain your commitment to the ABC continuing real funding over the life of this parliament—that is, three years?' The answer from Senator Alston: `Absolutely.' Then Mr Middleton came back with: `What if you find out that the budget is much worse?' And the answer was: `John Howard has made it clear we are honouring all our commitments.'

       What this government is doing with the ABC funding is taking away the independence of the public broadcaster through funding cuts of this magnitude. Have no doubt about it: they are enormous. When Senator Patterson said that the Labor Party is not innocent in this, she was dead right. The last government cut down on the ABC too.

       It is all very well to say that we have to trim off more fat. There is no more fat on the ABC; there just is not. We are trimming muscle, skin and bone; we are starting the amputations—it is pretty ugly. So here we have the ABC now being told, `Okay, carry out your own execution.

       I will just read from the budget statements. On page 3.131 of budget paper No. 1, there are a few reductions. The paper says `Cessation of extension of the "Unearthed" new music project', so `Unearthed', which, as Senator Schacht told us, is the project which goes around Australia and finds new youth music and is very successful, has gone. `Cessation of extension of Radio Triple J coverage': so if you cannot get Triple J now, just forget it; you are not going to get it in the future. This is despite the fact that Triple J is extraordinarily popular with young people. If those young people do not vote already, they will do so very soon. Just keep that in mind. Radio Triple J has an Internet site: let me say that it had an Internet site up until this budget. That has gone too. So the ABC is being told a few of its own execution points, but it is not being told all of them.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       On page 3.132 you see: `Reduced Budget Funding for the ABC.'

This government is saying to the ABC, `You be your own executioner. You chop off a leg or an arm, or maybe a couple. You decide which ones; it is not our fault. And when it comes to the next election we will blame you for it.'

        The government is reducing independent funding for an independent broadcaster and that of course simultaneously increases the power of already powerful media barons that we have in this country, because they own almost all of the rest. So we have one large independent media body which has an enormous diversity of interests inside it. And there probably is a bit of bias here and a bit of bias there: a bit of bias for the ALP on this side and the Liberal Party on that side; and the Nationals here and the Democrats there—goodness knows who else.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point about the ABC is that that is all allowed to exist inside the one organisation and there are very few people who can order anybody in the ABC to do anything in an editorial sense, and they do not do it; they would not get away with it. If somebody came to the people on
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Four Corners

        would be about somebody coming to tell them not to run the story because somebody did not like it. That is the way it works on the ABC. That is why bias is such a silly thing to say about it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With the level of concentration of media ownership in Australia, it has really dire consequences and it is absolutely stupid and short&amp;hyphen;sighted to cut down independent funding to an independent broadcaster because a government that increases the power of media barons, which is what it does if it does that, increases that power over itself. You are giving people power over yourself. Does the government really believe that media barons are going to be any more favourable to it compared with the so&amp;hyphen;called political bias that it believes it is subjected to by the ABC? We all believe we are subjected to bias. In certain circumstances, we all are. I could name a couple of programs I really did not like that I thought were biased against me. Maybe they were but there were a lot of other programs that I did not think that about, that I thought were absolutely fair and reasonable. And that will happen with everybody and every party. I can name you whole newspapers that I think

        We will go back to the motion of Senator Schacht. Let me reiterate what the coalition said in its policy statement, in Better Communications. Let me recommend to coalition members and particularly to Senator Alston that he reads his own policy document, because it is a very good one and there are a lot of policies in there that I think changed people's minds when they were deciding how to vote. I will just read out a few things:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Coalition will maintain the existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC and SBS, and retain triennial funding.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It supports the ongoing extension of Triple J into regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, according to budget statement No. 1, it has ceased the ongoing extension of Triple J into regional Australia. What a pity. Continuing:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will ensure Australia Television has a long term future in the Asia Pacific region.

        It will fund the ABC and SBS directly for its transmission costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        There's another interesting one. The budget for the National Transmission Authority has been cut by $28 million because its functions have been given to the ABC. So the government is not spending $28 million to fund the NTA. But guess what? It is not giving that $28 million that the NTA actually costs to the ABC to carry that out. The ABC will have to find that somewhere too.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the ABC's funding will not drop by just that $55 million over the next three years. Its funding will not go down by the ridiculously called efficiency dividend—at which point does it become inefficient when you are down to a zero budget? Its funding has not just been chopped by that. It has also been chopped by that $28 million that it will have to find somewhere if it is to carry out its own transmission costs which the coalition promised in its election document to fund directly. Back to the election promises:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will provide $6 million for the captioning of ABC and SBS news services.

       </para>
       <para>
        Guess what? It did provide money for the captioning of ABC and SBS news services. I do not have time to read through this to see whether it was $6 million; but there was some money for that in the budget. There you go, there is one promise that may have been kept to a certain extent. I am very pleased to see it. Continuing:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Coalition is committed to maintaining the ABC's comprehensive radio network.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it is committed to maintaining it, I do not know how it is going to do it with $55 million less from its running budget this year and next year, another $55 million the year after and another $55 million the year after that. Continuing:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio.
       </para>
       <para>
        There's a good one. I heard recently that that is open for negotiation as well. It might be open for negotiation through the House of Representatives, but I certainly hope that it is not open for negotiation through the Senate—it certainly will not be through me.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These are strong policies and they are good policies. I am absolutely positive that they caused voters to decide to vote for the coalition. What a mistake that was. If there is a double dissolution, I can tell you people will not forget that. The coalition will have to keep going the full three years for people to forget what happened here. People love the ABC with an absolute passion. You would be surprised how much they love the ABC.

        That view is shared by most Australians.

Eighty&amp;hyphen;five per cent is a powerful majority supporting the work of the ABC. It includes regular and occasional ABC audiences as well as those who never utilise the services of the national broadcaster.

        I was deputy chair of the 1995 Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations which exhaustively examined the ABC inside and out. We saw the ABC—and this is in the report—as `sound and providing an independent, diverse and vibrant service'. What is more, looking at our recommendations in that report, the ABC have rectified all the problems that the committee identified except for the one in which they cannot help themselves—adequate government funding. In that report we identified that government funding of the ABC was not adequate. Senator Alston ought to remember that because he chaired that committee which found that government funding of the ABC was not adequate. It will be a lot less adequate after this budget.

        The ABC has had more than its fair share of cuts. There is the two per cent efficiency cuts, the loss of a further $10 million and associated staff reductions.

         We heard from both former speakers about Mr Mansfield's inquiry which seeks to `redefine the role of the ABC', which can probably be read as `seek to make amendments to the ABC charter'. I hope it is not the case that this inquiry has been set up to guarantee certain outcomes. Having met Mr Mansfield, I must say—I talked to him for about an hour or so—I find him an honour able man, and I would be very surprised if that was the case. I do not believe he has been told to come out with a certain outcome. I believe the outcome he comes out with, within the terms of reference, will be all his own work. I hope that is the case; I think it probably will be.

        But we can see a couple of problems: the terms of reference are narrow and there are no public hearings, so the inquiry will not hear in a public manner from supporters of the ABC. I can tell the government now that there are far more supporters of the ABC than there are detractors.

        I hope that it does not happen but it could be the case that an apparent lack of support for the ABC might then be defined as an argument against the ABC—and the only apparent lack of support would be because submissions are not public because there are no public hearings. So that might lead to the desired conclusion, in the government's mind, that the community wants to downgrade the ABC and divest it of some of its programs, some of its production and some of its services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I can tell the government now that the community does not want the ABC downgraded. To show this we can look at the Friends of the ABC rallies all around Australia. They were testimony to that. I went to the Sydney rally in the Domain. It was massive. I got there just before the entertainment started. It was a festival atmosphere but the people I was talking to were really worried. I must say that most of the people I saw and talked to I think were probably coalition voters.

         The ABC was the forum that began the huge growth in lifestyle programs. The ABC is our greatest source of innovation and independent broadcasting. It has a significant impact on public and informed opinion. It creates debate and discussion and, most importantly, is not manipulated by anybody. Australia needs every single program and every single production on every single ABC network.

          about is the independence of the ABC and the editorial integrity of the ABC.

         The range of ages of people who were there, all of them ABC supporters, and the range of backgrounds of the people who came up and talked to me later were enormous—from young families to teenagers, then all the way up to what used to be known as the blue rinse set. There was a very large contingent of every single age group. That is something we all have to remember when we are considering what we are doing to the ABC. I honestly believe that the government has made an enormous mistake targeting the ABC. And the ABC has been targeted. It is no use saying, `Yes, we all have to bear the pain.' We do all have to bear the pain but why should the ABC have to bear more pain than anybody else? There must be a reason for it.

          find other jobs if they can, if these cuts go ahead—and there are so many cuts across the board in Australia that it is going to be very difficult—and particularly people who listen to the ABC now. If that is 85 per cent of the population this coalition government is in big trouble. This is something people will not forget. People love the ABC.

We take away what we value most about the ABC and what we need most in this country for it to give us: an independent voice in the media. The incredible stupidity of doing such a thing is almost beyond me. If the government persists in doing this, it will rue the day they decided on that course. That cabinet meeting where it was decided that the cuts to the ABC would be vicious and destructive, and would finally finish off the ABC and make sure it did not do nasty things to this government, will go down as a really black day in the annals of this government. If this government continues these funding cuts, it will regret that at the next election and it will keep regretting it until the ABC is put back together again.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Bills are essentially the same as ones introduced and referred to the JCPA in the 37th Parliament. Unfortunately, that Committee did not have an opportunity to complete its inquiry before the general election was called. However, the evidence it gathered was not wasted and has been considered by the current Committee.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The fact that these Bills rewrite existing law does not diminish their importance. There are few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than the tax laws. It should be a matter of considerable concern, therefore, that the most significant of these laws—the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936—is in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. This problem is recognised by all—from taxpayers to the Tax Office.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Act is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is over 5,000 pages long, cannot be easily read or understood, no longer has a recognisable structure and has had amendment piled on top of amendment over the last 60 years. The costs to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand and comply with this law ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually. Any reduction in these compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant microeconomic reform.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The defects of the 1936 Act have been known for some time. Indeed, in 1993 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in Report 326—a landmark report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the Australian Tax Office recommended that the tax law be simplified.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The then Government accepted that recommendation and the Tax Law Improvement Project was born. The purpose of this project—known by all as TLIP—was, and is, to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law. The Bills before the House essentially provide a new framework for the tax law, into which future packages of rewritten law will be slotted.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         On the whole, the new legislation has been well received by the tax and accounting professions, industry groups and academics. It became clear to the
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Committee during the inquiry that any improvements to the Bills would represent fine tuning rather than a major rethink. This stands as testimony to the efforts of the Bills' drafters and TLIP's extensive and comprehensive consultative and review.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While there may be general support for the contents of the legislation, there is certainly not support for its scheduled commencement date. As the Bills stand, they are due to have effect from 1 July 1996, clearly making them retrospective in application. The Committee acknowledges arguments that, in practical terms, the 1996 Bills are not retrospective
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          because they are only rewriting existing law and not creating `new' law.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, it is unacceptable to the Committee that taxation legislation of any form be retrospective. For this reason, the Committee has strongly recommended that the commencement date for the legislation be changed to the first of July after enactment. Some argued that the commencement date should simply be moved back a year—to 1 July 1997. The Committee disagrees, for there is a risk that the legislation will not be passed by that date and become retrospective again. The Committee's recommendation removes any possibility of this occurring. I might add that this recommendation is consistent with a similar recommendation made last year by the JCPA when it reviewed TLIP's progress up until then.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committer has made a number of other recommendations associated with the phase-in of the new Bills. The Committee has recommended that these and subsequent Bills by TLIP commence progressively. This will minimise the impact that the transfer to the new law will have on taxpayers. The Committee also believes that the Australian Taxation Office needs to make a public commitment to rewriting promptly Public Rulings that will be affected by the new legislation. Similarly, the ATO will need to ensure that any technical errors or unintended consequences are addressed speedily.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In addition, the Committee has recommended amendments to various clauses that reflect the concerns of tax professionals and industry groups. In fact, the process of amending the Bills before us still goes on. The Committee has recently been briefed on proposed government amendments to the Bills concerning company tracing provisions. However, there was not time to consider these in any detail. TLIP has also recently advised the Committee that it will be correcting several technical errors in the Bills. The Committee looks forward to seeing these changes made.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         One of the main objectives of the rewrite process is to reduce the long term cost of tax compliance. In the Committee's view, it is unlikely that compliance costs will come down significantly until such time as the underlying complexities of tax policy are addressed.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is a clear sense of frustration that unworkable sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are being perpetuated in the 1996 Bill. Unfortunately, addressing these concerns is beyond TLIP's current mandate. In practice, however, TLIP's mandate could not have been expanded without the rewrite process becoming bogged down in policy debates. Having said that, the Committee acknowledges that there needs to be more substantial simplification of the law.
         <break page="2976" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There remains, therefore, the continuing need to address the `small p' policy complexities being highlighted by TLIP. The success of the Committee's review process suggests that a parliamentary committee may be an appropriate forum to examine these issues. This is partly in response to a perception that the Treasury is unresponsive to concerns about these matters when they are raised.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Therefore, the Committee has recommended that the Government fund a parliamentary committee to review the unworkably complex sections of tax law. This could be performed by the JCPA, a Joint Standing Revenue Committee or a Joint Select Committee.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In fact, the Committee believes that tax simplification requires more than just a rewrite or a tidying up of policy complexities. What is ultimately required is a wide ranging review of tax policy at the Federal and state level. Only after such a review can compliance costs truly come down. The Committee urges the Government to consider this.

         On a final note, the Committee would like to thank all those individuals and organisations which have provided written and oral evidence and advice to both the previous and current JCPA. Some witnesses have given evidence twice to assist the new Committee come up to speed on the issues. We also thank the various officials from TLIP who have briefed the JCPA on a number of occasions.

         On behalf of the Government I thank the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its Report No. 345 and express our appreciation for the time and commitment which Committee members, and their

         The Joint Committee has taken a continuing interest in the rewriting of the income tax law. In November 1993, the Committee tabled its Report 326 An Assessment of Tax which recommended, among other things, the setting up of a broadly-based Task Force to rewrite the income tax law. The Tax Law Improvement Project was announced in the following month.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In November last year, the Committee tabled its Report 343 Tax Law Improvement: A Watching Brief in which it endorsed both the consultative way in which the project was proceeding and the intention to deliver the rewritten law progressively.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 and 2 related Bills, which are the subject of the Committee's latest report, are the first major instalment of the rewrite of the income tax law.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government is pleased that the Committee endorses the Bills and reaffirms its support for the progressive delivery of the new law.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Rewriting the income tax law so that it can be more easily understood has important micro-economic benefits for all Australians. Clearer law is inherently fairer. The Government wants to secure these benefits as quickly as possible.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government originally intended that the new law would apply for the current income year, as earlier versions of the Bills have been public since they were first introduced in November 1995. However, we recognise that the proroguing of Parliament in February created some uncertainty in the community about the reintroduction of the Bills and there has been unavoidable delay to the Parliament's consideration of them.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I note that the Committee has recommended that the commencement of the Bills be postponed until the income year following Royal Assent. The Government believes that a definite start date needs to be conveyed to the community, so that it can plan with certainty.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In light of this, the Government has decided to defer the commencement of the new law until the 1997-98 income year (which for most taxpayers will start on 1 July 1997). This decision will give everyone more time to ensure a smooth transition to the new law.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee also recommends a small number of minor technical changes to the Bills, none of which involves any change in policy. I can inform the Senate that the Government accepts those recommendations and will make those changes.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Rewriting the law will also require the Commissioner of Taxation to update his public rulings to
         <break page="2977" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          reflect any changes in the new law. Taxpayers need certainty and are looking for an assurance that rulings obtained under the old law will not lapse simply because there has been a change to simpler language. I note with approval that the Committee endorses the Commissioner's proposal to negotiate, with the tax professions, a suitable process and timetable for rewriting affected rulings.

         In a task as large as that embraced by this project there is always a danger that inadvertent errors may occur. I recognise the concern that any such errors be swiftly corrected. Again, I note with approval that the Committee endorses the process recently negotiated by the Commissioner and the tax professions for identifying and dealing with such errors.

         Mr President, I am also taking this opportunity to announce a major improvement to the new law which will overcome a longstanding practical problem. The Government has decided to amend the Bills in the House of Representatives to introduce new, streamlined arrangements for allowing public listed companies to trace who beneficially owns their shares.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Companies that maintain continuity of their beneficial ownership may carry forward unused deductions, as tax losses. However, the existing processes for identifying ownership have been notoriously difficult and time consuming because of the varying ways in which shares can be held. In rewriting the losses provisions, the project members and corporate representatives have worked hard to resolve these difficulties. The new arrangements, which will improve certainty and bring about significant compliance cost savings, demonstrate the Government's commitment to supporting new ways to reduce excessive compliance cost burdens on business.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         These amendments address longstanding concerns of the corporate sector. The amendments were referred to the Committee, but the Committee was not able to consider the proposals before completing its report.

         Finally, Mr President, I repeat my thanks to the Committee for its report and look forward to a speedy passage of the Bills by the Senate when they arrive in this place.

We are a nation of greater integrity than the shattered election pledges this budget contains—pledges that were given so forcefully and in such an unqualified manner by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) only a few months ago.

        This is a budget of betrayal—not just a betrayal of election promises but a betrayal of the Australian promise itself, the promise of Australia working always towards a more fair, more just, more inclusive and united society.
        <break page="2978" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         The message of this budget is: don't be sick; don't be old; don't expect to go to university; if you are unemployed, too bad; and, if you are young and unemployed, forget it.

        At the last election John Howard told Australians that they could trust him. He told Australians that, whatever budget numbers he inherited, all promises would be delivered. This budget breaches that trust. There is a long list of broken promises—promises made to mainstream Australia and made to battlers, promises made to students, promises made to the elderly, promises made to state and local governments. No contrived dribbling out of bad news for mainstream Australia and the battlers prior to the budget's presentation can hide that fact.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new morality of this government is that there are core promises and non&amp;hyphen;core promises, although no such distinction was made before the election. Core honesty; non&amp;hyphen;core honesty. Would you take that from your kids? John Howard inherited an economy that he said `. . . was better than good'. Indeed he did. It was an economy with inflation that had been averaging two and a half per cent; an economy that had been growing by four per cent a year; an economy which created 700,000 jobs over the last three years; an economy which saw our exports, particularly those of manufactured goods, grow and diversify. He inherited an economy with a very small public sector by international standards and a budget outcome better than any in the industrialised world, bar a couple.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Compare all that with the economy we inherited back when we came into government. The unemployment and inflation rates were over 10 per cent and there was a $25 billion budget deficit in today's dollars. This government placed a dead hand on the economy when they took office. A core reality of this budget is that the dead hand is still there, so much so that Treasury officials observed in the budget papers that `. . . possible confidence effects, while significant, do not fully offset the direct short&amp;hyphen;term effects of the measures resulting in a small net contractionary impact on activity in 1996-97'. That is Treasury&amp;hyphen;speak for saying that this budget not
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         only does nothing for growth, but it will reduce it.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Instead of undermining growth, the government should be promoting it. With more growth the budget could be restored to balance without the need for savage cuts to valuable public programs. Higher growths destroys the case for savage budget cuts. By keeping growth up, by aiming for sustainable growth at the four per cent we averaged during our last four years in office, we also bring unemployment down. Unemployment, not the budget, is the No. 1 problem facing Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Treasurer says that saving is our No. 1 problem. We have no argument that Australia has long had a saving problem; we did more to solve it, with the introduction of our national superannuation scheme, than any previous government. And now Mr Costello places a huge question mark over that achievement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have no argument that Australia's longer term economic interests are well served by restoring the budget to balance. That is why we, alone among post&amp;hyphen;war Australian governments, delivered successive surpluses in the late 1980s. But we say that the best way to restore the budget to balance is through a moderate program of budget cuts over the whole life of this parliament which do not harm valuable public programs, which do not harm growth, and which provide hope rather than despair for the jobless.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Costello makes a virtue of the fact that this budget holds growth back so that in three years time, and with massive budget cuts, the surplus will be $1 billion. It suits the government to have low growth because low growth makes it appear as though bigger cuts are needed to restore the budget to balance. But, with average growth close to four per cent, it would be possible to achieve balance without savage budget cuts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the government's own admission, these cuts are not necessary to reduce the debt ratio: that would have happened anyway. And so far as reduction of the current account deficit is concerned, that is hardly going to change next year. These cuts are not being made for genuine reasons of economic necessity; they
        <break page="2979" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para first-indent="16">
        Significantly, the burdens in this budget are not equally shared. It is a wrong headed interpretation of this budget that it soaks the rich as well as the poor. Mr Costello has leaped to the challenge of the Commissioner of Taxation to collect $800 million of avoided tax by the wealthiest Australians with a slash of his feather duster—$100 million and a bit of a look. `Hopefully it will be collected voluntarily,' he said. `And have a bit of health insurance while you're at it,' he invites wealthy Australians, `or we'll give you a snip of a levy.' The burden is borne by the battlers, the job seekers, the students, the elderly and middle income Australia.

        He offers tax cuts. For a dual income family earning up to a total of $79,000, these tax cuts amount to $3.85 a week for each dependent child. But families want to educate their children. They want to use child care. They are worried about their kids getting an opportunity to work. They want to know that, if their elderly parents need a nursing home bed, they will be able to afford it. They use public hospitals. They carry the burden of increased taxes and charges when the states are slashed.

        A generation of women has grown up with successive Labor governments, with new expectations and hopes for the future: meaningful employment and ongoing careers—a totally different world from their mothers and grandmothers. The female labour force is over 50 per cent larger today than it was in 1983. The Prime Minister shows no sign of recognising this fact. But this fact is why successive Labor governments made available affordable, high quality child care. This recognised that many families do not have the means to allow one partner to leave the work force to care for their children, even if they would like to.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the last election the Liberals were at pains to promise that this quality child care—affordable and available on an equal basis to all Australians—would remain. But what do we find in the budget? We find a range of mean&amp;hyphen;spirited measures which will make child
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         care more expensive for all families. For those using community based care, it will be $14 per child per week more. And this won't be all: $500 million will be taken out of child care and it will be the parents who will have to make up the difference.

        Families contain people of all ages. What does this budget do for families of older Australians? We see a proposal which may force older Australians who need nursing home care, or their children, to find around $26,000 in entry fees. Nursing home residents also face a new fee of up to $34 per day, or $12,000 per year, depending on their income.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Howard says that children should pay for their elderly parents to have a nursing home bed. This is yet another way this government is getting families to pay more. But it gets worse. Many older families, frail but still living in their own homes, are dependent on services such as Meals on Wheels, provided by the home and community care, HACC, program. These families are to be stung by greatly increased user fees. That is code for increased charges for Meals on Wheels and the like. The Prime Minister gives with one hand and takes away even more with the other, like a man that comes up to you in the street and says, `Here's $5, now give me $7.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the health area, Mr Howard promised to `retain Medicare in its entirety' and to provide a net increase in health funding. Instead, we have indirect cuts through reductions in the financial assistance grants to the states and direct cuts to hospital funding grants. The combined effect is a cut of around $800 million dollars over four years.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The nastiest, if not the largest, of the government's health cuts is the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. This program spends around $110 million a year and is exclusively directed at the provision of basic and emergency dental services to health card holders. The abolition of this program will reproduce the two&amp;hyphen; to three&amp;hyphen;year waiting lists which prompted the Commonwealth's intervention and which the program has substantially reduced. The budget speech contains the following explanation for the cuts:

         As if your teeth can be fixed once, and that's the only time you need a dentist! Another of the coalition's major betrayals in health is big increases in the costs of prescription drugs. For a family with three children—and we all know how often they get sick at once—at $20 a script, that is $60 for a family for just one visit to the chemist. And the increased pharmaceutical charge for pensioners breaks Mr Howard's explicit promise to `maintain the real value of all pension benefits and other entitlements for low income earners'.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Above all, there is the threat to bulk&amp;hyphen;billing. The government says that it will maintain it, yet eliminates the CPI adjustment to doctors fees. Bulk&amp;hyphen;billing is voluntary. Hundreds of doctors will stop bulk&amp;hyphen;billing with this change. With another budget next May, you just have to wonder how many more changes and how many fee increases there are going to be.

         We do not equally share the burden of this budget. Those who live in regional Australia carry it disproportionately. Regional communities have already been hit by a big round of cuts. Many centres have lost their CES and their tax offices. Now they will lose their local Medicare offices and they will pay more for the services that continue.

         During the recent election, the coalition asserted that regional communities were `Australia's forgotten people' and promised to `revitalise regional Australia'. Betrayal has been as swift as it is comprehensive. This government has abandoned regional Australia. In common with its approach to other  issues of national importance, it has abandoned its responsibilities to lead, to coordinate and to cooperate with the people of Australia's heartland. When it comes to regional Australia, this coalition has quickly become a government in exile. They are absentee landlords with a big city focus—a government of capital city lawyers from leafy suburbs.

The first is that it represents a calculated breach of faith with those Australians who elected the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the coalition into government. The second is that it is built on the backs of the unemployed. The third—and possibly most important theme—is that it heralds a significant shift from the public to the private. It signals a move away from the notion of community responsibility and from the idea that governments have a role to play in ensuring that all Australians—irrespective of their wealth—have access to a good standard of health care, to quality and affordable education and to the opportunity to find and keep a job.

But the political architecture of this budget goes back a lot further than the past few weeks. It is, after all, the culmination of a long tactical march which began this time last year. It started with John Howard's reply to last year's budget where he said:

        However, by the time the election rolled around, John Howard was saying he had to accept the government's figures. He went on to make billions of dollars worth of election promises on that basis.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When asked by journalists during the campaign what he would do if the deficit was higher than the government's figures, John Howard's response was clear and unequivocal. At the National Press Club on 28 February, he was asked:

This is what John Howard had to say at the National Press Club three days before the election:

        The Democrats share that concern about disillusionment and division. We share that desire to see a re&amp;hyphen;establishment of trust between Australians and their leaders. We apply the same test to whomever is in government. Restoring that trust requires breaking out of the cynical and dishonest election ritual where the major parties outbid each other to make unaffordable promises, then miraculously stumble across the true budget deficit a few days after they take office and use this discovery to break promises they knew they were not going to keep in the first place.

        We welcome the Charter of Budget Honesty, but the problem for John Howard is that many Australians who voted for him truly believed him when he said he was not playing this particular game. This budget shows that he was playing that game—$6 billion worth of promises kept; $12 billion worth of promises broken. That represents a massive breach of trust—something John Howard and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, are now trying to disguise by telling us they are only obliged to meet core commitments. Even that notion has been downgraded with John Howard yesterday on

        John Howard is also overlooking one important other consideration and that is this: alongside the written promises given during the campaign, there was one largely unspoken understanding.

There was an understanding that these two big&amp;hyphen;ticket promises would actually be worth something: that they would not be

In the June quarter, our economy scarcely grew at all. It grew by just one&amp;hyphen;tenth of one per cent—the most sluggish growth outcome since 1992. Employment growth has been virtually non&amp;hyphen;existent for 12 months. Business confidence is down. Consumers and families are worried. Yet, in this sluggish and tense environment, the coalition has consciously chosen to pull $7 billion out of the economy.

We make no secret of our dissatisfaction with Peter Costello's undisciplined and indiscriminate Scissorhands approach to deficit reduction—whirling through the expenditure side of the ledger, Scissorhands waving away, snipping and slashing at whatever wanders into his path. The result is a lopsided attempt at deficit reduction which well and truly earns the tag of `death by a thousand cuts'. The irony is that, as the details start to emerge, it may just be the government which ends up slowly bleeding to death.

        Morgan Gallup poll reported that 52 per cent of Australians would not have voted for the coalition on election day if they had known about its real plans. They are certainly not going to be any happier once they realise the true impact of the budget on their lives and pockets. So, while the general

         initial reaction might look favourable, the fact is that you cannot suppress bad news forever. People are going to be pretty angry when they figure out that the value of the family tax package has been almost totally undermined by cuts to education, to unemployment assistance, to child care and to public health services.

        I can say today that the Democrats will support the family tax package. We recognise that Australians clearly expected John Howard to deliver on that. I do not know that they expected him to deliver on that at the expense of support to the unemployed, higher education or Medicare. They did expect to get more money in their pockets. However, we are not happy about the loose targeting of the rebate. We warn the government that, unless it tightens up the income test, it will be paying out the rebate to some very well&amp;hyphen;off families.

        The other big sweetener, the private health insurance rebate, is a somewhat different matter. Not only is it paid for by massive cuts in health care but it also may threaten Australia's ability to keep a reasonable rein on our overall health care costs. There are a number of problems with the private health insurance rebate—not the least of them being how it stacks up alongside the other changes to Medicare. I can say at this stage that we are favourably disposed towards an increase in the Medicare levy for higher income earners, irrespective of whether or not they have private health insurance.

This is one of those offsets which typify the `public to private' flavour of this budget. It will also result in parents of children in the state school system paying more in fees and charges for what should be basic educational entitlements.

The Democrats make no apologies for our ongoing commitment not to block supply. We do not believe in denying the government—and, through it, the public sector—the money it needs to run the country.

        The real game with budgets is often very diffuse. In fact, around 70 per cent of appropriations are currently automatic appropriations, so many of the decisions that are taken in relation to spending are never in any way in the budget appropriation bills. While budget decisions are important and have real impacts on real people, a lot of the activity at budget time is theatre—a chance to create images. The budget books, I have noticed, are often written with the theatre of the period in mind.

        One thing to note is that there are a lot of rubbery figures, especially in terms of forward projections. There are large variations—a billion up or down as a result of a variation in a single percentage point in prices. Treasurers like to dress up their budgets using these and a few other devices. One device we have noticed in the past is that the presentation of actual figures of the previous year allowed an appearance of a substantial increase in funding where the actuality was that the prior year's budget was not entirely spent. In some environmental areas, we noted in the past that a budget decrease appeared and was announced as an increase.

The next year the same pattern would follow. Basically the declining forward projections allowed the forward outlays to be lower, bringing future budgets well back into the black, while the previous decline allowed a small increase to look like a substantial new initiative.

It simply was not realistic, at a time of high unemployment, to axe your entire labour market programs—and we said so, but we were the only ones saying so. Sure enough, 1994 included the Working Nation plan. The thing to recognise is that much of this was the simple replacement of programs that had fallen off the budget and which had been called a deficit reduction plan.

Quite frankly, the way to gain more profit is to cream off the employable and get the others off the books. That is going to be made a little easier by the coalition. It is going to be made easier because you tighten up the rules, make it harder for people to find enough money to pay their rent, take money from them if they happen to share a house with another person to survive; and then, if you find them breaking the rules, throw them off the system.

These cuts are also greater on a per capita basis. Reducing discretionary funds for universities represents a cut of $43 million per year. Cuts to higher education operating grants are $22.4 million, rising to $266 million, and targeting of Austudy will cut $63 million per year. Raising the age of independence for Austudy is a cut of $28 million, rising to $78 million, and reducing maximum Austudy rent assistance to students in shared houses is a cut of $0.4 million. I should mention that in Austudy we heard last year about student rent related poverty. I think that fell on deaf ears, so poverty will be the in thing for people who are game enough to go into tertiary education. I think fewer of our able students will do that.

        Who are the winners? Well, almost no&amp;hyphen;one. There are slight benefits and no pain for those with children in private schools. The losers? The nation is the loser through reduction in education and industry will lose through reduction in the skilled work force. But industry will put the pressure on the government and the government will say, `Okay, let us get in some skilled migrants. Let us adjust the supply curve of the labour market because we do not want industry to have to pay too much for skilled workers.'

        Who else loses? The economy loses through a reduction in people who might provide the basis for a clever country.

Families who assist their children at school will lose as a result of increased costs and a decreased ability of university aged children to be independent. The vulnerable lose: migrants and teenage secondary school students who are homeless.

It was not explained that the new internationalism meant that Australian industries were no longer Australian industries and that there was almost a free rein on speculative investment whereby people could come in and do a bit of asset stripping and people would lose their jobs and production could go overseas.

        For example, there is the increased activity test on the jobsearch allowance and newstart.

         Somehow there must be a goal for benefiting the community. What were the long&amp;hyphen;term goals for benefiting the community? Before the election the government said it would increase employment opportunities for young people. Frankly, this budget will do the exact opposite. So what was the goal of this budget if it was simply to reduce the deficit? Affordable tax cuts have caused much of the deficit. Basically, when you cut tax and you cannot afford to do so, you get into a deficit.

         Instead of looking at the tax system and wondering how you can increase the revenue and make the tax system more fair again, the only goal of this budget is cutting programs and expenditure and cutting from the most vulnerable in our society.

         Can this be justified only by cutting? A number of economists of highstanding in Australia do not believe so. But what are the choices? If we do not have enough money in the government coffers for the programs we need to provide in a decent, fair society then we look, amongst other things, at revenue measures. We look at whether our tax system is fair and, if not, how we can increase that fairness. We look at revenue measures which will redress the growing gap between rich and poor which the coalition mentioned again and again during the last parliament. That is what the Greens (WA) will be working towards—not letting this government off the hook; not letting them pretend in any way, shape or form that they have given any gift whatsoever to this nation by way of this budget. We will not let them forget that there are options they chose not to take, that they used this budget as a ruse and that we do not now or ever accept they should make the sole goal of their budget pleasing the money speculators of this world.

One is the retirement of Mr Alan Platt and I also want to say a few words about the very ugly demonstration that occurred outside this place earlier this week.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, I will deal with what for some people is the good news; that is, the retirement of Alan Platt. The President paid tribute to Alan yesterday morning here in the chamber and, in paying tribute to his service to the Senate and the parliament, she mentioned that Alan had been awarded the prestigious meritorious service medallion and certificate from the Senate. I would have thought that the work that Alan has done for this chamber deserved at least a trip to Government House. I know lots of others who have made the trip to Government House for a heck of a lot less than the work Alan has done in this place. I join with the President and many others who have paid tribute to him and wish him and his family all the very best in his retirement. This is the last night that he will serve the Senate while it is sitting.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         But he is not alone in departing this place. From the list of the scores of attendants who service us and this chamber, Natalie Campbell, an attendant, will also be leaving the services of the Senate next Monday as will Victor Amsteins, together with Terry Widdi combe, Anna Machado and Brian Agnew—six people who have with dedication, cheerfulness and faithfulness served us and who will depart from their permanent duties as attendants who service this place.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is sad because I think each and every senator would know each of the individuals who will not be around when we return in September. We will miss them but I guess we won't know we are missing most of them until we don't see them around any more. These are six human beings, six individuals, out of the tens of thousands of people in the Public Service of this country who will no longer be in jobs because of the actions of the current government in Canberra, many as a direct result of decisions announced in this place and the other place on Tuesday night and as a result of some of the earlier announcements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is all very fine to talk about a thousand going from that department and another thousand from a different department, and adding up the numbers and saying, `Isn't it dreadful; it's 15,000, now it's 20,000 or 30,000.' Quite often, even some of us on this side of the chamber forget that the thousands of people we are talking about are human beings, workers, people who have families who are dependent on the income that is gained from the services rendered in doing the job for us.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Certain decisions have been made in the Department of the Senate that have led to the retirement of Alan Platt and his colleagues. We wish Alan well in retirement. He is probably going on to better things but for lots of others of those thousands of people there will be no enjoyment. For the others sitting out there in the Public Service now who don't know whether that fateful telephone call will come tomorrow we should have some empathy—we, above all, who as politicians generally do not have certainty in our occupations and our lives.

         It should be a joyous occasion for Alan. He certainly will be missed. I hope the local politicians, not least the President of the Senate and also my colleague who is in the chamber and who will be speaking a little later, will take the hint in my opening re marks about the trip to Government House. I mean it sincerely because I am very firmly of the opinion that many others have made the trip to Government House to receive awards, having contributed a lot less than Alan Platt and his colleagues have.

        My colleague Senator Cooney last night on the adjournment also mentioned Alan and, by way of diversion, mentioned it was his daughter's birthday yesterday. We all joined in wishing Megan a happy birthday as another Leo. Not to be outdone, I have to announce to the chamber and the world that it is my stepdaughter's birthday. Kate Watkins is also a Leo and she is celebrating her birthday. She, in turn, is now very embarrassed as was Megan Cooney last evening.

        The final thing I wanted to comment on—I want to hold to my word about not delaying the Senate too long—is the demonstration that occurred outside this place on Monday. A few people got out of control and, in turn, caused the very good behaviour of the vast majority of the people in attendance at the demonstration to be brought into some degree of disrepute. Everybody I have heard has condemned the behaviour of the few individuals who caused the very violent scenes outside and immediately inside the front entrance of the building. They are condemned unequivocally.

I would hope that when an inquiry is conducted it will reveal the reasons, the causes and the names of the persons who gave the orders to block the access of those people who approached the body of the demonstration from Civic.

         In making these comments, I am not pointing the finger or putting the blame directly on the police force.

If somebody made an error of judgment by blocking the passage of certain demonstrators to the demonstration, indeed, the cause for that has to be found out and it must never be allowed to happen again.

         —I am glad that Senator McKiernan is here tonight to hear what I have to say because it is largely in reply to what he said last night. I will just summarise the allegations made by Senator McKiernan, as I recall them. He said that the current royal commission in Western Australia, which is looking into the Wanneroo matter, was biased, that it was aggressively discrediting whistleblowers—namely, Mr David King—that the counsel assisting the royal commission was engaging in an attack on the ministry of justice, and that the royal commission was artificially interpreting evidence before it. I will deal with those allegations in turn.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Suffice to say, Senator McKiernan's comments were reported in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        today. The heading was entitled `Commission under attack'. At the outset, Narelle  Johnson, counsel assisting the royal commission, was reported as not making any comment. Of course, that was entirely appropriate for her because the royal commission is continuing and any comment from her, as well as from the commission, would be entirely inappropriate. Therefore, I think the record needs to be clarified on that point. Where the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        reports that there was no comment forthcoming from the commission or Ms Johnson, it must be understood that the only
        <break page="2994" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         thing they could do was to remain silent. It cannot be interpreted in any way that the commission or Ms Johnson agreed with anything that Senator McKiernan said.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me go to the allegation made that the commission was aggressively discrediting whistleblowers—namely, Mr King. Narelle Johnson, counsel assisting, stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        King was ultimately forced to concede that he had no evidence to support the allegation he had made against Mr and Mrs Edwardes.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was based on the facts as presented to the royal commission. King himself had made the concession. There was no artificial interpretation of the evidence by Ms Johnson. Ms Johnson is a lawyer of experience and great reputation. She is not the sort of person, I would submit to the Senate, who is prone to making artificial interpretations of evidence. Furthermore, Senator McKiernan stated that Ms Johnson went on to attack the intelligence unit of the ministry of justice. This is not true. What Ms Johnson said before the royal commission was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the intelligence unit was not supposed to gather information in relation to the wider ministry. Its role was limited to prison-related activities and that must clearly be the case. The concept of intelligence gathering units within the public service departments as a general proposition must be anathema to any sensible member of the community. The potential for abuse is manifest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ms Johnson was saying that the unit concerned had obviously exceeded its charter. I would take her point that to have such intelligence gathering units within a department could well be the subject for potential abuse. This does not have the ramifications for the fight against crime and corruption that Senator McKiernan says it has. Really, the investigation of crime and corruption is not up to some unit in a department of the public service; it is up to the police. Indeed, the police force in Western Australia has been investigating this matter surrounding events in Wanneroo competently, so much so that people have now been gaoled and further charges have been laid against others.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What I am saying to the Senate is that a properly constituted royal commission is fulfilling its duties to the state of Western Australia and the people of that state and that,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         furthermore, the law is taking its course. There are those in Western Australia who simply are not happy with the interim report of the royal commission which cleared Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever. In fact, Norm Marlborough told the Western Australian parliament on 4 August 1996:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am one of the majority who wants to see her—
       </para>
       <para>
        Mrs Edwardes—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        banished. I want to see her out of Parliament, and I will. That will happen.
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, people of that sort are not happy with the result, so they are now attacking the people who are working in the royal commission. We saw a similar attack in relation to the royal commission dealing with Carmen Lawrence. If you don't like the decision, you attack the integrity of the royal commission and the commissioner involved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The record has to be set straight. Ms Johnson is not at liberty to say anything at this stage, nor is the royal commissioner, Mr Davis. I defend the way in which that royal commission is being conducted and the integrity of the people involved in that. I say to the Labor Party in Western Australia that, if it intends winning the next state election, it should stick to arguing policies and not attack members of the judiciary or the police force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, the true political motive in this whole matter is revealed when one looks at Senator McKiernan's attempts to link the Howard government with playing a role in any alleged cover up of corruption in Western Australia. I say to Senator McKiernan: that really is drawing a very long bow indeed. Such a flimsy allegation will be seen for what it is and rejected out of hand by the people of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I thoroughly condemn the corruption which has been found to exist in certain aspects of this matter pertaining to Wanneroo. However, I fully support the due process of the law, which no&amp;hyphen;one is able to show is not taking place in that state.

          comprehensive test ban treaty and its recent developments. For some time India has been reticent to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty along with the group of 21 developing nations. India's position has been the most publicised because they are in a problematic position due to being one of the nuclear weapons states, alongside Pakistan and Israel, who have not acceded to the non-proliferation treaty. However, their position should not detract from their message, theirs or that of the group of 21 nations.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The concerns of these 22 nations are that the CTBT is a hollow agreement without a timetable for disarmament. On top of this, the CTBT has been designed almost to fail, needing signatures of 44 named countries including Pakistan, Israel and India before it even enters into force. The strategy is akin to allowing the big players to force the little players into an agreement without making any concessions whatsoever themselves.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The group of five acknowledged nuclear nations—China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia—forced the non-proliferation treaty through without a timetable for disarmament and are now finding it even more difficult with the CTBT because the non&amp;hyphen;nuclear nations are becoming more resistant. The nuclear club deny that in fact it is their possession of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world that affects continuing nuclear acquisition within the group of five and outside it amongst the so-called nuclear threshold states. For any real cessation of the nuclear arms race, of which nuclear testing is a part, a timetable for disarmament is critical.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The CTBT is problematic in itself and will only be effective with a timetable for disarmament. This is because, even with a zero threshold, states will continue testing via computer simulated testing. Voluntary disarmament that has largely occurred between the United States and Russia with by far the largest arsenals has been tokenistic and insignificant. The oldest and less advanced warheads are being dismantled while newer, more powerful and sophisticated weapons are being developed. Testing will occur, albeit invisible to international monitoring and inspection agencies, at a fast pace while a

         timetable for disarmament is stopped from forcing a pause in the nuclear arms race.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Australia can now play a role in bringing this timetable for disarmament to the fore in the comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations. Apparently, the group of five nuclear nations have today asked Australia to put the CTBT before the United Nations General Assembly in order to bypass the Indian veto in the disarmament committee in Geneva. This is because the P5 nations apparently consider Australia to be the best placed country to sponsor the treaty.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because the P5 have been largely responsible for the fact that the current entry into force provision of the treaty is delayed, therefore crippling the treaty, Australia should use its position to strengthen the treaty preamble and the entry into force provision. The way to do this is that Australia should take action to impose preferably a timetable for disarmament or, as the Canberra Commission has called for, a timetable for negotiations for disarmament—perhaps just as a first step. Australia must be proactive on this issue to focus on a better outcome for all, rather than the nuclear weapons states that our policies usually pander to. I believe we are still waiting for a response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to the Canberra Commission. I hope that there is some recognition of what is currently happening in relation to international treaties.

        The ACT, the people that I represent, will bear a significant proportion of these job losses, but many others around Australia will bear the burden as well. With respect to the administrative cuts, many of those people are taking up the offer of redundancy and this week represents their last week of employment in the Public Service. On behalf of Labor, I extend our gratitude to each and every person who has given of themselves to the Commonwealth Public Service. Work in the public sector is incredibly diverse. Whether you are a painter, a landscaper or an administrative officer, it is crucial that each and every contribution is recognised.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So what are the options for these people who are taking redundancy packages? If we look at it in the context of this budget, things are not very rosy at all. Contemplating small business? This government has actively denied this country at least half a percentage point of growth and that is not good business in anybody's language. Contemplating retirement? Feel sure that there will be a user&amp;hyphen;pays principle for home and community care services, and an increase in nursing home fees to boot. Looking for other work? The problem with living in Canberra at the moment is that the impact of the public sector cuts on our local economy goes far beyond just that of the public sector; it eats into the private sector and into all of the support services that exist in our town. What about retraining? Sorry, all the labour market programs have gone. What about returning to higher education; perhaps a change in career? Just in case that seemed like an option, there will be fewer places, higher fees and far less opportunity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only other option is to contemplate leaving this place. Anybody who has grown up here or lived here will know that is something that is not a preferred option. Canberra is a beautiful city and the people who live here are very proud of it. Being forced to leave this city will be too high a price for many, but, faced with the option of the poverty line, perhaps it will just be enough to force these people out of town. I am talking

         about people I know. They are people with children, with parents, and many of their families have been here for a number of generations.

        This government is quite obviously anti&amp;hyphen;public sector. It has an ideology that does not go along with a public sector that provides genuine services. It seems to think that Canberra, in particular, is a place that can withstand a bit of harsh treatment and almost deserves a bit of a beating. Canberra does not seem to fit with this government's ideological picture of a market driven, dry, harsh world. For many, as I said, this week is their last week of employment with the Commonwealth public sector and all of these people need some hope, some future. They deserve it. Their work has contributed to the quality of all Australians' lives and, indeed, to the lives of many less fortunate overseas. I am referring to the work of people in AusAID and other agencies who have provided much support and assistance to people right around the world. Because of this government, their path will be so much more difficult and they know it. We saw how much they know it when they demonstrated here on Monday.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (a) Steps were taken in early 1995 to improve local councils' knowledge of their rights under the Telecommunications National Code (the Code). An information package containing a detailed plain English Guide to the provisions of the Code, a copy
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        of the Code, a copy of the regulations and a list of contacts was mailed to local councils and has been made available on request to councils and the general public. In addition the Government is in the process of revising the Telecommunications National Code. This follows an AUSTEL review of the Code. This process has enhanced the understanding by parties of the operations of the Code. I have recently published a new draft Code and directed AUSTEL to conduct a public inquiry into this Code. Once the new Code is introduced the Government intends to produce explanatory material which will be provided to each council. Consideration will also be given to whether there are any additional measures necessary to improve local councils' understanding of their rights and responsibilities under the new Code.

       (c) The new draft Code contains longer time frames in which councils can consult with the carriers, particularly where public notification and consultation is required.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (d) The current regulatory framework governing the way in which carriers install their networks, including the carriers' current exemptions from State and Territory planning laws will continue until replaced by another scheme of proper planning processes, preferably from 1 July 1997. However, the new draft Telecommunications National Code require carriers to have regard to protection of the environment and heritage, particularly in declared areas. It also encourages dialogue between carrier and councils with regard to planning of telecommunications infrastructure.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (e) The new draft Code requires carriers to provide information to be specified with regard to the electromagnetic energy (EME) emissions expected from radio facilities. With regard to the health effects of EME I am advised that the weight of national and international scientific opinion seems to be that there is no substantiated evidence of adverse health effects from EME emissions at typical levels. However, as science cannot prove a negative, the possibility cannot be ruled out. For this reason the Government takes community concerns about this issue seriously.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       A joint committee of officials has been set up to study EME public health issues and to ensure that health and safety concerns of the general public are addressed. Included in the committee's work are community information and dissemination programs.

       In relation to the commitment to reviews given in `Reviving the Heartland', the Government will be proceeding with its program in an orderly way consistent with its policy priorities and the resource constraints it faces as a result of the budget position it inherited.

       (1) Yes, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) is currently under contract to AusAID to procure goods and related services under the Commodities Assistance Program (CASP). CASP is a form of aid delivery whereby manufactured equipment and commodities, including related training, commissioning and after sales requirements, are purchased for aid recipient countries such as Papua New Guinea.

       (2) No, goods procured under CASP do not have to be manufactured in Australia or New Zealand. Procurement follows Commonwealth purchasing guidelines. These guidelines require SMEC to arrange for an open and fair competitive selection process and to obtain value for money. Factors taken into account include price, technical merit and conformity, delivery time, after sales service and maintenance and warranty cover. Australian suppliers should not however be disadvantaged in the selection process.
