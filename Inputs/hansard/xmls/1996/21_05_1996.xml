         —My question is addressed to Senator Short. Yesterday in the Senate your colleague Senator Parer failed to give a commitment to maintain the export market development grant scheme. In a speech to the ACCI on 15 May you conceded that some successful government programs would have to be wound back or scrapped, even where such programs are `meeting a relevant objective effectively and efficiently'. Will you inform the Senate where you rate in terms of priority the export market development grant scheme? Has the scheme been meeting its objective of facilitating the growth of exports by Australian small businesses both effectively and efficiently? Will the minister guarantee the operation of the scheme in its current form?

         —Yes, Senator Sherry is correct and has quoted correctly from my speech to the ACCI last week. Your question reveals much more about the opposition than it does about the government, because it reflects that Labor continues to hold a deficit mentality. You people seem to have a deficit fixation or deficit disorder requiring some professional treatment. You seem to believe that Australia can afford each and every program put forward by the plethora of groups in our community which argue that their programs are worthwhile.

         It is now 10 years since the banana republic and Labor has learnt absolutely nothing about that. The question I would ask Senator Sherry is, just where does the opposition stand on the question of getting the books of this nation back into balance? If you look at what the shadow Treasurer said in the House of Representatives last night, you would quite rightly feel rather confused because during the debate on the appropriation bill in the House of Representatives last night the shadow Treasur er made a very enlightening comment.

        The question that opposition senators have to answer is, do they want to continue to run a continuing budget deficit that leads to higher interest rates, less jobs, more unemployment, lower economic growth and less international competitiveness? That is the path you led Australia down in the last 13 years. Yesterday the shadow Treasurer admitted that it was a matter of deliberate policy. I am amazed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I will tell you something very interesting that I discovered only late last night. I thought there might have been some powerful reason why this legislation needed to be referred to a committee. But do you know why it is being referred? You have only to listen to what Senator Schacht had to say. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You have not exempted this new organisation from the Corporations Law which provides that minority shareholders have to be equally represented by all directors.

       <para>
        He is absolutely wrong because there are shareholder oversight provisions in the bill. When I pointed this out to him, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I may not have the details perfectly correct but I bet a lot of other people do not either. These are the sorts of issues that have to be debated in the community. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the reason this bill is going off to a committee is that Senator Schacht wants to take a refresher course. He was not prepared to read the bill to find out what it was about. If he had, he would understand that it has all the necessary consumer protections.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You do not understand the first thing about this. You have this quaint notion that somehow, when you remove the right to direction, Telstra will have to act in a commercial way. Let me explain to you that five years ago you corporatised Telstra; in other words, ever

        It is an absolute tragedy and a monumental hypocrisy for both of the two major opposition parties to have made up their minds. I note that they are quite comfortable in being called the `opposition parties' these days; it is no longer `the other mob and the Democrats'. There is Senator Bourne revelling in it. The opposition parties are lying in the same dishonest bed together. They have made up their minds. They are not interested in debate. Nonetheless, they are prepared to deliberately flout the will of the people.

The government is aware that the Ombudsman has decided to cease her agency arrangement with the Tasmanian Ombudsman. How the Ombudsman manages her office resources is a matter for her to determine. We understand that there were few complainants who took the opportunity to make complaints in person, rather most wrote or telephoned. The Ombudsman will retain a free call facility for Tasmanian residents. They will, of course, still be able to write to her.

        I am advised further that the Ombudsman's outreach arrangements to ethnic and indigenous communities are relatively recent.

The position in relation to the inspection of records of telecommunications interceptions by the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority is slightly different. The Ombudsman has a statutory responsibility to carry out that function and has been provided with resources to enable her to perform it.

        Month after month we were told in this place that there would not be a forecast budget deficit. In particular, I can remember Senator Cook emphasising it in answer to a number of questions. During the campaign we were told by the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, over and over again that there was no need to open the books because he could assure all Australians that there would not be a forecast budget deficit. We have come into office and have found that $8,000 million black hole. That is what we have to address. It cannot just be addressed out of the big expenditure portfolios, Senator Spindler. It has to be addressed across the board.

         —There is a very simple answer to that question. On the occasions when I have discussed with higher education people—including the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors—the very difficult task that we face in terms of meeting the budget savings that will be required to address the black hole left by the Labor government, I have tried to elicit from particularly the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors what the most sensible way is for the government to go about this task. These are the people who are running Australia's universities. These are the people who undoubtedly have enormous expertise in the higher education sector. These are the people to whom any government would turn to ask: how do you believe the

        On these occasions, the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors, in particular, have been extraordinarily reluctant to come forward with a group view as to how this ought to be done. There has been a lot of headshaking. There has been a lot of rumourmongering in the papers. But not one positive proposal has been put by the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors with respect to a suggestion as to how the government could best find these savings in the higher education sector. In other words, the attitude has been, `Do not take it from us; we must be completely untouched. If you have a budgetary problem, take it from other people. Leave the higher education sector out of it.'

        On a number of occasions I have made it clear to the vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors that the prospect of cutting student numbers is the least attractive prospect available. It is a very, very unattractive prospect. But let me underline this: none of the task of putting the budget back into the black is going to be attractive. Who would want to come into government and find an $8 billion black hole? Who, but the irresponsible pack sitting opposite, would leave government with that sort of deficit?

        I do not pretend that the task of getting the budget back into black is an easy one. I do not think it is an enjoyable one at all. The difference between this side of the chamber and that side of the chamber is that we will not walk away from the responsibility to get the budget back into black. This is a very difficult task. It is a matter of national interest that our economy is brought back into line.

It is in the national interest that we meet it. There will be arguments of specific self&amp;hyphen;interest. We will just have to deal with them.

That is what I am being told.

I would answer Senator Troeth in this way: by sticking to our policy, we will continue to put the runs on the board that the ALP cannot. By continuing to select people of merit regardless of their gender, by helping women to achieve the skills that they need to get a job—any job—we are doing more in a practical sense to achieve national involvement of women in the decision making processes of this country. Let me point out further that, by having an enlightened party with an enlightened leader, we have managed to achieve four women in the ministry of this country. It is a

        In answering that question, were you aware that your Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, said publicly on radio FM103.3 that a Howard government would in fact legislate to extinguish native title over pastoral leases. In response to a question from the interviewer about the claim made by the Western Australian Premier Richard Court that such a commitment had been given by Mr Fischer, Mr Fischer confirmed it. In response to the question, `What is the amendment you are intending to make if you gain power?' Mr Fisher said, `It is to fix the problem with regard to pastoral leasehold.' Minister, now that you are aware of that statement, will you admit to the Senate that your answer given in here was wrong? Will you now confirm that the government will not take such action in respect of native title?

Senator Minchin has done a magnificent job in preparing that discussion paper, which I hold up to everybody in this chamber. I hope that everybody in this chamber responds to that discussion paper, including Senator Collins and the opposition, because they achieved nothing in relation to the native title legislation. when they were in government. We are looking forward to your input, Senator Collins, into that discussion paper which has been so ably prepared with the assistance of all my colleagues. It will be issued shortly, as the Prime Minister said in another place, this afternoon. I hope that, in a constructive sense, everybody in this chamber will make a contribution, because it is in the interests of this country that reconciliation is achieved. The establishment of the Native Title Act and its workability is in the interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as well as the rest of the community at large.

Five and a half years later we are still suffering the pain of what your government caused. Now in those circumstances, and putting together the fact that we have inherited $8,000 million—for the sake of the Democrats who don't seem to know the difference between billions and millions—we are faced with a dreadful problem to look after those who are needy in Australia. The best thing we can possibly do is get more work for Australians, as Senator Vanstone has said this afternoon, and that is going to be the highest priority. We stand by our commitments to those who are disadvantaged and, if Senator Woodley wants details of how, he will have to wait until the budget.

         — Yes, it is a very good question indeed because it highlights in a very stark way the difference between the positive attitude of this government towards those self-funded retirees, the elderly citizens in our community who have worked and saved very hard for their retirements, and the niggardly, negative attitude that Labor showed towards them during its 13 years in government.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government recognises the vital contribution that self-funded retirees have made to the Australian community during their working lives, and during their retirement lives as well. They rely solely or partly on income
        <break page="786" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         from investments such as shares and interest earned on savings in order to accumulate that capital. As I said, they have worked hard and they have saved hard throughout their working lives. They exercised discipline and they deserve as recognition of that discipline, hard work and saving, proper, fair and equitable treatment by government. That is a treatment they did not receive under 13 years of Labor government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the election campaign, the now government announced that the pensioner rebate would be extended to self-funded retirees of pensionable age with annual incomes below the level where the pensioner rebate cut out. That tax incentive will benefit thousands of self-funded retirees throughout Australia—those retirees that Labor ignored. The initiative announced during the campaign is due to commence in the income year beginning on 1 July 1996. The election commitment indicated that that measure would be delivered through a tax rebate which will be claimed at the end of the financial year. The cost of that measure to revenue is $70 million per year and is a very important redressing of the unfairness and inequity that existed under the Labor government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This initiative is in addition to a number of other initiatives that we announced during the campaign which will also provide tax assistance to self-funded retirees—the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, the legislation for which is currently in the parliament, the tax rebate on interest income and the tax incentive for private health insurance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So far as the second part of Senator Watson's question is concerned, as I have said, under Labor self-funded retirees did not receive equitable tax treatment compared with pensioners on similar incomes. Rather than recognise their contribution, Labor penalised them through the tax system. Whereas pensioners received specific tax relief through a tax rebate, this rebate was not available for self-funded retirees and generally those self-funded retirees would have paid tax on every cent they earned over $5,400. They were also promised l&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;w law tax cuts—tax cuts which
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         never materialised. Then when Labor magically turned tax cuts into superannuation entitlements it cheated the self-funded retirees again because self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees are already retired and were never eligible. So there is a stark contrast. There will be great benefit for self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees.

          —Right. The fact is that a lot of those amendments have absolutely nothing to do with the Telstra bill. There is one there about whether carriers should be subject to normal state and territory planning requirements; in other words, picking up on overhead cabling. There is another one about whether there should be duplication of infrastructure. These are not privatisation issues; these are telecommunications issues.

         So by all means let's have a debate about post-1997, but do not for a moment pretend that somehow these have anything to do with privatisation. That is where the monumental hypocrisy comes in. Senator Faulkner gets up and says, `It is perfectly normal practice to refer bills to committees.' You know what happens. When you refer bills to committees, you do that for a purpose; that is, to see whether the bill can be improved, to flush out some problems that there might be with a view to considering the bill on its merits. But what we have is this absolutely stark position taken at the very beginning of the debate by both of the major opposition parties in this chamber: they are absolutely opposed irrespective.

If you did get the privatisation of Telstra through this parliament in the next six months, it would not mean a thing to anybody who wanted to bid for $8 billion, or whatever amount of money. No-one will put a cent up till they know what the rules are for post&amp;hyphen;1 July 1997, because it would only take the Senate or the House of Representatives, this parliament, to change one paragraph of the bill to change the income stream of the privatised Telstra by billions of dollars.

We cannot advise investors on what the marketplace will be until we know the rules the parliament will give.' That is a fundamental issue.

It actually happens to be a matter that they think is pretty important. Month after month, the coalition, in opposition, led the housing industry along the path on this policy, implying that it would be an election commitment. Then a few days before the election they dropped it and they dropped the HIA. I was there to talk about that policy, and I mentioned Telstra briefly in passing. I would have been delighted to spend 40 minutes pointing out why I thought the government had failed to make an economic case for the sale of any of Telstra. However, unlike Senator Alston, I do not seek to turn every opportunity to base politics; I went there to speak to my brief.

          I did not hear that interjection but I will not be distracted. Senator Alston knows full well, as do the members of the government who have bothered to take an interest in the details of the legislation rather than parroting on on the back benches all the time, that privatisation of itself will not deliver a single shred of consumer benefit and that Telstra is still an effective monopoly.

        He knows full well what has been said by the British National Consumer Council, the Australian Consumers Association and the NUS International survey. Virtually everyone who comes to this debate with a shred of independence and objectivity knows that the best consumer outcomes on telecommunications do come from a regulatory regime. The government is proposing a regulatory regime after 1997. We want to make sure that the knowledge of what is in that piece of legislation is available to us at the same time as we debate the sale of Telstra.

        It is the government which has failed to introduce the full legislative package in a logical and coherent way. It is the government which has failed to produce the bill to support its argument that the Telstra&amp;hyphen;environment link is so essential. The cut&amp;hyphen;off, as Senator Faulkner has said, is the way we have been operating. Under that cut&amp;hyphen;off motion proposed by Senator Hill, this bill automatically goes into the next session and it is meeting due process of this Senate and due scrutiny—scrutiny that was missing in the House of Representatives when the bill was gagged. Any government which is strong in its defence of its own policy has nothing to fear from a short inquiry.

        Well, if it doesn't get debated this session, it will be largely because of the extraordinary cynicism that's being displayed by the present Government leadership in the Senate who are now behaving in all the ways they accused us of behaving in our worst and most cynical moments previously, and the biter does occasionally get bit. But look, we frankly are prepared to debate the Telstra legislation in the normal way when it comes up. We're not going to hang in, in imposing ridiculous constraints on that and we'll just respond to the issues in a measured way as they come forward. We'll debate the Bill on its merits and we'll look at the whole future course of the argument on its merits.

        It is of enough concern when that ploy is used in this chamber during question time.

In the course of this debate we have had two instances where people were quoted out of context in order to create an impression that should not be created if we are seeking a proper, logical and considered debate about this very important issue.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill is not a "get Telstra" bill. Yes, Telstra will lose access to 7 per cent of its retained profits for 5 years and this will reduce the capital base of the company. The reduction is only marginal, about 1.5 per cent in five years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That 1.5 per cent reduction can be usefully compared with the 5.7 per cent discount at which the Commonwealth sold CSL shares, or the 20 per cent undervaluation on the original tranche of Commonwealth Bank shares. The Democrats believe it is a small price to pay, considering the significant
        <break page="798" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our proposal will also marginally reduce the amount of funds Telstra has available for re&amp;hyphen;investment, by about $75 million, compared with Telstra's total capital investments of $3.2 billion. But, as the Coalition itself points out in its environment policy, investment on the environment should itself be seen as capital investment. So while Telstra's capacity for capital investment would be reduced slightly, the net effect would be one of substituting one form of capital investment for another.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is also not a "tax Telstra" bill. Telstra is owned by the Government on behalf of the Australian people. If owners wish to withdraw funds from their own company, for a purpose which the ultimate owners—in this case, the Australian people—want, then they are entitled to do so. That is not a `tax'.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unlike the Coalition, we do not regard Telstra as a `magic money tree', a tree that can be chopped up and sold off to fit an ideological commitment to smaller Government and short&amp;hyphen;term debt reduction. We regard it as a highly profitable public asset which should be used for the benefit of all Australians, and which will contribute significantly to even greater long term debt reduction..
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We accept that ultimately this bill will marginally reduce the flow of company tax and dividend payments to the Budget. But this is consistent with our view that the Government should have made a decision to stick with funding environment policy from the Budget in the first place and not moved to tie environment funding to the sale of Telstra.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Democrats and, I believe, the majority of Australians regard the Government's attempt to link the Telstra sale to the funding of the environment programs as little more than a cynical political stunt.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was originally conceived as something of a clever trick during the election campaign, but its has turned out to be huge miscalculation based on two inaccurate and arrogant assumptions. The first is that the Democrats are a single issue environment party. The second is the assumption that the Democrats will cross&amp;hyphen;trade one reasonable policy for an appalling one.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Democrats are certainly committed to the environment. We have an 18 year record to prove it. We have demonstrated how this can be achieved while only maintaining a fiscally responsible deficit reduction program.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Imagine the outcry if the Coalition had made funding for defence, family assistance or schools contingent upon the sale of Telstra. Such a scenario would be rejected out of hand—and the fact that the Government has chosen to make environment funding contingent upon the sale of Telstra shows only too clearly its lack of respect for and commitment to the Australian environment.

        If the Government can find within its Budget $600 million worth of new defence spending, half a billion dollars in subsidies for the private health insurance industry, and over $2.5 billion in tax relief, why—then—is the environment being singled out for such unfair treatment?

        The Democrats have already outlined their reasons for opposing the sale of Telstra. We have concluded, based on international experience and research, that better consumer outcomes, better national savings outcomes and better economic outcomes can be achieved in other ways.

        The Democrats do not deny the need to allocate additional funding to the environment. We have a long record of calling for a significant boost in environment funding and, after years of inaction and neglect, there are now very clear priority areas which require urgent action.

        We also know that Australians are becoming increasingly aware of the need to take action to protect and preserve the environment.

        Governments in this country—both Labor and Liberal—have a long history of taking a short&amp;hyphen;term, short&amp;hyphen;sighted and small&amp;hyphen;minded approach to funding the environment.

        Over the next four years, the profits from Telstra have been forecast by BZW Australia to rise from $1.752 million last year to nearly $3 billion a year by 1998. The sale of 35 per cent of Telstra will result in a loss to the public sector of nearly $500 million a year by 1998.

        This is because the saving on interest payments from reducing debt—about $530 million a year—will be much less than the loss of 35 per cent of Telstra's profits—by then worth about $1 billion a year.

         —This bill seeks to implement the coalition government's promise to set up a national heritage trust fund, but in a more responsible and honourable way. The trust fund will be used to fund environment programs but will do so without attaching the

        The Democrats believe such a vitally important area as environmental funding should come from the budget. We demonstrate with this bill that if the government is determined to link Telstra to the environment it can get a better deal for both through this model than with its own controversial proposal. Maintaining Telstra in public ownership provides such an improvement in public sector finances that seven per cent of Telstra's profits can be allocated to setting up the national heritage trust fund while still improving public sector savings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill conclusively demonstrates that it is possible to have both an environment policy and Telstra in public ownership while improving fiscal responsibility. The difference between the coalition approach and the Democrat bill is clearly demonstrated by our estimate that at the end of five years, having funded all the programs nominated by the coalition, the Democrats' fund would stand at $1.1 billion. That is three times as much money available for future programs than under the coalition fund, which would have been run down to $360 million by the year 2001. By then, public sector savings would be about $700 million a year better off than if Telstra was sold because 100 per cent of Telstra profits would be flowing to the Commonwealth. Telstra would remain in full public ownership with full public accountability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In short, the Democrats seek to show through this bill that if Telstra is not sold the public is better off, public sector savings are better off and the environment is better off. I commend the bill to the Senate.

        The urgency is that the return of the writs for the election of senators in South Australia has taken place. We have some 30 days to resolve whether there is a problem with the election of one of those senators, Senator&amp;hyphen;designate Ferris. Under the constitution she may very well be incapable of sitting as a senator in this place. As I said, 30 days from the close of the writs is the end of next week—Thursday, 30 May.

        We have just over a week to discuss this issue. Some may argue that this gives us a bit of time but just over a week not only for us to discuss the issue but also for people to institute proceedings, if in fact proceedings are appropriate in this case, is not long. It may well be that proceedings may have to be issued through the Court of Disputed Returns. To do that right, anyone who may feel aggrieved by the election process or the capacity for Senator&amp;hyphen;elect Ferris to sit in this place will, I am sure, have to brief solicitors, go through the documentation and lodge those documents. That would take the best part of four or five days.

         Therefore, to get it right there needs to be a return to order by the end of this week. That is why the date imposed by this motion gives us 1 pm on Thursday of this week and five, six or seven days, not including two days over the weekend, is a tight framework within which to formulate the documentation. That has to be taken into account in the context of the fact that it has already taken some 22 days to get serious answers from the government.

         The first question concerning this matter was raised on 1 May and it is now 21 May. It has been 20 days. After 20 days, in response to a number of questions from the opposition, we have had one answer from Senator Vanstone which did not go to the essence of the concern that we have, that is, whether senator&amp;hyphen;designate Ferris either occupied a position of profit or in fact received any benefit which would accrue to such a position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If they cannot get it right in 20 days, we need to be sure that the documentation that is presented to us by Thursday is full and adequate. In fact, there may be a further need for a return to order, given the degree of dissembling by the government. I understand that it is not an easy issue for the government and that there are pressures surrounding this particular matter. I can understand that some of those pressures are forcing some of the leadership in this parliament to ensure that the 30&amp;hyphen;day period does expire and that thereafter there is a belief that the appointment of senator&amp;hyphen;designate Ferris may not be open to challenge, particularly in the Court of Disputed Returns.

         There is a time imperative in this matter. Senator Hill says that they are actually getting the documentation together and that they want this motion deferred until tomorrow. If he is getting the documentation together, there is no problem with letting this motion pass today, having the cut&amp;hyphen;off day as Thursday and the government working within that time frame from today until Thursday, which is close to 45 hours, and then getting the documentation to us.

          what he says is right, that he is trying to get these documents together. There is a time imperative because there are constitutional limits and limits imposed by the Electoral Act which would force proceedings in this matter to take place within a certain period. There may be capacity to raise the matter after that, but that is another course of action altogether, and possibly one which the government by dissembling this process may be opening up in the longer term.

         From the opposition's perspective there are serious issues to be answered. The advice we received yesterday concerned whether in fact senator&amp;hyphen;designate Ferris was officially appointed. That has not been the thrust of most of the questioning. The thrust of most of the questioning goes to other aspects such as a person being incapable of being chosen or sitting as a senator under section 44 of the Constitution. The documentation we are asking for here is documentation which, if provided, would satisfy the Senate one way or another about the problems senator&amp;hyphen;designate Ferris might have.

        —I do not want to transgress standing orders and repeat what I said on the last occasion. But it is a bit difficult to come back to an issue after there has been a separation period, particularly if the separation period has been for nearly 24 hours. I think that I made the point that I support the amendment relating to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill being referred to a Senate standing committee. I do agree that the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts should be the committee to which this is referred.

        I listened to what Senator Ferguson said and was inclined to the view that it should go to the legislation committee. I do not believe, unless I am missing something, that the opposition is suggesting that it be referred to the references committee so that it can get the numbers on that committee. I may be proved wrong, of course. If those who oppose the sale of a third of Telstra do become the majority of that committee—and it appears that they will—then they would have the very serious obligation in their report of making sure that their views are based on the infor mation that is provided to that committee and that they are persuasive enough for the various recommendations that may arise.

       I mentioned that I believe that a number of matters should be placed on the scales when weighing up whether or not one should support the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. Last night I briefly mentioned
       <break page="805" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        that this should include the question of mandate. No doubt, the committee will receive heaps of submissions from academics and the like, but we should also receive some submissions from the public in respect of that question of mandate. That is one thing that should be put onto the scales. I do not say how much weight that should be given.

      <para first-indent="16">
       There are a number of other matters that should be put onto the scales as well, including the effect on regional employment and the question of regional service quality. What is precisely meant by the universal service obligation? The legislation talks of universal service obligations in terms of basic telephone services and pay phone services. I would like to see the committee examine the question of interactive services and the like for rural Australia. I would certainly hope—no doubt, the government has the answers to these questions—that business in rural Australia is not adversely affected by the Telstra bill. I have heard the arguments that have been advanced by the minister and others that not only is that not likely to occur but because you would be in a competitive field and there was an injection of private capital in the area, you would also get further expertise. Under those circumstances, rural Australia would not need to be worried. Why is the government worried about having this go off to a committee? I do not precisely understand the full reason for that.

       <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
        I might mention a few other things, if the Senate would allow me. I refer to the question of the charging on user funded assets. In the past much of Telstra's infrastructure has been paid for by users. For example, farmers and subdividers have had to pay for much of the telephone network infrastructure on their own land. The decision of the High Court in Anthony v. the Commonwealth means that ownership of infrastructure, such as telephone poles, vests in Telstra even where others have defrayed much of the cost. Persons who have paid for these assets will need to be reassured that they will not be charged a rent for the use of assets that they have contributed. It will be important for them to have it on the record that the partly privatised Telstra will not be allowed to charge them beyond main tenance and other marginal costs for the use of fixed assets that Telstra never paid for or for which they paid a part.

       There was discussion today following a motion to take note of an answer about the impact of the post-1997 telecommunications regime. I listened to Senator Alston's response. There is a tension between maximising the sale value of Telstra and maximising competition by ensuring free and liberal access by all telecommunications providers to Telstra's natural monopoly network. If Telstra could freeze out Optus and others, its value as an unregulated monopoly would be enormous. On the other hand, if Telstra is forced to make its network available to others at below marginal cost, it could be bled to death. Some would argue that to avoid such extremes Telstra should be floated as an operating company with ownership of the natural monopoly network retained in public ownership, just as we let different road freight companies compete on an equal footing over the public roads. That is not an option before us in this particular legislation, but such suggestions highlight the critical importance of access to natural monopoly infrastructure at prices which do not exceed marginal cost.

       Investors in Telstra, competitors and the public need to have on record clear statements as to the nature of the post&amp;hyphen;1997 regulatory regime for telecommunications, especially clear statements on pricing principles for access to Telstra's network. I know the government has been considering this matter carefully, and I trust it will welcome the opportunity to spell out these issues for investors and others. I believe the committee will need to look at the questions relating to prospectus and information requirements under the Corporations Law, and I know that matter was given a run around the course today or yesterday.

       The bill contains some provisions which may override the Corporations Law in ensuring that the Commonwealth as the majority shareholder is given privileged access to information and other overriding powers. I agree with the thrust of such provisions because they protect the Commonwealth's controlling role and because Telstra is no

       However, it would be desirable to have on the record from the Australian Stock Exchange that there will be no problem with Stock Exchange listing rules if Telstra is floated on this basis and that Telstra shares will be acceptable for listing on overseas exchanges notwithstanding special provisions regarding information to the government and curbs on foreign investors. Whatever one's personal views on the partial sale of Telstra, it is important that potential technical issues are put beyond doubt. None of us should be happy if a bill were passed, expenses incurred for a float, and then some issue such as Stock Exchange listing rules caused difficulties. This will be the largest proposed corporate float in Australia's history. The previous largest proposed float—can honourable senators remember the previous largest proposed float?

       In conclusion, I have had the benefit of indications from the government on some of these issues, but I think it would be desirable—and I feel sure that the government will have no objection to this—that we should have firmly documented all of these matters for all to see how some of these issues are to be handled. Investors in Telstra may need to be reminded that Telstra is still going to be a public, majority&amp;hyphen;owned asset with historical and national commitments to provide full services across Australia. The parliament can only consent to the partial sale of Telstra on the understanding that investors will not seek and will not be able to use its unique natural monopoly position to extract monopoly tribute from the country or ignore its community service obligations to provide a nationwide service.

       I am sure that the government has these views and will welcome the opportunity to place its views on these matters on the public record. I understand what Senator Alston and other members of the government have been doing, but I believe they really should not object to representatives on the committee being able to do this so as to put it clearly on the public record. If Telstra is to be partially floated, it is vital that there be an informed market and that no investor is deluded into thinking that Telstra's directors will be at large to charge what the market will bear. This is not an ordinary company—indeed, the very term `company' seems odd when talking about a publicly&amp;hyphen;owned utility—and no investor should think that the fiduciary duties of directors to secure the best returns for one&amp;hyphen;third minority shareholders mean that Telstra

       Firstly, Senator Hill seems to think that the double dissolution of 1951 is a good precedent to use for whether or not this Senate should refer the contents of this bill to a committee. The obvious problem with that is that in 1951 the Senate did not have the comprehensive committee system it has today. It is very obvious that 20 per cent to 25 per cent of all bills which come to the Senate are referred to one committee or another. We refer them to lots of different types of committees—

Do we remember the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993? This is a classic bill. It was introduced into the House of Representatives on 17 August 1993 and into the Senate on 7 September of that year. The constitutional aspects were referred to a Senate committee on 31 August. There was an extension of time to report by 6 September. That report was tabled on 27 September.

       The opposition then referred, by another motion, the fringe benefits tax provisions to a different committee on 6 September. There was an extension of time to report by 27 September. The report was tabled on 19 October. It was split into separate bills, all of which were then referred by the opposition,
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        through the Selection of Bills Committee, to various different committees and they were then passed with amendments in late October 1993.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Then, of course, there is the classic that we are all mentioning at the moment: the land fund bill 1994. That was introduced into the House of Representatives on 30 June 1994 and into the Senate on 21 September 1994 and was referred by the Selection of Bills Committee to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 1 September. That report was tabled on 10 October. Senate amendments were referred by an opposition motion during the committee stage of that bill, on the floor of the parliament.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I can relate this back to something Senator Kernot has been quoted as saying. While that committee stage of that bill was going on, Senator Campbell moved an opposition motion to refer that bill to the Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill on 28 November. It was referred, the extension of time was given to them on 31 January and the report was finally tabled on 9 February. The House of Representatives agreed to certain amendments, disagreed to the remainder and laid aside the bill on 2 March and another bill was introduced after that.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Senator Kernot has actually been quoted in relation to the land fund bill as saying that two weeks was sufficient time for it to be sent out to a select committee for examination. I point out that that was the second time this bill had gone to a committee. That was the second committee it had gone to, not the first. We had been through the second reading of the bill. We had been through a referral to a committee. It had gone to a committee. The committee had reported. We had gone through some of the committee stage. We were in the middle of the committee stage on the floor of this parliament when the opposition rose to its feet and referred it to another committee. At that point, Senator Kernot said, not unreasonably, `I think two weeks more is probably enough.' And it probably was. We got it back then—it was five months overall, I might add—five months after it was first introduced and it was finally laid aside and a new bill
       <break page="808" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        came in. We all know what happened to that bill.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I am sure Senator Hill did not deliberately misrepresent Senator Kernot, just as I am sure Senator Alston did not deliberately misrepresent me during question time today. I was talking about the Telstra bill on

       , which is quite a popular program. I am quite surprised he could not remember the name of it. In answer to the question, `But will you vote for a privatisation of Telstra under some circumstance?', I said, `No. Absolutely not.' I did say that. Then I went on to say:

       But that's not all that's in that Bill. This Bill doesn't just say `privatising Telstra'. This bill says privatising Telstra and getting rid of the Minister's power to direct Telstra and consumer protection and customer guarantee.

      <para>
       That is the point. When Senator Hill says that because we are not prepared to vote for the privatisation of Telstra we should not be prepared to look at this bill, that is well and truly against the spirit of this Senate. Of course we should be prepared to look at this bill. Privatising Telstra is only one part of this bill; it is about half the bill. The other half of the bill looks at consumer guarantees—very important things which should be looked at, despite the fact that they are already in the Telecommunications Act at sections 287 and 288. They should still be looked at to see if they can be strengthened.

       If it came to a joint sitting of both houses, the only amendments that could be made to a bill put to a joint sitting are ones which have been considered by one house of the parliament.

It is very important that that happens.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The best way to do that is not what happened in the House of Representatives only last week. This bill was gagged through with virtually no debate—but that is the House of Representatives. This should now have public and parliamentary scrutiny. I thought this government when it was in opposition was in favour of public and parliamentary scrutiny,
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       This is due process. It is exactly what the Senate does with bills.

The bills go off to different committees and they come back in various periods of time. Senator Margetts told us yesterday that the average time taken is about three months.

       If we are to refer it to a committee within this sitting session, we have to keep in mind we have only 3&amp;half; sitting weeks left. That is totally inadequate for a bill of this complexity and importance. It is vitally important that before the Senate looks at whether Telstra should be privatised we see what is going to happen in those 1997 reviews. People from merchant banks are saying to me, `We cannot decide on how we should advise our clients until we know what is going happen in the 1997 review of deregulation.' That is vitally important. That is one of the things that will be looked at in this committee reference, and that is why I will be voting for it.

          —The day of reckoning will arrive. Even if it does not arrive in this calendar year, it will arrive. They will be seen for what they are: people who are opposed to change; people who do not have any coherent view of what is in the national interest; people who are highly selective in their support of privatisation. They know what is happening internationally. They know that every dominant carrier in the top 20 by revenue around the world has already been privatised or is about to be. They know that no country has introduced competition without also privatising the dominant carrier. It has happened everywhere else; it will happen here. It is simply a matter of time.

         What you want is to handicap Telstra for as long as possible, condemn it to a second-rate existence and keep one hand behind its back so that it becomes increasingly uncompetitive. That, I think, is not only a great shame but a disgrace in the context of a bill which is
         <break page="811" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          simply designed to enable privatisation to commence.

         Again, as Senator Harradine would have it, it is perfectly respectable to send a bill off to a committee. But, given that there has been very little community concern expressed to date, apart from a few vested interests, I would have thought the sensible course to follow would be to have referred it off to the legislation committee, initially for a four-week period—which is what we have in mind in our amendment—and you then see what comes in. If I am wrong and you are swamped by a whole range of concerns, then you may take the view that you need to come back to the chamber and ask for an extension. It would be difficult in those circumstances to justify the need to just ram the bill through.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not what is happening here. Irrespective of any level of community concerns, despite the fact that they have already made up their minds, they are now trying to put in place a regime that would justify not just a three-month extension but virtually an endless extension. If you seriously wanted to address all of these issues, many of which are utterly extraneous to the purpose of this bill, to do justice to those would take you a couple of years. You simply could not begin to assess the impact of privatisation on employment and economic activity.

          The amendments do not even say `privatisation of Telstra'. They say, `the impact of the duplication of infrastructure and the extent to which this can be reduced by sharing.' That has been a hot debate for some months, probably several years. It could well have been looked at by a select committee. There is not the slightest interest in the subject. No-one on the other side has been jumping up asking questions about these issues or saying that these matters ought to be investigated as a matter of high priority. As I say, we have re-established the community standards select committee. Why couldn't we have established select committees on these issues? They have nothing to do with privatisation. Important though they are, they will operate totally unrelated to the privatisation proposal, just as the post-1997 regime to which you are com mitted—I am sorry you were not there last Thursday—

That will provide enhanced services for the bush, get them onto the Internet and give them high&amp;hyphen;speed access. They are very important issues.

           —Let's be serious. If you want to oppose the fundamentals of the bill, you do it in here. You do not do it in the committee. The committee is the place where you explore the implications of proposals. You do that by listening to the evidence. You certainly do not do it, having made it clear on the public record that you are going to vote against this bill, come hell or high water. I think it is pretty clear where we are headed, but we will certainly take the matter to the end.

           I conclude by saying, again on Senator Harradine's point, that if you impose an obligation on Telstra to charge below marginal cost pricing principles, then it would effectively bleed to death. That is not how the universal service levy works. There is an avoidable cost methodology which is designed to fully compensate them for any losses and that is then recouped by a levy on the other carriers. That is regarded on all sides as a fair concept. As I have said many times, it is borrowed directly from the US, where they have never had publicly owned telecommunications companies. It services rural and remote areas just as effectively as it does here.

           If you had concerns about that or in some other way you wanted to boost that obligation, you could do it via a select committee because, if it is an issue now, it will remain an issue irrespective of whether this bill goes through. It will be an issue in the post&amp;hyphen;1997 environment. The fact that you have tagged all these things on simply exposes you for what you are: obstructionist.

         —Earlier in this debate I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, Senator Woods, a couple of questions. I would like to go over one of them. It related to the fact that, for the last few years, the TGA has adopted the practice of formally notifying both the minister and the secretary to the department whenever it receives a request for the special use of a drug as an abortifacient. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm that that is the case? If it is, could he tell me how many requests have been received?

        As I am informed, since 1991, which is when the therapeutic goods legislation came into effect, there have been two approvals for RU486 under the CTN procedure. For the CTX procedure there were no clinical trial approvals. There were a number of approvals for RU486 for non&amp;hyphen;abortion related issues, such as various cancers or Cushings syndrome. Since February 1991, under the CTN there has been a total of six notifications of abortion drugs, including RU486.

One of the key motivating factors for the review was not from the pharmaceutical end of the spectrum but rather from the natural foods and herbal products end of the spectrum. With some justification, there is a concern that perhaps unnecessary bureaucratic barriers have been erected to some of those products. That is one of the issues of the review. The time frame has not been settled, but we would certainly like to do this as soon as possible. I have instructed the department to look at ways in which we can do it quickly and get representations from a whole range of groups. My view is that it should be as wide

          —Senator Harradine, you are talking about the importation of the drug. I want to be clear exactly what your amendment means. I am very worried about the way this amendment is worded. Could you explain exactly when the intention for use applies for the purposes of this legislation? You have said it applies only at the time the application for importation is made. Therefore, can I conclude that if the medication were already in the country and if it were then used as an abortifacient, under this piece of legislation it would not be a problem?

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In spite of any other provision of this Act, a person must not, without the written approval of the Minister, import any restricted goods into Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, there needs to be an application for those restricted goods, namely, abortifacients, which include progesterone antagonists and vaccines against HCG intended for use in women as abortifacients. The procedure would be for a person who desires to import such drugs to apply. That is what happens now: they apply to the department. A delegate in the department makes the decision. All this does is require that that decision be made by the minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the current circumstances, because these are prohibited imports—because they are abortifacients—there is clearly a decision to be made on the basis of the application. That does not mean that a person can import this particular abortion drug and then use it for purposes other than those for which the application was approved. Other procedures would then be able to be adopted which would ensure that that did not take place. The amendment states:

The only situation I can think of where that might be relevant is that if those drugs were in the country it might be possible for people to use their presence, if you like, in the country as part of a trial and then undergo a CTX or CTN notification of a chemical trial. That is outside the importation, which Senator Harradine's amendment is really focusing on.

I will come to the substance of what you are raising, but let me first of all point out to honourable senators that RU486 is not a valuable drug in terms of treating any of the cancers which are listed. I simply point out that, if it was so, why has it only been used on 10 patients, or some number of that order? If it is such a wonderful drug and if you would really be depriving patients of a valuable drug, why is it not more widely used?

We have legal opinion to the effect that it would in fact be the case that the amendment moved by Senator Harradine would not restrict its access for those sorts of purposes. The amendment clearly states that it is the purpose of abortifacient uses that would be constrained by the legislation. As Senator Harradine has said, and I would reinforce it, certainly the last thing that either of us would want to do would be in any way to deprive patients of access to a drug which was beneficial in the treatment of cancer or, indeed, of any other serious illness.

         Let me just say that RU486 is not on the market, so we are not depriving patients of a drug which is on the market. And it is not a drug which, as I understand it, is likely to come onto the market, according to the manufacturers—who, I believe, are Rhonpoulenc. We are not actually affecting a drug which is readily available on the market. It is imported in various situations, as far as I am aware, for a couple of clinical trials and for a handful of other indications.

         —Senator Chamarette has said that tabling of the decision in the parliament is not a trigger for a disallowance. That was in my original motion. I thank Senator Chamarette for expressing concern about that. It is fair to say that the government and the opposition were concerned about that for a number of reasons. As a result of the reasons being advanced to me, I dropped those parts of this amendment relating to them and did not move them. This measure requires the tabling of the decision in the Senate.

        Senator Chamarette has asked, for example: if the minister is to table a decision to exempt RU486 from being a prohibited import, why should there not be a tabling of a decision which does not exempt? The measure that I am proposing arose out of a situation where a delegate in the department of health provided an exemption and told no-one, except the applicant. The decision was leaked by concerned people, people who were very much associated with the organisation which was the sponsor, who then provided the information.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That information was given to us for the estimates committee. It was asked of the Therapeutics Goods Administration: why did that decision take place when there was an undertaking, publicly given, for decisions of this nature to involve the minister?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Questions were further asked about the CTN, the clinical trial scheme, that has resulted. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has said that it was simply acting as a post box. If an application were made for a clinical trial—and that included a statement by an institutional ethics committee, whether it be a compliant institutional ethics committee or otherwise—and there was a payment of $110, then that was the end of it. The Therapeutics Goods Administration had nothing else to do with it.

         It was only because the decision of the delegate who approved the importation of that prohibited import was leaked by somebody within the system that the public found out about the matter; otherwise, the public would not have known about it. You may recall that the trial consent forms which were to be signed by women subjects of the trial were found to be inadequate and not to have contained vital information. As a result, the trial was stopped for a while.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Now we have got to the stage, hopefully, where the minister will assume ministerial responsibility and where the delegate in the department will not be required to take responsibility. We have gone one step further to say that the decision should be tabled in the parliament. The other side of the coin, relating to the decision not to approve, is not included. The reason, I suggest, is that the applicant would make absolutely sure that the matter was raised publicly. You can be absolutely sure of that. It would be in the interests of the applicant who was refused permission to raise it publicly. I have no doubt that that would occur both inside and outside parliament.

        I am concerned that the parliament has done a Pontius Pilate in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Act. I have been trying to search for the reasons why Peter Baume raised the whole issue of distancing and putting at arms length these particular kinds of decisions from the minister. I actually think that, while there may be good aspects to that, there are also negative aspects to that. We deserve to have parliamentary scrutiny of decisions. We deserve to have a voice on issues and not simply leave them to boards of experts. That can result in the same kinds of political pressures and pressures from pharmaceutical companies that people are complaining would prevent us from adequately debating or deciding on that issue. There is a problem there.

        If we were considering the importation of plutonium into this country, we would not leave it to an expert committee or an ethics committee; we would demand that this parliament had a say. I am keen that we see the processes of scrutiny and public consultation not undermined by distancing it. If this amendment can be improved in such a way that it allows a genuine public debate on an issue without putting undue pressure on the minister, but allows that kind of explanation to be given for reasons for a decision, it could be a beneficial amendment and it could warrant the support that I think it will probably get in this chamber.

For example, if a particular organisation or manufacturer wanted to set up a clinical trial or a particular evaluation or a usage of a drug and that were turned down, it is pretty inconceivable that that would not be made public pretty quickly. Therefore, the suggestion which Senator Chamarette is making is probably superfluous in as much as that side of the fence will always be open to public scrutiny and accountability and, no doubt, public debate.

Although I do not feel strongly about it, I am not sure that there is a necessity for it. I think there would be public debate on both sides if you accept what Senator Harradine is suggesting.

For consistency, Senator Harradine, you more than most should be saying, `You're quite right. It's an oversight.

However, that decision is made in a social context which in this particular aspect—namely the availability of a drug which may be used to procure abortions—has at least two dimensions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, there is the dimension of the responsibility to ensure the safety and health of users of the drug. That responsibility is discharged primarily by a committee of experts, as for any drug. I add that there has been a deal of debate on the issue of safety and the usage of that drug, not only in this country but internationally. It is quite difficult for lay people to access the kind of expert decision making bodies that may be dealing with that information if there is no public avenue for discussion of it. Secondly, there is the responsibility of the state with respect to the services available in our society by way of birth control generally.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is not merely a matter of personal choice in which governments bear no responsibility other than to make that choice as broad as possible. For example, the way in which governments allocate resources between education on sexuality compared with abortion services will, to a large extent, determine personal choice. It is also true that the level of personal choice that is available is determined by the access to information, and to public information, on the topics involved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because there is no consensus in the community about the availability of this drug, the opinion of experts on its physiological effects
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         should not constitute the last word on whether it is made widely available. There is not only a health issue in the narrow sense—that is, whether the drug is safe—but also a question of whether the availability should be limited for ethical or policy reasons in the context of social policy. This debate is yet to be heard.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The states, which have responsibility for laws on surgical abortions, have largely swept the issue under the carpet. The laws against procuring abortions remain on the statute books but they are not enforced, while thousands of abortions are carried out each year primarily, it would sometimes appear, as a means of birth control.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Ultimately, our society may decide that it wishes abortion to be readily available on demand. My point is that the decision should be made openly and after taking into account community opinion. Senator Harradine's amendments address the need with respect to chemically induced abortions where community opinions may be directed and taken into account. The allocation of direct responsibility to the minister other than the usual committee no doubt constitutes a very imperfect system given the polarised positions of some community groups. It is nevertheless a mechanism which has been supported by this chamber and I believe deserves scrutiny. It deserves a watching brief on any unintended consequences which may occur to the detriment of the community.

        I believe the question we have been looking at here is not the question for or against RU486. This question is really about who should have a say, who should have a voice and who should make the decision. While I was not prepared to at the end of the day support a mechanism which was imperfect, I nonetheless affirm the right of this parliament to have scrutiny over such issues. The position is basically taken from a point of view of: `Do we delegate our responsibility in a Pontius Pilate fashion to experts? Do we look at it in terms of a majority view or a consensus view or take a check and balance approach?'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe the approach that has been taken is a check and balance one. I think it does bear grave responsibility on this parliament to

        In recognising that there is no perfect method of contraception, Family Planning Associations also recognise that some of their clients face unwanted pregnancies and the issue of abortion therefore has to be addressed. IPPF and Family Planning Associations see it as their responsibility to persuade governments and opinion leaders of the tragic consequences and costs of not removing the barriers which prevent women accessing safe abortion. Within this context, what individual Family Planning Associations are able to do is constrained by local laws and lack of resources. Where abortion is illegal, many FPAs carry out advocacy work and undertake research on the problem to back their advocacy services. Across the globe, discussions are held with influential people, religious and community leaders and policy makers. Some FPAs offer services for the management of post&amp;hyphen;abortion complications, or provide post&amp;hyphen;abortion counselling and contraceptive services.

        I read that for the record because I think it is a very powerful point. I certainly was appalled by what Senator Harradine had to say by way of a broad smear of anyone who seemed to have a different view from his during his few moments of heated rhetoric in his contribution to the debate. I do not think it helped at all, Senator Harradine, nor do such references as `under the protection of the seemingly neutral World Health Organisation'. I think I am quoting you accurately. I understand they were the sentiments I heard but if that is to misrepresent you, Senator Harradine, I apologise in anticipation, but I do not think I do you an injustice with that reference.

        What amazes me is that it takes a very important concern about the health of women for it to be raised in this chamber and very often by women. It certainly is a matter of concern that we have a lot of publicity and great concern about the deaths of people around the country from AIDS. I certainly am one of those who grieve and am very unhappy and sorry for  people who suffer the consequences of AIDS. One has to feel the same grief and concern about those 500,000 women who die each year, but there has been nothing like the same passion or concern for those women, nor the 14 million, now reduced to about 11 million, children who die each year from easily preventable diseases.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have to say that, on the best authority I have, none of those pregnancies are immaculate conceptions. I made the point in a slightly different way last time that men are involved in every one of those pregnancies. Yet what often happens is that women are left with very limited resources and very limited access to adequate contraception, let alone health education or preventive measures, and very often have to resort to abortion. Very often it leads to illegal abortion. Very often it leads to terrible consequences for those women.

        I believe that the matters of population control—of better understanding the grief, the morbidity, the pain and the anguish and suffering of these women, their children and

        But I think we do need to look around the world and start being more fair in the allocation of our dollars, our health resources, our preventative programs and our education programs so that women's health equates to men's health and access to those services and we should be addressing any insufficiencies in either men's health or women's health. But the fact that 500,000 women can go on dying each year from largely neglect in the Third World is a matter of disgrace. It is time we took very seriously our concerns to assist those women toward better help so that they have choices other than abortion.

        If you look at the Cairo conference about world population, if you look at the Stockholm conference about social policy, if you look at the Beijing conference—three terribly significant conferences in the last 12 or 18 months—you will see that all of them highlight one extraordinary factor; that is, where women have access to education, where women are literate, where women have some control and responsibility over their own lives, then you see much less need for the termination of pregnancies—for abortion—and less morbidity or mortality. I raised this point on behalf of this nation when I reported on the International Year of the Family at the United Nations. We need to be giving the resources, the funds, the information and the backup to women so that they can make healthier and saner decisions, not sitting in judgment in the way that Senator Harradine has done.

He is opposed to women having access to abortifacients and his amendments are designed to achieve a ban on abortifacients here in Australia. I do not doubt that he will achieve that through the passing of those amendments with the support of Liberal and Labor parties.

        For women in Australia, it will be back to a choice basically of surgical intervention or no intervention at all. To put the other side yet again and to say that I am not alone in my opposition to what he is doing here, I have faxes from a number of groups such as the National Council of Women, the Doctors Reform Society, the Australian Women's Health Network, as well as many from the Family Planning Association.

This is an important bill, and I will go to the reasons in a moment.

        One would expect that in their first approach to this chamber with such a piece of legislation they would be careful to set the tone for their administration on these matters. In question time over the last sitting period we have heard government ministers in their answers to any questions which related to the economy refer to the so&amp;hyphen;called `Beazley $8 billion black hole'. We have heard that ad nauseam. Indeed, it seems to be an obligation on government ministers to repeat that phrase at least 50 times during every question time. What they are referring to is not, as they term it, the `Beazley $8 billion black hole', but rather the `Costello con'. In technical terms they are referring to a forecast of what the budget deficit may be based on, parameters that the Treasury identified to the government after the election. Those parameters will change substantially between now and when the budget comes down. Any one of those parameters will dramatically affect the level of the deficit.

         The whole edifice of the government's approach to this budget is based on the fallacious assertion of the so-called $8 billion black hole. It is avidly repeated as the justification for widespread cuts to programs which are ideologically inspired—ideological not in the sense that the government has any particular ideological conviction about balancing its budget, because the coalition's last performances in office do not demonstrate any such conviction whatsoever, but in the sense that it believes in small government and a smaller private sector. Under the cloak of this oft repeated phrase, it is about reducing the size of government services which impact most of all on those in needy positions in our society.

         I have gone into that preamble because this is the first bill that the government has presented to this chamber in which it seeks to raise revenue. Had we continued in government, it is a bill that we would have, in every respect bar one, presented to this chamber. Indeed, when we were in government, we did present it to this chamber, but it lapsed on the parliamentary

         The extraordinary thing about this bill, which is the one thing different in this legislation from what we had last presented, is that this bill gives money away. It gives money away to quarriers of limestone and part of the rural community. This is at a time when the government is bellowing from the rooftops that everyone should tighten their belts, that programs should be cut and that people should do more with less. It gives money away at a time when welfare is on the table for the scalpel and when, as we heard from the higher education people just this week, education programs are to be cut. At a time of budget stringency, the extraordinary thing about the first bill the government presents to this chamber is that it will give money away. The government estimates the amount it will give away to be in the order of $600,000. It is more than that, but I just cannot turn up the actual reference.

My recollection is that when we were in government and when we looked at the cost of this provision, the cost estimated to us was in the range between $250,000 and $2 million. It may well be that better calculations have been made to give more precision to the figure. Certainly, I intend to ask questions of that nature in the committee stage, or maybe Senator Parer, who on behalf of the government is shepherding this bill through this chamber, might care to give us, when he replies to the speeches in the second reading debate, some greater specificity as to how that figure is calculated. From my tenure as a minister in the previous government, I recollect that when this bill came through there was a range, and it was between $250,000 and $2 million.

          But whether it was 1c or $2 million, the principle is the same.

I believe that what we have here in this example is gross and clear hypocrisy by the government.

           this chamber. As part of the budget process last year, the then government, the now opposition, recognised that revenue was haemorrhaging by virtue of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. We supported the scheme. We wanted to continue the scheme, but we wanted to focus the scheme on those who had the proper entitlement to it. It is a scheme that provides a substantial rebate, and for all those who are quite properly the beneficiaries of it there are many other players out there in the community looking to minimise their taxation, or looking to evade taxation, who have tried, by resorting to the law, to extend the definition of `eligibility'. At the end of the day, funds were being paid to people that the government never intended them to be paid to. An amendment was needed to bring the act back into focus so that the intended beneficiaries were the beneficiaries, and the unintended free riders who had managed to change the law by judicial interpretation were eliminated.

          We presented the bill to this chamber. It met a barrage of opposition. One could, if one were cynical, say there was obstruction in this chamber to delay its passage. This task was made easier by the fact that there were some 28 amendments from the government to its own bill and 32 amendments from the opposition and minor parties. The bill went out and came back when it was found that those amendments were not properly transcribed. The intent of the chamber was not passed into legislation. The bill needed to come back and be regularised. I think it came back in about August last year, but it lapsed when the parliament was prorogued because, given the weight of other business, we were not able to get to it on the

We will support those parts of the bill that duplicate what we intended to do when in government. But I do not think there are grounds for supporting the bit that the govern ment has tacked on—which is a handout to their mates, a breaking of the principle of stringency, and an affront to the budget process they have set themselves. That is the approach they have taken with their first money raising bill.

I made appropriately sympathetic noises; however, on closer inspection, I find some difficulties in its drafting.

          The amendment, which we will debate at greater length in the committee stage, proposes adding provisions to the tax act rather than to this bill. The provisions would be inserted in that place in the tax act which we created when in government to deal with landcare. Landcare is, after all, the most significant environmental issue for this nation. Appropriately, when in government, we made provision in the tax act for deductions in the case of land&amp;hyphen;holders who were trying to recover their land.

          As I said, I understand and am sympathetic to the amendment but it is poorly drafted and has some technical difficulties. Under the existing act, a taxpayer gets a rebate for landcare work. The Greens' amendment proposes that if a person is not a taxpayer—that is, they are not in a situation in which they have to pay tax—they can get a cash refund for this work. The technical difficulty that I refer to is that I am not at all sure that, constitutionally, such a provision could go into the tax act and provide for a payment to a person or entity who is not a taxpayer.

While the range of the figures we were advised of when we were in government are modest to say the least, I would appreciate it if Senator Parer, when he closes the second reading debate on behalf of the government, would explain how that figure of $620,000 is calculated so that the efficacy of that amount can be tested. I support those parts of the bill that I referred to but oppose the last bit and I would appreciate some further explanation from the government.

        <break page="831" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, is essentially the same as that presented last year by the former government but with the addition of a rebate for quarrying limestone for agricultural use.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We acknowledge the importance of de&amp;hyphen;acidification, and the Greens (WA) certainly wish to support this important soil treatment. I do, however, have a few questions. Last year I made the point that soil treatment for de&amp;hyphen;acidification is already 100 per cent deductible under 75D(1B)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There were apparently some doubts, due to a poorly worded Department of Primary Industries and Energy pamphlet, but these doubts have been clarified, and I understand that the situation that caused them to arise has been clarified.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Applying limestone for de&amp;hyphen;acidification is 100 per cent deductible. My understanding is that deductions can also be carried forward under the income equity provisions that allowed businesses with good and bad years to spread costs and obligations. I also pointed out that although limestone has other agricultural uses, use for de&amp;hyphen;acidification generally involves periodic application on a cycle of between four and 10 years. This makes it somewhat easier for farmers to choose the timing of outlays to correspond with what looks like a good year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I make that point because at issue is the perennial problem that for farmers landcare expenses involve up-front outlays of capital, where there is no assurance that income will be sufficient to make tax deductibility relevant. In other words, a tax deduction gives no benefit unless there is enough tax obligation for it to be fully used.

         My understanding of the current government amendment is that the intention is to benefit farmers in the interest of landcare. It is not, in my understanding, mainly intended to benefit limestone quarries. The purpose is to reduce the sale cost of limestone to farmers using it for de&amp;hyphen;acidification.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Since that is the case, I have real concerns that the government may be creating major problems for itself by setting up an unworkable distinction. The diesel used in limestone quarrying for soil de&amp;hyphen;acidification in agriculture is extreme ly difficult to differentiate from limestone quarried for other purpose. I think they will be placing a very large burden on inspectors and some significant compliance costs on quarries, which will presumably have to prove their claims against an Australian Tax Office audit. While it is clearly the intention that quarries should make the distinction, do the paperwork and pass on the benefits to farmers, there is no guarantee that this will happen. There is no stipulation that benefits should be passed on.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government appears to be making the assumption that, because limestone use for cement is generally ground much more finely, it is therefore simple to distinguish non&amp;hyphen;agricultural uses. I remind them that limestone used for cement is less than half the limestone produced, and total agricultural use is about three per cent. Limestone for construction and aggregates is much more difficult to distinguish from agricultural use than cement, and agricultural use is not confined to the definition in the government amendment. Limestone is used for soil dressing for purposes other than de&amp;hyphen;acidification, and also used for on&amp;hyphen;farm roads and other purposes. I really do not think that it will be so easy to distinguish in an audit and, in any case, will require record keeping of evidence by the quarry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also note the quarries have indicated that they would like to expand this window of opportunity. In the committee last year, they talked about the cost of limestone for agriculture, including the cost of roadworks, clearing the overburden, and other costs extremely difficult to separate from general quarry costs, unless the agricultural limestone comes from a separate quarry—which is extremely unlikely and probably uneconomic, adding substantially to the cost.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I imagine that quarries may consider the whole thing too hard and not bother with the paperwork, and could charge farmers a standard rate for limestone. I imagine that even if they wished to give farmers some advantage, it would not be full advantage of the rebate, since the quarries have entailed real costs and to pass on all the advantage would make the rebate a negative benefit for the quarries. Either way, the benefit to farmers would be
        <break page="832" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         substantially less than might be imagined from this legislation. The costs in terms of ATO auditing and monitoring will be imposed on government, and there is potential for revenue leakage to other areas of limestone quarrying, which is by far the major purpose of limestone quarrying. This amendment is meant to benefit farmers. I notice that I am short of time. I will endeavour to explain my amendments to Senator Cook, who has questions about them, when I complete my speech.

        I rise to speak on the Australia&amp;hyphen;Indonesia security agreement. This agreement, signed by Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas and former foreign minister Gareth Evans on 18 December in Jakarta, is another indictment of Australia's human rights approach. It smacks of the continuing superiority of Defence riding roughshod over foreign affairs and human rights policy. It is also a slap in the face for indigenous people fighting for self&amp;hyphen;determination and democratic rights in Indonesia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition government's response to this treaty in December was one of democratic process—hardly the central issue, although it was significant. The present Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who at the time was the shadow minister, responded aptly with comments that the definition of `adverse challenges' in the treaty was too broad and should have been limited to `external challenges'. The coalition has since been silent about the breadth of the treaty and has been busy working to upgrade it through annual security `Polmin' talks between Indonesian and Australian foreign affairs and defence ministers.

         Both approaches by the major parties have put security issues above human rights, and will put Australia in a difficult position in lining up with Indonesian security concerns with others in the region. Despite the coalition's noises before the election to further the issue of East Timor during their time in government, this treaty and its proposed strengthening may well set back the cause of East Timor many years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australia&amp;hyphen;Indonesia security agreement is a slap in the face for East Timor and an injustice to the people fighting for self-determination in Indonesia. Article 2 of the treaty is the most serious component which binds Australia into complicity with helping to combat Indonesia's security threats. Article 2 of the treaty states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Parties undertake to consult each other in the case of adverse challenges to either party or to their common security interests and, if appropriate, consider measures which might be taken either individually or jointly and in accordance with the processes of each Party.
        </para>
        <para>
         Indonesia, as we all know, does not face external threats but focuses its military strength on perceived internal security threats such as people fighting for self-determination, democratic rights, freedom of speech and the right to unionisation. Therefore, due to the broad wording which makes reference to any `adverse challenges to either party', it is highly likely that Australia at some stage may be called upon to assist with civil conflict in areas such as East Timor, Aceh and West Papua. Both East Timor and West Papua have Australian economic interests such as oil investments and the 18 per cent owned Freeport goldmine which could be deemed to be within Australia's security interests to protect.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This treaty does not necessarily invoke an obligation for Australia to intervene in Indonesia's security problems but it does give a treaty basis for Australia to get involved if it wants to and allows Indonesians to ask us to get involved with Australia having to answer a public yes or no, making it difficult for us to object.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a sad and shocking situation where Australia cannot see the links between its role
         <break page="833" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in overseas development and security challenges to itself. Australian companies have been involved in developments such as the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea; Freeport mine in West Papua, which is 18 per cent Australian owned; and Australian subsidiary CRA in Bougainville. These mines have all led to environmental degradation and insecurity, social and economic inequality. These are the roots of conflict which have been violently suppressed by the national governments in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and have resulted in countless cases of human rights abuse.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia then sees this visible conflict as a threat to itself and sees this as a justification for arming and training the oppressors. This goes on at the expense of the ordinary people fighting for democracy, political and civil rights and freedom of expression—things that Australia is meant to value and work towards as a decent international citizen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This treaty then is about keeping and strengthening this amoral and unethical relationship with Indonesia. Instead of pressing this regime to change the way it treats its people, we help them to suppress them. We do this to protect our economic investments that were never viable if they were not environmentally sustainable. We also do this to placate a regime which can secure our investments for us through violence and repression. We do this out of some ridiculous notion that Indonesian internal threats, or pro self-determination and democracy movements, are somehow a threat to us.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government should wake up and deal with the roots of conflict, bringing in codes of conduct for companies operating overseas, and it should monitor the human rights situation closely. There are projects proposed that could ignite such as Bougainville. West Papua and Lihir are often mentioned. Our aid programs could do more to harvest community development which makes the community self&amp;hyphen;sustaining. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        This document is from the Australian Science and Technology Council, a council comprised of eminent Australians most of whom are scientists but some of whom are social scientists—not scientists in the sense classically ascribed to physicists, chemists or engineers. They are all eminent and are all concerned to try to peer into the future to see what Australia's needs will be in the year 2010.

        This is a report that rightly comes to the Senate under the hand of the current Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), and I acknowledge that. Nonetheless, and I might say this with some pride, it is a report that I was associated with in its infancy. The council approached me as the then science minister indicating their intention to carry out a foresight study in order to anticipate Australia's future needs so that we could better plan to meet those needs in a more intelligent way.

        It is not for me to go on and try to paraphrase what is an excellent and full report. To do so would be to do an injustice to it because I would miss elements and nuances that are quite important. What I do want to say is that this report comes down very much on the side of encouraging an innovation culture in Australia: a culture of being able to adapt existing modes of doing things to new stimuli or new needs in society by keeping a flexible and open mind; of being able to take the best of what is around and use it in a way that meets the social, economic, community and political needs of our society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is against that background that I find it absolutely unbelievable that the coalition should have forecast just before the election—without sufficient notice for industry to deal with it—and now, in government, seems hell&amp;hyphen;bent on pursuing the entire abolition of the programs enunciated by us in government in the innovation statement. Australians have got too used to seeing inventions in this country commercialised by foreigners, to the greater reward of those foreign corporations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The innovation statement was about setting a national innovation agenda in place so that the creativity of Australian scientists could be brought to the market as goods or services by Australian firms to win a greater place for Australian companies, and greater and more intelligent employment by Australians, in the world market place. The government has announced all of that is to go by the board.
