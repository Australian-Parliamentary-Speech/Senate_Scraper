        Mac Holten was born on 29 March 1922 and was educated at Scotch College in Melbourne. At the age of 19 Mac enlisted in the RAAF, serving as a flying instructor and test pilot until 1946, when he left the air force with the rank of Flight Lieutenant. Mac was a retail grocer before entering federal politics.

       <para first-indent="16">
        He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1958 when he won the Victorian seat of Indi for the Country Party. In his maiden speech to the parliament he reflected on his wide-ranging concerns, from education and the importance of research, to assistance for home ownership, to the difficulties faced by primary producers and industries, to foreign policy where he perceived that Australia's traditional ties with Britain and the United States must be juxtaposed with

        During his 19 years in this parliament, Mac contributed actively to the work of a number of parliamentary committees. He served on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1962 to 1966, the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works from 1967 to 1969, and the House Committee from 1974 to 1977. He was Minister for Repatriation from 1969 to 1972, and from 1971 to 1972 was also Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry.

        Mac's public service did not cease after his departure from federal politics. In 1980 he was appointed Administrator of the Territory of Christmas Island. In that same year, he was appointed a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George, CMG, for his parliamentary and community service.

        He will be sadly missed by those of us who knew him as a colleague and as a friend and, I should say, from my own experience of him, as a very good footballer and as a very good representative of the north-east of Victoria.

        As Senator Alston has indicated, Mac Holten was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Indi, in Victoria, in 1958 and he held that seat for nearly 20 years. He had a parliamentary career that was very meritorious indeed. He really did devote those two decades of his life to serving the people of Indi, to representing them very effectively here in the parliament and making sure that Canberra heard of their concerns.

        Mac Holten was born on 29 March 1922 and was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne. He was an immensely talented footballer. I know Senator Alston would be interested in this. He had an 80&amp;hyphen;game career with Collingwood and went on to coach the Magpies to a record four consecutive premierships. He was also a talented cricketer, playing at district level with the Melbourne Cricket Club and was heavily involved in local cricket, focusing on junior development.

        In his first speech he foreshadowed some of the policy areas that he intended to pursue: primary industry, decentralisation, trade and education. He highlighted the great necessity of higher and technical education for all school leavers, the need for the government to facilitate the development of inland centres and the difficulties that were being faced by the dairy and wool industries at that time. He spoke prophetically of the need for stimulating reciprocal trade activities with the South East Asian nations, particularly the large market of Indonesia, an approach that he was later to pursue in his role of Assistant Trade Minister.

        Mac Holten was an extremely hardworking and effective repatriation minister during the Gorton government. He was a staunch advocate for the veteran community and endeavoured to introduce constructive measures to improve their lives and those of their families. Key legislative initiatives he oversaw included removing the remaining discriminatory limitation for compensation benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, providing guide dogs for blind veterans as part of their rehabilitation treatment, increasing living allowances under the soldiers' children education scheme, which provided education assistance for children of deceased, blinded or disabled servicemen.

         —Senator Boswell, my colleague, is quite right to say that Mr Holten made an immense contribution to this nation both in times of peace and in times of war. But it is sometimes too easy for us just to look at the bare facts of a person's parliamentary career without ever looking at the character of the person in question, especially those of us who have not shared parliamentary service with the person in question.

        I was talking to one of the late Mr Holten's parliamentary colleagues from the other place this morning. He told me about the time he attended his first question time as a minister, immensely fearful that he was going to get asked a question which he would not be able to answer. He was sitting next to Mac Holten. Mac Holten, to keep him calm and relaxed during question time, proceeded to tell him jokes because apparently Mac was a great yarner in the country tradition and a great joke teller.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mac had just finished telling this tale about dad and Dave when the minister was asked a question by somebody on the other side. So he went up to the dispatch box and said: `Mr Speaker, I was wondering if the honourable member opposite could repeat the question because I did not hear it. Mr Holten had just told me a dirty joke.' The Speaker said: `Look, you are not here to tell jokes or listen to them; you are here to answer questions. So get on with it.'

         But that was the nature of Mac Holten. He was a great character, a great yarner and a great story teller. But, more than that, he was the epitome of a great Australian. He was a great sportsman, captain coach for Collingwood and a fearless, brave and dedicated Hurricane pilot in the Second World War. It is sobering for us to think of men like Mac Holten and others who have helped forge the character of our nation and to ask whether we who are here today can contribute as much or are as deserving of the legacy that they leave. I think that is the most important thing we consider today—that we make ourselves worthy of the legacy of those who have gone before.

          —The opposition will be agreeing with this motion. I think we need to state a few matters so that they are clearly on the record. When this matter was presented to the Selection of Bills Committee, a report came back to this chamber concerning the reporting date. It was originally proposed by me, in terms of the reference of this very important bill, that the reporting date be 28 November.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I received assurances from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that the committee ought to be able to extend the amended date if it could be found that that reporting date could not be accommodated within the program of the committee or the program of the chamber. It was clear to me at that time that the proposal could not and would not work because it would not be possible to do justice to the issues involved in the inquiry in that time and, given the sitting patterns established by this chamber, that it would not be possible to report within that time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to emphasise just how important this inquiry is. It will involve the expenditure of some $14 billion. It goes to a matter whereby the government will be introducing probably the most radical change in education policy in 30 years—that is, its plan to abolish the new schools policy. It will see an extraordinarily radical shift in the allocation of resources between the public and private education sectors in this country. It will involve very significant changes to targeted education programs. It will quite adversely affect a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          number of states, particularly my own, where in recent times we have seen substantial attacks upon the education system by the Kennett government, which to some extent have been alleviated by the actions of the federal Labor government.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under these proposals that protection will be lifted. We will see a dramatic movement in funds from the state education system to the private education system and, in particular, a shift of funds to Queensland where it just so happens that there are a very large number of marginal seats. We will see the introduction of a new allocation mechanism for the distribution of public moneys to the private sector on a basis which I believe has not been subjected to proper scrutiny by this parliament or by the education community at large. In the estimates process we have already seen revealed the fact that the department has not given adequate consideration to the technical issues involved in the distribution of moneys from the targeted educational programs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not just state systems that will be adversely affected in my state as a result of these changes; the Catholic education system will be affected as well. It is not just public schools but Catholic schools as well which will see a dramatic shift in resources to private schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we put that on top of the proposed changes to this government's deregulated new schools policy where we will see significant changes introduced which will mean the removal of minimum requirements for enrolments, a shift in the categories that can be used for the allocation of moneys and the removal of any commitment to proper planning in the allocation of schools in any particular district, we can see that all those elements combined produce an emerging pattern which we have already seen in other areas of the education sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee proposes to speak with some very important witnesses and it will be calling for public submissions; the advertisements will appear in the press this weekend. Therefore, to suggest that this matter could have been dealt with as originally presented to this chamber by the Selection of Bills Committee,
         <break page="4357" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and which has now obviously had to be amended by Senator Tierney's motion, demonstrates to me yet again that this government ought to be managing its affairs a lot better than it is.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill will not even be in this chamber until early November at the very best of reckonings. Frankly, I wonder whether it will be here then. The proposition that the reporting date be 14 November is totally inappropriate in the circumstances. As a consequence, the opposition welcomes Senator Tierney's motion today for an extension of time for the committee to report on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill. For the future, I would ask that proper consideration be given to these matters beforehand, that there be adequate consultation with the opposition and that our advice, when it is sought, be acted upon.

        —by leave—The opposition has indicated to the government that it will be supporting the government's proposals in relation to sitting days. It is an unusual circumstance to have the parliament sit for four straight weeks. The opposition have waited until this week, until the government finalised its proposals to the Senate on what sitting weeks were appropriate for this calendar year. The opposition, in order to assist the government with the facilitation of its legislative program, has proposed that two sitting Fridays be added to the government's announced program, and that a further two Fridays—29 November and 13 December—also be agreed to as a result of this particular motion standing in the name of Senator Campbell.

       I also indicate that the opposition proposed to the government, and the government accepted, that, because of the number of speakers on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Senate sit through to midnight on the Tuesday of the past sitting week. The government agreed that that was a sensible course of action, given the interest in the workplace relations bill second reading debate—a debate which concluded yesterday.

       I might say that, for the opposition's part, we did indicate that we would support the government's proposal. Originally the government had suggested three sitting weeks to conclude our sittings for this year. I think it is fair to say that the government wanted to review this situation, given that the visit of the President of the United States has been confirmed and there is a proposal for a joint sitting of the houses of parliament on 20 November.

       The government has come back with this proposition that the parliament sit from Monday, 18 November right through to Friday, 13 December. The opposition does not oppose this. I am pleased to see that Senator

       I want to place on record that it is rather a unique situation in recent years in this parliament to have an opposition agreeing to such lengthy parliamentary sittings. I think this does reflect the fact that this opposition always accepts that we are not only an opposition but also an alternative government. We do understand that there are significant responsibilities in the Senate to allow a government's reasonable legislative program to be presented and dealt with by the parliament.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is unusual to see the opposition in the Senate take this course of action, because over the last few years the coalition, in opposition, at every turn tried to stymie and obstruct the former Labor administration in its attempts to see its legislative program dealt with in a proper way. I do appreciate that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, has acknowledged that the opposition has been very cooperative in this regard. We will continue to ensure that we fulfil our responsibilities to the parliament while we are progressing issues of ministerial accountability and other issues of great importance in this chamber.

       I said in a meeting that was convened by Senator Hill earlier in the week that I thought that the government's latest proposals were far more realistic. We argue in the Labor Party that one of the real values of motions like this is to give all senators some certainty about what the sitting times of the Senate are going to be. While this is going to be a long, hard road—particularly the four straight sitting weeks—at least we now have a situation where senators can plan outside those

        We do not know the circumstances of that shipping disaster as very scant detail is available. It is presumed that many of the sheep were burnt. Whatever happened, they all went to the bottom of the ocean with the ship. There is a real question mark hanging over the measures to ameliorate conditions on the ship for those sheep. If I recollect correctly, unlike New Zealand, we do not have rules in place to ensure surveillance by professional veterinary officers over the conditions of the animals aboard these ships. Whatever the case, even without this disaster, we know that some 50,000 to 100,000 live sheep die in transit on the oceans out of this country every year, and that is a matter of very serious concern. An inquiry into this disaster could do nothing but good.

I reiterate: it is a very urgent topic, not because we ordain it so, but because a ship has just sunk in the ocean while carrying 67,000 live sheep. This opportunity should not be lost to establish a full ranging inquiry to avoid such incidents in the future and to better settle our conscience regarding the way in which millions of animals are treated on their way to ports out of Australia in the years ahead.

One might say that that is a preference, and it is a market preference, but there are perhaps other good reasons why Australian value adding ought to be looked at in a different way. Why is Australian killed meat not considered acceptable? Perhaps we ought to look at that issue.

         The third point that needs to be made is that we are debating this morning a motion that is about the live sheep trade but, as we all know, the debate at large is about the trade in live animals. It extends to live cattle as well, because that group of people who want to shut down this trade also want to shut down the trade in live cattle. That is a matter of public record and, of course, they are entitled to that view.

         As Senator Margetts correctly referred to this morning, live cattle exports are important for regional Australia. That is why it is important for me, not simply as the shadow minister for primary industries but as a Northern Territory senator, to again put our view on this issue on the record. Some $160 million in trade might not be huge bickies for Australia in the global economic picture but it is absolutely crucial in terms of the regional economy that generates that trade. I am talking about the live cattle trade from northern Australia into principally countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.

          Over the last three or four years that trade has grown from $20 million or $30 million a year to currently $130 million or $140 million a year and it is going up. The animal welfare nature of that trade is excellent. I say that because I have personally been on board the ships and inspected the conditions under which those cattle are exported. I can say categorically from personal experience that, in welfare terms, conditions on board the ships are significantly better than the conditions in the paddocks from which a lot of these animals come. There is ample space, scrupulously clean conditions, plenty of room for each individual animal—

It has been a mark of the live trade that those countries that are taking our live exports are also taking a continually increasing amount of our chilled and frozen product as the ability to buy continually improves and as the tastes of people in those countries changes.

           There are also a number of aspects of the trade—which Senator Margetts might find interesting if she is not familiar with them; and she may be—that make it very unique. Senator Margetts mentioned this morning the requirement in some of these countries for fresh meat. There is no question about that. In other words, for cultural and all sorts of other reasons there is a preference on the part of the customers to not have chilled or frozen meat. The customers may prefer meat that has been freshly prepared rather than slaughtered and dressed out weeks or even months before and chilled or frozen.It is a fact that that is changing and there is a growing demand for chilled and frozen product. This is growing at the same time as our live export trade is growing.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There is another matter that has to be raised in this regard. In some of the countries into which we are exporting live product there is a substantial lack of transport infrastructure and chiller infrastructure. In other words, the infrastructure that allows chilled and frozen product to be moved in that condition from the wharf to a central facility and then to the consumer does not exist.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I want to make the point because a lot of people even in the Northern Territory are not aware that, with respect to that live trade, other important services are provided to the rural communities in those countries to which we export the live product. A lot of people who are aware that the trade exists do not realise this happens. Cattle are exported from the port of Darwin to our near neighbours and are bought by a central agency. The cattle are then farmed out in small lots—two or three animals—to villages and individual families. It was when I saw this happening that I realised the important structural implications and why I am confident that trade has a long future ahead of it—and I note Senator Crane is nodding his head.

           The encouraging thing is—I am pleased Senator Crane supported me in this contention just a few minutes ago—that whilst we are continuing to put a live product into these markets, at the same time there is a clearly measurable increase in the amount of chilled and frozen products that are going into the same market. The Australian product generally has a reputation for quality, and the tastes of those markets are changing. People are buying Australian chilled and frozen products rather than somebody else's. The live trade helps that.

It is a vitally important market for regional Australia. In the case of the live cattle trade from the Northern Territory, I have to say to Senator Margetts that over the last three or four years, with desperately bad drought conditions and a collapse in the price, it has been a market that

           In conclusion, to move to what is currently happening—Senator Brownhill has canvassed this—there are an important number of things about this particular incident that need to be put on the record. There is an investigation taking place into the sinking of the

            Uniceb
           </emphasis>
           . AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, has already indicated formally Australia's interest in this investigation and I know, from my own experience with AMSA, that that is something they will follow through.

           When the report on the sinking is available and has been finalised—I have had this assurance from the minister—if there are defects or aspects that the investigation raises that are of continuing concern in an animal welfare sense or any other sense, then Australia will reserve the right to continue that investigation under its own auspices. But it is important to make the point that, because of the area where this sad event occurred, we have no rights to involve ourselves in that investigation or legally to demand the cooperation of any of the parties involved in it.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In other words, the appropriate investigation where these matters can be raised is being made now. We have formally indicated our desire to be a party to it. But we have no rights under the international maritime conventions to which we are signatories to compel, in any investigation this Senate might initiate, the cooperation of anybody. The investigation that does have those rights is under way now.

            There are further—this is also important—investigations being conducted by the Bureau of Resource Sciences, which is undertaking research into the occurrence of disease among livestock exports with a view to being able to recommend to government actions that might be taken to further improve this situation. A study is currently under way in the bureau to determine what, if anything, needs to be done to improve ventilation, for example, on livestock vessels, especially to cope with the high Middle East temperatures that are experienced during the summer months. AMSA has also been asked to review the design pens and loading densities.

            I want to conclude on the question of vets, which is included in the motion. It has certainly been my experience, in the investigations that have been conducted into this trade, that there are very few occasions where having veterinary surgeons on board ships would have made any material difference to the problems that commonly occur on those ships in respect of the animals. There is a requirement—I think a proper requirement—for mandating a minimum standard of experience for the people who actually look after the stock on board and there is a requirement for those people to be experienced in the handling and care of that stock.

There is a further protection—I think a proper one—that has been introduced in terms of the continuing attention that has been paid to the question of animal welfare, and that is that under AQIS's arrangements there is now a requirement for the clearance of stock by a qualified veterinary surgeon prior to their departure. AMSA are required to certify, from an animal welfare perspective, that the ship is in a proper condition to carry animals. A veterinary inspection and certification are required that the animals themselves are in a healthy condition prior to departure.

            The reason I make these points is to prove that Australia has nothing at all to fear or to be concerned about in respect of the strictness with which these trades are supervised. Everyone acknowledges that there can be further improvements with these trades. I might add in respect of the Northern Territory that there has been a dramatic improvement in the standard of the vessels that are being used now to carry cattle to the point where in animal welfare terms they represent five star accommodation. I have seen that myself with forced draft ventilation and high quality food for the animals carried on board and so on. It is a very high standard indeed. The Bureau of Animal Resource Sciences is continuing to carry out research as to how the situation can be further improved.

         —Good. I want to underline that I believe that what we are doing by not passing this motion is not reassuring the people who are concerned about the cruelty which is involved from time to time in this trade. The Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare tabled a report about live sheep export 10 years ago. For the students of history, the committee was chaired by former Senator George Georges from Queensland, a friend of mine. It included my Democrat colleague from Western Australia, former Senator Jack Evans, and former National Party Senate leader Senator Scott from New South Wales. It was a very good report. The report came to this conclusion:

        If a decision were to be made on the future of the trade purely on animal welfare grounds, there is enough evidence to stop the trade. The trade is, in many respects, inimical to good animal welfare,

        The committee went on to acknowledge that the animal welfare aspects of the trade could not be divorced from economic and other considerations. I am very aware of that. The live cattle trade and the live export sheep trade has been the only thing that has kept our wool industry and our cattle industry afloat. The rest of it has been bad news, but the live animal trade has enabled them to survive. So I am aware of those economic and other considerations. The committee recommended a range of reforms aimed at alleviating at least some of the suffering of the sheep. More importantly, the committee recognised the need to develop a long term solution. It recognised that the substitution of the refrigerated sheep meat trade offers such a solution.

         —Yes, I am certainly aware of that. But let me point out, Senator Collins, that the information I have contradicts what you said. So it may be that we will need to consult later on. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation advised my office—I hope Senator Collins is listening—that the frozen carcass trade actually declined by nearly half last financial year due to the product simply not being available during the peak supply period. That is an interesting statistic. I do not know whose information is correct; I am simply giving you what the Australian Meat and Live&amp;hyphen;stock Corporation advised my office. We will have to compare our sources, I think, and find out what the true situation is. But that certainly would seem to indicate that priority in supply is being given to the live sheep trade over the carcass trade.

        My problem with this motion—and on the surface it looks perfectly all right—is that, firstly, it cannot be implemented with any force whatsoever or with any effectiveness and, secondly, what it is actually seeking to have done is being done or has already been done. So we have a motion before us which can go nowhere and in effect do very little. There is already a commitment, if we are not satisfied with what comes out of the international inquiry, that the government will take further action on this issue.

         —I can too. I make the point that you cannot deal with this in isolation. I recognise that this economic argument that it costs jobs in Australia has been argued many times. But I want to refer people to the Geoff Miller report that was done in the early 1980s. I am not sure if it was at the end of the Fraser government or the beginning of the Hawke government, but that goes into the whole economic structure of what occurs in the live sheep trade.

        The particular point is that, when the live sheep trade out of this country drops off, substitution comes in and those live sheep then go into the meatworks. The amount of mutton that was being processed through the meatworks from other sheep that were not suitable for live shipment then drops off, and the net result is that the vast majority of those sheep that were previously going through the abattoirs get shot. It is as simple as that. In practice, that is what happens. There is a direct substitution, as you go down the line, when live sheep trade drops off. That is very important. When looking at the economics of this particular trade, we must take into account the production stage, the abattoir stage, the live sheep trade stage and the production of sheep foodstuff that goes onto the ships.

        was subjected to an AMSA safety inspection in May 1996 and was passed as fit for operation in Australian waters. It was again inspected for animal welfare conditions prior to its loading in Fremantle, immediately before its last voyage. So, in debating this issue, we cannot say that the processes that have been put in place were not adequate. The reason I referred to the past is that there have been, are and will continue to be improvements in this particular trade.

        I wish to also emphasise the point, having been on the modern ships, that the sheep go through pre&amp;hyphen;feeding and other processes before they go on the ship—they do not go directly onto the ship—and in fact in many instances the sheep live in better conditions than they actually do out in the paddock. The improvement that has occurred there is very significant.

        I want to now re&amp;hyphen;emphasise a point Senator Bob Collins made earlier. With the development of the live sheep trade into many of these countries, the consumption of processed meats has been gradually going up and will continue to go up. That is part of the process. There may come a time when the economics will indicate that most, if not all, of the meat will be processed. I doubt whether it will ever be all because there are other issues, such as

        One of the things that is very important to the people in the Middle East is the fact that those animals can actually walk around the place. That is how they take them and utilise many of them. When we do not supply them, they come from countries north of them or from South America, potentially from South Africa or from other countries. So there is a direct substitution for the live sheep trade.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One must also acknowledge—with the sadness of this particular event I mentioned—that sheep get burnt when fires get away from national parks. Do we legislate against that? I have also seen situations where floods have occurred and sheep have been drowned. It is all very sad, but these things, unfortunately, are realities of life.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to acknowledge and congratulate all those people who over the last 20 to 25 years have been involved in the process of gradually improving the conditions in the live sheep trade. In mentioning that, I must also include in that the road transport sector, which is a very important part of it. If we look at the trucks that carry the stock today compared to those that existed 10, 15, 20 or 25 years ago, you really do see the Rolls Royce of invention, of modification, of application. There has been an enormous improvement in the training that is given to the people who drive those trucks by the various operators.

        I will conclude my remarks by re-emphasising that it is indeed an unfortunate incident that occurred. We have to work to improve the situation. I look forward to the outcome of the international report. If I am not satisfied with that report when it comes before us, I will, as I am sure other senators in this place will, proceed or endeavour to have additional work done on this issue. In the meantime, I believe it is pointless for this place to pass a motion which cannot implement anything more. In fact, it would not go as far as the action that has already been taken.

        I need to take up one point that I have mentioned privately to Senator Brownhill. Senator Brownhill gave an indication, presumably from a briefing note that he has, that the Greens did not take up an offer to change the wording of the motion or to defer it. We did defer the motion; in fact we have deferred it a couple of times. I believe the briefing is out of date. So I believe it is necessary for Senator Brownhill at the first available time to correct the inference that was given because, quite late last night, the office of Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy, contacted my office saying, in effect, that all bets were off and that the motion would be opposed. It is fine for the motion to be opposed, but it is simply not true that the Greens were not interested in changing the

        An Australian cargo was involved. The indication is that Australia has no rights to conduct an investigation. It is true that Australia has no rights under the international convention to either participate in an investigation or to insist on access from the flag registry, the underwriters or the owners. That does not mean to say that Australia has no rights to an investigation.

We have had debates here about the ability of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to undertake adequate inspections. I am on record as saying that the resources that are available to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority simply do not give it the ability to make full and adequate safety inspections. In the past we have had very damning reports from the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General indicating similar things, that there have been problems.

What did AMSA inspect, and what was the basis of its being able to say it was fit for operation? If it is as a result of a lack of resources that AMSA was not alerted to potential problems, or if it is something that was nothing whatever to do with adequate inspection, we are entitled to know these things. If we see what is an AMSA report, that is fine, but perhaps there needs to be some scrutiny as to whether AMSA simply has a lack of resources or whether something different is the problem.

         I am pleased to see that there is some interest. A number of people have been alerted to the issue and will be watching carefully for, firstly, the outcome of the international investigation and, secondly, the AMSA response. You can be sure that we will revisit this debate when we hear that response. If it be a matter of AMSA resourcing, the Australian government has a responsibility to address the matter. If AMSA does not have proper resources—I am just surmising that—it has to be dealt with.

         I also want to deal briefly with comments that Senator Bob Collins made in relation to the cattle trade. Senator Collins made an assumption which, I believe, was unwarranted. The assumption was that if I move a motion in relation to the standards of the shipping of live sheep, I am associated automatically with an attack on the live cattle export trade.

         Those reasons include the fact that there is a great deal of concern about the level of overstocking and land degradation in pastoral areas of Western Australia. One way of getting cattle growers to look after their land better and not overstock it is by convincing them to produce higher value breeding stock. That is an issue which we, as well as other people in the community, are considering.

         Further, there is no single opinion on the farming of native animals. There are people in the environment movement who believe that emus and kangaroos should not be considered for farming. There are other people in the environment movement who believe it is more beneficial to the environment to farm animals appropriate to our environment and climate. That debate still occurs and it is very healthy.

         It is wrong to assume that there is one view in the environment movement, and it is wrong to assume that there is one view among the Greens in relation to these issues. It is right to assume that these debates should occur. The problem is suggesting that the issue is about animal exports in general. That detracts from the fact that because sheep exports are, on a unit by unit basis, a much lower value product, the pressures, understandably, are much greater on growers not to create a requirement for improved conditions.

         I can understand these issues. We should not look at them and simply say that we know that standards could be considerably better for cattle exports.

          This report is timely. It comes at a time when a major Pay TV operator is advertising a service which will consist mainly of showing R&amp;hyphen;rated material on Pay TV. The Committee is not satisfied that the concerns which it has previously expressed on this matter have been addressed before such a service is made available on subscription or pay television.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          In previous reports on this issue, the Committee indicated its belief that the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) should complete extensive Australia&amp;hyphen;wide qualitative and quantitative research on community standards of taste and decency in relation to classifications for pay television, and on what levels of violence and depiction of sex should be allowed. The Parliament also indicated its support for such research in the Schedule to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Schedule 2, Part 6). The Committee reported to the Senate in 1995 that the ABA's research was flawed and recommended that the OFLC recast the R category. In their latest report on this matter the OFLC has undertaken some minor adjustments to R but not carried out the comprehensive recast of R required by the Community Standards Committee.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          So in this report, the Committee's first major recommendation is for the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to be amended to prevent the broadcast of R&amp;hyphen;rated and X&amp;hyphen;rated material on pay TV.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee also expresses its concern in this report at the lack of accountability in the decision&amp;hyphen;making process adopted by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Censorship Ministers when making decisions in relation to the Classification Act and to the guidelines. The Committee believes that amendments to the National Code under section 6 of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1996 and determinations or amendments of the classification guidelines under section 12 should be disallowable instruments by the Commonwealth Parliament. It is recommending that the Classification Act be amended accordingly.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee is repeating its call for a restructuring of the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC). It is important that the community should perceive the OFLC to be truly reflective of community standards. One way for this to be achieved would be for the OFLC to work closely with a community committee which represents major interest groups such as parents, teachers, churches, academics, women, young people, aboriginal and ethnic groups. The Committee is recommending that such a community committee be set up and that the positions of Director and deputy Director of the Classification Board be drawn from such community representatives.

         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Film and Video Guidelines were last revised in 1988 and the Committee had recommended in Part 1 of its report tabled in February 1995, that a review of those guidelines should be undertaken. The OFLC undertook such a review last year in 1995 and the revised Guidelines were gazetted in September this year. It is those guidelines that the Committee has reviewed.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Committee recognises that the new guidelines are intended to be more strict in relation to depictions of violence and sexual violence but it is concerned that there is still a lack of precision about the criteria which is to be applied when making classification decisions. The Committee is particularly concerned to see to it that video material which enters the home environment should have lower levels of intensity in relation to depiction of violence and sexual violence. Accordingly, the Committee is recommending that separate guidelines be introduced for the classification of videotapes to ensure that higher standards are applied than for equivalent categories of film for cinema release.

          Of great concern to the Committee was the fact that video material which has been given a particular classification prior to the introduction of the system of consumer advice in 1989 and those rated M prior to the introduction of the MA classification in 1993 are still available in the community under the old classifications. The Committee believes that such material should be recalled and reclassified in the light of the newly issued stricter guidelines and it has made a recommendation to that effect.

         —When I was interrupted by a move to other business last night, I was speaking on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill and expressing considerable surprise, having sat through the same set of hearings as members of the opposition, that they could come to such radically different conclusions based on the evidence. Government senators who participated in this inquiry strongly recommended at the end of the evidence that the bill be passed in its present form.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We rejected the key recommendations of the opposition parties that Telstra remain in full public ownership. Importantly, in light of the motion foreshadowed this morning, we also rejected that the bill be split. We rejected that the $1 billion national heritage environment package be funded from other sources. We did this because we had expert witnesses appear before the committee. We had witnesses from the Department of Communications and the Arts who detailed the provisions of this bill and raised very convincing arguments that it would deliver world&amp;hyphen;class consumer protection guarantees prior to the part&amp;hyphen;privatisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The evidence that we were given completely demolished the opposition parties' attempts to make wild scaremongering claims about the loss of consumer protection when we move to the part&amp;hyphen;privatisation of Telstra. They began this scare campaign during the 1996 election and they refined this further in the debate. The universal service obligation—the USO—
        <break page="4380" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and consumer service guarantees are firmly entrenched in the Telecommunications Act of 1992. They are not diminished or affected in any way by the passage of this bill.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Telstra's obligations to the consumers are not diluted by part&amp;hyphen;privatisation, and whether ownership of Telstra will be 100 per cent public or one&amp;hyphen;third privatised has no bearing at all on the government's commitment to the USO. The bill, in fact, provides new benefits to business and a guarantee of no timed local calls for business users.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill in no way affects the existing legislative or other protections of directory assistance, untimed local calls and the provision of public telephone call boxes across Australia. For example, the USO expenditure by Telstra in the rural electorate of Grey—which would be close to your heart, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, because it is in your area and you will be heartened to know this—is $21 million and that will be retained under this legislation. Additional evidence provided to the Senate inquiry highlights how improved efficiencies in a partly privatised Telstra would flow through to the communications sector and to the wider community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Potential gains in living standards are estimated to be $2 billion. Reductions in the price of communications services are estimated to be in the order of 12 per cent. The long run gain economy wide to the GDP will be $1.7 billion and the economy wide gain in wages is estimated to be $3 a week.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Stimulation of the development of telecommunications services and equipment industries will be another beneficial outcome of a growing and robust Telstra. Service delivery to all Australians will improve considerably, as it has in a similar exercise undertaken in New Zealand. Over there, waiting time for new phone line connections is down from six weeks to three days. That is the sort of benefit you get when you bring in some of the disciplines of the marketplace. The company actually becomes responsive to what consumers want.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a bonus in all this as well in that what we are proposing keeps Telstra almost totally Australian owned. At least 88.3 per
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         cent will be off limits to foreign ownership and the maximum individual holding for any one investor in Telstra will be 1.7 per cent, accumulating to a total of 11.7 per cent for all overseas ownership.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me turn finally to the enormous benefits for rural and regional Australia of the part privatisation of Telstra. As communications costs are reduced in regional Australia, new jobs will be created. One of the great things about new technology in communications is that it does not really matter where you are located if you are on the information superhighway. It gives the nation a real opportunity to decentralise industries that do not really have to be in the centre of the major cities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reduced communications costs and new services provided will disproportionately, we believe, benefit rural and regional Australia.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The cost disadvantage of living and doing work outside metropolitan areas will come down substantially, making regions more attractive for establishing new businesses. Telephone inquiry centres for banks, company service centres, catalogue sales—these are all the sorts of things that can be located in country areas. Tele industries for airline and hotel reservations, insurance and car rental firms will also have inducements to go to rural areas, as has occurred in the United States. In places like Nebraska those sorts of industries have moved out of the big cities to rural areas because of lower costs, to the great benefit of rural employment.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Contrary to Labor's scare campaign, the part privatisation of Telstra will have positive effects on employment in the overall telecommunications sector and supplier industries. The sector is growing at 18 per cent per annum. Job cuts in Telstra will be offset by new opportunities in this sector and in the economy as a whole.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Alan Horsley from the Australian Telecommunications Users Group told the Senate inquiry that members of his industry group face a desperate shortage of qualified staff. Telstra staff are qualified and will be snapped up by new players in the communications sector. Many of these new companies will be
        <break page="4381" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         operating and offering employment in regional Australia.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition in this debate and during the Senate inquiry have peddled so&amp;hyphen;called employment `nasties' to frighten the community. Specifically, Labor has charged that massive job reductions will occur in Telstra across regional and rural Australia. These allegations are not true. Qualified Telstra technicians will win new, interesting jobs on the payroll of new telcos and communications companies. In 1996&amp;hyphen;97, 70 to 80 per cent of Telstra redundancies will occur in metropolitan areas, not rural areas. Tasmania, for example, will be affected by less than one per cent of the redundancies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Failure by Telstra to become efficient and cost effective post&amp;hyphen;1997 as a 100 per cent publicly owned company will only see Telstra lose more market share to those new, eager competitors we will be getting after the middle of next year.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Employment levels and job opportunities will really be eroded if this is allowed to happen. Telstra could become like another publicly owned dinosaur—maybe like the ANL or the National Rail Corporation.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor, in government, oversaw a very large downsizing of employment at Telstra. In 1985, Telecom employed over 90,000 people. Under the Labor government, the Telstra work force fell to 76,000 people. That had nothing to do with part privatisation. That was driven by changes in technology. All of that downsizing, I remind the Senate, occurred under full public ownership.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Technological change and progressive digitisation of the network is the thing that drives the trend. Digitisation of networks means lower operating costs for access lines and reduced employment. After a slow start, Telstra is starting to match the overseas telcos, but it is 25 per cent off the pace. The pace needs to be accelerated. It will be accelerated with the part privatisation of Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) on Telstra's timetable for upgrading the phone network. This development is a sign of the efficiencies that we can expect under part privatisation. Telstra will be
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         brought up to world standard by the passage of this bill. The open communications market post&amp;hyphen; 1997 demands that Telstra be allowed to compete effectively with new players. To oppose this bill is not to save Telstra; rather, it will sow the seeds of Telstra's decline. I support the bill and commend its passage to the Senate.

Notwithstanding that the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill currently before the Senate proposes the one&amp;hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra, we know that the real agenda of the government is the total privatisation, the total sale of Telstra.

        It has been confirmed by Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, that that is the government's real agenda. Once we proceed down the path of the partial sale of Telstra, the inevitable result will be its complete sale. What we are really debating is the future of Telstra as, firstly, a fully publicly owned corporation and, secondly, as the major corporate government asset that the people of Australia have.

        Telstra is the country's largest owned government asset. It is the people's greatest and most valuable corporate asset. The government has said that they have a mandate for this legislation. They seek to rely upon the fact that they put to the people at the last election that, if elected, they would proceed to sell one-third of Telstra and set up this phoney environment fund, which I will come back to later. They seek to rely upon the fact that because they won government—and I concede that; they won government significantly in terms of the number of seats they obtained in the House of Representatives—they somehow have a mandate from the people. I refute that. The results of the federal elections put the lie to that claim.

        The one big issue that the people were made fully aware of at this most recent
        <break page="4382" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         election in March 1996 was that, on the one hand, the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party said that they would proceed to sell Telstra and, on the other hand, the Australian Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens made it abundantly clear that they would not support the legislation and that they would proceed in the Senate to reject it.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The figures from the recent elections show that a majority of people, both in the House of Representatives elections and in the Senate, voted for the parties that were on the record as opposing the sale of Telstra. In the House of Representatives, 47.2 per cent of people voted for the Liberal and National parties. Some 38.8 per cent of people voted for the Australian Labor Party, 6.8 per cent of people voted for the Democrats and 2.9 per cent of people voted for the Greens. A total of 48.5 per cent of the Australian electorate in respect of the House of Representatives voted for the parties that were completely opposed to the sale of Telstra on the record and had put that policy to the people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So a majority of people voted against this proposal, voted for the parties that were opposed to the sale of Telstra, notwithstanding the fact that the Liberal and National parties won the majority of seats. When you come to the Senate, the figures are even more conclusive. In the Senate the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party's vote dropped to 43.47 per cent of the vote. The Australian Labor Party obtained 36.15 per cent. The Democrats increased, as one would have expected, to 10.82 per cent and the Greens increased to 3.17 per cent.

        In the Senate vote, 50.14 per cent of the Australian electorate voted for the parties that were on the record as opposing the sale of Telstra and making very clear to the Australian people that when the legislation came before the Senate they would oppose it. That compares with only approximately 43.5 per cent of people who supported the government's proposal. So let us not have any of this nonsense that somehow the government has a mandate from the people on this issue; an issue that was widely debated and fully before the public mind when it cast its votes on March 2.

         There is no doubt that the Australian people knew that, even though they were disposed to vote to remove the Labor Party after a quite lengthy period in office—not an unnatural thing, notwithstanding my great disappointment at their decision—when this legislation and some of the other policies of this government were before the Senate they could be voted down by the Australian Labor Party and the other  parties. Let me quickly turn to Telstra itself, which as I have said is the people's greatest corporate asset.

         Senator Tierney referred to the fact that job reductions have occurred, and that is conceded. But what the Labor Party did was corporatise Telstra and make it competitive. We have seen dramatic improvements in their position in recent years. The asset value of Telstra alone is in the vicinity of $24 billion and probably greater. The last recorded figures from 1994-95 show an annual revenue in the vicinity of $14 billion, a pre&amp;hyphen;tax profit of $2.4 billion and an after tax profit of $1.75 billion. In 1994-95 Telstra paid a dividend to the government of some $944 million for the year. In total, Telstra was making payments to governments of around $2.7 billion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, that performance has improved in more recent times. In the six months up to the end of 1995, the dividend paid to the government was in the vicinity of $686 million, an increase of some 66 per cent on the previous recorded figure for the relevant period. Revenue has grown by around nine per cent. Telstra has a return to equity rate of around 20.2 per cent. That is a very healthy figure. But what do we hear from the government? We hear this line that Telstra is some sort of crippled corporation that is about to fall over. Nothing could be further from the truth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We would accept that, unlike the performance of some previous government&amp;hyphen;run corporations or institutions, Telstra is a fantastic success. Its debt ratio has reduced to some 28 per cent and it has seen a substantial boost in its capital expenditure to around 45 per cent.

          Not only is Telstra still a major employer but it is also one of the major investors in capital infrastructure in this country, particularly in information technology. Telstra is not some lumbering corporation in need of massive efficiency reform and change. It has already been through that process. Telstra is at the leading edge in telecommunications in the world; that is, in its delivery, research and development, and investment in telecommunications. All of this happens when it is 100 per cent publicly owned.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I accept that not all publicly owned companies, either in the past or today, need necessarily remain in government ownership. The previous Labor government recognised that in respect of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas because the nature of the industry had changed so much. Qantas had about a 50 per cent share of the market and the Commonwealth Bank had around a 20 per cent share of the market. There was no point, notwithstanding the historical commitment of the Labor Party to that position. I for one regret it in many ways but I recognise the reality that the move had to be made.

          That is not to say that, when you look at a corporation like Telstra that is successful, viable, efficient and at the world's leading edge in terms of service delivery, you automatically have to privatise it because you have privatised some other government institutions. That is the sort of nonsense, follow&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;leader argument that we get from the government when it suits them. The sort of argument we get from the government is that, because they happen to be privatising Telecom in Albania or because Fidel Castro is going to privatise his Telecom in Cuba, Australia should do the same. That is, we should sit back and say to the Australian people, `We're going to sell off Telstra. Why? Because Albania is doing it and because Cuba is doing it.' The day we have to follow the lead of Albania and Cuba is the day we should give this business away. One could argue with a far greater degree of logic—it is a minor point but it shows the stupidity of the arguments that you get from Senator Alston, the minister—that if that is what Albania and Cuba are doing, then it is a damn good reason

          As I said, Telstra is the great shining example of how a publicly owned corporation can succeed: how it can be the world's best performer; how it can demonstrate world best practice in the whole range of its operations; and, at the same time, how it can make such a great economic and social contribution to Australia's welfare. Let me turn to some of those contributions to the welfare of the Australian people that will be affected if this bill happened to, unfortunately, pass.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We know that Telstra provides substantial benefits to rural and regional Australia. Senator Panizza should recognise this more than most, given the state from which he comes. It is trite but it needs to be said: Australia is a huge continent with a very small population. It is a continent that is larger than the size of most European countries put together but with a population of only some 18 million people, compared with the hundreds of millions of people living in Europe. Equally, the same comparison can be made with the United States.

           Australia is a sparsely populated continent, as we know. Nevertheless, out of our total population of 18 million, some 6.2 million people live outside the major urban areas of the country; that is, around 37.5 per cent of Australians live outside major urban areas. We have geographic difficulties in terms of delivering basic telecommunications services, such as telephones, to all Australians—without even considering the more sophisticated services. But, because we have always believed that Australia is a fair and equitable society and that all Australians should have access to these services, we have ensured, through the combination of full public ownership and the community service obligations, that all Australians can have access to those services at an affordable price. Just like with the ABC, another fully owned public corporation, it is important to retain Telstra in full public ownership to ensure that those people will continue to have equitable treatment when it comes to the delivery of telecom munications and the various services in that industry.

          Let us look at the level of cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation that occurs to ensure that people in rural and regional Australia are able to avail themselves of these services. I know that some of these figures have been referred to in previous speeches, but I will just run through a few of them. In a town like Bordertown in South Australia, the cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation level is of the order of $1,480 and in Naracoorte the level is $1,650. If you happen to live on Kangaroo Island, the cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation is valued at some $2,360. If you live on Flinders Island off the coast of Tasmania, $4,930 is the current value of the cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation that occurs in order to ensure that these services are delivered. If you live on King Island it is $2,220. Cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation levels in New South Wales include $880 in Bathurst and $1,500 in Deniliquin. In Rockhampton, Queensland, it is $1,020; in Albany—back to Western Australia, Senator Panizza's home state—it is $1,780; and in Ceduna, South Australia, it is some $6,800.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These massive subsidies are available to ensure that people in outlying areas can have access to affordable telecommunications. What will be the inevitable result if you privatise Telstra? You will place at risk those levels of subsidies.

It is showing the world what we can provide in terms of the development of infrastructure and the delivery of telecommunications services.

A number of years back the Australian Labor Party took steps to protect the Australian environment in Tasmania's forests, in North Queensland, in the Great Barrier Reef and other areas. We took those steps because we believed the environment was a mainstream issue and needed to be protected.

Frankly, the people who cast their votes on the last occasion want Telstra to remain in public ownership and I am confident that the Senate will equally decide that.

        We will be seeking to break that weld. Earlier today Senator Lees gave notice of our intention to move for the division of this bill into its two constituent parts—one dealing with the part sale and one dealing with improved customer services. Regardless of whether we will be debating one bill or two tomorrow, I will be moving a series of amendments to enhance consumer protection if we reach the committee stage of the debate.

        The government has attempted to bribe the Australian people by promising a world class consumer framework if one-third of Telstra is sold.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We know that task will be made more difficult in a privatised environment. Although the government has promised to retain Telstra's universal service obligation, we know that it will be quite a task to ensure that it is retained, in the long run, on a privatised carrier operating in a competitive environment.
       </para>

        The claim repeated ad nauseam by this government that public enterprises are more inefficient than private enterprises usually
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         overlooks one simple fact. Government enterprises are often charged with social objectives providing a measure of equity. These are, we think, just as important as profit making but are portrayed so often as sources of economic inefficiency and loss making.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While such objectives may impede the aim of profit making, their importance for furthering national goals or for promoting the national interest should not be underestimated. I acknowledge that the provision of the universal service obligation is not directly related to the privatisation. Provision of the universal service obligation can be continued under direction of legislation, irrespective of whether or not Telstra is publicly or privately owned. What I am concerned about is that privatisation will inevitably place the ongoing provision of the USO under tremendous pressure along with other regulations, such as those on pricing, which are presently imposed on Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Furthermore, there is presently much debate about the optimal means for delivering the universal service obligation. A number of industry commentators have called for the removal of cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies as the means of financing community service obligations. Instead, they advocate funding them out of budget revenue—in other words, a welfare approach. The danger with this is that, as soon as you transfer payment for the USO to the budget, it will make it far more vulnerable for elimination or reduction than if it is paid for directly by carriers. As soon as governments start looking for somewhere to save a few extra dollars, you can be sure the USO will come up for review.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have no doubt that private owners of a commercially focused company whose sole objective is to maximise profits would wholeheartedly agree that this is a good thing. The fact is it is quite legitimate for private shareholders to expect management and the board to seek to maximise profits and to lobby the government to remove any regulatory impediments to this aim. The government is kidding itself if it thinks a privatised Telstra is not going to be working very hard to get rid of cross subsidisation and the USO.

         It is equally legitimate for the community to expect the government to pursue social objectives in the provision of telecommunication services. This inherent tension cannot be easily dismissed or willed away and will only be exacerbated by privatisation. A privatised Telstra would be governed by a board of directors acting not in the national interest, or in the interests of rural and remote communities, but in the interest of the company.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We should not be fooled into believing that what is best for the company will coincide with what is best for the nation. Let us not forget that it will end up being owned by a select group of domestic elite and foreign shareholders. This company would be one of Australia's largest and would wield tremendous economic and political clout, and Australian governments have not exactly proved themselves resistant to corporate lobbying from that big end of town. It is not hard to see a government—particularly one determined to portray itself as friendly to business—caving in to lobbying by a powerful, private Telstra.

         What this adds up to is that, if we go down the privatisation track, we run the high risk of ultimately losing our ability to set, maintain and deliver community service obligations in the national interest. It is not merely the existing universal service obligation which needs to be safeguarded. The universal service obligation is out of date. Reaffirming the existing USO, as the government has promised, will not provide a world class consumer framework; nor will it ensure that they have access to vital communication services, which are essential for actively participating in today's society.

The government has dismissed these concerns as being irrelevant. From a government that claims they want to privatise Telstra to benefit consumers, we think this is the height of hypocrisy. It does not require much wisdom to see that appropriate environment and planning regulations are liable to be traded off by the government in pursuit of a higher sale price. These concerns need to be addressed immediately—not some day long away in the future—and I will do all in my power to see that they are addressed.

         —I oppose the sale of Telstra, and for very good reason. This has been done over many times and the government has always tried to convince not only the senators in here but the public generally that its partial sale of Telstra will have no effect. The government says that it will put in place mechanisms to protect the consumers and users of telecommunications in this country, but the reality will be something different.

        You only have to look back in history to the sale of other public assets to realise that at the end of the day the government will have no capacity or any legal right to deny the new private shareholders in Telstra their opportunity to maximise their investments. Sooner or later the argument will come up about their rights. There will be arguments from the government, whoever the government may be at that time, that the universal service obligations and requirements on Telstra to install ongoing services and provide new services as part of a cross-subsidised or part subsidised process should come to an end.

        One has to question the coalition government's stand on providing for rural and regional Australia the maintenance and improvement of services when it then turns around and proceeds down the track of privatising one of the most fundamentally important service providers in the country. Clearly, the people do not want this to happen. They have demonstrated that through various polls that have been conducted. Also, they do not want any funding for environment policies attached to the sale of Telstra. The government over a very short space of time has been dealing the funding cards off the bottom of the deck as far as the environment is concerned, taking more and more of the funding dollars away very quietly and secretly in an effort to place greater emphasis on, and put
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         more pressure on conservation groups to support, the partial sale.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The conservation groups must be really smarting over the way this government has dealt with environmental matters in the six months or so that it has been in office. We have  plenty of examples. The most recent was yesterday with the regulations for the export woodchip licences. Clearly, all conservation groups and a great number of other people concerned about the environment were duped by the coalition prior to the election. They voted in the belief that they would see the maintenance of at least existing funding limits for the environment and that, if there were to be any additional funding from the sale of a public asset, it would have been additional. But that is not the case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other aspect you have to consider—I know it has been said many times before—is why you would sell a public asset like Telstra that has such a great capacity to provide funds for the government. It had record earnings in its last financial year and has paid huge dividends to the government. And not only that. With regard to the provision of services throughout the country, and I refer back to the cross-subsidisation issue, in my state alone it is in excess of $9 million. Yet we still do not have the level of services that we might like to have in Tasmania with regard to mobile phone services and other services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If Telstra is going to be the main player in the game, then it will be important that any government have the capacity to direct it at some point in time to maintain equity in the provision of services to communities throughout Australia. It is fairly evident, even with the current circumstances as they relate to pay TV and other services that are being provided in some areas of the country at the moment, that those companies doing that, even Telstra, do not have any real plans to go to areas that will be deemed to be not profitable. That is a good indicator if, at the end of the day, you sell part of Telstra. We should not forget that the coalition has always had a policy of the complete sale of Telstra.

I can recall one or two letters that I have seen from when you people were in opposition from shadow ministers with regard to what was proposed for Telstra. That is of great concern to the public of Australia and there has been concern with regard to the sale of other assets. You people in opposition say, `Well, you sold the Commonwealth Bank and you sold Qantas.' But the circumstances were totally different. We introduced competition. In terms of the Commonwealth Bank, we have a Reserve Bank of Australia. We have much greater competition following deregulation of the financial system. It would have been unfair to the Commonwealth Bank for it not to have been sold. So from that point of view, the circumstances are totally different.

         Australian Airlines and Qantas were merged to create greater competition. We all know that air fares have stayed down and that air travel is increasing.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of those two major components of the bill, the first relates to a minor amendment to the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 which will ensure that borrowers will have their rights protected when all the states and territories adopt a common consumer code. We are talking here about Westpac Banking taking up the services of lending in this respect. We wanted to ensure that Westpac, in terms of its legal obligations under the Defence Services Home Act 1918, will comply with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Code. We support this because of the enhanced rights that it gives to those who are in a contractual arrangement with Westpac.

        The second component relates to an amendment to the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. This amendment was once again foreshadowed whilst we were in government. It is an amendment which ensures that, when a veteran dies of a previously established war caused disability, the veteran's dependant will be automatically eligible for a pension without having to re&amp;hyphen;establish the relationship between the death and the war service. We saw this as an initiative of importance to the veteran community and we foreshadowed it before the election. We now support this measure which will implement that decision announced before the election.

         —It is with great pleasure that I rise to support the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996. The previous Labor government took steps to combat the decline in participation in childhood immunisation and vaccination. An initiative of Labor was the establishment of an Australian childhood immunisation register.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Levels of childhood immunisation have been declining for some years. The proportion of immunised children decreased from 54.1 per cent in 1989&amp;hyphen;90 to 52.1 per cent in 1990&amp;hyphen;91, and this has been the continuing trend for some years. That drop occurred in just one year. There is some debate about what the cause of this decline has been, but there is some view in the community that the inconvenience and possible side effects of immunisation may no longer outweigh the risk that is avoided by that immunisation. Also, there tends to be a continuing view in the community that the less medical intervention there is the better it is for individuals.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that this trend has been a major problem for the community. As a result, the incidence of childhood diseases such as measles, whooping cough and rubella have been on the increase. The sad thing is that, even though these diseases are generally a minor inconvenience and are generally thought of as such in the community, over the ten&amp;hyphen;year period between 1983 and 1993 41 deaths occurred as a result of measles, a fact that I do not think many people would appreciate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of this problem, the previous Labor government put in place a twofold strategy in order to combat it. The first was an education campaign to ensure that parents were aware of the necessity to vaccinate and the second was the introduction of the register that this legislation is now putting into place. Originally the 18&amp;hyphen;month trial was put in place by regulation but in light of the success of this program, it is now seen as appropriate to put it into primary legislation and I am completely in accord with that view.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is worth noting that in the six months between 1 January 1996 and 30 June 1996 there were over one million notifications of vaccines that had been administered recorded on the register and there are over 11,000 doctors and medical practices and 256 councils now providing data. I fully endorse this amendment and urge the Senate to support it.

There is no doubt that, as Senator Neal has pointed out, there has been an unnecessary increase in the incidence of, particularly, rubella, measles and whooping cough. As she points out, there have been deaths. As she did not mention, but I am sure implied, there have also been a number of children suffering long-term brain damage from those particular diseases, in particular from measles—far more than have ever been accounted for as caused by the immunisation process itself.

         There is a bit of folklore around the community at present which says that immunisation is harmful. The facts are that the evi dence to correlate immunisation with deaths—in Australia in particular—is incredibly scanty. There is very little evidence, if any at all, to indicate that there is a correlation between the two. Certainly, there is a temporal relationship, but beyond that it has been impossible to prove a correlation.

         —I thank Senator Calvert for that very important question. No doubt everyone in the community would accept that there is a responsibility for governments to provide funding to various arts bodies in order to ensure that people have every opportunity to give expression to their creative endeavours. There are a number of situations in which the marketplace does not fulfil the need, and therefore governments have a role. But what is of great concern is when a party as ideological as the Labor Party thinks a legitimate vehicle for funding arts is the trade union movement.

         My colleague Senator Short put a question on notice to the previous minister for the arts, Mr Lee, to ascertain to what extent the trade union movement had been used as a vehicle for arts funding. The question was put on notice on 25 September last year. Not only did Senator Short not get an answer within the required 30 days; he actually did not get an answer at all before the last election.

         You ask yourself, `Why did Mr Lee wait for five months?' Or, in fact, `Why would he have waited forever?' The answer is that Mr Lee simply was not game to tell the public the disgraceful facts of the matter, because the facts are that, between 1994-95 and 1995-96, nearly $800,000 in arts funding was supplied to the ALP's main funding source—the trade union movement.

         I can give examples of where these funds were spent. There was $28,700 given to the Queensland branch of the ACTU for a poster competition and exhibition. The Tasmanian TLC got nearly $200,000—$199,925, in fact—for a variety of projects, ranging from a celebration of pulping in Burnie to a photographic exhibition connecting time through sight. As part of the overall total, the Tasmanian TLC got two grants of $48,000 each to employ a community cultural development organiser. The ACT Trades and Labour Council—and no doubt Senator Lundy was very grateful for this—also did exceptionally well. It got grants totalling $122,420 during the same period for two exhibitions.

         This is typical of a party that does not believe in free creative endeavour. It believes in manipulating artists by requiring them to express their cultural aspirations through the prism of the ALP's ideology. What it was doing was no doubt encouraging those who wanted to perpetuate myths about heroic worker struggles, anti-capitalist propaganda

         We regard this as totally unacceptable. Our view is that the arts ought to flourish in an environment where government is not pulling the strings and simply saying, `If you toe the line, we'll give you money.'

         Our approach is quite different to that. We are not Sydneycentric like Mr Keating. We did not take the view that it was okay to spend $150 million if you did not like the view of the Cahill Expressway. We would rather put that money into regional arts funding.

         I call on the ALP to dissociate itself from its failed leader. The captain might be off the team but the rest of the side is well and truly still out there. If it has not dissociated itself from his approach, we can assume that Labor still thinks that it is legitimate to use those sorts of rorts, to use that sort of government control of the arts and any other area it can get its hands on.

I wonder if the minister has any comment about the seriousness of the separation of Aboriginal children and the way the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate treats it so flippantly?

Senator Bolkus, we have done an enormous amount for the Aboriginal people since we took over government because we are not locked into your paradigm. We are progressing on to the future. We have done an enormous amount. We have cleared up the perception—the special auditor's report has demonstrated that and that is going through. We are working constructively with ATSIC for the first time, which did not occur in the previous government. We are meeting on a daily basis with ATSIC and we are progressing to the future. I would hope that it will get through even to the opposition, dense as they are, that we actually won the election on 2 March and we are marching to a different tune from the one that they were.

I think it indicates the seriousness with which we are treating the economic mess bequeathed to us and the Australian people after 13 years of Labor mismanagement. There can be no doubt that the minerals and energy sector will continue to be one of the main drivers of growth and prosperity for all Australians into the future. Without the wealth created by the minerals and energy sector, there would be considerably less funds available for the broad range of state and Commonwealth programs, including those directed towards environmental protection.

        Mineral and energy resources are our largest single export earner, accounting for 60 per cent of all commodity exports and 35 per cent of all exports of goods and services. Total earnings from minerals and energy exports are expected to rise to a record $37 billion in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. In addition to company and PAYE tax, the minerals and energy sector contributes about $2.2 billion a year in royalties to the states, as well as, in most instances, providing their own infrastructure at no cost to the taxpayer. It employs over 400,000 people directly and indirectly in the economy and contributes six per cent to gross domestic product.

         To achieve these outcomes, however, Australia must create a climate of greater stability and predictability in areas such as land access, and improve coordination of environmental and other policies by all levels of government.

        Senator Allison will be aware of what has occurred over the last few years in that regard. It was going to go to Point Wilson but then that was utilised for an armaments depot. Then it was suggested that it should be at Point Lillias, and that has gone through a Victorian government assessment process to which my department contributed. The contribution of my department and their concerns are on the public record, and those concerns were made public with my agreement.

        It is true that we have not asked the universities to teach the same number of people for less dollars. What we have said to them is that they can cut load. In order to protect the opportunities for young Australians to have the first crack at higher education, we have said to them that we do not want them to do it in the undergraduate area. We want to maintain the opportunity for young Australians to get that first chance and operate under Labor's HECS system, which we support and where it does not matter how much money you have, you do not have to pay your contribution back until you start earning.

        For that reason, we have maintained that. We are actually adding to the number of undergraduate places next year. The drop in places over a period of time will be a drop in postgraduate course work places which you may realise are places that can already be bought. I think it was your government, Senator Murphy, that introduced the opportunity for Australian graduates to do that. The senator sitting next to you chose to pay for his postgraduate education elsewhere. I hope that is not a comment by him on the quality of Australian higher education because it is of exemplary quality.

Education expenses are estimated at $15,000 pa with the two secondary students attending a category 3 private school. The family is currently in receipt of a Health Care Card on the basis of low income, which exempts them from the AUSTUDY parental income test.

         This became clear to me only yesterday evening when we were considering a request from DSS to release data to them so that they could check the Social Security payments reportedly being made to the Wrights. Notwithstanding this, as Secretary, I must not only apologise on behalf of the Department but accept responsibility for our not accurately informing you of the status of the Wright case.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The substantive point remains that there are families well off but with a low taxable income and low net assets able to draw Government benefits in the absence of a rigorous actual means test.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It also remains true that the Government has correctly identified this problem and signalled its intention to address it.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To a significant extent the paper prepared in the Department on the Wright case properly illustrates these points. The problem is less its content than our fault in not clearly advising you on its status.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The paper (attached) notes that the family profile and financial circumstances are "based on a real family" tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test. This is correct. But some details (e.g. number of children) were adjusted to illustrate the range of payments that might be available to a family. The paper lists "benefits available" rather than benefits actually being paid.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The paper incorporated in Hansard in the course of the Estimates Hearings therefore contains these caveats.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, I believe the Committee would have been left with the impression from the oral testimony that the Wrights were an actual family. I am seeking to check Hansard as urgently as possible, but certainly you said that you understood it was "a specific example". You were entitled to say this on the basis of the Department's advice to you.

         Recommendation: that you write to the Chairman of the Senate Estimates Committee indicating that you have just been informed of the status of the Wright case and drawing this to the Committee's attention. A draft letter for your consideration is attached.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         My recollection of the ERC discussions is that your Ministerial colleagues are also likely to have gained the impression that the Wrights are an actual family. Again, this is notwithstanding that a close reading of the document itself shows that the Wrights are based on a real family.
        </para>

         The calculations of Social Security benefits were not developed by the Department in consultation with DSS. That Department, having now had the opportunity to check the calculations, has advised us that the calculation made for Parenting Allowance ($5,954 p.a.) should be $156 p.a. There are two other small variations. A note from DSS is attached.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Finally, there is the issue that a number of press reports have clearly taken the Wrights to be an actual family and the payments to them actual payments rather than benefits available. I believe this needs to be promptly corrected.

         It is important to proceed in concert with Social Security in the handling of this matter. I have shown these papers to the Secretary of DSS, who has cleared them from his point of view, but coordination at Ministerial level is also important.

         Finally, I should note that the other cases which the Department put forward in the documents for the ERC were cases of actual families. Also, they did not include an attempt by the Department to calculate Social Security benefits. We can be confident, therefore, of their accuracy based on information actually provided to us by the clients.

The Department of Social Security also notes that the husband would be entitled to a low income rebate of $150 p.a. which would reduce his tax liability from $522 to $372.

         At the Committee's hearings on the Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs Portfolio on 23 September 1996 the example of the Wright family was discussed in the context of questions about the Austudy Actual Means Test.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A paper provided by my Department, and on which I drew, was incorporated in the Hansard.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This paper correctly notes that the family profile and financial circumstances of the "Wrights" are based on a real family tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Nonetheless, I believe the Committee is likely to have had the understanding—as did I—that the Wrights are an actual family. I have now been informed by my Department that, in developing the Wright profile it made some adjustment to the actual case to illustrate the payments that could be available. I have also been advised that the Department of Social Security estimates two payments differently—namely Parenting Allowance ($156 p.a.) and Child Care Assistance ($3,840 for 50 weeks)—compared with the figures in the Department's paper. The Department of Social Security also notes that the husband would be entitled to a low income rebate of $150 p.a. which would reduce his tax liability from $522 to $372.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government benefits in the Wright case would still be in the order of $15,000 p.a. (rather than
         <break page="4413" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          $20,000). Therefore in clarifying the status and the figures in the Wright example, I wish to emphasise the substantive point that there are families who have low taxable income and low nett assets who are able to draw Government benefits. This is a problem the Government has identified and is addressing.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Secretary of the Department, having himself become aware of the status of the Wright case, has acknowledged that the Department should have made it clearer from the outset that while based on a real family the example also included modifications to illustrate the point. Nonetheless in moving  quickly to correct the record I also apologise that we were not clearer with the Committee.

         A number of media reports have referred to Government benefits being paid to the "Wright family". The Wright example was also used in the Senate Committee examining the Budget for my Portfolio earlier this week.

         As the paper from my Department on the Wrights notes the family profile and financial circumstances are based on a real family tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test. But the Department adjusted some details to illustrate the payments that could be available. The case is illustrative, rather than an actual family.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The paper was first prepared as an internal and illustrative document, and the Department has expressed its regret to me that the status of the Wright example was not made fully clear.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The figures on payments were also illustrative and based on my Department's estimate of family entitlements. Department of Social Security estimates show that the figures need some adjustment, mainly that the Parenting Allowance would be $156 p.a. rather than $5,954 p.a.

         Dear Senator Tierney
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I am writing to you direct on the matter of the "Wright family" because the fault clearly lies with the Department. It was an incorrect characterisation of the case by the Department to the Minister which led Senator Vanstone in him to describe the Wright family as a specific example in the hearings of the Committee on 23 September 1996.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I myself wrongly believed the Wrights to be an actual case and, like the Minister, only became aware this was not so after the Committee hearings. Nonetheless, as Departmental Head, I accept responsibility for the mistake.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In brief, the Department provided the Minister earlier in the year with a number of actual examples of families well off but who, in the absence of the Actual Means Test, were able to draw AUSTUDY benefits.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Wright family case was also put forward as a realistic demonstration, in the Department's view, of other benefits that could be obtained by a family with certain characteristics in the absence of a rigorous actual means test along the lines of that applied to AUSTUDY.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It was, as the relevant document prepared by the Department and tabled in the Committee says, based on a real family. But certainly variations were made, not with the intention to fabricate or mislead but to demonstrate the policy point the Department was seeking to make in its advice to the Minister.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Following the Committee hearings, the Department of Social Security on 25 September sought details
         <break page="4415" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of the Wrights in order to check the Social Security payments reportedly being made to them. In handling this request, it became clear to me then that the Wrights were not an actual case and also that in some respects the Department's calculations of benefits were in error.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I wrote to the Minister on 26 September to inform her both of the status of the Wrights and the errors in calculations. I conveyed my apologies to her. There was subsequent discussion with the Minister and her office in the normal way. Slight adjustments were made to the letter to be sent to you. The Minister's office then checked with their clerk, who suggested a sentence be inserted to ensure the letter was circulated to the members of the Committee. The Minister then wrote to you on 9 October advising the Committee of the correct situation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I also felt it appropriate to write to you direct since both I and the Minister have overseas commitments next week when the Committee will meet and, although specialist officers will of course be present, the relevant Division Head will be on leave. The Minister has, however, informed me that she will be proposing to the Committee that if it wishes to meet to discuss this matter with her on return, then she would be happy to do so.

         In past cases the Senate Privileges Committee had made it clear that leaving a committee with an incorrect impression as to the facts can be the equivalent of giving misleading evidence. The Committee has also made it clear, however, that a Minister is not guilty of contempt if the minister passes on incorrect information but corrects it when the error is discovered. This was the situation in the diesel fuel tax case, reported by the Committee in its 46th Report in 1994. A minister had passed on at an estimates hearing incorrect information about a proposed tax, but subsequently corrected the information in the Senate and before the Committee, although his first correction was in itself incomplete. The Committee found that false information was given, but the minister was not aware at the relevant time that the information was correct, and no contempt was committed. The Senate endorsed the findings of the Committee.

        —by leave—Senator Vanstone has blatantly and barefacedly misled both the Senate and the public on this matter. There is no question about that. What we have from Senator Vanstone today is the tabling of documents and a chronology presented with spin from the minister. But the facts of the matter are this. On 23 September the Wright family was brought up at the Senate estimates committee by virtue of a question from one of Senator Vanstone's staunchest factional opponents, Senator Ferris.

        I must say, Senator Ferris, I did not believe I would ever stand in this place and say that I feel sorry for you but I do because you are just another person who has been given the dump by Amanda Vanstone. You were the bunny who asked the question about the Wrights. You were the bunny who put out the press release entitled `Millionaires on Government Welfare Benefits', with the bodgie Wright family document that had been pre pared by Senator Vanstone attached. You were the bunny, Senator Ferris. I hope that in the next internal ballot in the South Australian division of the Liberal Party you do not forget who to blame.

       Apparently, not only are there not plenty of others where they came from but the Wrights themselves do not even exist. Then, after Senator Ferris had put out her bodgie table and her press release as requested by Senator Vanstone, I was given a copy of this press release and the bodgie table by a recalcitrant member of the government. I was handed this—I cannot name sources—on 24 September. It was in the public arena but someone had caught hold of it and said, ` Look at this.' I did have a close look at it and, like most members of the Labor Party, I can smell a Liberal dead cat at 100 metres.

       To be fair to Senator Newman, who is perhaps not one of the best ministers in the government—it is a pretty ordinary bunch and it is a bit of a competition for last place between Senator Vanstone and Senator Newman—she got onto this before Senator Vanstone. She put out what I would describe, I think, as a limited edition press release to correct the $229 parenting allowance mistake. She stated in the limited edition press release that `DSS cannot confirm that the family actually exists.'

       I believe that Senator Newman probably did tell her colleague Senator Vanstone at about that time, probably on that day, that the story that was published in this newspaper and in many others in this country was wrong and that they were both, along with all other members of the government, right up to their necks in a colossal hoax.

That was the same day, I think, that my own office received the reply to the questions that I placed on notice at the Department of Social Security estimates stating that the figure for parenting allowance was wrong; it was actual ly $6. What did Senator Vanstone say it was? Two&amp;hyphen;hundred and twenty&amp;hyphen;nine dollars. It also stated that the figure for child&amp;hyphen;care assistance was wrong.

        During Question Time on Thursday 10 October Senator Lees asked me a question concerning the eligibility for diesel fuel rebate of the diesel which leaked from storage tanks at the manganese mine on Groote Eylandt, operated by the BHP Subsidiary GEMCO.

        I am advised this leak was first confirmed in February 1995. It is not known when it commenced, but apparently well before that date. A drilling program carried out by the company to both identify the extent of the leakage and to enable recovery of the spilled fuel has indicated that of the order of 3 million litres escaped.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have to say that I find it difficult to understand how a company can lose 3 million litres of diesel without noticing. GEMCO was fined $45,000 by the North Territory Government in March 1996 after pleading guilty to a charge of unlawfully permitting diesel fuel to enter the groundwater. Around 600,000 litres has so far been recovered by the use of skimmer pumps. That diesel is being cleaned and re-used for activities which would be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate. The company has advised me, however, that it does not intend to claim the rebate, for reasons which I will go into in a moment.

        One of the many administrative issues we have had to deal with since coming to Government is the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme by the previous Government.

        Significant deficiencies were identified by the Australian National Audit Office as long ago as May 1991. Over the following three years, the Labor administration established three separate interdepartmental committees and an Industry Commission Inquiry. The only response by the then Government was to legislate to reduce eligibility and to attempt to charge industry an administration

        In 1993-94 a major fraud of approximately $1.4 million was discovered, which resulted in Customs commissioning consultants to review the rebate database system and its claims processing practices.

        I am advised that it is not possible to determine whether all or part of the diesel lost was, or was not, subject to a rebate claim without an extensive search of both Customs and GEMCO's records, even then, a conclusive outcome may not result.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am further advised by the Australian Customs Service that under the existing legislation, payment of rebate is based on intended use for eligible activities. Recovery is possible where fuel is used for other than eligible purposes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any prospect that the rebate is not recoverable is not tolerable and will not be tolerated by this Government. It is yet another testimony to the incompetence of the previous Government.

        Minister Prosser initiated a review of the administration of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme shortly after taking responsibility for the portfolio. That review was assisted by the efficiency audit of the scheme which we tabled on 2 May of this year. Senators will also be aware that the Government announced in the Budget that it will introduce legislation, with effect from 1 January 1997, to tighten eligibility for mining industry rebated under the scheme and to ensure that only legitimate claimants receive the rebate.

        We are dealing here with a matter of the greatest gravity. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, in question time today and just now in her statement gave us the chronology of how long it took her to write to cover herself, to explain that there had been an error. But for far too long she waited. Even then, she did not come into this Senate and give the explanation.

         It is clearly established that misleading a Senate estimates committee is equivalent to misleading the Senate. I find it quite remarkable that yesterday Senator Vanstone gave an unreserved apology—which quite clearly indicates the seriousness with which she takes this matter, the substance of it—but she is quite cavalier about the timing and the process of what she had to do. `What's a couple of days here and there,' she said.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A couple of days here and there are in direct breach of the ministerial guidelines for appropriate behaviour. Those guidelines were put on the record in my question to Senator Vanstone, and also by Senator Faulkner, but they need to be said again:

         The minister says, `What's a couple of days here and there.' They are a direct flouting of the guidelines for appropriate ministerial conduct, from which I quote:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         An answer which may be found incorrect should be corrected as soon as the error is found.

         Senator Vanstone knew very early on—some of us have the gravest doubt that she did not know from the word go—that this was a fake family. Departments do not make hypothetical families by attaching kids to real families. That is a totally political family construct. It is not what departments do, but they are encouraged to do it by their political directors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If this hypothetical family was not designed by the minister it was designed by the minister's office. It is about time that the political bent on this matter is made clear. And it is a political bent, blaming the department.

         What department takes over two weeks to explain that they got it wrong? They knew on 26 September—when the secretary wrote to the minister—that they had got it wrong. It was two weeks after that before a letter arrived—and still no apology in this place, not until a question was asked by Senator Carr. This is outrageous! It is interesting to note that the ministerial guidelines say:

          The question which I think is critical is: what range of information does that cover? Does it cover the minister coming in here and apologising because she said something wrong or misled the estimates committee and was required to make it clear here? It might, but a common other reading of it would be that you would make some effort to correct the mass of misinformation that went out in the major dailies in huge headlines across this nation. There has been nothing to correct that misinformation—nothing.

Listen to what people in receipt of those payments have to say about how they feel about being pilloried by Senator Vanstone's very cavalier regard for the truth.

        Let us go to the real basis of what is wrong in the system. The example of the Wright family showed what happened in the administration, or the maladministration, of Austudy under the previous government. One and a half years ago we had an inquiry into Austudy after the Ombudsman found 17 major flaws in the administration of Austudy. We held a major inquiry into it; we made 24 recommendations to change it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me tell you about one of the recommendations. In the past, when people put their name down for Austudy, they had to show their taxable income. The Wright example—hypothetical as it now turns out—shows that people can get their taxable income way down and get Austudy. What our report recommended was then implemented in the dying days of the Labor government. They had not done anything about it for 13 years. They would not have done anything about it until they were provoked by our committee, which broadened out the criteria, which did show up people's assets.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result of that Liberal initiative is to better target Austudy, and the people who get it are the people who deserve to get it. That is the basis of this debate. It is just an absolute storm in a teacup for the opposition to come in here and claim that the minister has done something wrong when she, like the rest of us on this committee—like Senator Carr and Senator Crowley—sat there through that and believed that it was a real family. Now we know it is not a real family—it is a hypothetical—the record has been set straight, and that is where the matter should lie.

        We have a fundamental principle here. This minister was advised, according to the secretary of her own department, on 26 September that there was an inaccuracy in her statements to the Senate. She had six sitting days to come into this parliament and correct the record as required under the ministerial responsibility guidelines set down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). She failed to do so for six days. If it was not for the question asked by me, she probably still would have tried to get away with her actions.

        It is enough to make it absolutely clear that the actual means test was introduced by Labor. It was announced in the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 budget and came into effect on 1 January 1996, before this government was elected. The portfolio budget statement at the time made it perfectly clear that, as far as the Labor government was concerned, there was a responsibility about community concerns that some well&amp;hyphen;off families could get Austudy and use complex financial arrangements to circumvent Austudy income and assets tests. From 1 January 1996, before this government was elected, certain categories of families, such as those with access to complex financial arrangements, were to no longer get Austudy unless household means were within allowable limits. Who was responsible for that measure? Of course, it was the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Ross Free. He happens to be Labor's candidate in Lindsay.

         —I stand corrected, Senator Carr—that 5,000 millionaire families in Australia had either inappropriately accessed these benefits or could do so in the same way that the Wrights had been doing so. I suggest that the minister is correct in stating that she was labouring under the impression that it was a real family—that the Wright family was the right family and not the wrong family, as we suspected all along. The

        So I will give the minister the benefit of the doubt that she did believe this was a true case. Of course, that still does not mitigate the fact that she did mislead the parliament and misled the Senate estimates committee. But regardless of that, she is indeed guilty of perpetuating this idea that people—and the Wright family case was used as an example—are rorting the Austudy system.

        Senator Tierney referred to this case as being entirely plausible. I have to say that when the three kids were read out, the family's income was read out, the $1.1 million home was read out, the truck was read

Senators Crowley and Carr did mention to me informally and at the Senate estimates committee hearing that they were concerned that the social security benefits did not add up, the example did not sound right. We were unable to get facts and figures relating to those families who are allegedly rorting the system.

The departmental head has said that it was an error in the department and they take full responsibility.

        There was a period of three weeks between when Senator Vanstone spoke at the estimates committee and when she apologised to the Senate yesterday. There was also a period up to 9 October of some 16 days. The period in dispute that was raised and referred to the privileges committee in this report was less than one week.

        Of the 337,000 veterans, war widows and dependants currently entitled to health care through my Department, over 31 per cent live outside the major metropolitan areas.

        The majority of veterans are now aged over 70 years. This ageing is creating further demand for a wider range of health care and support services. The veteran community also includes many younger veterans who served in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and in more recent engagements including UN peacekeeping missions.

         This document has identified very clearly the rural and remote areas of Australia where the population of veterans are located. This is a very important issue for the department in its delivery of services. There are 337,000 people currently entitled to health care through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and 31.6 per cent of those people live outside the metropolitan area.

         When you look at the statistics of where the rest of the community live in Australia, the veteran community is different in composition in its patterns of living. Most Australians in this country live in metropolitan areas on the eastern seaboard, but a lot of veterans have chosen to move to or to stay in the country areas. That may reflect their age, because a lot of them are older and have gone back to those areas. It may also reflect some of the soldier settlement schemes that were put in place after the war ended. But it does provide the department with a challenge to meet in its provision of health services.

          In this document, the minister has brought together all of the processes that the department is involved in, which is a very good thing.

Many of us will view with great interest the outcome of these pilot programs.

          The area of transport, particularly now with the Second World War veterans becoming quite elderly, is becoming more of an issue. The veterans will all be very close to the age of 70 or over—just doing some quick mental arithmetic—and many are approaching the age of 80. I know that, with my own parents who are aged 75 and nearly 80, transport is becoming an issue for them living in a rural community. If they require treatment or assessment in a centre in Sydney, which has happened, they are no longer able to drive themselves there. There are dependent upon my brother to do the driving and to provide the transport for them. However, there are many veterans who live in smaller communities that do not have that family support there for the provision of transport. This document is calling for more flexibility within the repatriation transport arrangements.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The veterans have asked that their support needs be taken into account when they travel to metropolitan centres for extended periods of treatment. Often the veterans will need somebody to accompany them on these visits. These issues are highlighted in the national and state and local initiatives outlined in this statement. One of the initiatives is to use the community care seeding grants program in Belmont to evaluate trials of two community transport models to assess their suitability for general application in rural Victoria. That is the standard of programs proposed to be undertaken as pilots. That is a very good thing.

The department is also prepared to provide some financial assistance to the accompanying person, in cases where a veteran or war widow's—and I suggested it should be widowers as more women who have served die and their spouses require assistance—medical condition requires him or her to be accompanied to travel for treatment and while the veterans is admitted for treatment in a centre away from their area. It is the very humane programs and plans that are being put in place that attract my attention and highlight to many people the very valuable results that will arise out of this policy statement.

          I note with caution that there is no new funding announced for these policies. They are to be funded from the recurrent DVA budget which has been subject to an across the board two per cent reduction in running costs. That amounts to about $20 million over four years. Administrative efficiency savings of $48.5 million over four years must be absorbed by the department. This is the code for the slashing of spending. I desperately hope that this slashing of spending is not going to impact adversely on the programs that are being outlined.

         One of the problems we had with the previous government was that they made a lot of noise about looking after veterans but when it came to delivering services, particularly to veterans outside the capital city areas, it did not happen. One of the consequences of having a Minister for Veterans' Affairs such as Minister Scott who lives outside a capital city is that he is acutely aware of the problems that are being experienced. I think Mr Scott deserves the congratulations of both sides for what he has done. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

         —It is a privilege to stand here today and speak to this document, although I must say at the outset of my contribution that I do have great concerns about the case that was used to establish reasons why the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ought to make significant recommendations to the government about the removal of any form of age discrimination from the Public Service Act 1922.

        My concerns were brought about by the fact that the complaints, which culminated in this report to the parliament, were made by four airline pilots who were compulsorily retired from their positions as airline pilots because they had reached the age of 60 years. If there is an occupation in this country which should have extremely high standards of safety applying to it, perhaps even age limits, I think the occupation of airline pilots might be the one that we should remove last from the list
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of occupations that have age barriers and age limits attached to them.

        It is an extremely stressful occupation. Many senators in this place would have sat in the cockpit in light aircraft. I suggest that all of us, from time to time—as I have done recently on a Qantas flight—sit up the front with the pilots when they are coming in to land at one of our major airports. One gets the real, distinct feeling of pressure that is applied to those individuals who have the responsibility not only for the lives of persons on board but also for many of the people on the ground and areas surrounding the airports where pilots land their aircraft.

       <para first-indent="16">
        For many years there have been arbitrary and, in some cases, very unreal age limits applying to people. It certainly used to apply in the Defence Force. It applies in our police forces. As I understand it, in my state of Western Australia, senior police officers have to retire when they reach the age of 55. Age limits used to apply in politics. I can recall some very vigorous debates in my party back in Western Australia involving those of us who were advocating that there ought be age limits—it was a good way of removing people from the political positions they occupied!
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting that, after growing up in the political party I grew up in, I actually came to witness people who, having argued vigorously for the imposition of age limits at one point in time, somewhat later in their careers arguing for completely the opposite. I am not in any way implying that their latter arguments were influenced by the fact that they too had aged. Might I quickly add that I have made it public that age limits will not affect me in the next round of preselections, because there will not be a next round of preselections for me. But I am going to be round this place for a quite a period of time.

        The report itself is an interesting one and not one, I suggest, that the government should immediately accept without qualification, without exceptions. There are still areas in this society where age limits ought apply—that is, age limits at the beginning of a working life and at the end of a working life. I do not think we ought to automatically abolish

        I put on the record that I chaired the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, which made a very quick recommendation very early in its inquiry that the age limits applying to judges of the Family Court ought to be lifted from the age of 65 to 70 to at least bring them into line with all other judges in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. I accept in general what the human rights commission has to say in this report, but we have to look individually and specifically at where it applies within the Public Service Act.

        Mr Chris Sidoti is saying that age should not by itself be a bar to what a person can do and to his or her place in the work force, in the same way that gender or disability or race should not be a bar.

        In referring to this report, I want to take note of the significance of a case before the commission in the last financial year, as referred to at page 9 of the report. The significance of this matter is that it may well be the last time, if the Workplace Relations Bill is passed, that we see the commission intervening in matters such as this. I refer in particular to the matter of the Tweed Valley fruit processors. I will quote from the report because the matter was seen to be of such importance that it was highlighted as one of the three major cases reported. The report says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this matter (Print M6526) the Full Bench dealt with the issue of whether an appeal lies against a refusal to approve an enterprise flexibility agree
        <break page="4438" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         ment (EFA). The Bench held that there were limited grounds for appeal on the basis of jurisdictional error.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, at the start of the next paragraph it says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this decision, the Bench found that the agreement resulted in a breach of the `no disadvantage' test.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cite that because I fear that if the Workplace Relations Bill before the Senate is passed, then the no disadvantage test will disappear and so also will the ability of the independent umpire. So this report holds particular significance in that it may well be the last time that something of that significance appears.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second thing that I wanted to refer to, because I know that union membership and people not wanting to be in unions has always been a bugbear for people, is at page 37 of the report. Page 37 of the report contains the heading: `Applications for certificates of conscientious objection'. This gives people the right to withdraw from unions or not to be part of unions, should they so desire, by going through the proper processes of the Deputy Industrial Registrar. It is interesting to see in the report that there were 92 applications pursuant to section 267 in 1993-94, 60 in 1994-95 and 69 in 1995-96. When one considers the number of workers in the work force in Australia, this is an insignificant number indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to draw the Senate's attention to pages 56, 57 and 58 of the report. There one sees a report on industrial democracy operating within the province of the Industrial Registry. These pages draw attention to a very enlightened approach to trade unionism, to employer-employee relations and to the development of a cooperative spirit in the workplace. Page 56 says:

          from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry. This report is presented to this parliament by Deirdre O'Connor, the president of the commission. There are a number of aspects that I would like to refer to but, firstly, I congratulate the president of the commission on what I think is a very precise, very good report with a lot of information in it, put down in very concise and readable terms. As one who has looked at each of the reports here in this place for the last seven years, I think this is one of the most concise reports—if not the most concise report—that we have had from this body.

        It does highlight a number of important aspects. In the year in summary section we find that in total there were some 13,643 applications with regard to unlawful termination. We have already heard that we are going to see the committee stage of the reform bill debated over the next week or two and be dealt with here, it having passed the second reading stage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One particular thing in that bill that must be one of the top priorities in this country is the situation that has existed since 1993 resulting from the unfair dismissal laws that were brought in by the former labour minister, Laurie Brereton. They will forever remain a blight on his position and his contribution to industrial law in this country. The year in summary graph says it all, and it is there for people to observe.

        Moving through the document, I draw attention to one of the points in that summary:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In October 1995, the Commission produced a resource book,
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Making Federal Awards Simpler
        </emphasis>
        , as a guide to reviewing federal awards under s.150A of the Act. The industrial parties were enthusiastic participants and made important contributions to the production of the resource book.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the point that, under the reform bill before us, the process outlined here will not only be enhanced, it will proceed in a much more constructive and cooperative manner in dealing with future matters and issues. Of course, having made awards simpler, it is going to put much more responsibility back into the workplace for employers and employ
        <break page="4439" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         ees to negotiate the detail of their working arrangements. The important point in relating this to the bill we have before us is that the commission will have responsibility for putting in the minimum standards which conditions cannot go below but the other matters will be negotiated between the parties.

       </para>

        Further on in the report I note that the commission and registry moved to new premises in Perth and Darwin—and I hope to see this extend. There are some comments that I will not go over, but I think that was a welcome development and one we will see develop further, I believe, under the new legislation in terms of the coordination between the state and federal systems.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As we work through the report, I draw attention to the comments on page 9 with regard to international cooperation. I do that because of the commission's role in hosting a delegation of visitors from South Africa in the context of the changes that have occurred in that nation in recent times with the ending of the previous regime and the beginning of a much more democratic process.

        The document contains comments about relationships with state industrial tribunals, which, as I have already mentioned, are very important. I would like to go quickly to pages 18 and 19 on the statistics of the activities of the commission. It is interesting to note that the notification of disputes has increased from 1994&amp;hyphen;95 to 1995&amp;hyphen;96. I believe that with this much more cooperative approach on workplaces you will see a decline in that under the new workplace arrangements bill. There are a number of other aspects—

        One of the great things about the former C and A Commission and the now Industrial Relations Commission is the wealth of experience of its members. They come from areas such as the business community, the professional business organisations, farmers organisations—as Senator Crane once represented—trade unions, companies, the public sector, the legal profession and a range of other disciplines. All of these people bring countless years of experience to industrial relations issues.

        Unfortunately, the attitude of the government is that all of that is going to be ignored, thrown out and cast into the dustbin of history under the proposals that they have. Their proposals—as contained in proposed section 89A and section 44 of the bill—will take the award regulation functions away from the commission, whereby awards of the commission will simply be varied by legislation to exclude a whole range of provisions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I raise that particular issue because I would like to refer specifically to section 150A, review process, detailed on pages 5 and 6 of the report. It indicates that the commission has produced a resource book,
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Making federal awards simpler

        , which is a guide to reviewing federal awards as required under section 150A of the current act. The Industrial Relations Commission, over a number of years, as a result of the various amendments put through by the former Labor government and as a

        That is not sufficient for this government,  notwithstanding, as this report notes, that that process has had the enthusiastic participation of the industrial parties. This government wants to undo all of that good work, all of that cooperative work, which has seen the lowest level of industrial disputation in this country in living memory. The good work that is recorded in this report, which went towards modernising awards, promoting enterprise bargaining but at the same time underpinning it with a safety net award system, is, unfortunately, at grave peril, at grave risk as a result of the workplace relations bill.

        I can only endorse the comments of Senator Hogg when he said that this may well be—or it will be—the last report of this nature as a result of the proposals contained in the government's current legislation. I commend this report to the Senate and I commend it to members of the government. They should read it, take time to understand it and rethink their current industrial relations policies.

         —Without doubt, the Industrial Relations Commission is an integral part of Australian working life. As a result of its workings, ordinary Australians' lives are affected. This occurs in the areas of wages, conditions of employment and a range of others. This is a prudent time to discuss this report, considering the changes the government is proposing to make to the legislation.

        The report outlines several major issues over the past year. I will discuss just a few of those. The period 1995-96 has seen a significant increase in the workload of the commission and the Australian Industrial Registry. There was a 35 per cent increase from last year's all&amp;hyphen;time high in the number of matters lodged with the commission—they totalled
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         32,972. This produced a 39 per cent increase in the number of hearings by the commission.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This fact alone highlights the important role of the commission in Australia today. It is used extensively by our community in the lodging of grievances and the bringing together of employer and employee in attempting to resolve disputes. These are points the Senate should take note of in deciding the commission's future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Senate should note that the increased workload of the commission continued to occur while preparing itself for the budget cuts of the Howard government. The commission should be commended for its high quality of work while overseeing an increasing workload and a decreasing budget with which to deal with its business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Senators should be aware that the commission is not responsible only for dealing with issues lodged. It also plays an important monitoring role. In accordance with the act, the Australian Industrial Registry identifies awards that have seen no change for the last five years and writes to all parties involved to establish the current status of those awards. The responses are then referred on to the commission to deal with as appropriate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report highlights that there were 395 awards requiring review with the following results: 169 awards were set aside, 58 awards were identified by the parties as still current, 69 awards were referred to panel heads for further action to determine their status, and 72 awards were scheduled for hearing before the commission in August this year. I highlight these points because they illustrate the important role the commission and the registry play and the issues that would remain unresolved or unmonitored if the commission does not continue in its current form.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Perhaps this issue is no more obvious than in the area of unlawful terminations. The report states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The conciliation of complaints of unlawful termination of employment has become a growing jurisdiction for the Commission during the reporting period.

       <para>
        In the reporting period, the commission had over 13,000 reports lodged for unlawful termination of employment—and I think
        <break page="4441" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Senator Crane made reference to that. The interesting thing to note about that growth of unlawful terminations is that almost exclusively it is growing in administrative, managerial and non-award areas. It is unclear what process people will be able to go through to resolve these issues under current proposals.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn now, more comprehensively, to the Australian Industrial Registry. The registry is a statutory authority established under the Industrial Relations Act. The registry essentially provides administrative support to the Industrial Relations Commission. It plays an important role in facilitating cooperation between the federal and state industrial relations systems. The registry, like the commission, has had an increasing workload over the reporting period. Lodgments have increased by approximately 8,000 in 1995-96 and the average hearings per day have increased to 105. This is up from 76 hearings per day in 1994-95.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Like the commission, the increased workload of the registry will continue. However, the government will also bring about reductions in its budget. This is most evident in the implementation of the recommendations stemming from the review into the registry in 1994-95.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report highlights a number of recommendations that have been put on hold since the budget cuts, and I will mention just a few these cuts are affecting. They are the establishment by the president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission advisory board; the establishment and convening of the implementation consultative forum; the implementation of an initial communications strategy; and the appointment of a financial restructuring implementation working party.

        There have been many high standard facets of the commission and registry highlighted in this year's report. It has a good record on internal accounting procedures as well as opening itself up to external scrutiny. It has an excellent staff training and development program, a high level of success with its information technology resources through equal employment opportunity standards and an extensive industrial democracy program.

        I see Senator Calvert over there. I know of his influence within the government as well, but on this particular point he is silent. I will not invite the duty minister, Senator Herron, to come into the debate to give us some reasons. I think he deserves a bit of a rest at the end of the week because it has been a tough one.

        I want to make only one other point before I sit down and that goes to what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) had to say during question time today in the House of Representatives. There is a simple reason for the minister wasting five minutes of question time denigrating trade unions, trade union officials, trade union members who happen to be members of parliament and senators—in turn, denigrating all members of all unions.

        It is a great shame that the minister hates trade unions in the way that he does. It is not a great way to approach industrial relations in this country.

        The Senate committees come on again next week and, certainly, senators from this side of the chamber will be asking more questions about the affairs of government, as we are quite entitled to.

I put them on notice now that they will not be able to get away with inventing families in order to hide the incompetence and ineptitude of some of the ministers in this government.

        I am very pleased to get an opportunity to refer to the annual report of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. This is an excellent report. I urge senators to have a flick through it if they have a bit of spare time. It deals with a whole range of funding proposals for the next few years and what the Australian Sports Drug Agency is proposing in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the year 2000 and the Olympics to be held here in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has made a commitment to not cut back, despite all the other cutbacks, in the athletes program. It is very important that we do not cut back and that we increase our funding for the Sports Drugs Agency to perform its role.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We need to do that in two areas. Firstly, we need to do it locally. Unfortunately, there is going to be a big incentive for a lot of unscrupulous coaches to put pressure on young athletes in Australia over the next few years
        <break page="4445" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to take drugs so that they can qualify for an Olympics at home. That will increase the probability that some young people may be misguided and led astray by those coaches. Some young athletes may feel the pressures.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important that we not just maintain our funding levels for this agency but increase them because there is going to be potential for an increased level of abuse over the next few years. It is very important that athletes in Australia know that the agency is about, and see its advertising and the `beat the cheats' program they have been promoting. Abuse is everywhere throughout the country where there are athletes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We do not want the blot that other games have had over the last 10 years. I well remember watching Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis a few years ago. I sat down and put a videotape on because I thought it was going to be pretty special watching the 100&amp;hyphen;metres final. Ben Johnson ran a world record. I thought, `Jeez, I am glad I got that 9.7 seconds on film.' Then the next day it came out that he was on anabolic steroids. I know how let down and cheated I felt. Certainly Carl Lewis made it plain how cheated he felt at the time. But justice was done and he got his gold medal.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is what we do not want to see in Sydney in 2000. We want a drug free games. We want to make sure that no Australian athletes are able to get through the screening procedures between now and 2000 and that no Australian athletes shame us. I am not suggesting there are going to be any, but the key role of the agency is deterrence so that every athlete knows that, if they are going to try it, they are going to get caught. If we are going to win gold medals in 2000, it is going to be fair and square.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The drug agency also plays a role on the international stage. For many years, international drug testing has been controversial. You only have to look at what has been going on with swimming, where we have probably seen Australian swimmers robbed of gold medals and world records because other countries have not been prepared to be as clean as we have been.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have to see an increase in Australia's international participation. We have to see an increase in the number of drug control officers. We only have 29 going around the country. What I am suggesting is that we are going to need more, and the government must be prepared to recognise that and give an increase in funding to the agency. The processes are critical. We have already seen legal abuses over the last few years internationally and even here in Australia, where an athlete gets tested positive and is able to use the legal processes to overturn the federations—athletics, swimming or whichever.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very important that the drug agency is able to use the correct procedures and not have athletes claim that the tests were done illegally or incorrectly or handled wrongly and those sorts of things. We cannot afford that blight in 2000.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very important that the agency is able to visit as many schools as possible in Australia over the next four years to get that message out. The beat the cheats program is a very important message for this country and for the youth of this country. We want it in every young athlete's mind that we are about a drug free games in 2000 and winning fair and square so that Australia can celebrate in the year 2000.

It is about seeing their gonads shrivel up and slime ooze from their eyes, ears and nose because this is what happens when the level of toxins in your system builds up so much—your body cannot handle it any more.

         Drugs damage people's lives, and that is the real issue. We have to be aware of those things. If we want a clean games and clean Australian athletes, it does not start when they become elite. It starts the very first day they turn out for training and it continues from then until the day they retire from sport. Unless any other honourable senators wish to make a contribution, I seek leave to continue my remarks.

        The report of the National Gallery of Australia is very well put together. Reading through it, one name stands out amongst others and that is Betty Churcher. This is an appropriate time to mark the great work that she has done for art in Australia. She is a member of the Canberra group of the foundation, as is indeed our President, Senator Margaret Reid. The sorts of things Betty Churcher has done need noting. For example, she brought the Turner exhibition here, and, Madam Acting Deputy President, I hope that you went down to the exhibition.

There is ample reference to the use of this power for this purpose in the standard text on environmental law in Australia by Dr Gerry Bates, which points out that while this power has not been used, except, incidentally, in the Franklin Dam case, it would be able to protect areas of national significance.

        What is happening in D'Entrecasteaux National Park is that the Western Australian parliament, with the government using its numbers, has excised over 300 hectares of the park within 300 metres of the largest freshwater lake in south&amp;hyphen;west Western Australia, Lake Jasper. In doing so it has not only cut hundreds of hectares out of the national park, but it threatens the lake itself, with its rare and magnificent wildlife and plant life species, including a great number of aquatic species, including local fish and frog species which are only found in that region of south&amp;hyphen;west Western Australia. Moreover, it threatens an underwater archaeological site, the only such site on mainland Australia, which has a rich repository of Aboriginal sites going back at least 8,000 years. All of this is to be threatened by a short&amp;hyphen;term mining operation wholly owned outside Australia, repatriating most of its profits overseas and leaving very little for the state or the people of Western Australia.

Jim Scott, a West Australian Green in the upper house in Western Australia, the Minister for Mines in that state showed that this is not a once&amp;hyphen;off.

The government has a lot of legislation coming up between now and Christmas. I know they will want other senators to be expeditious in dealing with that because they think it is important. We consider this legislation to be important. In particular, Senator Margetts and Senator Murray, who have brought it before this House, believe it is vital and urgent legislation.

         As I have said in my contribution on behalf of the government when debating the general business notice of motion about a month ago, the issue at stake is whether the Commonwealth government should be involved in legislating on an ad hoc basis, which is what we are being asked to do here, to resolve land use conflicts and environmental issues on a case by case basis from Canberra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I put the view that the Commonwealth, in the view of the new government—and I think to a large extent in the view of the former government—has a very important national leadership role to play. I do not think that would be contested by the Green senators. We also have a responsibility to address issues of national and international environmental concern, particularly World Heritage areas and Ramsar sites. This is recognised by the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, and it was also recognised by the coalition's saving our national heritage policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Commonwealth is concerned that the existing legislative and administrative structures do not adequately reflect this view of the Commonwealth's role and responsibilities. In some cases, there is unnecessary duplication between what the Commonwealth does and what the states do. So often in Australia we have people proposing land use activities with environmental consequences who go through local processes, then state processes and then are forced to go through a Commonwealth process. There is overlap in a whole range of areas. In other cases, the Commonwealth's role is not adequately recognised. One of the goals of the new Commonwealth government is to try to sort out those roles and responsibilities to create an efficient system and to create a system that is more likely to achieve better environmental outcomes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this regard, a report from a Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state working group is due to go to COAG in May 1997. Preliminary negotiations between the three levels of government—between Commonwealth, state, territory and local government officials—have already commenced. To give clarity to this issue, this is to better define the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth.
        </para>
        <break page="4450" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Accordingly, the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the states through the COAG process and through this working group, will seek to review the respective roles, to cut out duplication and, most importantly, to create better cooperation. With respect to the Green senators and to Senator Murray, you do not achieve that sort of cooperation whenever you are not happy with the state process or you do not like a particular development by going around in an ad hoc way and saying, `Bring a bill into the parliament, pass it through and stop it.' That is not the way to achieve cooperation. It is not the good way to achieve a good outcome for the environment. We need to create a process that works better for the environment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This bill seeks to pre-empt that review. It pre-empts the Commonwealth's commitment to achieving a more sensible process of dealing with these land use conflict and environmental issues. The Commonwealth has before it no information that would suggest that the values contained within the subject area come under any Commonwealth jurisdiction.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They are not World Heritage listed, even though Senator Brown and Senator Margetts might like them to be World Heritage listed. In Australia there are 11 World Heritage areas where the Commonwealth has quite clear powers and responsibilities, but this area does not come under those. They do not come under a Ramsar listing either. We have 49 Ramsar&amp;hyphen;listed sites across Australia, nine of which are in my home state of Western Australia. This site, of course, is not one of them. With Ramsar sites, the Commonwealth again has very clear roles and responsibilities defined in legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Senator Brown made the point that the area that is referred to is listed in the Commonwealth's directory of important wetlands. But the point is that there are over 700 areas listed in that directory and 110 of them are in Western Australia. Clearly, it would be ludicrous for the Commonwealth to propose a piece of legislation that would stop activity in or around all of those 700 areas—although I would not be surprised if Senator Brown and Senator Margetts may propose that that might
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           be a course of action for the Commonwealth to take.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I also refer to migratory species. Again, the Commonwealth has obligations in relation to migratory species, particularly the Bonn Convention on migratory species, the Japan-Australia migratory birds agreement and the China-Australia migratory birds agreement. But there is no reference to the national park providing habitat for any of these species.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In terms of the National Estate, Senator Brown is quite correct in saying that the area is listed on the National Estate. However, there are 11,000 places on that National Estate and we have to ask ourselves as a government and as a parliament whether we intend introducing 11,000 D'Entrecasteaux National Park protection bills, if that is the criterion for our intervening in this way. Again, I would not be surprised if Senator Brown and Senator Margetts were not proposing—in their view of an ideal world it would be possible—to protect all 11,000 sites on the National Estate in this way by bringing an overarching Commonwealth power to bear. But I do not think many other people would view the matter this way.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With that background can I say, as I said in my previous contribution, that this is very much at this stage a matter for the Western Australian government and for the Western Australian parliament. They have, as we know, passed a bill which will excise this area of 300-odd hectares from the park and replace it with about 1,100 or 1,200 hectares immediately adjacent to Lake Jasper.

          As I have said previously, the Commonwealth will have a responsibility and a role when and if Cable Sands, having gone through the environmental process as they are required to in Western Australia, seek an export licence. That will, of course, trigger the EP(IP) act. The resources minister would then be required to advise the environment minister and after appropriate levels of assessment are carried out under EP(IP) the resources minister, on the advice of the environment minister, would decide whether or not to grant export approval. That is very much a Commonwealth role and a Commonwealth responsibility.

           The Commonwealth, as Senator Brown and Senator Margetts will not be surprised to know, will not be supporting this legislation as we believe it would set a quite silly precedent for Commonwealth intervention into virtually every environmental issue anywhere in Australia. Our intention is to ensure that there is a comprehensive EIS carried out, involving sensible levels of public consultation, broad public consultation, and that it is conducted before any decisions are made.

           We also believe—and I have already had discussions on behalf of the minister with the relevant people—that there is nothing to say that the triggering process for the Cable Sands operation will go ahead.

           Senator Brown, I know you would prefer us to say no mining whatsoever in this national park and I am sure many people would hold that view. That particular area has been used for a range of uses in the past. I am informed that it was a pastoral lease for many years, although it has changed since then. I believe there is farming activity only just to the west of the area that Cable Sands has put back into the national park. It is not in the classical respect what I would define as `wilderness', even though I think it does have qualities by which some people would give it that tag.

           Carmen Lawrence very proudly put out this policy under her own name. It specifically allows, under a range of conditions, there to be exploration in the D'Entrecasteaux National Park. It specifically states that the new policy recognises the extremely high conservation values of these areas. It talks about the rich mineral sand deposits which have been identified in the D'Entrecasteaux National Park. It specifically refers to excisions of mining areas from the D'Entrecasteaux National Park and the replacement of those excised areas with other areas. I think in this case, as I have said previously, the area that is to be excised has already been replaced by an area three times its size and immediately adjacent to Lake Jasper.

         What is clear is that when the Howard government actually has the power to protect the environment, it shows no leadership. Those who are sponsoring this bill have seized on the corporations power because of the Commonwealth government's claim that it had no power to influence the situation at D'Entrecasteaux National Park until the company applied for a mineral export licence.

I think this is of particular concern, given the recent statement by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, who has called for changes to the law to permit mineral exploration and mining in wilderness areas, something that has been the subject of a considerable amount of public debate and public concern and something that has been raised by a number of non-government senators in this chamber, not the least during recent question times. The D'Entrecasteaux case indicates that so far as the Court and Howard governments are concerned a national park is only a national park as long as it is not required for something else.

         The Australian Heritage Commission has recognised the ecological importance of D'Entrecasteaux National Park and included much of the park on its Register of the National Estate. I am pleased to say that the extent of the Register of the National Estate does appear to be one area of environmental policy and programs that Senator Campbell seems to be learning about and seems to have a bit of an understanding of. I am pleased that he has learnt a little in his short time on the coalition front bench about the Register of the National Estate. It just goes to show that even the most recalcitrant person can learn something about the protection of the environment in this country.

        The federal government has a definite responsibility in this area because this national park is on the Register of the National Estate. This bill will give the constitutional power for intervention and provide an important precedent in terms of the use of corporations powers. In fact, Justice Wilcox expressed the view that it would be possible to prohibit trading corporations adversely affecting items on the Register of the National Estate. The most respected authority on the Australian constitution, Professor Leslie Zines, insists that the Commonwealth may regulate and control all acts of trading and financial corporations for the purposes of trade, including mining.

        The important point is that, because this can only apply to corporations and this legislation is split between foreign corporations and Australian corporations, if this legislation were carried we would see a much tougher test for individual non-corporation mining operations than for corporations.

        I will move to my next point, and there are some aspects of this I wish to make. In doing so, I re-emphasise the point that the legislation which is operating in Western Australia in terms of this—subject to a couple of minor amendments—is the legislation of the previous Labor government in Western Australia. So, in effect, there is no real difference between either major parties in Western Australia, my home state.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only difference of note between the parties over the mining issue in national parks is that Premier Lawrence proposed that there would be no mining in national parks. However, in the recognition of high resource values in five of the 62 national parks, special provisions were made to allow for the continued exploration and excision of mining leases. With the excision of small areas from two national parks—Watheroo and Neerabup—only three national parks would be subject to exploration and mining. I will not go over that any further, because Senator Campbell has already touched on those aspects of it. I just make that point.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As we work through the actual aspects of the proposal—and I have not got the maps right now to do that—we find that the proposal states that 368 hectares will be available for mining. In return, 1,083 hectares of private land will be transferred to the executive director of the Department of Conservation and Land Management. That is a ratio of three to one, bearing in mind that, when the mining operation is done, the original 368 hectares will also be returned to the national park. In fact, there will be, over time, a net gain of 1,083 hectares of private land.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also make the point that much of the area to be mined—as has already been stated—is former grazing land or private land. When we talk about this area, we are talking about an area that has been extensively grazed for many, many years. In fact, the area that will
        <break page="4460" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         go back into the park will be significantly increased.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also rehabilitation that goes with that. The rehabilitation in the mining areas of the south&amp;hyphen;west of Western Australia is undoubtedly world class. A number of operations there have won world awards for their rehabilitation programs. I am absolutely confident that this will occur in this situation with Cable Sands.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next point relates to a point Senator Brown made in his contribution. I think I have got this right; I am not in the business of misrepresenting people. He asked who would want mining within 300 metres of the lake. The reality of this proposal and the operations involved is that the land being put into the park on the other side of the lake—land which is under the control of CALM, as all public lands in Western Australia are controlled by CALM—is agricultural land. If we were quite honest about it, it is far more likely that there would be damage to the lake from fertilisers used on farming land than from any mining operation, although I am told that this has not happened. That is advice I have been given, and I have no reason to question that. I really think the point that has been raised there is not valid.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a number of benefits from the proposal which I would like to highlight, and I have touched on some of these briefly. The first is that the state's conservation estate will be increased in area, although there will be a decrease of three square kilometres in the area of the national park in the interim. Once mining is completed and restoration of native vegetation is at an acceptable stage, the area of the class C reserve will be returned to the national park. The national park area will be increased by about 10 square kilometres ultimately.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next point I want to make in terms of this relates to the improvement of water quality in the south-west of WA. This is a very important benefit from the proposal. It is required and a lot more work has to be done. The water quality in Lake Jasper will be better protected. Cable has already ceased intensive farming practices on its private land, which has thereby increased the protective
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         buffer between Lake Jasper and the nearest farm land from the 300 metres that I have already mentioned to 2,600 metres—which is nearly nine times further away. This will be permanent once the mining has been approved.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point is that employment and wealth generation will continue with a well&amp;hyphen;established mining company which has a good reputation for mine rehabilitation and native vegetation restoration. Parts of the private land which are partly cleared could be added to the national park as the flora is returned to suitable quality, or used for other purposes, such as sport and other recreational activities, within the national park without further clearing of native vegetation. As to any perceived threat to Lake Jasper if mining proceeds, I re&amp;hyphen;emphasise the points I made about the buffer and farm fertilisers and the threat to water quality.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But I come back now to where I started and restate the fact that I find it remarkable that we have a piece of legislation before this chamber which will establish lesser standards, lesser requirements for dealing with the management of national parks by corporations, particularly foreign corporations, than exist under the state legislation. If a corporation's power were being used to improve the situation, I could understand the objectives behind these measures. But there will be far less scrutiny, with no reference whatsoever to environmental protection assessments and no reference whatsoever to who will manage the land in that particular area in the bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We know who has responsibility for the management of land in Western Australia—CALM. It is an organisation that was set up many years ago. It has changed its name a couple of times but, essentially, it has been the same organisation for the last 40 or 50 years. When we analyse the cost benefits of the proposal before us we see that land management in Western Australia would have significantly less control. The disciplines required would be significantly less. This proposal would also override the present provisions under the Soil Conservation Act and a number of other acts because of the
        <break page="4461" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         way—I emphasise again—it relates to foreign corporations and corporations of Australian origin.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On those grounds alone, I believe we should not support this particular legislation. But we should also take into account the environment, the people who are working hands on, the people who have the scientific knowledge and background. Once again, there is a diminution of that particular aspect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill also runs into the problem of the right of a state—in this case, the right of Western Australia—to manage land. That right is clearly spelt out in the constitution. It is my understanding that it would require the High Court to say whether this piece of proposed legislation overrides the rights of the states to manage land.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I conclude by saying that I do not think that this bill has been carefully thought through. It is fundamentally a political stunt. Were it to become law, the environment, mining operations and all the aspects that go with them in Western Australia would be far worse off and nowhere near as well managed, controlled and disciplined as they currently are.

         At the outset, I wish to express very strong reservations about the thrust of this bill. I will itemise those reservations under five separate headings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Firstly, it is in part inconsistent with—indeed diametrically in opposition to—the national policy of the Australian Labor Party. We should be clear on that aspect. The policy of the Australian Labor Party is to prohibit mining in national parks and I do not dissent from that very sound policy. However, the national policy position of the Australian Labor Party expressly authorises exploration activities in national parks. So, to the extent that this bill prohibits exploration activities in national parks, it is contrary to the policy of the Australian Labor Party.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, it is contrary to the policy adopted by the caucus of the Western Australian state parliamentary Labor Party. I shall return to that policy in more detail later.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="4462" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          Thirdly, it is contrary to what has been the practice of all Western Australian governments since 1990, under the leadership of premiers Dowding, Lawrence and Court. That position, as referred to earlier, can be deter mined from what is known as the resolution of conflict policy, which was tabled in this debate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fourthly, the bill expressly uses the corporations power to attempt to create a national park. I know that the extent of the corporations power has been reviewed by the High Court of late. But even with the current composition of the High Court, it seems a long bow to suggest the internal regulation of public companies extends to the creation of national parks and regulation of mining activities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this context, the bill is deficient, and apparently deliberately so, because it does not seek to regulate the activities of private companies, trusts, family trusts, partnerships and the like. It is not beyond the wit of humankind to establish one of those entities to engage in mining activities in a national park. It causes me to question the intent and credibility of the park when there is no attempt to regulate other legal entities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fifthly and most importantly, the bill will have the direct consequence of putting out of work some 80 directly employed miners. With a multiplier effect, this means almost 300 people have employment directly or indirectly associated with the current mine. With the families of those persons, the number totals some 900. They are indeed weighty matters that have caused me to review my attitude to this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the other side of this debate, one must acknowledge the views held in the community about mining, resources or extraction activities and national parks. Strong views are held concerning these issues and we would be fools to ignore that the Greens and the Australian Democrats received between seven per cent and 10 per cent of the primary vote in different states around March this year. Their vote is certainly centred around green issues. I acknowledge those views exist in the community and properly are up for discussion and resolution.

         Indeed, earlier this week, there was a debate about logging and woodchips in Tasmania. In my room I listened to the contribution of Senator Brown from Tasmania. He spoke with great feeling about the insect colonies, the

         I do not denigrate those concerns and wish those parties well in the prosecution of their claims. But in the scheme of things, if the issue is about priorities, my priority can only be that of the men and women of the local communities, the miners and their families currently employed on the existing mine site, not the subject of this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe it is sensible to avoid polarisation and taking extreme positions in this debate. Polarisation, extreme positions and positional negotiations are ultimately self&amp;hyphen;defeating and intellectually barren. I suggest that all parties in this debate—and it appears to be coming back onto the agenda if this bill is any example of the future—need to avoid denigration of their opponents. More importantly, they need to cease adopting intractable positions and they need to seek to find a middle path or compromise in this debate concerning mining activities and reservation of parks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this respect, I would suggest to the Senate that we are well served by the actions of the Western Australian parliamentary Labor Party and successive state governments since 1990 in Western Australia. We should look at the history of mining in this area and the mechanisms adopted by the Lawrence Labor government in 1990 to resolve the issue of mining in national parks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Firstly, it should be noted that there has been a mine site extracting titanium, a mineral sand, in Jangardup since 1994. The area was explored in 1987 and has been developed since 1993; and extraction activity has continued since around mid&amp;hyphen;1994. The area of the existing mine site was, and is, immediately adjacent to the national park under discussion. The existing mine site, not the subject of the bill, will be exhausted in late 1997 and early 1998.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Earlier this year, Cable Sands Pty Ltd applied to the Western Australian government to excise an area of approximately 380 hectares on the boundary of the national park and sought parliamentary approval to mine that
         <break page="4463" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          new site. That new mine site is known as Jangardup South and is about four kilometres south of the current mine site.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is the proposal of the company to mine that site, and the excision bill, as outlined earlier, has passed through both houses of the Western Australian parliament. It is the proposal of the company to transfer the existing work force to that new mine site and to employ some additional 20 or 30 workers. If the bill under discussion today became law, it would prohibit that mining activity now excised from the national park. The proposal is thus quite contentious.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This matter was considered by the Western Australian parliamentary Labor Party in June of this year. That body, in resolving the issue, determined to apply what is known as the resolution of conflict policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The resolution of conflict policy was created around 1990 when, as I recall, Dr Lawrence was the leader of the state parliamentary Labor Party in Western Australia. That policy was devised to try to resolve the conflicting Green and mining interests in the area of national parks. That policy was applied by the Lawrence government and, as I understand it, is applied by the current government, although I stand to be corrected on that issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us examine that policy because it offers a very sensible middle path to the resolution of these issues. In respect of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park, the policy expressly applies four principles. It says that further exploration of the national park is expressly authorised for 36 months from November 1990. Secondly, after this period no more than one per cent of the total land area will be excised from the park. Thirdly, additional land of equal or greater size will be incorporated into the park. Fourthly, the relevant company will commit to value adding and secondary processing of the mined product in Western Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          So that resolution of conflict policy, as outlined in those four points, was adopted by the parliamentary Labor Party in 1990 when Dr Lawrence was the leader of the government in that day. It was applied throughout the life of her government and, as I under stand it, has been applied by governments after that time.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The state parliamentary Labor Party endorsed those principles and added a number of other restrictions in June of this year when it considered this issue. Firstly, it required a report from CSIRO relating to hydrology of the Lake Jasper area; secondly, an environmental assessment of the proposed mine site; thirdly, revegetation of the mine site to acceptable nature vegetation standards; and, fourthly, a further statement concerning a commitment to secondary processing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the Western Australian state parliamentary Labor Party brought a very moderate and sensible approach to this problem of mining in national parks. It followed longstanding policy established by the Lawrence Labor government: it accepted excision of the boundary area of the national park for the purpose of mining; it required the company to purchase and gift to the state a parcel of land of equal or superior condition to that which had been excised; it required complete rehabilitation of the mine site at the conclusion of the mining process; and, finally, it required value adding of the mined product.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would submit to the Senate that this is a most sensible and balanced position. It protects the long&amp;hyphen;term integrity of the park; enlarges the size of the park; protects the vegetation, the flora and the fauna by requiring rehabilitation; allows development, wealth creation, value adding and employment to grow; resolves conflict; is not all for one side or the other, but it does protect the long&amp;hyphen;term interests of greens and conservationists; advances the immediate interests of miners, mine workers and their families; and is a considered and rational approach to resolution of these seemingly intractable documents. I commend that resolution of conflict policy to the Senate for consideration.

        The company, Cable Sands Western Australia, appear to appreciate that point of view as well. In a pamphlet which Senator Crane tabled earlier in the debate, they also draw attention to the environmental aspects of the area where sand mining is proposed. In that information document, they draw attention to the scientific surveys that have occurred: the hydrological study of Lake Jasper; the dieback survey; the vegetation studies; the fauna studies; and the Linnean studies of Lake Jasper. They also take account of the Aboriginal interests in the area, and I am quite appreciative that they do.

        Some representatives of the company came to Canberra earlier this week and sought to meet with myself and other Labor senators from Western Australia. I was certainly glad I had the opportunity to meet them. I met with Mr Ken Mills and Mr Christopher Davies to discuss the matter and to have them put their points of view to me as a senator representing the state of Western Australia. I make this point very clearly so that there is no confusion: Mr Mills and Mr Davies left the consultation that I had with them under no misapprehension that no commitments were given one way or the other from myself to support their proposal for mining in that particular region of my state.

         I have obviously followed the debate on the matter. It has been the subject of quite con siderable debate in Western Australia. My colleague Senator Bishop has referred to some of the debates that have taken place in both the upper house and the lower house of the state parliament. Unlike my colleagues in the state parliament of Western Australia, I have not had the opportunity to do an on&amp;hyphen;site inspection of the proposal. One of the things that I put to company representatives when I met with them on Monday of this week was that I would like to do not only an on&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;ground inspection, but when you look at a map of Lake Jasper, one appreciates that the only way you can get to it is by foot, so I would also like to fly over the area in order to get a proper appreciation.

        In the pamphlet which Senator Crane tabled earlier, there is a photograph which shows the lake, the proposed mining area and the area that Cable Sands proposed to transfer in exchange for the area that they want to mine. Quite clearly and quite graphically, the photograph contained in the pamphlet shows some of the area that is being handed back. I thought it looked like an area that had been mined previously. It does not make a particularly pretty picture in the brochure that the company put out. The photographs contained in a different publication, to which I have had access, put the matter in a somewhat different light. But I do not think you could do any better than see what the proposal is all about at first hand.

          —I rise to support the government members' minority report into the abolition of DIFF, the development import finance facility. This inquiry was nothing more than a cynical attempt by the opposition to discredit the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer. The opposition at
          <break page="4466" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">

         Through the numbers in the Senate, the inquiry went to a Senate references committee on which the opposition has a majority. I think that was inappropriate, but that is an argument for another time. The opposition's report is a last ditch stand to bring the minister to task—and what a weak attempt it is. Nothing has come out of this inquiry, after weeks of evidence and close interrogation by the opposition, that was not known before. No additional information has come to light that has not already been forwarded by the minister, firstly, in his statement to the parliament on 26 June and, secondly, in his subsequent letter to the Speaker on 19 July.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All the opposition majority report can come up with were the following recommendations: firstly, that Mr Downer be requested to appear before the committee to give evidence; secondly, that the Senate order the Minister for Foreign Affairs to provide the committee with more documents and more information; and, thirdly, an extension of time for the committee to report to the Senate on terms of reference (d) and (f) by one month after the first two recommendations are complied with. This is a pretty weak effort. This is after putting five senior AusAID and DFAT officials through an interrogation, which included over 900 questions, over a period of nine hours in four separate sessions.

         The senior officers who faced this barrage included: two deputy secretaries, a first assistant secretary and two assistant secretaries from DFAT; and the Director-General of AusAID. AusAID and DFAT also submitted a comprehensive 105-page joint submission. As well, a considerable amount of additional material has since been provided in writing by AusAID and DFAT. The government has been entirely open and cooperative. The only information not provided was information which no government would consider releasing due to considerations of national interest; that being the confidentiality that exists between governments and their officials and inter-government communications—all of this

         It is worth noting that the minister's non-appearance was in accordance with proper procedure and consistent with the long tradition observed by governments of both persuasions that ministers from the House of Representatives do not appear before Senate committees. We can all well remember Mr Keating's famous statement in December 1992, where he said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Then you want a Minister from the House of Representatives chamber to wander over to the unrepresentative chamber and account for himself. You have got to be joking.

        </para>
        <para>
         That was the reply to a request of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council for both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to appear. I also recall that, in 1994 in the Senate select committee on the print media of which I was a member, we attempted to call the Treasurer to come before the committee to answer some queries about the operation of the FIRB. The Treasurer refused to provide documents and, in fact, instructed officers not to give evidence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other recommendation in the majority report that I take particular exception to is that the withdrawal of funding has had a serious effect on Australia-Indonesia relations or in fact on Australia's relations with the four DIFF recipient countries or in fact other regional countries in east Asia and the South Pacific. As the minority report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . Australia's relations with China, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines are multi&amp;hyphen;faceted and multi&amp;hyphen;layered and not so fragile as to fracture over the termination of the DIFF scheme and that the aid relationship is only one small part of the overall bilateral relationships.
        </para>
        <para>
         It further states that the government's decision to provide additional funding of $64 million for high priority projects, able to be nominated by recipient country governments, will go some considerable distance toward accommodating those high priority project applications that had significantly advanced through
         <break page="4467" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the selection process at the time of the scheme's termination.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst the majority report adequately describes the scheme's history and evolution, the manner in which the opposition members have interpreted aspects of the evidence fails to take into account both the breadth of the evidence presented to the committee and the economic imperatives underpinning the decision to terminate the scheme. It must be remembered that this government inherited a $8 billion deficit on 2 March. It is sensible that some contribution be made to that from the aid budget. It would not be possible, nor desirable, to exempt the aid budget while other departments and programs bear the full brunt of cost cutting.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I would like to say a few words in regard to the equal impact on the Australian economy and on those Australian companies who had been involved in the DIFF scheme. Whilst the evidence presented to the committee did not enable a definitive assessment regarding the extent to which DIFF provided industry assistance to exporters to be made, the evidence provided by some company representatives indicated that a concessional finance package was necessary in order to engage in project negotiations with certain countries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst individual companies detailed the commercial benefits flowing to them as a result of winning DIFF support, the net effect on the Australian economy is unclear. There have been a number of inquiries provided by the government, some of which remained reasonably unpublished, including making DIFF better, which bore that position out.

         this morning headed  `Aboriginal infant mortality three times that of others'. I would like to say a little about Aboriginal health in Australia and Western Australia in particular. Much has been said recently in the media about Aboriginal health and, more specifically, World Vision over the last week or so has criticised the record of Aboriginal health in Western Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to put on record in the Senate the other side of the story about Aboriginal health issues in Western Australia and I am sure in other parts of Australia as well. The truth of the matter is that, while there are certainly still significant health problems in the area of Aboriginal health, a great deal of progress has been made. I think the very dedicated people who work in the Aboriginal health area deserve to be recognised for their contributions. Instead of a constant stream of disheartening brickbats, I would like to see those dedicated health workers receive a few bouquets.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The most important point I would like to make is that, were the solutions to the problems of Aboriginal heath simple, the problems which exist in Aboriginal health would have been solved long ago. Were it just a matter of providing more funding for Aboriginal health, again the problems would have been solved long ago.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason why Aboriginal health problems have persisted is precisely because the whole question of Aboriginal health is very complex indeed. Factors which are relevant to the problems in Aboriginal health include cultural factors, such as the fact that Aborigines living in remote communities often sleep with dogs which, for example, carry scabies, which is thereby passed on to both children and adults. The Pilbara Public Health Service now has a program to encourage Aboriginal
        <break page="4468" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         communities to accept the need to treat diseases in dogs and vaccinate dogs in camps. Only experience would have brought that problem to light.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Also relevant is the fact that Aborigines in remote communities do not like living in western style housing, but prefer to live in open style accommodation in which there is little protection from the elements so that babies and older children get frequent chest infections. Last November, I attended the Kimberley medical conference in Broome at which Aboriginal health issues were discussed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the problems which was highlighted was that resources are not unlimited and medical services can only be provided to reasonably permanent communities. Servicing difficulties arose with the proliferation of temporary out&amp;hyphen;stations located away from the main communities. The out&amp;hyphen;stations often comprise only small groups of people and it is just not physically possible for medical staff to maintain services to them. The same applies to the provision of other government funded infrastructure such as housing, water, sewerage, power, schools and roads.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The health problems faced by adult Aborigines include a high incidence of blood pressure and diabetes which is undoubtedly related to the adoption of a western diet. The key to dealing with these problems is to change the diet of Aboriginals, but that is more easily said than done. It seems that Aboriginals are genetically disposed to storing excess energy as fat. This is said to be due to the effect of the so-called thrifty gene. A Monash University study showed a few years ago that when Aborigines are returned to their traditional diet they lose weight and their diabetes and high  blood pressure gets better.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There have been significant improvements in the health of Aboriginal people in Western Australia over the past two decades. These improvements are particularly reflected by child health statistics. In 1970 in Western Australia, Aboriginal infant mortality was estimated at 46 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to 15 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1993.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Western Australia, the case fatality rate for gastroenteritis in 1970 was approximately five per cent among Aboriginal infants. It is now close to zero. There has also been a significant decline in infant and child hospitalisation rates for respiratory tract diseases in Western Australia over the same period. While there was little information about immunisation coverage among Aboriginal children in 1970 there are now very high rates of coverage—in excess of 95 per cent—for vaccine preventible diseases in Aboriginal children throughout Western Australia. Furthermore, in the Kimberley region of WA there has been a significant increase of about 50 grams in the mean birth weight of Aboriginal babies over the past 20 years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These improvements have been primarily due to the concerted efforts of public and community health services that provide such services as maternal and child health programs, immunisation programs, screening programs for diseases, abnormalities in young children and the provision of preventative services to counter problems such as sexually transmitted diseases and alcoholism and to improve the diet of Aboriginal people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Over the last decade, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of the role of Aboriginal health workers and Aboriginal environmental health workers in the improvement of the health of Aboriginal people. This led to accredited training courses and career structures for health workers in 1994 and current negotiations to develop a similar training program and career structure for environmental health workers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The health department of Western Australia increased the focus on Aboriginal health in the 1980s by the establishment of an Aboriginal health policy unit. In November 1995, a restructure of the health department led to the establishment of the Office of Aboriginal Health which aims to deliver an effective and efficient health service that best meets the cultural and traditional needs of the Aboriginal people of Western Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to name a few of the dedicated individuals who have made great contributions to the improvement of Aboriginal health in the north of Western Australia in the last
         <break page="4469" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          20 years. Dr Lawson Holman was for many years the Kimberley regional surgeon based in Derby. He thought up the concept of mobile field nurses who could take preventative medical care out to Aboriginal communities which developed into the WA Community Health Nursing Service. Dr Randy Spargo, as the Director of Kimberley Public Health, did important work on nutritional deficiencies in Aborigines for which he was awarded an Order of Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are nurses such as Helen Sullivan, who also received an Order of Australia for her work with Aboriginal communities in the Fitzroy River Valley, and Sister Sally Murray Connelly, who for nearly 20 years has once a week driven a four&amp;hyphen;wheel drive vehicle out to the Yande Yarra community on the banks of the Yule River in Pilbara to provide largely preventative medical services to that community. There are many more doctors, nurses and Aboriginal health workers, such as Vicky Dhu, Jenny Baraga and May Eckerman, who have likewise worked hard to improve Aboriginal health.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, while significant improvements have been made over the last 20 years with respect to some aspects of the health of Aboriginal people, unfortunately it is still true that the level of ill&amp;hyphen;health among the Aboriginal population of Western Australia and Australia in general remains disturbingly high compared with levels in non&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal people. That is a matter which should rightly concern the Senate and all members of the Australian community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, I believe the Senate should respect the fact that a great deal of effort is going into bringing these sad statistics about Aboriginal health into line with the record for other Australians and not be tempted into the trap of accepting the kind of simplistic criticisms which are made by people in organisations who really know very little about what is being done to improve Aboriginal health in this country.

The average immigration intake over that period from 1984&amp;hyphen;85 to 1994&amp;hyphen;95 was 102,188 per financial year. That makes a total of approximately 1,226,000 for the period. Of these, according to Ms Hanson, 40 per cent were of Asian origin. This equates to less than 2.9 per cent of the total population. Ms Hanson's views are paranoid and deceitful.

Let it be the judge of the racists of the 1950s and 1960s. Australia is a much richer country in every way for the contribution of the southern European migrants of the 1950s and 1960s.

Their community events, despite the ignorant views of Ms Hanson and her ilk, are a blend of Asian and Australian activities. The Tet Festival is an excellent example of this. Many members on the opposite side have been to the Tet Festival held in Footscray Park every year and I congratulate them on that. It is a brilliant display of dragon dance, music, fairground rides, sporting activities and stalls of diverse nature. This festival is a joyous occasion shared by people of all backgrounds in Footscray and from throughout Melbourne. It is not the cause of a Bosnia&amp;hyphen;style situation as her alarmist claims would have you believe.

        I would now like to turn to the role of the Prime Minister, particularly in light of the campaign slogan used by the coalition in the last election, `For all of us'. It now seems that `us' does not include Australians who have an Asian background. John Howard should know better than anyone that he was elected as Prime Minister to lead all Australians. He craves to be a statesman; history will not remember him so. Yes, free speech is vital but by going missing in action in response to Ms Hanson he shames himself and he shames Australia by his silence.

        The Commission on Government recommended at recommendation 66 the inclusion of `improper conduct' within the Official Corruption Commission's jurisdiction; at recommendation 69 that the commission should receive, oversee and investigate all complaints against police; at recommendation 70 that the commission should be accountable to parliament and the people; and at recommendation 73 that whistleblowers disclosure legislation is a mechanism for the prevention and exposure of impropriety and corruption in Western Australia. Currently only people who provide information which is within the jurisdiction of the OCC can be protected against reprisals under statutory and common law protection. This means that for people wishing to raise issues of improper conduct which fall outside the new act's definition only limited protection exists. New legislation should be enacted to protect people who make public interest disclosures.

        The Court government made amendments to the Official Corruption Commission. The Court government has denied the will of parliament by failing to proclaim the Official Corruption Commission Amendment Act 1996 in its entirety. The substantive provisions of the act have not been proclaimed. See the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Western Australian Gazette
        </emphasis>
        , 30 August 1996, No. 124. The sections which have been proclaimed by the Court government are those which change the name of the commission to the Anti-Corruption Commission and establish new eligibility requirements for the commissioners. This begs the question: is it the government's intention to proclaim the rest of the act before the election? A government that was genuinely pursuing corrupt, illegal and improper conduct in its public institutions would have no hesitation in strengthening and widening the powers of the Anti-Corruption Commission now for the benefit of all West Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a number of deficiencies in the new Official Corruption Commission Amendment Act 1996 passed to establish the Anti-Corruption Commission. The Western Australian government's new ACC fails to meet a number of recommendations made by the Commission on Government and these can be identified as follows.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under the heading `Philosophy', principles such as openness, transparency, accountability and independence are lacking in the legislation establishing the ACC. There has been a failure by the government to approach anti-corruption measures comprehensively. While the government has passed legislation which deals with disclosures on corrupt and criminal conduct by public officials, it fails to correspondingly implement provisions for public interest disclosures such as the establishment of a whistleblower scheme to encourage such disclosure. There is no responsibility by CEOs or agencies to establish internal procedures to facilitate the making of disclosure or to develop and encourage an ethical climate—
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that is, through codes of conduct or induction. Nor is there responsibility of chief executive officers or agencies to protect internal whistleblowers or to address and establish anti-corruption measures.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In regard to powers, although the powers of a special investigator appointed by the proposed ACC are considerable, namely the powers of a royal commission, the limitations to the powers of the proposed commission are nevertheless extensive. Some of these limitations are as follows. The proposed ACC only has recommendatory powers, not powers of investigation. The new legislation fails to keep the Anti-Corruption Commission out of executive hands. The reporting requirements of the ACC are limited and are still blanketed in secrecy as it is not mandatory for the ACC to report to parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Powers of the ACC to receive information and investigate allegations about the conduct of a person in his or her capacity as to the holder of a judicial office are limited to matters which relate to an offence under section 122 of the Criminal Code. It does not, therefore, have the power to investigate less serious activities such as improper conduct. Although attempts have been made to encompass members of parliament within the ACC's jurisdiction, ancillary amendments linking the jurisdiction of the ACC to a breach of code of conduct of an MP are lacking.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to ex-Public Service officers, no enforcement provisions have been provided, even though the ACC may receive allegations and invoke investigations against ex-Public Service officers. The ACC may only report facts and may not make findings. This may prove difficult without some guidelines in relation to weight, standard of proof and credibility of evidence. Even though the special investigator has the powers of a royal commission if appointed, that evidence may only be taken in private. This does not correspondingly endow the ACC with even the appearance of openness, accountability and independence. Save for listening device authorised use, no police powers have been given to the ACC. The ACC has no powers to provide protection for whistleblowers from
        <break page="4473" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         threat or harassment. The ACC has no enforcement powers.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In regard to accountability, secrecy provisions are still inhibitive of openness, transparency and accountability. The reporting provisions under the Financial Administration and Audit Act should be more specific. There is no provision for compulsory reporting to parliament. This means that the ACC is a creature of the executive and in the current structure it is not accountable to the parliament and, therefore, to the people. There is no legislative requirement for a joint standing committee of parliament to be established and the new legislation fails to establish whistleblower legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In regard to whistleblowers, the failure of the government to implement comprehensive whistleblowing provisions or legislation is a fundamental weakness in this new legislation which is intended to establish a commission which investigates, exposes and prevents corruption and impropriety. While the new ACC provides somewhere for whistleblowers to go and disclose their information, a similar function is served by a number of other agencies, the ombudsman and the police. The ACC does not provide protection for whistleblowers who make disclosures which are within the jurisdiction of the commission. It also does not provide other services such as advice or counselling for whistleblowers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ACC has no anti&amp;hyphen;corruption functions as recommended by the Commission on Government. In the absence of efforts to encourage the prevention of corruption as part of the climate of the public and private sector, the battle to encourage disclosure will be more difficult. Where corruption and improper conduct is considered to be the norm, not only will disclosure be more difficult but an awareness of what is corrupt and improper will be lost.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We need a coherent system. The proposed changes do not appear to be made with reference to the current inadequacies as highlighted by the Commission on Government concerning the Public Sector Management Act 1994 and the current legislative and operational inadequacies of the state ombudsman.

         —I rise tonight to draw to the attention of the Senate more evidence regarding the failings of the coalition government to implement policies and commitments that they gave at the election in March. There are numerous examples that one could give, as has been demonstrated over recent days regarding the inability of this government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to live up to the commitments they made.

        One of the commitments that the now Prime Minister made was to `maintain the real value of all pension benefits and other entitlements for low income earners.' One of the most disgraceful decisions of this government contained in the budget is the proposal to axe the Commonwealth dental health program. This was a program introduced by the previous Labor government to provide equity of access to dental health care for less fortunate members of our community.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The scheme provided funds to hospitals so as to reduce the waiting list for those unable

         to afford dental care. Funding for the program was in the order of $350 million over the last three years of the Labor government. There is no doubt that this program was a success. Since its introduction, waiting lists for people waiting for dental treatment have reduced from some two years or more down to, in most cases, approximately one month.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am sure all honourable senators recognise the distress that can exist for people, particularly elderly people on pensions, waiting for dental treatment. To have to wait for two years or more was indeed a matter of great concern, and the previous Labor government introduced this scheme to reduce that waiting period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was an outstanding success, recognised by many health care groups, hospitals, dental services and others throughout the community. What it meant was that pensioners and health care card holders had access to real, ongoing preventative dental care, not just emergency care. In the last financial year of the Labor government, 1995&amp;hyphen;96, it spent around $106 million on the program and, all told, around 500,000 people were able to be treated under this scheme.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Unfortunately—and unfortunately particularly for many people living in western Sydney—this program is to be abolished. In its first budget the coalition government cut funds available to dental clinics and consequently we are going to see a massive reduction in services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Who will be affected? For a start, 36 per cent of those that were using the program were aged pensioners, so the elderly will be affected. Thirty per cent of people accessing the program were in receipt of other pension entitlements such as sole parents, disability pensions and so on. Of course, many of the unemployed were able to access this program.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All told, around 21,000 people in western Sydney alone received emergency or preventative health care. In areas such as Westmead, the Nepean, Mount Druitt and Katoomba many people were able to receive treatment as a result of this program. Therefore it is very distressing and disturbing for the people of western Sydney—many of whom will get an opportunity next Saturday in the Lindsay

        Last Tuesday in the Senate the minister responsible in this chamber, Senator Newman, was waxing lyrical about how she had visited the electorate of Lindsay to assist her friend the Liberal candidate, who could not even get her own nomination correct. The minister was in the electorate to try and help, in a belated way, the candidate from the Liberal party to regain the seat. I would not mind betting that there were two places in the electorate that the minister did not get to visit and in fact avoided visiting. They would be, firstly, the Wentworth Area Health Services and, secondly, the Blue Mountains District Health Services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason she would not have wanted to visit these two health service providers is that they would have given very bad news to the minister about the impact of this decision. For instance, the Wentworth area health service has indicated that the impact of this decision will be such that five people from the health service will be expected to lose their jobs before the end of this year. That is a huge cut in the provision of services available for the many people living in the area who will want to access them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All told, it is expected that around 100 patient visits per week will be lost as a result of the impact of this cut and eventual abolition of this program from the Wentworth area health service. It has also been indicated by the health services within western Sydney that, as a result of the abolition of this program, the waiting lists will soar back up again—they will increase from around one month, which is now the approximate waiting time, to up to two years and maybe even longer. For anybody waiting for dental treatment for that length of time, particularly the elderly, it must be incredibly distressing. It is a cruel, indeed despicable, action on the part of this government to cut funding from such a worthwhile program which has delivered relief to so many hundreds of thousands of people in recent years.

It may be okay for the millionaire shareholders on the front bench of the government to pay $200 or more an hour for dental treatment, but there are many people in Lindsay and in other parts of western Sydney who cannot afford that and who do not have the opportunity to even consider having a share portfolio. They will get their chance on Saturday to re-elect Ross Free as the member for Lindsay and to start to put an end to the sorts of policies that this government is seeking to inflict upon the residents of that electorate and upon people of western Sydney—the real battlers in this community.

       The figure of more than $76,000 is the cost per net impact of the JobSkills program. That is the cost of each extra job obtained by JobSkills participants, over and above jobs that were obtained by those who did not receive assistance. This cost is calculated with reference to program net unit costs.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The net unit cost of JobSkills is derived from the average gross unit cost of assistance and estimated savings in Newstart Allowance (NSA) payments accruing to the Department of Social Security (DSS) as a result of jobseekers participating in the program. The formula for calculating net unit costs was developed in collaboration with DSS, the Department of Finance and the Treasury. The formula includes a range of parameters amongst which are the duration of program assistance, the proportion of participants on NSA and averaged NSA rates. In relation to calculation of the figure reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, the gross cost of JobSkills was $9,971 for each person assisted. The offset or reduction for savings in NSA payments was $3,845, giving a net unit cost of $6,126.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Program net impact is measured by comparing the unsubsidised employment levels of former participants and those of similar long term unemployed who were not assisted. Program participants and non&amp;hyphen;participants are matched on key criteria such as duration of unemployment, age, gender, educational attainment and geographical location. Comparisons of this kind have shown that while 6 months after leaving the program 39 percent of JobSkills participants were in unsubsidised work, 31 percent of those not assisted were also in unsubsidised jobs. This means that there is an increase of 8 percentage points in the likelihood of any individual finding work as a consequence of participating in the program and implies a cost to

The Department's data show that just 22 percent of former New Work Opportunities participants have progressed to unsubsidised jobs. In view of this extremely low post program employment level, and assuming a level of effectiveness not dissimilar to that of JobSkills, a cost of at least $100,000 per net impact could be expected.

       The 1996&amp;hyphen;97 Budget provides for the most significant reorganisation of labour market assistance in fifty years. In the lead up to the introduction of the new arrangements in December 1997, the current case management system will continue under the Employment Services Act. The Employment Services Regulatory Authority is currently undertaking a new tender round for the period 1 December 1996 to 30 November 1997. It is envisaged that expenditure on case management in this period will be some $197 million. Under the arrangements to apply from December 1997, some CES staff will transfer to a new service delivery agency to provide registration, assessment, referral and compliance services. The remaining CES staff will join with Employment Assistance Australia staff to form the new corporatised public employment placement enterprise (EPE). The public EPE will compete with private and community sector EPEs to provide employment services to job seekers. Job seekers will be able to nominate their preferred EPE. There will be increased choice for job seekers as the full range of employment services, not just case management, will be available from the private, community and public sectors.
