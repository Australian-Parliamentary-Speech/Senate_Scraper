         —When this debate was interrupted at about midnight on Tuesday night, I had just made the point that, despite this legislation faithfully implementing the four key principles and the policy detail of our election commitment, Labor persists in misrepresenting it. Rather than an end to a cooperative era, as Mr McMullan had claimed, in contrast to that false claim this legislation represents the very beginning of the cooperative era. It is an end to the standover tactics employed by a diminishing union movement desperate to cling to the relics of the past.

         There is clear community support for the bill, despite claims to the contrary by unions. It is in the interests of employees and employers, of the Australian economy overall and, most importantly, in the interests of the unemployed for the Senate to pass the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amend ment Bill as presented. We should not bow to the trade unions and their minions sitting on the opposition benches of this chamber and in the other place.

        It is worth noting that more than half of senators opposite retain membership of trade unions. One can question whether there is a conflict of interest on the part of those senators in seeking to oppose and change this legislation. They have a direct conflict of interest as members of unions seeking to change this legislation, simply because the trade union movement is opposed to any reduction in power that will result from this legislation. That is a question that ought to be asked in the light of their performance in the last 24 hours or so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Too many senators opposite have links with the trade union movement and have used that movement as a stepping stone into this place. In contrast, too few of them have direct practical experience of private business as employers. They have approached the government's industrial relations reforms from a biased position protective of trade unions. It is the unions and in particular the ACTU's continued campaign of fear and loathing promised during the election campaign which has caused some unnecessary anxiety in the community about this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand that some 80 community groups have appealed to the opposition, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents to keep the government to its election commitment that no Australian worker will be worse off under our new industrial relations laws. We will honour that commitment. It is a fundamental part of the government's policy to release Australian workers and their families from the Labor imposed industrial relations yoke and to achieve a better quality of life as a result.

        The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised that, for the first time in Australia, people will be permitted to reach agreement at the workplace level without unwanted, undesired and unnecessary third&amp;hyphen;party intrusion. It is worth noting in that context that a recent research study published in yesterday's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Adelaide Advertiser
        </emphasis>
        shows that in South Australia union membership has fallen to 15.5 per cent
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of the work force—a fall of more than 40 per cent over the last 15 years. That is how representative this mob opposite are—15 per cent of the work force. In relation to comments I have made about undesired third&amp;hyphen;party intrusion, that study also showed that employers were unhappy with unions brokering agreements in which they `simply walk in with a template plan asking for a 20 per cent increase over two years and demand the employer sign the agreement'.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is what has been happening. We have not had any genuine enterprise negotiations relevant to local employment conditions and to the needs of local firms under Labor's legislation. We have had these enforced template agreements. We need to remember that when we hear this nonsense opposite about workers being forced to sign agreements under this legislation, because it is the unions that have forced employers to sign agreements under the existing legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Passage of this bill will mean that Australian workers will be released from this union stranglehold which has decreed when, where and how people may perform their jobs. There will be freedom to negotiate. Although unions will still have their place, that place will only be relevant if members want them involved. So this government retains its commitment that no Australian worker will be worse off under this legislation.

        Labor's scaremongering about the working poor is a blatant misrepresentation of the government's industrial relations reform. Quite specifically, under this legislation, the safety nets are in place, no worker will be subjected to duress in the process of formulating a workplace agreement and workers will be freed of unwanted union interference. A major shortcoming of Labor's existing laws is that a union without any members in a workplace is nevertheless able to argue against various working conditions agreed in that non-union workplace and they could actually contest that agreement in the Industrial Relations Commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The previous Labor government's enterprise flexibility agreements, supposedly designed for the non-union sector, could not be established without union involvement or approval

         by the Industrial Relations Commission. A union with no connections to a particular work force could argue against conditions in that workplace. Under our bill, union members can choose to remain with their respective unions. Unions will still have a role to play in Australia's industrial relations, as I said earlier, if the worker wants that involvement.

        There are many safeguards for employees built into the legislation, including the role of the Employment Advocate to investigate alleged breaches of Australian workplace agreements. It is to the Labor Party's and the trade union's everlasting detriment that they have stirred up unwarranted anxiety in the community about the changes proposed in this bill simply by misrepresenting the facts of the legislation. The community's anxieties are fictional, not factual. Employees will not be worse off. The legislation will give hope to the unemployed, encourage the private sector to employ and improve our international competitiveness, which will in turn reduce our national debt.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Under Labor, the employment sector, small business in particular, was too scared to employ because of the draconian restrictions placed on employers by Labor's legislation. By contrast, this government's new legislation has a central theme of cooperation with two parties agreeing to a contract of mutual benefit, taking us away from the dispute and fear regime of the past decade. Individual skills will be recognised under the new legislation. Those who show talent in the workplace will be rewarded. Productivity will be encouraged. The rigid award system favoured by Labor will be freed up and employers will have the right to reward employees whom they value.

         The federal government's industrial relations legislation will remove restrictions on employers hiring permanent  part-time employees, representing a significant benefit to many working women currently juggling work and family responsibilities. Our bill will return respectability to permanent part-time work. The Labor Party has, for years, paid lip&amp;hyphen;service to the plight of women in the workplace and those with family responsibili ties returning to the workplace. Yet current restrictions on permanent part-time employees have caused a vast increase in the numbers of casual workers who do not have the security of set hours with predictable pay levels, do not have the security of sick and recreational leave and do not have access to the myriad of other securities available to full-time workers.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Employees with family responsibilities need to know when they will be at work and how much income they will get. They also need to know that their job is safe and that they are secure. Yet current restrictions in place under some awards restrict permanent part-time work to at least 16 hours a week. If you are not going to work that minimum or more, you cannot be employed on a permanent part-time basis and have those benefits.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I return to some of the other benefits of this legislation, in particular for employers. In the past, employers have found themselves victims of boycotts and industrial disputes which have nothing to do with them. This legislation will return secondary boycott provisions. Employers will be able, under the Trade Practices Act, sections 45D and 45E, to turn to injunctive relief against unions which engage in secondary boycotts. Critically important to employers is the scrapping of the unworkable unfair dismissal laws. Once this bill is passed, both employers and employees will be able to get a fair go in this regard and this important facet of workplace activity will no longer be so badly out of kilter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is worth remembering that, of the 23,000 applications for unfair dismissal which have been filed, only 3,500 have been before the Industrial Relations Commission. Employers have been faced with the unhappy choice of either defending at great cost their reasons for sacking a person or agreeing to out of court settlements, even if that person had been caught stealing, had not fulfilled work obligations or had provided numerous other reasons for the termination of their employment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Apart from the ridiculous havoc that failure to precisely adhere to procedural requirements wrought on employers, the sheer cost of Labor's unfair dismissal provisions rendered them unworkable. Under this legislation, they will no longer exist. The appeals of small

        In contrast to the positive legislation proposed by the government, the ACTU's living wage proposal to raise minimum wages by 30 per cent over the next three years is fraught with economic disaster. The imposition of this living wage would not lift Australian families out of poverty. Most poor households do not have a full-time employed member but are either predominantly in casual or part-time employment or, as a result of the previous Labor government's mismanagement, unemployed. So they are not going to benefit from this proposal. More than two million Australians, one&amp;hyphen;quarter of the work force, are part-time employees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Higher minimum wages would increase income levels of very few part-time workers and would be more likely to result in a reduction in the number of hours of work offered to them. Employment opportunities for Australian workers with low skill levels will also be adversely affected by such a sharp increase in minimum wages unless there is a uniform 30 per cent pay increase across the entire work force. That would neutralise the whole purpose of this living wage proposal.

        As a Victorian senator, it was no great surprise to discover that after the election the coalition quickly discarded their moderate language. Victorian workers were lied to by Jeff Kennett and now Australian workers have been deceived by the federal coalition, led by John Howard.

         On 23 July 1992, the Industrial Relations Commission was given power to review unfair contracts. On 30 March 1994, these powers transferred to the Industrial Relations Court. These powers allowed the court to vary a contract and set aside the whole or part of the contract. The court can intervene if it finds a contract for services is either unfair or harsh.

         Section 127A(4) lists the following factors for the court to consider in deciding if a contract is unfair or harsh: the relative bargaining strength of the parties to the contract; whether there was any undue influence or pressure exerted on the party; and whether the contract provides for total remuneration which is less than that of an employee performing similar work. These provisions were introduced both to deal with the shams created by some employers to avoid award requirements and in recognition of the changing nature of the work force.

         Some senators may believe that an owner-driver contractor should not be considered an industrial relationship. Let me deal with this immediately. An owner-driver contract is an industrial relationship. This is indicated by the following common practices in the industry. Owner-drivers perform work at the direction and control of their prime contractor. Many receive annual leave, sick leave and RDO entitlements and are paid without invoicing. Many operate equipment which is owned and installed by the prime contractor. Many are captive and prohibited from working for other parties.

Allow me to give you a real life example. Mick Nealor is an owner-driver for Comet of Footscray Road in Melbourne. Mick works alongside 40 employee drivers in his yard. Mick drives a truck which is painted in the same Comet colours as the employee truck drivers. Mick wears the same uniform as the employee driver. Mick will be directed in his work by the same Comet supervisor. Mick's

The major industrial relations issues at Comet in respect of Mick will be determined by the same industrial relations managers who determine the same issues for their employee drivers at Comet. The fundamental point is that Mick's bargaining position is very similar to the bargaining position of the employees at Comet.

         Mick differs from an employee driver in the following critical respect. Mick is required to invest his own capital in the tools of the trade; namely, the truck. The tools of the trade in the transport industry, trucks, are expensive. Comet are required to invest millions of dollars in a very expensive transport fleet if they engage employees to work for them. The reason owner-drivers like  Mick are an attractive work force for Comet is that it allows Comet to avoid this capital investment. Using Mick is a way for Comet to use their work force's private capital to purchase a transport fleet which they use. The result is that the employer does not risk the investment in the capital but rather the risk is transferred to Comet's labour force. In the light of these risks it could easily be argued that the owner-driver should be afforded greater protection, not less.

         Section 127A is the only provision in the act that recognises that owner-drivers have any rights. There is no minimum pay or conditions set out anywhere in the rest of the act.

Owner-drivers will be forced into the common law system. This system treats owner-drivers as business people with commercial interests rather than workers.

         In Victoria there has been an explosion of owner-drivers. Many employers have sought to exploit this situation by forcing the employees—no choice involved—to become owner-drivers so that an employer can transfer liabilities to the new owner-driver. The courier industry is a depressing example of this phenomenon. In 1988 there were 18 courier companies in Victoria. In 1996 there are 275. This explosion in the number of owner&amp;hyphen;drivers means that there is an absolute inequality in bargaining power when seeking work. This means that companies can unilaterally set conditions. Negotiations over terms of employment are non-existent. Many drivers are shown a contract, asked to sign and not even given a copy of the contract they have signed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The unfairness and exploitation encountered by courier drivers across the industry is reflected in the following examples of contracts in Victoria. Common contracts include: workcover, superannuation and insurance obligations on the driver rather than on the company; radio fees; administration fees; aerial fees; uniform fees; delays between four and six weeks in being paid; and the company has the right to unilaterally alter rates and conditions. These fees that I have listed are simply deducted from the driver's pay.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If a driver were to terminate his contract he would discover many of the following: up to 10 weeks delay in being paid outstanding entitlements; a range of hidden extras which are deducted from the driver's last pay, including radio removal fees, uniform fees again and fees for replacing signage; and being prevented from working for a customer after termination. The individual courier owner&amp;hyphen;driver is not offered any choice but to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          accept these terms or look for work somewhere else.

         The other significant area of the transport industry that has many owner&amp;hyphen;drivers is the long&amp;hyphen;distance interstate sector. Figures collated from employer organisations illustrate how harshly these drivers have fared in the last four years. On average in this sector, rates paid to drivers have increased by only 3.27 per cent. Over the same period the CPI transport index increased by 12.45 per cent. These increased costs have swamped the rate increase. The squeeze has meant a significant reduction for the driver's labour.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The consequences of these falling rates and a completely unregulated market include: as rates cannot keep up with the increasing costs of fuel, tyres and other costs, maintenance becomes ad hoc and less frequent, corners are cut and trade-offs are made, posing obvious threats to safety on our roads; and in order for drivers to make a living, they are forced to drive increased hours. This leads to breaches of driving hours regulations and also the increased use of medical stimulants and drugs in order to perform excessive hours of driving.

         Section 127A of the act does not regulate minimum rates paid to owner&amp;hyphen;drivers but at least accepts that there should be some parity between owner&amp;hyphen;drivers and employees. If the Senate repeals section 127A, given the impracticality of common law resolutions to disputes, one of two outcomes will occur: for the weak, increased inequality and instances of unfair treatment, together with unconscionable conduct by prime contractors; or, for the strong, increased industrial disputation in the absence of any forum for the resolution of disputes.

         The second area that I wish to raise is the government's attempt to remove the current provisions which recognise awards covering the payment of superannuation and the significant reduction in the power of the IRC under the proposed bill. The immediate impact of this legislation would see an increase in industrial disputation as workers and employers fight for the ability to determine which fund employee superannuation is directed to. Many employers will want to
         <break page="3998" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          direct where their employees' superannuation is paid to. Banks will begin approaching employers to get workers to place money into the new retirement savings accounts. Banks may offer a range of inducements to the employers, such as reduced account&amp;hyphen;keeping charges on business accounts, reduced overdraft interest rates and the like. Employees will be faced with the decision to accept lower returns, higher administration charges or have a narrower range of value added services or take industrial action to pay into the fund they prefer, not the one directed by the employer.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the building unions have proved over travelling allowances, many other unions will be forced to conduct wildcat campaigns to protect their members' interests. The removal of these provisions from the act will also disadvantage workers directly as many employers who are currently required to make contributions on a monthly basis will now resort to paying a lump sum by 28 July each year. In the case of the TWU fund employers make monthly payments. This allows workers' accounts to receive compound interest throughout the year on the early contributions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the government is successful, a worker will be on a sliding scale of reducing disadvantage to the end of the year. The degree of this disadvantage can be shown by calculating the case of a worker receiving a $1,200 per annum—that is approximately $25 per week—employer SGC contribution. If held for one year—52 weeks—by the employer and not paid monthly, the employee's account balance will be $993.50. If, however, the fund received 12 regular monthly payments of $100, at the end of the year the employee would, at an average return of seven per cent per annum, have in their account $1,034.40. This represents for each worker a financial disadvantage of $40.90 in the first year alone.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To ensure that employers pay employee contributions within 28 days, the TWU superannuation fund, as do other industry funds, employ officers in the field who liaise with employers to make sure that employees' contributions are kept up to date. If superannuation award covered employees become members of funds other than industry funds, it will
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          be difficult to coerce recalcitrant employers to pay employee contributions on a regular monthly basis. The enforcement of regular payments will be even more difficult if the employer has control over where the employee's contributions are placed.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To illustrate this point, take the case of two competing superannuation funds—fund No. 1 and fund No. 2. If superannuation fund No. 1 tries to pressure an employer into regular monthly payments the employer will simply move to superannuation fund No. 2. Therefore, commercial superannuation providers have a financial disincentive to enforce what are current superannuation award standards, and so employees will be disadvantaged.

         The next point I wish to make demonstrates that this legislation breaches the Prime Minister's promise that no worker will be worse off. It relates to fee structures. Some super schemes are more suitable for some people than for others. Different schemes have different options regarding investments and, most importantly, different fee structures.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the government is successful in removing the link between industrial relations and the payment of superannuation, many workers will be worse off as they will be forced to accept a scheme that is not best for them. To illustrate this, let me compare a National Mutual scheme, an Asgard scheme, the TWU super fund and the Brambles super fund plan D. Contribution fee: National Mutual $62.50 a year; Asgard, $62.50; TWU super, nil; Brambles super fund, nil. Asset management fee: National Mutual $375 a year; Asgard, $307.50; TWU, nil; Brambles super fund, nil.

These fees total as follows: National Mutual $486.50; Asgard, $400; Brambles, $160; TWU super, $31.20. That is not tinkering at the edges, Senator Panizza.

          The final issue that I wish to address is the impact of section 152 of the bill. This is a nasty, vindictive backdoor attempt to reduce wages and conditions by allowing the state industrial relations system to have primacy over the federal system. How so, some senators on the government side ask? An Australian workplace agreement operates to the exclusion of any award. To quote the bill:
         </para>

          What will this mean for workers in Victoria? These are the minimum terms and conditions under Victorian legislation: four weeks paid annual leave for each year worked; one week sick leave for each year worked; an hourly rate of pay equal to the base award rate for the classification of employees as at the time the act commences; 52 weeks unpaid parental and adoption leave, and a right to work part-time for two years after the adoption or birth of a child. That is four conditions—not 18 but four. That is what is going to be happening to workers in the transport industry in Victoria.

          The provision of some minimum wage is of little comfort. For non&amp;hyphen;award employees there is no minimum. For employees covered by classification, their guaranteed minimum wage is frozen at the rate applying when the legislation was proclaimed. The legislation also makes extensive provisions as to long service leave, creating a statutory entitlement to 13 weeks paid long service leave after 15 years of continuous employment with one employer.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are a number of other matters which may be included in employment agreements which were illegal in Victoria. Clause 166 permits an employment agreement to allow an employer to require an employee to work for more than five hours without a meal break. Clause 167 permits—incredibly—an employment agreement to contain a provision that enables an employer to fine an employee if the employee's behaviour, attendance or obedience is, in the opinion of the employer, unsatisfactory.

          In addition to this, there is no capacity for any industrial dispute to be brought before the Employee Relations Commission of Victoria without the consent of both parties.

Quite a number of concerns have been raised about this legislation, and the concern raised and reflected by Senator Conroy is a critical one.

         My concern is that this particular legislation is on very weak ground constitutionally, for a number of reasons. It fails to confront four or five fundamental legal issues.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to address two key areas of concern. The bill is a recipe for protracted legislation and will create an enormous degree of uncertainty for all participants in industrial relations in Australia. Also, given the legal uncertainty, it is a clear recipe for damaging levels of industrial disputation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Before I go into those areas, I would like to make some preliminary observations. Unfortunately for people in an employment relationship in Australia, for the workers, this is a bill from a government which knows nothing about industrial relations except for its own blind ideology. The government sees the relationship between employer and employee as a simple economic transaction, one in which labour should be bought and sold like any other commodity in the market, according to the price that the market will pay, regardless of the needs of the worker, regardless of any need to have fairness embodied and entrenched in the system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They can dress up all their views with false platitudes and euphemisms, but this is a centrepiece of their ideology: the market should dictate. This, I must say, is a 19th century view of the work relationship. It is fundamentally flawed. It is a view that the need to be fair to workers is an impediment to the proper working of the labour market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such a view, for instance, fails to recognise that the work relationship is one of the most important and critical relationships that we enter into during our lives. It is at the heart of the productive capacity of the nation. For the whole of this century since federation, the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         The bill ignores the fact that, because of the importance of the work relationship, matters concerning it are frequently litigated at the highest level. Matters quite often go to the High Court. Decisions, like the engineers and boilermakers, which have shaped the fundamental governance in this country, arose from considerations of the Commonwealth industrial power. Matters have gone to the High Court; matters will continue to go to the High Court. This legislation will just ensure that more matters go to the High Court. It will ensure that, while being a bitter pill for workers, it will be a bonanza for lawyers.

         Some of the areas of potential challenge to the legislation have been mentioned in the House of Representatives. One area, for instance, is the issue of whether or not to restrict the commission to dealing with only 18 core conditions, and then only to the extent of prescribing minimum conditions. The validity of whether this is properly a law for conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes has been questioned by quite a number of lawyers. They have argued that to restrict the arbitrator in this way is not properly a law with regard to conciliation and arbitration.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If enacted, this law would have to be seen to be doubtful; and if enacted, it will undoubtedly be subject to challenge—challenge that might bring down the pitiful safety net which

          is provided by this bill. I am sure that the government is aware of this, and I am sure that the government would not be concerned if the safety net entrenched by this particular provision were to be struck down by the court. This is where deceit comes into this legislation—deceit where protections are based and, in fact, built like a house of cards.

         One area in which it is clear that the coalition has problems is with its understanding of the separation of powers. This is not a new problem for coalition conservative politicians in this country, but it is a fundamental problem when one looks at the basis of this legislation and the exercise of arbitral and judicial functions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A second legal issue which is of concern is that it is quite plain that the jurisdiction given to the Industrial Relations Commission by this bill over unfair dismissals looks remarkably like a judicial function. The bill sets out statutory criteria by which the function is to be worked through, by which the body needs to operate, and by which it is to be judged whether a person is unfairly dismissed. It sets out statutory guidelines for assessing proper remedies. The commission even has scope to order costs in some circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not the usual description of arbitral power. It is settled law that the Industrial Relations Commission cannot exercise judicial power. This means that, when the first employer is aggrieved by being taken to the commission, or is aggrieved by a decision of the commission, that particular employer will have a ready made decision for challenging the commission's jurisdiction. That challenge, once again, inevitably would finish up in the High Court and be decided upon by the High Court, because it goes to the heart of the powers of the commission in this particular case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what we have already is a recipe for chaos. We know from experience that a High Court challenge can take a considerable amount of time to be determined. The upshot of all this is that the government would find that its legislation, which flies in the face of established legal precedent, could quite well, in fact—I must say—probably be bowled over by the High Court. As such, all decisions
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          taken by the commission prior to it would also be struck down. So if you are talking about a case that runs for a year or so after the legislation has been put in place, you are talking about a court decision bowling over quite an amount of work done by the commission. This is not a recipe for industrial harmony; this is not a recipe for industrial stability; this is not a recipe that will lay the foundations for economic prosperity.

Senator Kemp says what a terrible thing that is. The union would also have to have rules that give the branches an autonomous fund. This appears to be designed towards two ends: one, obviously, is to reduce the effectiveness of unions by the dispersal of union resources and the second is to allow the potential for enterprise branches in the pockets of individual employers.

          The trouble for the government in this area—and I say to you Senator Kemp that this may not be the last time that you will hear these arguments, because we will come back once these provisions are struck down by the court system—is that the provision for an autonomous branch fund is based on requiring unions to have rules for enterprise branches that meet the provisions of schedule 4 of the existing act. They are the provisions addressed at state branches of federal organisa tions that are an attempt to get over a long&amp;hyphen;term problem in the industrial arena; that is, to get over the Moore v. Doyle problem of dual incorporation.

         They are based on the existing funds and assets of state branches being preserved if the branch moves to a system whereby it forgoes its incorporation under a state industrial system. A mere glance at the provisions of schedule 4 will show that that cannot apply to the creation of new enterprise branches. This will raise enormous problems, I think, in terms of the constitutionality of this section.

         We can go on to refer to the government's de&amp;hyphen;amalgamation in the proposed division 7A. Again we see ideology driving the government in this area, an ideology to damage organised labour. But once again their zealotry leads them into another area of potential legal challenge. The bill proposes, for instance, to allow the Federal Court to make orders to take the funds and assets of an existing organisation and give them to a new hived off body where a union which has undergone an amalgamation has a division. It is to take into account the assets and liabilities of the hived off body when it first amalgamated and any changes since, and the interests of creditors of the organisation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not think there is any doubt that unions will fight legally any attempt to give their assets to another body, particularly a hived off body. They might challenge whether this is truly a judicial function for a court to perform, given that with enterprise branches the commission appears to be the body responsible for ensuring that the branch gets the proper funds. If it is a judicial function, they might challenge the correctness of any allocation at law. It seems the creditors would also have standing to issue a challenge.

         Finally, in terms of another major problem legally, it is quite arguable that any audit to divest a union of its property and deliver it to a body corporate newly created by this bill is the acquisition of property for the purposes of the Commonwealth under the constitution. If that is the case, there will be a requirement, according to the constitution, of compensation on just terms. I think it would be a great irony if in its attempt to undermine trade

         All this leads to a very clear conclusion that the government is taking a constitutional gamble in this area. As a result of these matters we have to accept that there is no guarantee that the government's bill would put in place a legally or constitutionally workable framework for industrial relations in Australia. Given the enormous social and economic importance of the work relationship and the destruction this legislation would cause to it, this is a grotesque gamble with Australia's future. It is a gamble which leads to uncertainty and which leads very clearly to industrial disputation. I must say, Senator Kemp, that I am stunned that you are prepared to go down this route, pursued and driven by zealotry and ideology, and disregarding the national interest.

         There are a number of areas which are of legal concern. One that needs to be addressed in this debate is this government's intention to reintroduce into the Australian workplace the spectre of the most wasteful and unnecessary form of industrial action, the demarcation dispute. This is the sort of action the previous government worked hard, with great success, to remove from the industrial landscape. We did it by proper cooperative relationships with the trade union movement, where trade unions elected to restructure, to reduce restrictive work practices and to reduce the number of unions competing for coverage in any calling or on any work site.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This industrial harmony was able to be achieved by creating an industrial environment in which unions were able to rationalise themselves and to move away from the craft&amp;hyphen;based unionism of the past to industrial unionism. The then government's greatest contribution was to create an environment that facilitated restructuring and amalgamation by putting the proper combination of legal framework and industrial relations culture in place. Anyone with any experience of industrial relations in Australia will know what an important improvement it was in terms of industrial relations in the area of demarcation disputes during the 1980s and 1990s.

          What is most incomprehensible is that this bill contains not just one but a raft of provisions designed to cause proliferation of unions and the competition of unions for membership. The bill, for instance, will remove the conveniently belong test for the registration of new unions. What will this do? This is a test designed to ensure that new unions will not be formed that will end in damaging disputes between unions over membership in a particular area. It is a rule that has worked successfully because it has been flexible enough to allow the registration of a new union on occasions when existing unions have failed to properly represent a group of workers.

What will happen, if this particular bill gets up, is the unions that we are talking about, the enterprise branches, will become known very quickly as bosses' unions. In any workplace, you will find decent trade unionists who will find it enormously difficult to belong to these branches. As such, even if 70 per cent of people at a particular work site are part of a bosses' union, the other people will have a capacity to want to belong to another industrial organisation. What you will do with this particular legislation is fragment industrial representation in individual workplaces.

        I want to explore two important aspects of the bill and their impact on one of the most disadvantaged and most unemployment prone parts of the labour market—young Australians. The bill before us proposes two things to solve youth unemployment. Firstly, it proposes to abolish the current legislative phase&amp;hyphen;out of junior rates of pay and, basically, preserve forever discrimination against young workers simply because they are young. Secondly, this bill provides the legislative underpinning of the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system, MAATS, the government's much vaunted new labour

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Both of these proposals, in my view, are inadequate and, in the case of junior rates of pay, quite offensive. To say that young people can only keep their jobs if they are paid half the wages of adults for doing the same types of work is demeaning. To say that the MAATS scheme, with its $20 million of extra places a year, will somehow make up for the $1 billion worth of labour market and training programs that have been cut over the next two years simply defies logic.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, let me deal with junior rates of pay. Three years ago, the Australian Democrats, as many of the honourable senators here would know, supported the insertion of a provision into the Industrial Relations Act, section 90AB, declaring discrimination on the basis of age illegal. We provided an exemption of four years, until June 1997, to allow the parties to develop a new replacement wages system for junior rates.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It was our view then, and it is our view today, that, just because someone is 16, 17 or even 20 and doing the same work side by side with someone who is older, they should not automatically be paid 50 per cent of those wages. That is blatant discrimination and shows blatant disregard for the principle of equal work for equal pay.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is telling us and some employers have told us that junior rates are necessary to ensure that young people have employment prospects and that, if we get rid of them, more young people will be out of work, contributing to the 27 per cent youth unemployment level that we currently have. I still find it very difficult that people persist with this notion that there is some causal connection between lower wage rates for young people and increased employment opportunities. In fact, we have had little evidence provided to us that supports this assertion other than the prejudice of some employers.

There is a very authoritative study by Princeton University academics, David Card and Alan Kreuger, of minimum wage adjustment in the United States showing that an increase in the minimum wage has not led to unemployment. Studies such as this must frustrate a lot of economists and certainly, I suggest, a lot of senators, because they show that the labour market is very different from the market of apples and oranges. In fact, the labour market constantly defies economic models and economic theories on how it should behave, and the youth market is a classic example.

        We have seen research recently by the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, AYPAC, showing that, in the last two decades, wages for young people have fallen in real terms in this country, yet youth unemployment has risen. Indeed, the number of full&amp;hyphen;time jobs filled by young people is static in a growing economy. But the contrariness of the youth employment market gets worse. Of course, in the 1970s and still today, the principal substitute for young people in the labour force has been married women. The equal pay case of the early 1970s, which increased wages for married women, was amid all sorts of doom and gloom forecasts that this increase in wage levels would somehow kill the employment prospects of married women.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since then, the employment rates of married women have increased exponentially. However, the employment of young people has not. The only piece of research that I have seen in support of retaining youth wages was a survey of members conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Even this survey showed that the principal determinant employers act on in deciding whether or not to employ a young person is not youth wages but the ability to train their own workers from scratch. In short, the proponents of retaining youth wages have not made out a very strong case.

        The best that the parties have been able to come up with so far has been to take junior rates in the retail industry, knock out all reference to age and replace it with a reference to a combination of schooling and years since that person had left school which, for all intents and purposes, meant the same thing as age based discrimination. This system is still indirect discrimination. It would still leave young school leavers, working side by side with older workers, being paid, I think, roughly 45 per cent less than their adult counterparts for no good reason. This simply is not good enough. We need to address the fact that it is the firm view in some employers' minds that young people are somehow worth less than older workers. That can only be done through better research and better information.

        The appropriate organisation to look into some of these issues and look at the discrimination argument versus the employment argument is the Industrial Relations Commission.

        This brings me to MAATS. What has become increasingly clear over the past two decades has been that the youth market is dysfunctional. Technological and industrial change has wiped out thousands of jobs formerly occupied by young people—jobs which often lead to white and blue collar employment. The growth of retail and fast food industries has created other jobs but these have tended to be casual employment rather than full&amp;hyphen;time employment, which has disappeared. This radical change in the youth

       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1992, the Australian Democrats were so concerned about the dysfunctional nature of the youth labour market and the failure of government policy to deal with this that we proposed a youth guarantee—that is, that young people should be guaranteed a place in either education or training or employment by the government. As we know today, in 1994 the former Labor government picked up this idea—they thought it was so good—as part of their Working Nation package.
       </para>

        Unfortunately, this government seeks to cut back on those programs. Despite rising unemployment, 670,000 job program places will be cut to 440,000. The government has assured us that places will only be cut from those programs that are not working. Yet the program with the highest success rate—I believe around 90 per cent record of young people in unsubsidised employment, the Australian traineeship system—has been capped at 34,000 places. So just when employers are finally beginning to welcome traineeships, the growth of this vital program has been cut.

        It is in this environment that the government has unveiled MAATS. The Democrats support MAATS in principle, but we have a number of concerns as to how it will work. These concerns have been exacerbated by the almost complete lack of policy detail that surrounds this whole proposal. Foremost among our concerns is that under MAATS some young people will be financially disadvantaged. Only paying young people for the time they spend in productive work as opposed to training means that in many cases wages under MAATS will be lower than they are currently and in some cases wages under MAATS will actually fall to levels which are below the current level of unemployment benefits.

         undertake the MAATS apprenticeships and traineeships, but I am yet to be convinced that this payment will go anywhere near towards providing young people with the means to sustain a reasonable living standard. As far as I can see, even through the estimates committee process, there are no guarantees to ensure that this top&amp;hyphen;up will be passed on to the employee by their employers.

        The Democrats are also yet to be convinced that training and qualifications received under MAATS, with all its flexibility, will be transportable and nationally consistent. This is one area of MAATS that we will be watching very closely. The Democrats will only support MAATS if it results in real jobs and real benefits for young Australians. Our primary purpose, as details of the MAATS proposal continue to unfold—at least I think they are beginning to unfold—will be to protect and further the interests of young Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The operation of the MAATS system or MAATS proposal is contingent upon the passage of the workplace relations bill.

        Unfortunately, flexibility is often a one&amp;hyphen;way street and often the employers' way. What bargaining strength does a young person have to negotiate flexibility? What skills will they have to stand up for their rights against an employer? None.

        It ignores the basic principle that if a person is in such a disadvantaged bargaining position that they basically agree to an AWA under duress they are unlikely to have the confidence to complain about that AWA afterwards.

         The proposal to discount wages for apprenticeships and trainees based on an increase in training time has the potential to offer great harm as well as great benefit for employees—great benefit if young people are able to accelerate their training and enter full trade rates earlier, but great harm if they end up with insufficient income to live while they are doing so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has proposed a top-up allowance based on the lowest level of the national training wage award. There is strong argument—and I believe this very strongly—that these rates are far too low. Of more concern to us also is that the allowance is not related to competency. Take, for example, the case of a second&amp;hyphen;year apprentice in the metal trades. The most likely change in work-training mix would see training increased from the equivalent of one day a week to two days a week. For a metal trades apprentice, having completed the equivalent of a year's training, under the government's proposal they would end up being paid exactly the same as a first&amp;hyphen;year apprentice, despite the intensive training.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The top-up of $195 per week is well below the award second-year rate of $229 per week. We believe this is hardly an incentive for young people to engage in accelerated training. When you have some employers who are already complaining or concerned about the difficulty in finding young people to fill training and apprenticeship places in some industries, we need to be concerned about the incentive effect of any changes to wage rates in particular.

         We are also of the firm view that training arrangements should not be approved unless they are in the best interests of the trainees. It is their interests, not the interests of employers, that must be paramount. From that point of view, we oppose the suggestion that training arrangements in AWAs could be approved by people who are not competent to do so, by local employment councils synonymous with local chambers of commerce, as I believe has been suggested by some.

         In conclusion, the Democrats believe that this bill as it stands provides little advances for our troubled youth employment market, contrary to the great faith that Senator Chapman was showing earlier for the workplaces relations bill to solve youth unemployment in this country. Most worryingly, I think this bill returns to the dark old ages of discrimination simply on the basis of age. Exploiting young people's skills, their talents and their labour is something that I will never vote for. I will always oppose discrimination on the basis of age and I will always oppose the exploitation of young people.

That did happen while I was doing my training. One of our patients who had been suffering from acute depression jumped off a balcony and died. Colleagues of mine were required to attend a coroner's court. They were able to obtain legal representation through the support and the encouragement of the union.

        This bill is a fundamental attack on the rights of workers in this country. It erodes the three pillars which have protected workers in Australia for decades. It erodes the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as the independent umpire. It erodes the role of the award system and it erodes the right to collectively bargain for Australia and Australians.

        It is an unprecedented attack which removes virtually all power or equality that employees have in their relationship with employers. It is founded on the flawed premise that workers and bosses are equal parties in a relationship. This is not the case. Nothing could be further from the truth. When a prospective employee goes for an interview, they are in need of a job or want a job. They want income. When the employer, on the other hand, enters into the agreement or the bargaining, more often than not there are more people vying for the position than there are positions available.

        I heard recently of a case where 40 positions for apprentices were advertised and there were 1,900 applications. Who has got the equality there? It certainly is not one of the 1,900 who are trying to get 40 places. One thousand nine hundred does not go into 40. One thousand nine hundred leaves 1,860 without any job. It leaves them highly dependent upon unemployment benefits.

        The bill also assumes that the signed contract between the employer and the employee is just like any other contract. But it is not. Employees are not bags of cement, they are not computers, they are not inanimate objects without any feeling. They are people with feelings, with needs and with the need to support themselves and their families. The current government seems to have forgotten that.

        Whilst there is room for negotiation of workplace agreements, the worker must be protected. That is not to say that every boss is out to get their workers, to rip them off and to treat them badly but, without legislation to protect employees, they are at the mercy of unscrupulous employers. Interestingly, the converse can be true too, where you have a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        The previous Labor government worked towards a flexible system of workplace relations to take into account differences between different work situations. Foremost in our minds was always the concept of fairness—fairness to workers and their families as well as fairness to employers and consideration for their situation. This government is taking away this fairness.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will go back to expanding on why people are not equal when they are in that situation. The government expects people who are new to the work force to make a secret deal with their boss so that nobody else from the plant or the workplace knows what anybody else is being paid. You expect them to make a secret deal. Can you tell me how a woman who has been out of the workplace for five or 10 years while raising a family or a young person coming into the workplace for the first time is in any position of power to have equality? It is quite obvious that they are not.

        I thought all legal contracts had to be signed where there was full understanding of the ramifications of everything, where everything had to be explained to them. But it strikes me that this legislation leaves a lot of people vulnerable to signing legal documents that they do not understand. They have not been in the position of equality to actually discuss and negotiate the documents in a proper and fit manner. I wonder what is actually going to happen.

        Of course, there is nowhere that they can go to challenge this, because they are gutting the Industrial Relations Commission.

How many people at age 18 or 19 have the capacity or the ability—firstly, the intellect and the courage and, secondly, the finances—to take something through the federal courts?

That is what you are doing. You are putting pressure on people to not negotiate out a legitimate settlement and a legitimate wage. With the complementary social security legislation, you are forcing people to take what is offered; in other words, like it or lump it.

        The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has played a pivotal role in maintaining this fairness and seeing that employees are treated respectfully and receive fair pay and conditions. This government will gut the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and turn it into a toothless tiger through 36 limitations to the commission's powers. For example, the IRC will no longer have general jurisdiction to settle industrial disputes by arbitration. This function will be extremely limited. As I have said earlier, it can leave the employees vulnerable and it can leave the employers vulnerable. We only ever hear from the government, those opposite, about what terrible things the unions and the employees will have done; we hear nothing about their concern for the employers.

        The IRC will no longer have the power to review workplace agreements, so nobody will be there to arbitrate the agreement that has been made.

         But that expertise and those skills and knowledge will be lost when you could end up in a court where the presiding officer is, in fact, someone whose area of expertise may well have been commercial law or copyright or something that is totally unrelated to industrial relations. I do not mean that with any disrespect for those who sit upon the bench. I have nothing but the utmost respect for them. But, as with most professions, people do specialise. I think it is only right that, in this situation, people who have industrial relations type problems should be able to take their cases quickly to a jurisdiction where the people oversighting the case have expertise and knowledge in the area.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the Senate Economics References Committee's considerations of this bill, women's groups expressed three major concerns: that the removal of the commission's powers to ensure equal remuneration would result in further inequalities in pay and conditions for women; that the proposed arrangements for workplace bargaining would disadvantage women; and that the deregulation of part-time work—in particular, the removal of minimum and maximum hours—would disadvantage women who form the bulk of this sector of the work force.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will deal with these three points first. Firstly, the slow advancement towards equal pay for women, particularly in over&amp;hyphen;award payments, has not just been due to the laws of supply and demand or the beneficence of employers. It certainly will not come about if these matters are left solely up to the market and market forces. Women have slowly moved towards equal pay through the efforts of women's groups and the enacting and enforcing of legislation through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Indeed, the previous government introduced new equal remuneration provisions in part VIA of the act
         <break page="4010" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          which gave the commission the ability to remedy instances of discriminatory over&amp;hyphen;award payments. That is where women have been particularly disadvantaged in their payments. It is not the award payment; it is the over&amp;hyphen;award payments—the extras that get added to remuneration packages—that are not going to remain in the act. We are also concerned because removing the Industrial Relations Commission's powers in this regard will be a huge step backwards in the fight for equal pay for equal work.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, women are traditionally in a disadvantaged position in the work force. They are often not employed full time and they have little bargaining experience or they may have a host of situations where their bargaining power is at a minimum. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1966 will further disadvantage women through the extension of workplace bargaining and the removal of the protection of the Industrial Relations Commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thirdly, there are many more women than men involved in part&amp;hyphen;time and casual work: 41 per cent of the female work force is employed on a part&amp;hyphen;time basis and 75 per cent of part&amp;hyphen;time workers are women. This bill will remove the minimum and maximum hours that part&amp;hyphen;time employees can work. The setting of minimum hours for part&amp;hyphen;time employees was designed to ensure that they had reasonable chances to work, as well as providing a steady income and a similar pay packet from week to week. We now see the situation where women are not sure from one week to the next what their hours of work are going to be. It will make budgeting extremely difficult. If women receive very small remunerations for their work, it will also make it very difficult if they are able to and eligible to apply for social security benefits. This will be particularly so if we see it combined with the abolition in the budget of the ability of workers to work and earn up to $1,000 in a year and to have those earning credits there if they wish to apply for social security benefits.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          were going to take place to some of the social security programs, you see how draconian and how evil and mean&amp;hyphen;spirited this government is being to people who have to find employment and work part time. As I have mentioned, the lack of consistent rostering schedules is crucial. Women who work part time are often those with families and who are trying to juggle child care and child rearing with their own needs and those of their spouses and their occupations. It means that they do not have a great deal of flexibility and, if they do not know what hours they are going to be working from week to the next, they will have even less flexibility and even less ability to plan.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the current system there is a ratio of full&amp;hyphen; to part&amp;hyphen;time workers, and this must be maintained. This legislation will remove that ratio and increase the number of part&amp;hyphen;time workers that can be employed. This will especially disadvantage women, as it will remove opportunities to move into a full&amp;hyphen;time career; by moving into a full&amp;hyphen;time career you actually can get onto a career path. But, again, this government does not seem to care about those sorts of issues or those sorts of needs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Casual workers, of course, will not be eligible for parental leave. Women make up the majority of the casual work force and again it is obvious that they are going to be further disadvantaged. It is quite clear that the `rock solid' guarantee of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no workers will be worse off is not applicable to women. It is obvious that the conservatives want to say that women should be at home doing whatever they want them to do there.

         There is another disadvantaged group that will be worse off under this legislation—Senator Stott Despoja has already mentioned it, as have a number of other people—and that is young people. This bill will allow employers to cut youth wages. Indeed, the minimum rate could drop to as little as $3.05 an hour, and the government says no&amp;hyphen;one will be forced to work for less than the dole. So the minimum pay rate will no longer be an award; instead it will be the dole. The employer will also be allowed to determine how
         <break page="4011" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          much time is spent at work and how much time is spent in training. The person will be paid for work, but not for training. A young person may be paid for only a few days out of the whole week's work that they actually do. Also, the training discount will be applied to junior rates of pay, not to the full pay rate. Young people will have their pay cut not only because of their age but also because they will be deemed to be training.

         To make young people work for as little as the dole provides no incentive. The government is waging war on so&amp;hyphen;called dole bludgers but is not providing any incentives. In other words, like other workers, young people's conditions of work will also be drastically reduced. The young, like women, are already starting from a disadvantaged position when it comes to workplace bargaining. The employer certainly has the upper hand in that relationship.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is making a concerted attack on workers. The destruction of the independent umpire and the freeing up of the rules of the games demonstrate this government's desire to move this country more and more into a dog&amp;hyphen;eat&amp;hyphen;dog kind of environment where everybody cares only for themselves and for nobody else in their community. The concepts of a fair go and helping people out are being thrown out the window. John Howard is taking Australia down the path of the United States. Australia is the best country in the world, with a high standard of living and an efficient industrial relations system. This legislation will do nothing to improve that situation for the vast majority of Australians.

Others have spoken and will speak generally about the bill, but I will speak specifically about the effects this bill will have on women workers in this country. Working women now—and, more importantly, it is generally conceded that the generation about to enter the work force will continue to—perform the lowest paid jobs. I notice Senator Stott Despoja spoke about young people entering the workplace. Young people, and women particularly, usually have the most insecure jobs. I am concerned that, under this bill, these people will be those who suffer. In many respects, I am thinking about working women—as Jennie George stated—who are process workers, the women who work on car production lines and in clothing factories. In my own region of north&amp;hyphen;west Tasmania, I think in particular of women textile workers or vegetable process workers.

        Prior to the last election, Mr Howard made two clear pledges to the Australian people and I have heard these quoted many times by my colleagues. The first was that he would govern for all Australians and the second was that no worker would be worse off under the coalition's industrial legislation. When making these pledges, Mr Howard clearly did not have women workers in mind. Historically, women have been most at risk of exploitation in the workplace. As I stated earlier, they generally perform the most menial, lowest paid and insecure jobs.

        Was there a proper effort made to assess the impact the proposed changes would have on women? The level of consultation with women's groups, trade unions and community organisations has not, in my view, been adequate. Many of the changes listed in the bill were not mentioned by the coalition during the election campaign. This bill will worsen the situation of women who rely on their income to supplement family living costs. It is imperative that all workers should retain the protection of awards and the Industrial Relations Commission, even more so for women.

        One of the most outrageous claims which Mr Howard and Mr Reith make is that the bill gives women choices and allows them more flexibility to arrange their family commitments. The bill will do away with minimum and maximum hours of work for casual and part&amp;hyphen;time workers. This will make it extremely difficult for women to arrange other things such as child care. The government's cut to operational funding for community child&amp;hyphen;care day care centres will lead to increased child&amp;hyphen;care costs. Unable to plan child&amp;hyphen;care arrangements ahead, many women will eventually be driven out of the work force.

        Unfortunately, many women still work under the paid rates award, including those in community services, health and education. The abolition of paid rates awards and their replacement with minimum rates awards will let employers off the hook. There will be no necessity for employers to pay above minimum rates awards. I fear that the upshot of this measure will be that overtime pay for women will reduce and the gender pay gap will increase—and it is not as if it is not already too large a gap.

        Fear of reprisal from an employer will discourage workers from taking this action.

I also think it is appropriate to use this opportunity to commend the Hon.

        I want to confine my remarks largely to schedule 7, relating to the termination of employment, commonly known as unfair dismissal. This section relates to one of the most controversial aspects of earlier legislation which was brought in by the previous ALP government in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. The vociferous criticism it attracted was only partly addressed by that government's amendments in 1994 and also in 1995.

As we know, they claimed that we were going to scrap the unfair dismissal legislation. This was an environment intended to create uncertainty and undermine people's confidence. Unfortunately, they paid lip service to the truth. When criticism zeroed in on their botched up legislation, I believe they just had no answers.

        The point I wish to make is that we are not scrapping the unfair dismissal legislation. That is a surprise to so many.

What Peter Reith has done in relation to these unfair dismissal laws—it is important that all Australians know this—is streamline, simplify and make them a lot fairer to all Australians, both to employees and to those who pay the bills, the employers. This is something the Labor Party could not do, despite their many attempts.

        This sort of overemphasis on whether the correct procedures have been taken to dismiss an unsatisfactory employee has attracted a lot of criticism. It has been seen to be far too legalistic, far too inflexible and far too narrow. This is largely why there has been such an outcry for a fair go all round. I believe that the coalition, through this legislation before us today, has responded to this outcry across the community, and I believe that because of this concern employers have been reluctant to take on additional employees.

        The previous government had to amend their legislation three times in two years and still they could not get it right. With the most recent amendments they claimed that the changes would make the handling of unfair dismissal claims simpler, more effective and less legalistic while still guaranteeing protection for employees. They were meant to ensure that the court would take into account all the aspects of the case when arriving at a decision; however, none of their amendments went far enough, nor did they satisfactorily remedy the faults in the original legislation.

        The creation of a federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction was one of the major features of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. Power was given to the newly created Industrial Relations Court of Australia to deal with unfair dismissal from employment in prescribed circumstances; however, the Labor Party was forced to amend their unlawful termination provisions of the reform act significantly in two important respects.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the amendment of 1994, access to the court's unfair dismissal jurisdiction was limited to employees who were either employed under a federal or state award or whose basic wage was no more than $60,000 per annum. This was in spite of the International Labour Organisation's convention No. 158, stating that it should apply to all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons. One of the objects of the convention was that no-one was to be excluded. But surprise, surprise, the Labor amendments at

        It is true that the employers were the ones who sought the cut-off of $60,000.

I have just given you a good example to explain.

        Those opposite have ignored the ILO convention in the past themselves with regard to this aspect of comprehensive coverage. They also put a cap on compensation in an amendment in 1994. Where reinstatement was thought to be impractical, aggrieved persons became entitled to an amount of six months remuneration in the case of employees covered by such awards and for such non-award employees to either six months remuneration or $30,000, whichever was the lower.

        Secondly, after much pressure, again from our side, a 1994 amendment changed the onus of proof from being entirely on the employer, in respect of compliance with the provisions of the act, to confining the onus of proof imposed on employers on these matters concerning the giving of valid reasons for dismissal and for proving that one or other of the specific proscribed grounds of dismissal did not apply.

        Just recently the High Court has determined that the two features of the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws actually `exceeded the external power in the constitution'. The court held that a ground that a dismissal was harsh, unjust and unreasonable and going beyond its powers is not a ground sanctioned by the Termination of Employment Convention of the ILO. It also determined that shifting the onus of proof to the employer had been beyond its jurisdiction, even while affirming that external affairs powers do have a broad reach. So the High Court upheld our view—that is, the coalition's view—that this law was excessive and too biased. What greater authority can we get in Australia than the High Court's interpretation?

Theoretically, their legislation overrode all existing state laws.

        The states arrangements for unfair dismissals have never elicited the outcry which has erupted in response to Labor's federal legislation. Many of the federal government's proposed reforms, including unfair dismissal laws, closely resemble those of my own state, Tasmania. The Tasmanian government and the Commonwealth government have continued to work closely with each other. By comparison with Labor's federal law, for example, Tasmania's legislation is so simple. It is recognised as the fairest, most flexible jurisdiction in the country. It gives the commissioner wide ranging powers to address the
        <break page="4017" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         complaints brought before it, yet it is cheap and quick.

        Furthermore, changes made to Tasmania's law at the end of last year saw the adoption of the ILO convention on sacking. Part (ii) of convention 158 has now been spelt out in the act and has been supported by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has meant that workers continue to take unfair dismissal claims to the Tasmanian Industrial Commission.

        These points should be considered in the context of schedule 5 of the new Commonwealth bill. It provides that state enterprise agreements and voluntary employment agreements will no longer be automatically overridden by Commonwealth awards. Nor will the AIRC now be able to prevent a state tribunal from dealing with a dispute where this is facilitating the making of a state employment agreement. The new Commonwealth legislation proposes that a state agreement, which is usually less prescriptive, will indeed override a federal award. Contrary to the claims of some, the remedies for unfair dismissal under a state agreement will be more than adequate.

        There are other important provisions in our legislation which, unfortunately, I do not have time to deal with today, but I will draw your attention to one of them. The awarding of a remedy will be at the discretion of the AIRC based on the entire circumstance of the case. Importantly, the employer is to be given a fair go because the commission must also take into account, when assessing payment, the effect on the viability of the employer's business. The employee should not be able to bankrupt his boss's business even if his boss has dismissed him unfairly. Furthermore, the fact that the employer has not carried out the termination procedures to the nth letter of the law should only be one of the factors considered in assessing whether this dismissal was unfair. Other relevant factors must be taken into account.

         A very significant factor inhibiting business employing new recruits has been the ramifications of the earlier 1993 industrial reform that I referred to. The general opinion in the Australian community is that it has been too hard to get rid of the unsatisfactory employee. Fears that you would not be able to prove that the employee had refused to do the job required, had insulted customers, had negligently or wilfully damaged property or had been the object of sexual harassment charges by clients, hardened the resolve of the business people to not employ new recruits if they could possibly avoid it. The message was out there quite simply: do not employ; you might make a mistake.

Under this legislation, the assurance that `no worker will be disadvantaged' simply will not be kept. Workers all over this country are going to be disadvantaged. You do not have to be Einstein to recognise that, if the union watchdog for the workers is not available to ensure that their rights are being maintained, those rights will be eroded.

        In talking with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) a couple of months ago in Sydney—and we had a very good yarn—I put to him the situation of a female worker, for example, in a factory where there are only one or two workers, whose first language is not English and who depends on every dollar she can get, being faced with an employer wanting to have her sign a new contractual arrangement, knowing that there are a dozen people outside in the queue waiting to take her job if she does not sign. She will not know what her rights are. She will not have the independent

Those things will no longer come under the purview of the Industrial Relations Commission. That means that many workers who have had those things guaranteed in the past are not going to have them guaranteed in the future.

We are now debating legislation which seeks to change them dramatically. Such changes, if made, will affect both the workplace in particular and society in general and will do so in a major way. The coalition's legislation owes much to a tradition which holds that the law relating to employment is best when based on that relating to contract. A different tradition holds that it is best when based on that relating to civil rights.

        The Statute of Labourers was passed in 1349, almost 650 years ago. It embraced the concept that an employer and an employee should reach agreement about the conditions under which one will work for the other as individuals and not as members of a negotiating group. It regulated the maximum level of wages which could be paid to labourers. Its sponsors accepted the law of contract as the appropriate one to fix the relationship between employers and employees but with riders that were to the disadvantage of the workers. The Statute of Labourers was the result of policies comparable to the policy giving rise to the workplace relations bill.

        Early legislation dealing with conditions of employment were loaded against workers. A number of the statutes of 12 Richard II passed in 1388 and that of 23 Henry VI CAP X111 show this. Parliament pursued this bent—that is, the English parliament—thereafter for centuries. The Statute of Artificers of 1563, the Settlement Act of 1662 and the Spitalfields Weavers Act of 1773 are examples. At times, the conscience of the legislature was moved to protect the condition of workers as with the Truck Act of 1701, but the general thrust of the law, both statute and common, militated against employees.

So has the doctrine of restraint of trade, which the courts have enforced with some modification, but with vigour, since at least the time of Henry V.

In Australia the great reform accomplished at a federal level was the passing of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904.

         Australia has developed labour laws both at a federal and state level which in many ways are unique, but the history of English employment law still has a powerful impact in this country. Belief in contract law as the best basis on which to build the proper relationship between employer and employee is a profound influence on the government's legislation now under debate. It is a belief that a discrete agreement between an individual employer and an individual employee made and sustained without any outside intervention will bring the greatest good to the workplace. It is a belief that privity of contract ought to prevail over transparency in the workplace. It is a belief held by authorities over many centuries in  England and which has had a cruel and unjust outcome for millions of workers.

          The "Industrial Revolution" for a long time . . . made the workman's labour a mere marketable commodity to be bought at the lowest price that individual competition between workers would permit. The degradation and suffering that ensued, the revolt against the system, the repression of illegal acts, the amelioration of the law, the organisation of labour, the gradual recognition of collective bargaining, the introduction of private conciliation and arbitration as well as of industrial laws securing better conditions for workers, are well known historical facts.

          The main purpose of the workplace relations bill is other than to ameliorate the law in favour of workers, to make more efficient the organisation of labour or to improve collective bargaining. Rather it is to reduce the range of matters in respect of which employees can seek awards, to increase the chances of their having to negotiate employment contracts with inadequate assistance, and to promote bargaining not on a collective basis but person to person. This legislation seeks to return to industrial relations of a bygone era and one that in the interests of equity ought not be revived. This bill would bring joy to the heart of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.

          According to Government, the purpose of the proposed legislation is to create flexible labour market practices so that production efficiencies will be encouraged; they in turn will lead to economic growth.

It does away with compulsory unionism and allows employers and workers to enter into collective or individual contracts, thereby removing unions statutory bargaining rights. It redefines the internationally understood terms, freedom of association and right to organise in trade unions, thus hampering the right to form unions. It also restricts the right to strike.

         As a Western Australian senator coming to this place, I have an added interest in the bill, because it represents the fulfilment of a commitment Mr Howard made some time ago to the Australian public. I believe it was at a conference in Perth that Mr Howard, the now Prime Minister, said:

         What does that mean? It does not mean a great deal to former workers with the giant mining company WMC Resources NL. Three days ago, WMC Resources NL—which used to be known as Western Mining Corporation and is a large donator to the coalition political parties—sacked 445 of its full-time employees at its underground nickel and gold operations in the Western Australian goldfields. It sacked them out of the blue. Where is the security for workers?

          WMC Resources NL went from a position of employing 445 full-time employees to a system where they have contractors in place. They offered some people contracts. That is the type of system that we now have operating in Western Australia. One morning a worker can have a full-time job and their family can feel some sense of security, and then all of a sudden, out of the blue—in accordance with the laws that are prevailing within Western Australia—the workers can be sacked. It is my understanding at this moment in time that those workers have no recourse against their employer for unfair dismissal. What happens is entirely at the will of the employer and, indeed, it is a lawful act on the part of the will of the employer.

        I would have thought that the moral debate Senator Cooney was suggesting is needed should be reserved for a true moral debate that will be coming to both houses in the near future. I refer to the euthanasia debate which this government has had the courage to introduce, whatever the vote is. The facts are, Senator Cooney, we were left with a legacy of an underclass, of an appalling unemployment rate, of favoured sectors within the economy, of an outstanding and mounting debt—and you know what that does to a country, as it does to households—and a society in anxiety. Those past policies have failed and we have been given the overwhelming task and mandate to address those problems, to have the courage to do so and to introduce a balanced budget for the benefits we believe it will bring.

        For you to come to this debate with the suggestion that we are going to rip the moral standing away from the Australian people and the rights of workers leads me to say to you: look at your own economic record and, for that matter, look at the moral record of the previous government.

        So, Senator Cooney, I just have to take that suggestion up because in another place for another debate what you were saying was very good, and I could not agree more with it, but to try to implant that in this industrial relations debate is either a trick—which you are so very good at performing—or you are sadly misguided.

This legislation is not for the single benefit of employers; rather the expected benefits will be for the employers and the employees alike and it follows for the nation as a whole. That is very much unlike what motivated the previous government's introduction of their industrial relations legislation in those now infamous words by the ACTU chief Jennie George—and they will always remind us of the sentiments of the previous legislation—when she said on radio soon after the 1993 election:

        The results since then have been quite obvious. It was a favoured piece of legislation. In stark contrast, we pledge that this legislation is to the benefit of the employer and the employee and that no worker will be worse off through these reforms. In fact, these reforms are necessary to lift and to hold the Australian standard of living for decades to come.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Having achieved government, with the industrial relations reform bill as one of our key policies, the workplace relations bill fulfils the long&amp;hyphen;term commitment that we made to the Australian people. The No. 1 principle of the legislation is to deliver choice into the workplace; therefore, it follows that flexibility will be introduced into the now rigid system. Under this particular bill, employers and employees will have a choice of remaining on the award or taking advantage of the new enterprise bargaining arrangements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To that end, there will be two choices within those enterprise bargaining arrangements: firstly, what is called the certified agreements which are no more than collective enterprise agreements covering the employees in the particular business. Alternatively, the other choice is of an agreement that is individually based, so&amp;hyphen;called in the legislation as Australian workplace agreements. In tandem with these three choices, the government is
        <break page="4029" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         committed to providing a safety net for the wages and conditions of employees under these three streams.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There will be some 18 subject areas to be covered that have been tenets of previous awards and will remain so under the certified agreements or the workplace agreements. I will run through some of them, so people are aware that we are not stripping away any of the existing award achievements and conditions—for example, overtime, casual and shift work loadings, allowances, public holidays, long service leave, annual leave, bonuses, ordinary time hours of work and times within which they are performed, and classification of employees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Further to this, the award conditions safety net has a secondary advantage of simplifying the awards and the agreements. It should be noted that the award simplification was supported in the previous government's Working Nation document when the then Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        He went on to specify some 10 core provisions for awards as against our 18. Of course, history shows that the Labor government were forced to buckle under the pressure of the ACTU and those principles never saw the light of day.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Contrary to the perceptions given by the opposition, the Industrial Relations Commission keeps a major role. All certified agreements with or without union participation must be approved by the Industrial Relations Commission. Further, as is the case now, award variations must also be approved by the Industrial Relations Commission. It is only in the case of workplace agreements that the Industrial Relations Commission's role is taken up by the Employment Advocate away from the Industrial Relations Commission and the courts, having the task to oversee the individually based contracts—being an independent umpire.

        It is in this area, youth unemployment, that attention is most needed and it is also in this area that the government and the opposition parties most differ, both philosophically and practically. For it was the previous government that had written into the legislation to abolish junior rates by June 1997. In contrast, this legislation before the Senate maintains age based junior rates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Currently, many workers aged between 15 and 20 years are employed on junior wages. For example, in the retail industry, typical junior wages for 18&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds are 70 per cent of adult rates and, for 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, they are some 60 per cent of adult rates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The surest way to handicap a young person in obtaining employment where junior wages are a part of the awards—they are not part of every award—is to increase the employer's costs to the extent that there is no difference between the wages of an experienced, adult employee and those of an inexperienced, junior employee. That is just commonsense and a fact of life in the workplace.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While the abolition of junior rates would have the obvious detrimental effect on youth unemployment, nothing has had a more retarding effect on employment than the absurd unfair dismissal laws. While the laws produced many laughable judgments from the Industrial Relations Commission, they became a very serious factor at the last federal election. That issue ranked high on the list of reasons business, particularly small business, supported the coalition en masse. The proposed changes to these laws have been eagerly awaited by small business.

         The legislation, while protecting the rights of employees that have been unfairly dismissed, will nevertheless take out the com plexity and the legalistic nature of the provisions and check against those frivolous and often malicious claims  which have been the hallmark of the existing system. Past judgments have simply put too much weight on the procedural fairness factor; namely, as employers would well know, the recording of warnings 1, 2 and 3, then a bit of counselling, a possible retraining and even relocation. Under this government's proposal, procedural fairness will remain a factor but it will not now be the sole factor before the courts. All the circumstances surrounding a dismissal must now be taken into account.

        The reforms mentioned have been long awaited, particularly by Australia's rural and regional areas. These areas have been burdened by higher than average unemployment rates and costly workplace structures. As it is well known, business in the rural and regional areas is predominantly made up of small businesses. Under the existing system they have been handicapped from forming workplace agreements that are peculiar to their regions and, quite frankly, are central to their viability. Further, small businesses have had to endure the absurd unfair dismissal laws, which are magnified in the rural areas because they are operating on a lesser profit margin, given that they are linked to the very poor state of the rural economy.

        I single out the meat industry, which has suffered under decades of industrial disruption and archaic and costly work practices. The blame in this particular case can be sheeted right home solely to the militant unions. The state of the meat processing industry today rivals the disgraceful standard of our waterfront. Over the decade, thousands of jobs have been lost due to abattoirs being forced to close, particularly in my state of Victoria. As a result, now some 80 per cent of the meat processing companies are owned by foreign interests.

        The Industry Commission inquired into the meat industry and found the processing sector to be in urgent need of reform.

        Another report, from Booz Allen Hamilton, shows the reality of the problem. On a per kilo, finished weight basis, the costs of our meat processors are uncompetitive. These figures will show that. To process one kilo of meat it costs in Australia 113c; in Argentina, 105c; in New Zealand, 72c; and in the United States, 41c. The obvious consequences, particularly from the United States, flowed.

        In 1994 the Sizzler restaurant chain decided to import United States beef as it was, quite simply, as those figures show, cheaper to do so. Even with the American beef being 60 per cent more expensive than our beef at the farm gate, it was cheaper to purchase from the American farmer, put it through their abattoirs, move it through their wharves, ship it across the Pacific, put it through our wharves—that would have been a great difficulty—pass our meat inspectors and distribute it in the Sizzler chain of restaurants. It was still cheaper than just going down the road and picking a slab of Australian beef from our abattoirs.

        For further evidence of the non-viability of our abattoirs or meat processing sector, look at live cattle exports to Asia. Selling live cattle to Asia is more profitable than it is to process in Australia. It is a poor indictment of our processing sector if processing cattle in Australia does not value add. In fact, it subtracts value. These are jobs that have been lost and will probably never be won back. It is expected that the workplace relations bill will bring significant reforms to this particular sector. Moreover, this is really the testing ground for the success of this bill.

        The bill contains some provisions which are common to Victoria. The most obvious similarity is that the proposed Australian workplace agreements would take effect from the day they are signed and would not be vetted by the Industrial Commission. This feature is found in the Victorian system but it is not found in any other state in Australia. Even the conservative governments of New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia required some element of vetting before agreements took place.

         The Victorian system provides only a minimal number of minimum conditions for agreements. Whilst the proposed AWA stream would have a few more, a range of important issues would not be protected. But, more importantly, employers, particularly in Vic toria, would be able to opt out of federal awards into state employment agreements under section 152. This means that in the case of Victoria, despite all the publicity attached to the so-called safeguards of the AWAs, Victorian employers would be able to get individual employment agreements under Jeff Kennett's legislation and thus avoid a federal award. This would reverse the flight of hundreds of thousands of Victorian workers from the Victorian to the federal system and expose workers in my state to widespread exploitation. Information about the nature of Victorian employment agreements is scanty because agreements are not made public. Some of this information did come through the Senate committee. However, it is worth highlighting some of that evidence.

Great pressure was put on employees to sign. We need to be mindful that employment in this industry is neither permanent nor easy to come by.

        One group which has had the most difficulty with the Victorian system has been the employees of the state government itself.

These agreements had the potential to undermine the professional standards of the teaching profession. Eventually the Australian Education Union was forced to seek a federal award and to arbitrate the rates under that award.

         For public sector workers paid rates awards are very important. Paid rates awards ensure that governments cannot play favourites between employees. Paid raids awards ensure that teachers in poor schools, for instance, do not end up being paid less than teachers in rich schools. Paid rates awards ensure that government ministers, in their quest to cut the so-called fat from bureaucracy, cannot unilaterally withdraw established and important employment conditions. Most importantly, paid rates awards, because they are capable of being arbitrated, give employees in the public sector an important protection against the omnipotent legal power of the state. It is a nonsense to suggest that an individual teacher, nurse or police officer can walk in and negotiate on equal terms with the state government.

This is the fundamental flaw in the productivity objective of the government's Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. You do not gain the commitment of your work force to work smarter by reducing their wages and conditions. No worker will make a commitment to improve their skills, increase their productivity and look at ways of improving their employers' profits if they are working under a harsh contract which pays them a low amount for working long hours.

But by looking at the statistics for overall wages and conditions, a less glowing story was told. Over 50 per cent of employees with workplace agreements had their hours increased; over 67 per cent had their annual leave loading eliminated; over 50 per cent had their penalty rates for working weekends, public holidays and other shift periods eliminated; over 40 per cent had their penalty rates for overtime eliminated; and, most importantly, only 12.9 per cent of those individual workplace agreements in Western Australia had any productivity relationship incentives or comment at all. After trading off these benefits, penalty rates, conditions and other payments, the wage rise of course was illusory. At best, in 80 per cent of the agreements there was an absorption of existing loadings and penalties, and this was disguised as a wage rise.

         Employers in the independent supermarkets industry, for example, have seen their market share decrease from 53 per cent in 1993 to 49 per cent in 1996, with a further reduction, according to industry associations, to around 42 per cent over the next five years. Employees lost penalty rates, leave loadings and weekend rates without any guarantee of

         Oddly enough, that market share was transferred to heavily unionised national and Western Australian based companies which engaged in legitimate enterprise bargaining. These companies focused on improved customer service, high volume turnover, additional staff training, differential products and innovative service techniques. In short, these companies that gained market share in an intensely competitive industry and paid higher wages did so on the basis of improved productivity. As Dr Roy Green, of the Employment Studies Centre at the University of Newcastle told the Senate Economics References Committee:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Low wage competition is not the most effective way of improving productivity. The most effective way of improving productivity is to focus on other aspects of our competitive edge: quality, innovation, delivery and service. These are the areas which—in global markets, anyway—give the greatest benefit to countries which lack the resources we have.
        </para>
        <para>
         To improve this bill so it really does provide sustained productivity increases we need to remove the parts of the legislation which will reduce wages and conditions and, instead, add ways to deliver win&amp;hyphen;win situations for both employers and employees, situations where parties cooperate to achieve productivity increases and where both parties are rewarded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my view, there are a number of aspects of the bill which require particular attention by the Senate. They are seven in number. The first is opposition to reducing awards to a mere 18 conditions. The effect of reducing awards is to remove entitlements of workers in a way that is contrary to the Howard government's promises before the election of 2 March 1996. Secondly is the opposition to reducing the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to 18 conditions. How can an industrial dispute on a matter outside the 18 permitted conditions be resolved if the employer or, for that matter, the employees refuse to negotiate or to reach a sensible agreement and the Industrial Relations Commission is unable to conciliate or arbitrate on this matter?
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Thirdly is the opposition to removing the power of the commission to regulate superannuation under the terms of an award. This issue is important because many awards nominate a single industry fund into which superannuation should be paid. Removing the ability of the award to regulate superannuation is introducing unwanted, costly competition without any protection or guarantees. Fourthly is the opposition to removing the ability of awards to regulate part&amp;hyphen;time work. It is important to retain existing provisions which regulate the minimum hours a part&amp;hyphen;timer can work on any day, the minimum hours a part&amp;hyphen;timer can work in a given week, the maximum hours a part&amp;hyphen;timer can work in any day as part of ordinary time and the maximum hours which a part&amp;hyphen;timer can work in a given week.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fifthly, the proposed legislation would abolish the ability of the Industrial Relations Commission to scrutinise Australian workplace agreements before they come into force. This change needs to be resisted because it means individual contracts could be applied without any independent scrutiny, thereby endangering existing rates and conditions of workers who go onto such individual contracts. Sixthly is opposition to the right of entry. It is important that unions retain the right to visit any workplace where members or potential members of the union are employed and that they retain the right to be able to look at the wage records of the employer.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Seventhly, a membership agreement should be permitted as part of enterprise bargaining arrangements where an employer and a union have negotiated wages, working conditions, job security and superannuation matters and also dealt with the issue of union membership in an agreement which is endorsed by the workers to whom it applies. By limiting the commission's capacity to prevent and settle industrial disputes, particularly through the introduction of last resort arbitration, the government is discouraging disputes from reaching a quick and effective resolution. This will damage Australia's reputation with our overseas trading partners and will also have
          <break page="4037" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           a massively detrimental effect on our productivity rates.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The legislation can be improved to deliver the stated productivity outcome. There are specific ways to ensure this happen. Firstly is the institutionalisation of productivity. There must be a productivity culture among all workers, employers and unions. This should become an important focus of our entire industrial relations system. In practice, this means communicating the benefits of productivity increases to almost every member of the work force, something unions have been most effective at doing for the past decade. It means establishing forums at an enterprise level which facilitate employer&amp;hyphen;employee discussion and cooperation with a focus on improving productivity. Most importantly, it means forgetting the antiquated idea that industrial relations is a game of us versus them. If we are to succeed in the future as a nation, industrial relations must be about cooperation and working to the mutual benefit of employers and employees.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly is the recognition that only a skilled and motivated work force will deliver the productivity growth that Australia requires to lift our standard of living. This is achieved through providing access to education and training, developing a training culture at an enterprise level, and ensuring employees are encouraged to undertake training.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Thirdly is the establishment of an industrial relations system which acts as an agent of redistribution, without impeding efficiency. To ensure adequate motivation to work smarter and to undertake more training and skills development, workers must share in the rewards of productivity gains. At the same time, however, it is a requirement for all parties to recognise the desirability of adequate profit levels. If companies do not have adequate profits they cannot invest in areas like research and development, and the purchasing of equipment, which would also boost productivity. There can be no argument that wage rises linked to productivity gains are inflationary or unfair to companies. Therefore, these rises should be encouraged. As any worker will tell you, one of the biggest

          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fourthly is a public policy commitment entrenching the right of individuals and groups to join unions and bargain collectively in the sanctity of a legal system that protects these fundamental rights. This means recognising that unions have a legitimate right to organise and represent their members effectively. It must be recognised that equality is a fundamental requirement for productivity. Employees will not be motivated to work hard if there are huge wage disparities between people performing equal work. At the same time, there should be real freedom for workers to choose whether to be covered by a strong, effective award or collective enterprise agreement or workplace agreement which contains a no disadvantage test.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Real freedom means employees will not be disadvantaged if they decide against signing a workplace agreement. It must be illegal for employers to refuse to employ someone who will not sign an agreement.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fifthly, there has to be an understanding that an effective industrial relations system imposes obligations as well as responsibilities which are binding on employers, employees and unions. These rights and responsibilities should be written into a bill of rights for employers and employees which ensures mutually agreeable outcomes and the protection of both parties' fundamental rights.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Sixthly, there has to be adequate flexibility to make necessary changes in those areas of the economy which compete internationally, ensuring that they have every opportunity to be successful in the global marketplace. At the same time, there must be a recognition that Australia's export future is not in competing with the lower wage levels of some overseas countries. Rather, one of our key comparative advantages is our highly skilled, innovative and intelligent work force. Our workers may cost more than those of some of our neighbours, but they also produce far more. Lowering wages will only reduce that productivity because workers will lose their commitment and incentive to become skilled.

The only way to ensure a fast outcome is to have a commission which has the legal right to resolve disputes. It is only through introducing strategies such as this that you will achieve the stated outcomes of the bill.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In its present form, the bill is a lost opportunity. We are at a crucial point in our nation's future—a point where we must have continuously productive workplaces; otherwise we will not be able to compete effectively in the increasingly global economy.

          All this bill offers Australians is a 19th century industrial relations agenda in a 21st century world. The legislation should seek to provide security for the future, not turn the clock back to the insecurities of the past. With the right vision and, in practice, the right amendments, this legislation can still be a groundbreaking act which delivers industrial relations harmony and economic security for all Australians.

         —I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill proposed by the government. Of course, like all members of the opposition, I strongly oppose this bill. I think this bill is a retrograde step in the history of industrial relations in Australia. Our system of industrial relations is by no means perfect but, by comparison with many other places in the civilised world, it has served Australia extremely well over the last 90-odd years since Federation and the historic Higgins case in the early 1900s that established the right for organised labour in this country to be able to bargain and an arbitration system that meant that the balance of power between organised labour and capital was about equal.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Higgins case accepted the fact, and the early days of the operation of the arbitration commission established the fact, that an individual employee has not got the same bargaining strength as an employer and the philosophy of industrial relations in this country is to give both sides an even go. The arbitration system was established to take
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         account of the particular role that trade unions, organised labour, have and to ensure that both sides are evenly balanced within the system.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill is about tipping the playing field in favour of the employer. That is not surprising coming from an ideologically right wing driven new government that has been going on about some of these issues for nearly a decade. I would presume that this is very similar but not quite the same as what Mr Hewson was promising in Fightback. But if it is not the complete daughter of Fightback it is very close to it—to reduce the power of ordinary employees to get a reasonable go in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Around the world the history of Australia's industrial relations and arbitration system is well known. Of course, it is interesting to note that way back in 1929 another conservative liberal Prime Minister—it was called the National Party in those days—Mr Bruce decided to try to destroy the arbitration system in this country. He went to an election and got soundly defeated and had the ignominy of being the only sitting Prime Minister in Australia's history to lose his seat. That was the last time a coalition government or a conservative government tried to play around with the arbitration system in a fundamental way. The conservative Prime Minister of the day lost his seat and his party suffered a grievous defeat at that time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Here again, we have a conservative coalition attempting to turn the clock back on industrial relations to an age that no longer exists, to a golden age where employers were able to do what they liked and employees basically had no rights. This is the first step to winding back. That is why we oppose this bill in philosophical terms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Today I want to talk about the impact on small business. As minister for small business in the previous government, I was fully aware of the concern in the small business community about the impact of the unfair dismissal amendments that went through in 1993-94. I was involved in discussions with the small business community, the small business forum, about their concerns about the process of that legislation—how it was clumsy, how
        <break page="4039" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         it was tortuous and how, in the end, commonsense in outcomes was not able to be achieved because of the processes that were outlined when the case went to the industrial court.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result of those discussions, I raised these matters with the then Prime Minister and the industrial relations minister and major changes were made in legislation on unfair dismissals. They went through the parliament in the last half of last year. They came into effect on 15 January this year. As of yet, we have not got complete data available on the number of unfair dismissal cases being taken since those amendments came into effect on 15 January. But all the indications, I am told, are that there has been a significant drop in the number of unfair dismissal cases taken since 15 January. This, of course, reflects the effect of those changes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those changes were to make the operation of the legislation simpler, less legalistic and, above all else, to make sure that the court could take into account the broad circumstances of the particular case, not just a narrow legal process approach. I think that certainly was the intent. I think that is why some of the capricious cases were taken.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As small business minister, I noticed that many of the applications that occurred after the legislation first went through at the end of 1993, early 1994, that established unfair dismissals were not actually coming all the time from the blue collar area; they were coming from middle management. Middle management discovered for the first time that they could take a case against their employer about being dismissed. They were the ones who quickly took the opportunity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because initially there was no cap on the amount you could claim, some of the claims for loss for unfair dismissal from some of these middle managers were, in my view, quite outrageous, running into hundreds of thousands of dollars and in some cases over $1 million. That was not the intent of the legislation. It is interesting to note that a number of these people from middle management, who are probably not noted to be Labor supporters, were willing to take advantage of the legislation.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we amended the legislation. I think overwhelmingly it has achieved the effect that everybody in Australia would have liked to have seen. Now the government is moving to amend it further. Under the unfair dismissal area, the government is transferring to the industrial commission the unfair dismissal cases that are now being dealt with in the industrial court. We have already warned the government that we put it in the industrial court because there was some doubt about the constitutionality of putting cases of unfair dismissal in the industrial commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We still believe that there may be constitutional issues, but we are not opposed to putting those cases to the industrial commission. If that goes through and they are not challenged constitutionally, that, obviously, would be a further step in ensuring that the cases are dealt with in a commonsense, broad approach way rather than in a narrow legalistic way involving the cost of lawyers, et cetera. That is a good move, but we did not do it because we were advised of the constitutionality issues of having such cases dealt with by the industrial commission rather than by the industrial court.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second area the government has proposed is limiting jurisdiction in the way the unfair dismissal laws could operate. We do not support that. We think the government has got itself into a bit of a tangle about this because it does not want to use the external power provisions in respect of jurisdiction. This, of course, is an ideologically driven view of some members of the opposition that they should under no circumstances at any stage on any issue use external powers because using external powers means that the supremacy of this parliament over state rights is clear.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many in the coalition who believe that state rights should overwhelm the power of the federal parliament. We make no bones about it. We believe the national parliament should have these powers. We are all Australians first before we are South Australians, Western Australians or Victorians. That is the way it should be. Many people, even people from the employer side from time to time, have said all industrial relations matters
         <break page="4040" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          should be referred to the federal jurisdiction. I certainly have had that view for a long time.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think we will end up with a better industrial relations system if we use the powers and legislation of this parliament. It would be a much better industrial relations system than having six different states and two territories running industrial relations. The sooner the coalition parties accept that the only way this country is going to succeed economically is to ensure that we run Australia as Australia and not as six separate states based on a colonial mentality the better. That is the way Australia is going to be able to have the best advantage economically in an internationally competitive economy, not running six states based on a colonial mentality.

         The third part of the unfair dismissal legislation which we oppose is the proposal by the government to limit the amounts of compensation—and it is capped—and by the description according to the viability of the firm. We believe that, though that might have some immediate populist reasoning, it will create enormous legal difficulties in determining the viability of a firm. It means that, if the firm is doing better, someone can get a higher amount of compensation for an unfair dismissal—irrespective of the merits or the demerits of their dismissal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we believe the measures that are being proposed with great fanfare by the new government to meet their promises, particularly to the small business community, really have been overtrumpeted. Basically the amendments that we put through—which
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          came into effect on 15 January with the support of the then small business community, the small business forum—have addressed, overwhelmingly, the concerns of that community. That is why the numbers of complaints have now substantially dropped off.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also want to talk about what I think is wrong with this bill from a small business perspective. Despite all of the publicity and all of the argument about whether the unfair dismissal rules were affecting employment in the small business community, if one goes back and looks at the amount of employment that increased in Australia from 1993-94 through to the end of last year, the numbers of employed people in Australia went up by several hundred thousand. All the figures show that the largest proportion of that area came from people in the small business community, which was employing people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I accept that someone might say, `Well, they would have employed even more if they had not had unfair dismissal rules.' That may be the case. But to say, as the coalition put it, that these unfair dismissal laws meant that there was no employment increase going on is just wrong and is not supported by the facts. There were several hundred thousand new jobs created in Australia during that period 1993-96, and a majority of those were in the small business sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to make another point about the impact of employment in small business. When you go and visit many of the small businesses in the manufacturing industry and the services industry you soon find that unfair dismissal was not the major issue that they saw as contributing to difficulties for their business. There were a range of issues, and some of them are well known.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the things that struck me when I visited many of these small businesses—and I visited several hundred during the three years I was minister—is that the businesses that were doing the best clearly had excellent industrial relations that they had sorted out themselves. Even within the award structure, even within the existing rules and laws, they had worked out very sensibly the best way their business could operate. There was cooperation and complete understanding
         <break page="4042" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          between the employer—who, in most cases, was both the owner and the manager of the business—and his or her employees.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You saw excellent achievement in productivity, in innovation and in R&amp;D. You knew that these businesses were getting into the export business. They were able to sort out very happily and quite properly within the existing structure ways to get rid of senseless demarcation disputes between jobs, to improve skilling and to improve training—all of that was occurring.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I visited those several hundred firms that were doing well, you never got many complaints—if any at all—on the operation of the industrial relations system. They said, `So long as we can negotiate a flexible approach that is fair to our employees about the way the business is conducted to improve the profitability and to improve the quality of our product, we are more than happy with it.' In fact, a number of small businesses said to me, `We would prefer to continue to operate within the award structure rather than have to negotiate an individual arrangement with every employee. So long as the award gives us the flexibility'—and it does—`we are more than happy with it, because we know what it provides and the employees know what it provides. Where there are areas of change needed, we can make those arrangements.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The industrial relations aspects of this bill are not taking account of the fact that there has been a culture change in Australia over the last 10 to 15 years, from both employers and employees in the mainstream, about the way business and industry should be conducted. The issue is not about one side condemning the other. I did go to some businesses which had the old&amp;hyphen;style approach of `them' and `us'. They were competing against each other, and you saw a business that was dying. When you saw one where there was good cooperation and understanding and respect on both sides, you saw a business that was growing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill is aiming to take people back to reduce their wages, to make them cannon fodder and to basically say, `When you come to work, you leave your brains at the front door.' Rather, they should be saying—and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          most modern businesses now have this approach—that the best asset of their business is the quality and intellect of their workers. They should be giving them the opportunity in the workplace to contribute not just to producing an item but to ways of improving the value added of that particular business.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those businesses are the ones that are the future of Australia. I think it is disappointing that the government still has an attitude based on the 1960s or 1970s at the latest—more likely the 1920s of former Prime Minister Bruce—to try to destroy the rights of workers, either individually or collectively, where they want to organise trade unions to represent them in sensible negotiations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill, if it is passed in any form that comes out of the discussions in this place, will not be the panacea for employment growth in this country. It will not be the panacea for economic growth. It will be a retrograde step that does no justice to the rights of not only workers but sensible employers in this country.

        INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT (FAMILY TAX INITIATIVE) BILL 1996
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Madam President, this bill, together with the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996, will give effect to the centrepiece of the government's election commitment to Australian families, the family tax initiative.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Almost two million families with dependent children—the majority of Australian families with dependent children—will receive a major boost from this initiative. It will direct around $1 billion
        <break page="4044" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         a year extra to families, providing much needed extra help in bringing up children.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The family tax initiative will commence on 1 January 1997.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The family tax initiative is a clear example of the government's commitment to giving families greater choice in how they spend their hard earned cash and in how they juggle work and family responsibilities. Each family is the best judge of what it needs, and the government's program of reforms reflect that approach.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The family tax initiative provides two forms of assistance. Part A has the effect of increasing the tax free threshold by $1,000 for one parent in a family for each dependent child up to the age of 16 years and each dependent secondary student up to 18 years. This assistance will be available to families that have a combined taxable income of less than $70,000, with an increase of $3,000 for each child after the first. By increasing the threshold, tax at the rate of 20 cents in the dollar is saved, with the effect that eligible families receive the equivalent of an increase of $200 per annum in their disposable income for each dependent child.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additional assistance, Part B of the initiative, will be directed towards single income families, including lone parents, with young children. There will be an increase in the tax free threshold of $2,500 for one parent in those families who have at least one child aged under five years and provided that the breadwinner's income is less than $65,000 per annum (with an increase of $3,000 for each child after the first) and the spouse's income is less than the income cut&amp;hyphen;off for basic parenting allowance (currently $174.43 per fortnight). The alignment of the spouse's income test with the cut&amp;hyphen;off for basic parenting allowance provides a realistic measure of the workforce activity of the principal carer and ensures greater consistency in the treatment of predominantly single income families. This assistance will give families the equivalent of an increase in their disposable income of $500 per annum (around $19.20 per fortnight).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are two methods of delivery for the family tax initiative. First, the majority of eligible families with children will be assisted through the income tax system. This bill gives effect to the tax free threshold adjustments to deliver both Part A and Part B assistance to families.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Low income families will be able to receive the family tax initiative as a fortnightly direct payment through the Department of Social Security. Some 900,000 families will receive an immediate boost to their disposable income through this measure. The extra fortnightly amount will be known as the family tax payment and will ensure that low income families, who might not have a high enough tax liability to benefit fully from the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         changes to the tax system, will get the help they need when they need it most. Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for family tax payments are contained in the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 which is being introduced as part of this package.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Madam President, the government recognises that providing an economic and social environment in which families can achieve their full potential is crucial to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society. Providing financial assistance to those families with the greatest need is an investment in that economic and social environment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The pressures that families face in juggling their work and child raising responsibilities are arguably greater today than ever before. One of the keys to relieving these pressures is to increase the real opportunities available to families and to give them more genuine choices about how they live. The government has a commitment to pursue policies that enable families to choose how they balance their work and child raising responsibilities. The government is committed to ensuring that families with young children are given greater freedom to choose whether one parent cares full&amp;hyphen;time for their children at home or whether both are in the paid workforce.

         —I do not propose to go over the details of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 here; they have been well publicised over many months and discussed on many occasions. This is a bill that is crucially important to the development of Australia. Despite all the changes that the Labor Party introduced over 13 years, this bill is in a field that they simply could not have touched, paralysed as they were by the union movement—the ACTU in particular. But it is important to put on the record that the more intelligent members of the Labor Party who are aware of what is going on in the community want this bill passed. They want, when they get into government in future years, to be able to run Australia with a modern competitive international economy. They know that this is the sort of legislation they can never introduce themselves, as Senator Schacht, the speaker who preceded me—a museum curator—so amply demonstrated.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point I would make about so many of the previous speakers in this debate from the opposition parties is that their lack of experience as employers or in business is transparently obvious. They are only giving one side of the argument.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When I came into this parliament it would have been impossible to have had a debate like this. About the only thing I agreed with in Senator Schacht's speech was the fact that times have changed enormously and that it would not have been possible to have debated a bill like this some years ago. The whole of
        <break page="4047" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         society has changed. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has not understood that the Australian people are asking for a change. The country recognises that times have moved on and that we have got to move to a better way of running our affairs. We are not moving back at all to a laissez&amp;hyphen;faire society or, even worse, to the law of the jungle. We are a civilised community and we have checks and balances in this society. Assurances have been given by the government that no&amp;hyphen;one will be worse off at all when this legislation goes through. In fact, we will all be better off, because we will all have much more money as a country. We will be able to do much for the welfare services, for education and for health—those problems that are so pressing for us.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we do need is a flexible approach to our labour relationship. One of the things that the Labor Party never mentioned in their drive into Asia—their Asianisation of Australia—was the inevitable corollary of that Asianisation: that we have got to be able to compete. That does not mean going back and living with a handful of rice a day for pay; it does mean having systems within the Australian community which allow the talents and the abilities of this society to be used and to be used for the benefit of the whole community. That is the point that the Labor Party cannot see.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian people recognise that the inherent conflict between employers and employees which is so much part and parcel of the demonology of the ACTU and Labor Party should now be put behind us. They realise that the community has grown up and got to the point where we do not need unions to have a monopoly on the right to look after the interests of workers. We are going to leave the community the right to have unions and for unions to have a place in the scheme of things. What we are not going to do is give them a monopoly position.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to briefly touch on the four points that are really important to me in relation to the bill. The first is voluntary unionism. I feel very strongly that this is one of the basic human rights, one of the extensions of the right of freedom of association. When I
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         graduated, the first job I had was as a locum and after that I took a job as a resident at Townsville general hospital. I was appalled then because, in those days, we had a Labor government that had been in for well over 20 years in Queensland which tried to govern at the lowest common denominator in every sense. I was forced to join a union to operate as a professional on the staff of that hospital. I just could not believe it, but I had to do that to be paid—the government made it mandatory. So I said, `All right, if I've got to join the union, then I'm going to go to a union meeting.' `Oh no,' said the union organiser, `A professional person like you can't go to a union meeting.' I said, `You take my money, I'm going.' The local head of the union—I don't know what he was called, the president, or something—was literally a communist, and I do not mean that in a derogatory way. He was a genuine, full&amp;hyphen;blooded communist. So I went along and caused him a great deal of discomfort for a while. But I believe that was an abrogation of someone's basic rights. Freedom of choice is absolutely fundamental. That view is shared by the majority of the Australian community.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you look at membership of the unions, it has declined from a majority position within the Australian community to a figure that is only around 38 per cent at present—in the private sector it is down to around 28 per cent of the work force now. People have the basic human rights of freedom of association, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, and part of that is the right to join or not join a union.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second point that concerns me is the unfair dismissal laws. I heard Senator Schacht saying that when he was the great minister for small business no&amp;hyphen;one ever complained to him about industrial regulations when he went around small businesses. The point is: small businesses are smart. They are not going to talk to a life&amp;hyphen;long union organiser, who owes his whole career to being a secretary of some union and is now a minister in a Labor government, about the inequities of industrial relations law. They are not going to waste their breath on that.
       </para>
       <break page="4048" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The way that you cannot fire employees who are not performing is a real imposition on employers at the present time. This bill will end those unfair and disastrous dismissal laws which have actively discouraged employment since they were passed. They will be replaced by a system which is fair to both the employer and the employee. While I am on that subject, I am also concerned, as an employer over the years, that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission get very strongly onto the rights of employers. If you are advertising for staff and want to get the best person for the job, then you have to very clearly define what the duties are and the type of applicant you are seeking. But now you have to advertise in such a broad way that you do not really attract the people who have the specific skills you want and you end up having to run through dozens or hundreds of people who are totally inappropriate for the job just in order to satisfy some meaningless human rights consideration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third point I am very concerned about is the secondary boycott provisions. This bill will restore the secondary boycott provisions that were removed in relation to sectiond 45D and 45E. If ever there was a thing that was unfair—and there are many aspects of the union movement that demonstrate man's inhumanity to man—nothing is more unfair than the secondary boycott so beloved by the bully boys of the Labor movement. It is extraordinary. If you have a dispute between two parties, that is where the dispute should lie. You should not be able to hold the rest of the community to ransom the way the union movement loves to do. You just cannot tolerate that in a society.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It worked very well when we had sections 45D and E in the Industrial Relations Act. It put a pressure on people who had a dispute to resolve that dispute, if it was confined to that one field, and the rest of the country was not held to ransom.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fourth point that is important to me is the rights of employers and employees. In 1993, the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, speaking of workplace agreements—which is something this legislation supports—said:
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          These agreements would predominantly be based on improving the productive performance of enterprises, because both employers and employees are coming to understand that only productivity improvements can generate substantial real wage increases.
         </para>
         <para>
          The need for the reforms that will flow from this bill are transparently clear. We have a huge unemployment rate in this country, we have a huge foreign debt, we have stagnation of real wages and there is a widening gap between the rich and poor which does not bode well for social cohesion in the years ahead. We have many statistics on the increasing gap and the way real wages have not increased. In the important industries in this country we are not getting the productivity improvements that we should. We are comparing ourselves with Asia all the time. I was in Korea a couple of weeks ago. Korea has averaged eight to 10 per cent growth for the last 10 to 15 years, compounding away. We are struggling to make three per cent per annum.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The community recognises that we have to be competitive and they want to be competitive. That is the thing that the Labor Party cannot understand about the Australian community. They know that they can perform; they just want the opportunity to do so. That is why they are asking us to support this legislation and get it through.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While I am on the subject of reform, I would like to say something about the need to continue and develop the industrial policy that this government is moving on. After 13 years of Labor government, whether in the hands of the economic rationalists, all they have done is devastated the Australian manufacturing industry. They have left a smoking hole in the ground for Australian manufacturing industry because of their simplistic belief—an obsession almost—of zero tariffs. They never recognised the complexity of having a decent industrial policy which was relevant for Australian manufacturing industry. In many senses, through the last 13 years, the Labor Party was the Pol Pot of the economic world. The legacy is there in the nine to 10 per cent unemployment that we have and the great under&amp;hyphen;utilisation of manufacturing in Australia.
         </para>
         <break page="4049" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           All we heard was the endless litany coming from those people over there of the need to have level playing fields. We did have a major problem with tariffs in this country 20 or more years ago, and it was a crippling problem. The problem was not tariff protection per se, the problem was the extent of tariff protection, the way tariffs were taken to absurd levels and the way that not only did we have very high and absurd tariff protection levels we had quotas as well. We had a belt and braces approach, and the consequence of that was that Australian manufacturing industries certainly was not competitive in many circumstances and that crazy economic system certainly had to go.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I am not saying that we have to bring back tariffs, far from that at all. I regard the tariff argument is now over because, apart from one or two industries, it is virtually finished. But I am asking for a new approach and I am happy to support the moves that this new government is making to develop a relevant industrial policy for this country because, under the old high tariff system, there simply was no incentive, management could be as incompetent as it liked and it was often very, very incompetent because it could turn to the government of the day and say, `I've got all these hundreds of employees; we need tariff protection to ensure their jobs.'
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           At the same time, it exacerbated the irresponsible elements within the labour movement, in the union movement, because they knew also that the tariff barrier would protect them from the most irrational of their claims. The answer to that really is to cut the tariff system back the way we have, but we have to put something in its place and we have to think very carefully about that. We do need positive support from a government with respect to an intelligent and relevant industrial policy. It is all very well to talk about getting efficiency into Australian industry and we must be efficient. That is not the point.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The point is that Australian industry necessarily is always small and particularly in the more high technology areas, it is always easy for a large scale manufacturer overseas, at very little marginal cost, to extend the production run and then dump those goods into the
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            Australian market. And having put quite a bit of time into the customs area once upon a time and looked at anti&amp;hyphen;dumping legislation, I can say quite firmly that anti&amp;hyphen;dumping legislation is always after the event. In actual fact, most anti&amp;hyphen;dumping legislation is pretty well worthless so you cannot protect your industry that way.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           When Australian manufacturing industry collapses the way it has under Labor, then you get an inevitable rise in imports because there is a demand for those goods, and then we move into the huge balance of payments problem that we are trying to cope with at the present time. A consequence of that huge balance of payments problem is that the value of the Australian currency goes down and imports cost more. We could not have a better example than the ratio between the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen. I can remember the time recently when it was around 200 or more yen to the Australian dollar. Going back further still, it was probably around 400. We are now down to about 80 today.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The consequence of that is that Japanese goods that come into this country are now costing us twice, if we just put a notional figure of ¥100 to the dollar—and it is way below that now—as against the ¥200 figure. It means that they are costing us twice the amount. It means that the value we pay for that is repatriated to Japan and further more, the price competition of the imported goods into Australian industry is also diminished because the Australian manufacturers are in competition then with goods that we are paying twice the price for. The obsession that the Labor Party had with zero tariffs was a very simplistic and a very damaging move for the Australian manufacturing industry. The solution to those problems is really far more complex than they ever dreamed.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There is a place for some careful tariff protection. There is a need to manage the exchange value of the country even while you are maintaining a floating dollar value, but maintaining it indirectly through your industrial policies, and you have to have an industrial policy which is nurturing and developing those industries within Australia which are in the national interest.

           <para first-indent="16">
            The other point I make about the flat earth philosophy of the Labor Party with respect to tariffs was it was very unfair to many sectors of the Australian community. It hit the manufacturers, but the carpenters, the plumbers, the doctors, the dentists, the engineers were quite free of any international competition just by virtue of their skilled positions within the community, and I support that. I am certainly not saying that we throw away the professional and trade standards that we have in the country.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            What I am saying is that the effect of zero tariffs operated against one narrow sector of the Australian community and gave not only 100 per cent tariff protection to the other part, it gave absolute immunity to them from any sort of competition at all. My plea is that this parliament supports the moves of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, in developing an intelligent and coherent industrial policy so that we can get Australia's manufacturing industry back on the rails and start to work on our balance of payments problem.

            At the present time, when the bulk of our export earnings are coming from primary production, agricultural and pastoral activities or mining activities, we are very much in the grip of commodity prices, which always fluctuate and which makes the balancing of the books all that more difficult.

            This bill is all about choice. It is all about flexibility. It is all about accommodating the changes that have taken place in society and in changed economic circumstances. It will provide better incomes, which will benefit all Australians. We have a huge responsibility in this country to improve our education and our hospitals and to develop the infrastructure of this country. We cannot do that unless we change the way we have hobbled and restricted the employment of labour within this country.

There will be absolute freedom of choice for that. This government has got a mandate from the electorate to make those changes because they are changes that the electorate want and know must be made for the Australian community.

         —The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is a blueprint for the significant dismantling of the Australian industrial relations system. Whichever page I turn to in this document, I find it awash with examples that indicate a serious attempt to tear apart the very institutions that have assisted in developing and sustaining industrial justice in this nation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Many of the Queensland workers and their families I represent have spoken to me of the very real fear they feel about the prospect of being denied industrial justice. The prospect of this bill being passed without significant amendments is creating a considerable degree of stress amongst Queensland workers. The majority of them are honest and intelligent people who want to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. Many of them work in communities that have experienced structural adjustment during the past few years and the last thing they need is a government that flagrantly attempts to remove the industrial rights that have been hard fought for and won since the advent of conciliation and arbitration in this country.

        There is no doubt in my mind that the introduction of Australian workplace agreements, without the scrutiny of an independent umpire and with little recourse for workers whose agreements will be subject to stringent privacy provisions, will result in reduced wages and conditions for the most vulnerable Australian workers. In fact, the more I think about this bill and the real consequences it will have for part-time and casual workers, most of whom are women, and for unskilled and young workers and those from non-English speaking backgrounds, the more I realise that this rock solid guarantee that the take-home pay of workers will not be less

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is more than the very real likelihood of losing pay that worries many Queenslanders. What really worries them is how this bill will facilitate the erosion of the quality of the bargaining process between employee and employer, which both have worked hard to sustain. This government talks about this bill as though it will solve all the problems inherent within the bargaining process between employee and employer. They call it simplification, but what this bill proposes is anything but simple. It proposes a greater array of awards, classifications and agreements than is currently the case. This will surely cause confusion for all concerned. Nearly every enterprise will need to hire an industrial lawyer to guide them through the maze. So much for greater efficiency and flexibility for small business!

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to highlight several features of this bill that are of great concern to Queensland workers and their unions. In terms of legislated conditions of employment and the interaction between them and the history of the Queensland commission's jurisdiction, I would like to call your attention to several difficulties. Queensland legislation contains minimum conditions of employment. These conditions have been underpinned by commission decisions that have general application to all workers, generated through statements of policy of general rulings.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The workplace relations bill endeavours to displace the history of employment conditions within Queensland. This is particularly evident where conditions are superior to those  prescribed in the federal bill. An example of this is annual leave, where employees are entitled to proportionate annual leave for periods of less than one year on termination of employment. Other examples include carers leave, where currently the arrangement is for improved access rights to leave in relation to bereavement leave.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The workplace relations bill proposes the adoption of the AIRC decision, which has not been applied in the state arena. The application of only a legislative framework, in lieu of the mixture of legislative framework and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         commission generated outcomes, will undermine the vibrancy of the system. This begs the question: is it necessary or desirable to change the balance between federal and state systems?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no unequivocal evidence which indicates that a change in the longstanding principle that federal awards and agreements override inconsistent state awards or agreements is necessary. In fact, there are several compelling arguments that the amendments to section 152 are based on flawed assumptions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The effect of the bill regarding so-called simplification that will arise out of changes to the state/federal system is that there will be a myriad of confusing combinations for both employees and employers. Some employees will be on federal awards only, some will be on a combination of both federal awards and agreements, and others will be on federal awards which will be overlaid by a state agreement. They will all be processed in different ways and subject to different minimum standards and protections. This hardly seems like simplification to me.

        There is also no definitive evidence which suggests that the current system, where most workplaces operate under either a federal or state award, is fraught with inconsistencies. Where is the difficulty here?

        In relation to proposed section 89A(4), the rationale for removing provisions contained in awards that regulate minimum and maximum hours worked is that it will supposedly benefit employees who cannot complete the minimum number and who therefore must remain a casual employee or remain unemployed. This provision is also said to benefit many women with family responsibilities through an increase in flexibility in the number of hours worked. This attempt to deregulate part-time work is supposedly necessary for increasing labour market flexibility. I doubt that very much. In reality, this provision will encourage the casualisation of part-time work, which is the last thing many women with family responsibilities need.

The right to regular rostering is not one of the 18 allowable matters. Many women need regular hours and a regular roster. They need to know that the child-care arrangements they have struggled to put in place are not going to be continually disrupted by constant chopping and changing of rosters.

        The casualisation of part-time work will affect many more women than men. As of August 1996 the number of people in Australia employed as part-time workers totalled 2,083,500. Approximately 73.4 per cent of this total are women. This represents over 1,529,600 women. Many of these women will eventually be severely disadvantaged by any change to access to fair and equitable rostering.

        This all adds up to a strong disincentive to work part time. The government well knows that it is mostly women who are the part-time workers.

        There is to be exclusion of significant award entitlements from the minimum conditions outlined in schedule 13. The conversion from paid rates awards to minimum rates awards could mean that up to 1.7 million Australian workers will lose thousands of dollars in wages and conditions. In Queensland alone approximately 250,000 employees currently working under paid rates awards will be affected. Workers such as teachers, nurses and other health sector workers, public sector workers and some in the private sector not only risk being paid less for the same work; they also will be forced to bargain for wages and conditions they had previously been entitled to under their awards.

Although schedule 9, section 170NC and schedule 11, section 170WG prohibit coercion or duress in making certified agreements for AWAs, these provisions are naive in that they ignore the very real possibility of employers placing subtle pressure on employees to sign agreements. It is very naive to assume that employees will always be aware that they are placed in such a situation.

        The majority of Australians, especially the majority of Australian workers, are fairly trusting of their employers. This bill encourages the less scrupulous in our communities to not only exploit that trust but plunder the core of that trust. In order for our communities to function, we need to be able to trust one another, particularly those we look up to or answer to. Most employees enter into a contract with their employers in the good faith that the employer will do right by them. This is an integral part of the `fair go' ethos which is characteristically Australian.

        Many people have not experienced even the role of employer in their role of being a tried union official. Just to set the record straight, I have also experienced the role of being an employer. As a trade union secretary, I found myself in the position of being in control of 30-odd staff. So I am therefore aware intimately of the need to provide fair, reasonable and workable conditions for one's employees. But when one looks at this legislation, one finds that this does not exist at all. It stems out of a worldwide drive to eliminate trade unions, firstly, and, secondly, fair and reasonable working conditions for employees.

        The bill in itself is a prescription for unfettered managerial prerogative. That is all it will do. It will give managers something that they have long wished for and long desired: the ability to exercise complete power, complete control and have at their mercy the work force—the members of which have to eke out an existence in our society today. This unfettered managerial control can in no way be justified, yet it underpins the legislation that is before this house. It is an assault on basic social justice standards. It seeks to attack those who are most vulnerable to attack: those who are weakest in our community and least likely to be able to defend themselves. In this sense, the legislation is reprehensible.

        The architects of the legislation, by the way, are left completely unscathed. It in no way attacks their privileged position in the community. It in no way attacks their wages or their conditions. No, they are sitting very pretty, thank you very much. That was always my experience when dealing with the bosses as a trade union official. I found that they sat very pretty in any set of negotiations. Never at stake were their conditions, their wages. Yet they sat back and dished out whatever they could to their employees, all in the name of profit.

        In particular, the legislation is antisocial, in my view, as it widens the gap between the rich and the poor. That is something that we definitely do not want in this nation at this time. Even Senator MacGibbon from the other side, who spoke before me, admitted that there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor in this nation.

        This legislation sets out deliberately to disadvantage the young at a time when the young need greater consideration than at any other time in our history. I heard discussion earlier today about junior rates of pay. My experience with junior rates of pay as a trade union official brought me to the conclusion that all that they did was supply employers with cheap fodder, enabling them to turn their labour over and over. It was said to me repeatedly in the retail industry when I worked there, `It's pretty bad when you reach the ripe old age of 18 for, once you reach that age, you then find there is a new retirement mark for you; you get the flick and you then go into voluntary or, more likely, compulsory retirement.' The abolition of junior rates—canvassed and undertaken by the previous

But, nonetheless, women who were in an unskilled or semiskilled position within the retail and the fast food industries found themselves the subject of great pressure just by virtue of their sex—and that alone.

The only reason I can see for the legislation is that it will legitimise, institutionalise and hide those employers who have been cheating on their staff for years. That is the only reason I can see for this legislation, just as back in 1987 it was the only reason I could see voluntary employment agreements being introduced into Queensland.

        This legislation seeks to go for the lowest common denominator. It seeks to destroy any semblance of social justice through minimum standards. Some of the minimum standards to go are the consultative processes under termination, change and redundancy. Here we are, living in an information technology&amp;hyphen;rich society, a computer society, a society that is ever changing. One of the major breakthroughs in the trade union movement in the last 20 years was the achievement of proper termination, change and redundancy provisions. They are wiped out completely so people now have lost any confidence about the future. They will be at the disposal and the whim of the employer and, as I said at the outset, there will be unfettered managerial prerogative.

        One of the second major minimum standards to go will be payment of wages. A lot of people have not recognised this yet but we will see people no longer being required to be paid in money. Under this proposed legislation an AWA could override an award or an agreement and that AWA could specify that people would be paid in kind. That to me is a backward step; it is a cargo cult mentality. Whilst people would say that that is not going to happen and that that is not our society today, I can assure them that with some of the employers I have met out in the workplace, they will be jumping over the moon to get into that straight away.

That is not the sort of employment environment that we need or want in our society today, particularly when we have the unemployment rates we have in this nation.

        There is no doubt also that the legislation will not address the issue of unemployment. In my view, the legislation deliberately runs away from the issue of unemployment. It gives the green light to further under&amp;hyphen;employment and is more soul destroying for many people. The legislation will not provide a level playing field for the worker. It removes any idea of a level playing field. All it does is put in place the superiority of the employer, with no rights, in effect, for the employee. The employer will have at their disposal resources, knowledge, a battery of solicitors, consultants and whatever else might be necessary. The employer will be left almost unchallenged, for the simple reason that the employee will be discouraged at great lengths by their employer from any union membership. That has been my experience in a so&amp;hyphen;called positive environment to get people into trade unions. Employers do threaten people if they join the union: they threaten them with the sack and, if they can, they remove them at all times.

        I do have a number of other concerns which I will come to when the legislation comes before the Senate again. Specifically, I am very concerned about the abolition of consent awards.

         unscrupulous employers will not misuse their power over employees for commercial gain. Further, they subscribe to the view that downward pressure on wages and conditions has no adverse consequences for occupational health and safety or for the community generally.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Perhaps those parroting these naive views might take time out to consider the report and conclusions prepared by James Henry Staunton QC from the commission of inquiry into relations between the CAA and Seaview Air. It is clear from chapter 5 of this report that Seaview Air exploited its market position and the vulnerability of air pilots to drive conditions and safety standards down. The inquiry found on page 115 that young pilots were vulnerable to exploitation as their ambitions to fly for major airlines are dependent on the accumulation of experience and flying hours.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was clear from the evidence that the pilots were constantly contacting Seaview Air looking for work. Seaview Air received dozens of CVs a week. John Green of Seaview acknowledged that, in respect of the employment of pilots, it was a `buyers' market'. Former pilots testified that they were remunerated solely on the basis of flying hours and received no payment for extra duties. They were frequently over&amp;hyphen;rostered in breach of civil aviation orders, generating pilot fatigue and therefore reducing safety. This was not disputed by John Green.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Basically, the inquiry found that Green was `in a position of significant domination in relation to his pilots'. Significantly, in evidence, he acknowledged that he was in a position to bend the rules on overloading and on maintenance releases. For the purposes of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, Mr Green was a respondent to the Pilots (General Aviation) Award. It appears that John Green did not take a responsible attitude to the obligations imposed by his respondency. Indeed, Mr Green acknowledged in evidence that, had he received a log of claims, he would have thrown it in a bin.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The inquiry concluded that, regardless of the fact that John Green did not consider himself to be a respondent to the award, he
        <break page="4058" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         was indeed bound by the provisions of the award. Further, the commission concluded that Green and therefore Seaview gained a competitive advantage over their competitors by not complying with the provisions of the award. Finally, the inquiry found:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Believing themselves to have lesser rights than those conferred by the award, the pilots were more susceptible to the demands of an employer seeking to maximise aircraft use and minimise costs. They were more likely to bow to pressure to fly long hours, overload aircraft and understate hours on maintenance releases. Such practices are not in the interests of the safety of pilots and passengers . . . Mr Green's non&amp;hyphen;compliance with the award was obviously for commercial gain.
       </para>
       <para>
        The government disingenuously asserts that driving unions out of the system, stripping them of powers and reducing their viability and effectiveness, will have no impact on safety standards and conditions. To mindlessly chant slogans about reducing union privilege is to encourage the John Greens of the world to exploit positions of power over employees. Currently such exploitation is illegal and able to be scrutinised by union presence. This will disappear under the new regime foreshadowed by the legislation. The problems identified with Seaview and the exploitation of employees that occurred with its deleterious effects on passenger safety will be magnified 50 to 100 times with the passage of this particular legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me go to some specifics of the bill. The bill encourages the establishment of single enterprise unions. The government claims this will create greater autonomy for members. What they are really seeking is poorly resourced unions, lacking the industrial capacity to bargain effectively for their members. Employer dominated unions will be the result. The experience to date of staff associations at the enterprise level has not been an encouraging one. Indeed the report of the Economics References Committee noted the experience of Metway Bank in Queensland where the Australian Industrial Relations Commission found the staff association's negotiations on behalf of members to have displayed `an appalling lack of competence'.

        The abolition of the `conveniently belong to' rule by the repeal of section 204 of the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Industrial Relations Act is not designed to promote freedom of association as this government claims. This rule prevented the registration of unions under the act in circumstances where it could be demonstrated that there was an existing registered organisation to which members could conveniently belong. Repealing these provisions is really all about reducing the viability of unions.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But as well as creating a proliferation of unions, this measure will lead to an increase in demarcation disputes. So the coalition has maintained the power under section 118A of the act to grant exclusive coverage to a union—one of the considerations of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in granting exclusive coverage being the consequences for the employer. In other words, the government's commitment to freedom of association for union members is pretty shallow when put to the test. Indeed, what we will quickly find is that it will be freedom of association unless it is inconvenient for the employer.

        The workplace relations bill removes the right of entry for unions and effectively voids provisions in existing awards that would have guaranteed right of entry—unions will only be able to enter a workplace at the invitation of a union member. Again, this provision is dressed up by the government in the language of choice. What it really does is restrict the ability of unions to monitor compliance by employers with the terms of agreements that they have entered into with their workers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It assumes that employees will be aware of their entitlement to invite union attendance and will not be intimidated by employers into not exercising that right. It will make the policing of notorious industries such as the sweated shops and the textile, clothing and footwear industry impossible. By insisting that the invitation be in writing the bill places further restriction on union access by being intimidatory.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also abolishes union preference, that is, unions getting preference in employment, and closed shops. The first point to note about union preference is that it is usually subject to an `all things being equal' rule. So any concerns about merit being the
        <break page="4059" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         sole criterion for advancement are not well founded. Even with preference rules, this was the case. Changing the rules midstream, as this act does, will however create disputes, as many agreements containing preference clauses and entered into in good faith will now be illegal, and the new laws will enable employers, if they wish, to discriminate against union members—something that preference rules were originally designed to prevent.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In relation to closed shops, it should be noted that nowhere was there legal recognition of so-called closed shops. Rather they were the product of informal agreements between unions and employers. Now any such agreements will generate substantial monetary penalties. Why can't such clauses be inserted into agreements when all parties agree to them?

        The next point I want to go to is industrial action. Industrial action will only be legal during the bargaining period of a certified or workplace agreement. The commission will be able to prevent unlawful strikes. The Federal Court will be able to award damages and sequester funds in such circumstances.

        Under the current act, bans clauses in awards prevent behaviour not in accordance with the award. Both employees and employers are restrained from behaviour contrary to that anticipated by the award. The new arrangements abolish bans clauses and replace them with injunctive relief. Not only are these a blunt instrument punishable only by an action for contempt of court but the relief is only available to employers. This is clearly unfair and is further evidence of the contempt with which the government holds unions and union members throughout Australia.

        The secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act will be reintroduced as well as a reduction in the scope for some primary boycotts. This essentially means a limitation on the right to strike. As well as increasing the range of unlawful industrial activity under the Trade Practices Act, the bill will also increase the penalties for such activities. Fines of up to $750,000 may be imposed for union breaches.

         There will no longer be a requirement for conciliation to precede common law action. This is coupled with the abolition of the 72&amp;hyphen;hour cooling-off period during which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission could conciliate an industrial dispute.

         All of this represents a return to the vagaries of common law actions to resolve industrial disputes, backed up with punitive legislative provisions. A more constructive approach surely must be the encouragement of conciliation and discussion between parties.

         By reducing union power, the coalition correctly believes that a reduction in the pay and conditions of Australian workers will follow. This negative view of the way to promote prosperity in Australia informs all of their measures—whether it is budgetary cuts or industrial relations or a reduction in labour market programs. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has already noted that the passage of the workplace relations bill will not create jobs; the budget papers acknowledge that the government's fiscal strategy will contribute little to growth. So where will the jobs come from? This bill is not about growth; it is about attacking the role of the industrial relations system.

The political party on this side of the chamber was born of the trade union movements in the 1890s.

        As those opposite know, the award system in this country has been developed over the last 90 years to a point where it is the envy of employees and employee organisations around the world as an effective, legally binding safety net for the Australian work force. I remind those opposite that the truth is that the award system has been established with the active participation of the trade unions on behalf of employees and maintained by trade unions on behalf of employees.

         There is no doubt that this bill is designed to directly attack the effectiveness of the award system. It also attacks the ability of unions to enrol members whose contributions fund their operations. There have been a number of speakers in this debate who have clearly made points which establish that fact. Those opposite know that, without adequate resources, the organisations which have in the past maintained the award system will be severely restricted in their ability to adequately maintain that system. Senator Robert Ray just detailed some of those areas where the effect of limiting the access to workplaces by having an employee put up his hand, effectively, and say, `I have invited the union in,' will act detrimentally to giving unions effective access to workplaces where sweated labour, for example, exists.

         The government knows and relies upon that to achieve the real aim of this bill. That aim is to reduce the level of wages and conditions in this country. The assurance it gives to Australians in pursuing this bill is—and I quote from Mr Reith's second reading speech: `Wages will not be reduced by any provision in this bill.' That is a very clever statement. I believe it is a most disingenuous statement. It is a very different statement from the rock&amp;hyphen;solid guarantee of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no worker would be worse off with respect to their wages and conditions because of the Liberal Party's industrial relations legislation. It is a statement that says nothing about the reduction in the real value of wages that this bill is intended to cause.

         There can be no doubt that limiting the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in matters it can deal with will lead, and this is clearly intended, to removing conditions from awards.

The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be required to remove those conditions not consistent with the list of matters it is empowered to deal with.

         We have heard a lot of criticism of the award system from senators opposite. They do not like it. They have been critical of its alleged inflexibility.

         One of the strengths of the current system is its ability for awards to be reviewed with regard to both national standards and the needs of the industry or occupation that it effects.
