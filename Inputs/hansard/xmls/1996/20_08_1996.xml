        On a day like this one reflects a little on the people that have been involved with one getting anywhere in life, and they are very valuable. There was one incident in particular that I wish briefly to refer to, and that is the untimely death of John Knight, a good friend of mine and the first senator for the ACT. Some of you will know, some of you will not know, that John Knight at the age of 37 died in office in March 1981. He left a wife and two young boys, Jason and Joshua. But for

If I might say so, I think the Senate has made an excellent choice. You have served us well as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees.

       I was thinking a moment ago of the qualities that one would look for in a President. I thought that possibly the first—not necessarily in order—would be a good sense of humour. You have that. Second would be a good solid dose of commonsense, and you have plenty of that. Third is legal skills or the equivalent thereof, and you are well qualified in that regard. Fourth is obviously political skills, and you have been in politics now for a long time and very successfully at every level of your political role. I refer from the electorate responsibilities here in the ACT up to the various functions and responsibilities that you have held in this Senate.

       I have no doubt, Madam President, that you will even further enhance the standing of this chamber and this parliament by being our President.

I congratulate you and wish you well.

I know that you know your way well around this place: you have a very good knowledge not only of the formal standing orders and procedures of this place but also of the way it works informally. Of course there is a need for any President to have a very good understanding of that because you do preside in the chamber where no one party has a majority.

       Ten years ago today, on budget day 1986, Janine Haines rose to speak in this chamber as the first woman leader of a political party at the federal level. Ten years ago the Democrats had five men and two women but, looking behind us today, it is quite the reverse—five women and two men and all the leadership positions are held by women!

         —The disgraceful and totally unjustifiable episode that occurred yesterday afternoon in this Parliament House is one of the most shameful in this nation's political history. I am sure I speak for senators on both sides of this chamber when I say that the opportunity for law&amp;hyphen;abiding citizens to express by peaceful protest, by orderly and non&amp;hyphen;violent demonstration or by other acceptable means their dissent from decisions made by governments is acknowledged as one of the fundamental privileges in a free and democratic society. However, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that it is a privilege that is not abused. What happened in this place yesterday should never have happened and those responsible for transforming what was meant to be a well&amp;hyphen;organised demonstration into the ugly and violent display that ultimately eventuated deserve the strongest condemnation.

         Senators should be aware that every endeavour had been made to ensure this pre&amp;hyphen;budget protest activity would proceed in an acceptable and reasonable manner. There was a number of meetings between Parliament House security authorities, the police and representatives of the demonstrators prior to yesterday's rally. It had been hoped that these discussions would assist in promoting peaceful protest action.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Briefly, by way of background: on 4 July the ACT Trades and Labour Council wrote to the Speaker and former President Beahan about a rally to be staged at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the building. The Presiding Officers responded to that request on 24 July. They approved the protest and the march around the building subject to the following conditions: the march not commence earlier than 1.35 p.m. and be completed by 2.25 p.m; marshals be appointed and clearly identified to cooperate with police in managing the march to ensure minimal disruption to traffic flows and access to the building for emergency and other vehicles; all efforts be made by participants in cooperation with marshals and police to ensure that roadways leading from Parliament Drive to the building and entrances to underground car parks remain unobstructed so as not to prevent the free movement of vehicles and people in and out of Parliament House; and the march be contained to Parliament Drive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were subsequent discussions with representatives of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Aboriginal community. All concerned were advised of the approved march and agreed to contain their activities to the authorised event. Most regrettably, this agreement was broken and the conditions were not adhered to.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20 p.m., when a separate group of marchers entered the parliamentary precincts. This group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in police lines and ran towards the main front entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by
         <break page="2671" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous conduct by a speaker from the official platform.

         Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and was redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors. Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons, including a large hammer, a wheel brace, a steel trolley and a stanchion torn from the external doors to break open the internal doors.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop, but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, they dispersed. In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace.

         On a more positive note, I want to advise senators that the Parliament House shop will re&amp;hyphen;open on Wednesday, 21 August, as originally planned—and I hope that Bill Podmore and his staff will receive the support they deserve. They were stoic under enormous pressure yesterday, and they are already up and running with plans in hand for what will hopefully be a once only and never to be repeated giant sale of damaged stock.

Many, many thousands of people took the opportunity to peacefully and properly express their views on a very important piece of legislation that will be dealt with in short order by this chamber.

        Sometimes when such violence occurs it is used to mask the other violence in society—the violence associated with the deliberate dividing of society and the forced marginalisation of large numbers of people in our society. When we do this enough, the argument becomes a law and order issue, and I think we should be dealing with these issues before this becomes the major debate in this or any other parliament. We need to ask: what is the basis of the violence that is causing the marginalisation of our community; and should we not as a parliament be dealing with that issue as the primary issue and not the symptoms of that violence?

        —As a parliamentarian for 21 years, as a trade unionist continuously for the last 40 years, I join with colleagues right around this chamber in my expression of condemnation of what occurred yesterday. It was an attack on the symbol of our democratic way of life. It besmirched the good name of the trade union movement, and we cannot allow a handful of Trotskyists, anarchists and thugs to so exploit the genuine feelings of many people and thrust them into violent activity. That sort of anarchy, that sort of individualism, strikes at the very heart of our democracy and, indeed, strikes at the heart of what I hope we all want in the industrial area: orderly industrial progress. Some forms of economic rationalism combined with utilitari

       I was not here yesterday at that time. I did send a message to the meeting that it was my view that the workplace relations bill as currently drafted would promote an unAustralian, self&amp;hyphen;centred and selfish `I'm alright Jack' attitude and, if that prevailed, then workplace relations would be soured and the unity which is necessary to protect the workers and their families would suffer.

       But last night I did see in my room the pictures of what happened in the storming of this parliament, the symbol of our democratic way of life. I saw those violent actions which caused such injuries to police, emergency workers and other workers in this parliament who serve us as members of parliament. I saw the terror in the eyes of children and the anxiety experienced by the international and Australian visitors—those Australians who rightly regard this parliament as `our House'. And this violence occurred in `our House'.

       Somehow or another, as a trade unionist and as a member of parliament, I feel a sense of shame. I do not know why but I feel a sense of shame. I could not sleep last night. I came in here and about 4 o'clock this morning I wrote a motion. I will not propose it because we have the opportunity of speaking now. But I did wander around the empty great hall of the parliament imagining the echoing voices of former Labor members of parliament who had come through the trade union movement—the voices of Ben Chifley and Percy Cleary and other great Labor leaders, all of whom would have roundly condemned yesterday's violent action. And I was very pleased to hear what Kim Beazley said yesterday and what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Mr Faulkner) said here today.

       What we have now is a slimy, sleazy little trick from the government. They are not satisfied with breaking the convention in relation to the election of presidents and deputy presidents in this place. Senator Hill was too gutless to stand up in the earlier debate and nominate Senator Colston. He passed the ball back to a member of his backbench because he did not have the courage of his conviction, he did not have the ticker, he did not have the intestinal fortitude

        to stand up in this place and put forward his own sleazy deal and arrangement. Senator Hill has indicated to Senator Panizza that the longstanding principle of pairs in this chamber is going to be broken. That is the sort of approach that we now see from the government in this place.

       I might say, Madam President, that yesterday we had a meeting of whips, leaders and managers in this place when Senator Hill talked about a new framework of cooperation in the chamber. I think it is fair to say to Senator Brown, Senator Margetts, Senator Harradine and Senator Kernot—to those four senators who attended that meeting—that that was put forward as a new, more constructive and more sensible approach from this mob over here in government.

It is for that reason I understand that, contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has said, pairs are never given in secret ballots—a very obvious reason, but it does not suit his purposes at the moment to recognise the argument of the logic. He says, `It's a convention.' It is a bit like his previous speech; it is a convention, except in 1990 when it did not suit his purposes. Here he says, `It's a convention.'

       It is for that reason that, when Senator Panizza signed his name to the pairs list, two Liberals should have been paired from coming in at the division bells—and he knows it. I am a bit sad that, probably through no connivance of his own, today, in this chamber, he

       There are many standing orders in the book here, but the first standing order always should be commonsense. Let me give you an example from history of how what goes around comes around. Three years ago a variety of coalition members missed a division here because they lingered too long over their dinner. I know that because, in fact, I passed them all—can you believe that?—on the way to this chamber for that division and I made it by 20 seconds. They all hit the door running when the door slammed in their faces, and we won that particular division on a crucial amendment. What was our response in government—not to rely on past practice, not to rely on what was in standing orders but to institute the law of common sense. I recommitted that clause, and we were defeated by one vote.

       The next time this happened we were at fault and we lost a division that we should have won. What happened? The other side here said, `No, you can't recommit it. We won't let you.' We had to move 12 divisions in a row to get that original vote restored. I warned you on that occasion that you were setting precedents. What happened a few months later? Again they missed divisions. Did we force another 12 divisions on this chamber? No. We instituted the law of commonsense and had that clause recommitted.

Apparently, he did not once mention that. You have to ask yourself why. Was he ambushed by his leader and others, or was he in fact planning this all along?

I must correct Senator Ray—and I must say I am saddened that Senator Ray, who has been one of the sticklers for procedures in this chamber and probably the only member of the Labor Party who has any respect for the institution of the Senate and the parliament, should have made such a misstatement. He said that, when pairs are granted, you are debarred from entering the chamber. There is a point of view that, if you are within the building and you are paired, you appear in the chamber and stand behind the seats here so that your presence is noted. It is quite incorrect to say that you are debarred from entering the chamber.

       This debate has got very muddled on the point of a secret ballot as opposed to a division. Senator Hill is perfectly correct. If we have a secret ballot, we do not know how people vote; therefore, we cannot make a prediction on how they are going to vote.

       My final point is about the crocodile tears of Senator Ray about breaking precedence. A far more serious matter was the matter of the division of the Senate into short- and long-term senators after the 1987 double dissolution. Senator Ray, as Manager of Government Business at the time, conspired with the Democrats to rort the system. They broke with precedence since Federation and took the plum jobs, the long-term Senate positions, for the Labor Party and the Democrats so that in the subsequent election they would be able to get control of the Senate.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Fortunately, the public made their judgement of the Democrats and the Labor Party in the 1990 election—they lost seats and did not get control. But the rorting of the convention that senators be distributed into short- and long-term positions in the sequence in which they were elected—the sequence that had been followed since Federation—was a far more profound breach of convention than anything that is going on, or implied to be going on, here today.

        The reason I move this motion is that I think it would have been more reasonable for senators who dissented from my speaking before not to have so dissented. This is a debate which touches on the very foundation of the Senate—that is, how we elect officers of this chamber to preside over this chamber, bring order to this chamber and structure the debate and proceedings of this chamber in a way and in a manner in which it will be orderly.

        It seems to me that for anyone to be denied to speak on such a matter is, in fact, to suppress the opinion of senators in this chamber by weight of numbers rather than to open the proceedings of this chamber for the free flow of debate so that all of us, when this matter is finally resolved, as it eventually will be, can at least feel that we had our say and had our opportunity to put our views to this chamber. Therefore, I think the motion to suspend standing orders ought to be supported.

        What has been said in this debate by a number of  speakers is true. The Prime Minister promised the electorate of Australia, when he was elected, that he would bring a better order and governance to the affairs of parliament. What we have seen today is something that has been, in my view, rightly described as a low, sleazy move, and it is to break a longstanding convention of the parliament. I just ask the Senate to consider for a moment that, when we have bills of high public controversy in the wings waiting to come on in here, if the proceedings to elect the presiding officers of this chamber—and I now refer to the Deputy President, not the President—are subverted, the authority that those officers might bring to their high and esteemed office will also be equally subverted.

The problem is not with giving pairs; the problem is with the standing orders and what they say about how the ballot will take place. That is the point. I hope I am relevant.

        The problem is with the way the standing orders are written in respect of the ballot. There is no provision in there for a postal ballot. Every elector in this country can have a postal ballot if they are not there. Senator Foreman—and my best wishes to you, Dominic—could have a postal ballot if it were an election to elect us to this place. It is odd that we cannot have a postal ballot.

We have seen today one of the sleaziest, most deceitful pieces of politics that has ever been perpetrated in this place. We have seen it only because Senator Hill has been so weak and spineless in failing to back up the relevant government office holder—that is, Senator Panizza—in terms of the commitments that he gave. I believe that, if the government is fair dinkum that it wants to see all senators have an opportunity to vote—and the Labor Party has made very clear its position in regard to this particular matter—then the way to allow that is to have this ballot when all senators are present.

We will then have obviously a very clear and fair dinkum assessment of what the real position is in this chamber.

         —This is an absolute shambles. If ever the moral and intellectual inadequacies of an opposition leader have been exposed, it is today. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) got himself worked into a fury with confected outrage about our doing what they did in 1990. He complained bitterly about Senator Knowles, who is a good friend of Senator Colston, actually having the cheek to nominate him. Then of course we had all this outrage about the fact that somehow we can equate pairs in a secret ballot with normal pairs in a division, where the vote is quite transparent. As Senator Harradine made so very clear, there is a fundamental difference, and the opposition has clearly declined to answer the point.

        It is not only that, of course. We have also had an extraordinary concession that somehow that argument is unanswerable. So all of Senator Faulkner's outrage is now out the window, and what are we left with? A proposition that we should adjourn until such time as everyone is present. What does that mean? Take an anarchist like Senator Carr, who will be very unhappy if democracy prevails. What if he chooses to absent himself from the chamber? We would never get around to a vote on this issue. It is an absolutely ludicrous proposition.

        The trouble is that Labor is a victim of their own tyranny. They have never accepted the concept of a secret ballot. They cannot understand how anyone cannot toe the party line.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It does not work that way. The Senate was not designed to accommodate that system. It is a private arrangement. As we know, pairs are there for the convenience of the parties. They were assigned on this day on the usual understanding that they would apply when there were divisions, when there were  transparent ballots. They have never been used in this chamber for the purpose of effectively causing a secret ballot to be a non-secret ballot. That is what you are trying to do.

        The tragedy is that Senator Faulkner is so bereft of any intellectual ability to cope with the argument about the difference between a secret ballot and an open ballot that he basically has to concede the point, not address it in any shape or form and come up with something else that the real opposition leader tells him he better give a run. That is a tragedy and it certainly pulls the rug out from any of the arguments we have heard this afternoon.

What happened when we came to the Telstra bill and the Australian Workplace Relations Bill? Of course they were referred to references committees—in other words, an absolute and flagrant breach of all that Senator Robert Ray lectured us about.

We have not heard one squeak of a defence about how he justified the ballot that is effectively being re&amp;hyphen;run today. In other words, convention is something that suits him, in terms of an intellectual or debating point. It has nothing to do with real life—as far as the Labor Party is concerned—where you live or die on the strength of numbers. That is all you understand.

        But we understand secret ballots to have a lot more to them than that. They are an opportunity for people to express their real views. We cannot force people to vote, and you should not either. But that is what you try to do. You try to ensure that somehow you cut people back. When Senator Sherry chose to absent himself, you could have explored the consequences of that. You knew full well what was going to take place in this chamber this afternoon.

        When Senator Hill accommodates you absolutely, what do you do? You once again want to change the rules. So you now have an absolutely nonsensical proposition before the chair.

You cannot accept the fact that what is happening now is something that is entirely of your own creation, both internally and externally. You ought to wear that result. Democracy is a lot healthier than you are prepared to give it credit for.

        Senator Sherry, who is the shadow minister for finance, had arranged for some time in accordance with those provisions of the budget to be in the lockup. If we asked for him to come out of the lockup now, you would prevent him from coming out because that would be a breach of the budget confidentiality. Once he is in there—and I think he went in at about 12.30 p.m.—he is locked up; he cannot come out. So what we now have from Senator Hill is a proposal: `We don't accept the pairs. You cannot have a pair in a secret ballot, but we will ask two of our people not to vote.' If he says that that is not acceptable and that that is a strange way to go about having pairs on a secret ballot, then Senator Faulkner's position is the best: wait until all 76 senators are available to vote.

It waited until the bells had almost finished ringing to call people to have the ballot before Senator Panizza gave an indication to the opposition that the pairs were off because Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, said they were off.

         If there is any doubt about there being effective pairs or people having to leave the chamber to make the ballot real or not real, why not wait until all 76 senators are in here and voting in a secret ballot, which everybody says is the way to do it, rather than having Senator Hill create this unfortunate precedent of saying, `We'll find two Liberals and I'll ask them not to vote, but it's really not a pairs process,' therefore throwing doubt on this whole process? It has been a very unseemly start to the Senate today through the sheer incompetence and deception of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. He stands condemned as a result.

         —On this occasion I congratulate Senator Colston on his election. There was a lot spoken today about precedent. But perhaps it is important to note that it is possible or should be possible in this chamber for the position of President to be held by someone who is not of a major party. I do believe that that is important.

        I would like to draw attention to the fact that it is important that we acknowledge that, in the democratic process, this was to happen at some time during the life of the Australian Senate. With its having happened now, we should take the opportunity to find out what it might be like to have a person who is not of either major party, and to experience the benefits that that might bring. I am very encouraged to see that that has not taken another 20 years to happen.

I have brought that forward by some weeks for a variety of reasons, one of which is to do with the sitting pattern of the Tasmanian parliament to ensure that there is not an unreasonable length of time before the appointment of my successor.

       My first task is to say a few thankyous: to my family for their tolerance of this political life over so many years; to all those who have been my personal staff over many years—a great variety of them; and to committee staff, particularly of those Senate committees that I have been chair of. I would also like to thank all of those working in this building who have been helpful to me over the years, all of those in this town who have been helpful and all of those in the public service throughout Australia—particularly in Tasmania—who have helped in so many ways. It is sad that so many of them are feeling a bit unwanted these days.

       I certainly express my appreciation to the Australian Labor Party and in particular to the Left of the party for giving me the opportunity to serve here.

       My departure from here will mean that there is nobody left in this chamber who was a member of the parliament for the period of the Whitlam government, which shows you how time passes. Even in the House of Representatives on our side, the only ones who remain are Peter Morris and Ralph Willis. I spent three years in the House of Representatives before spending five years in the electorate office of Senator Ken Wriedt
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        when he was Leader of the Opposition here. I have then spent 15 years in the Senate.

       In 1972, when I discovered that there were a number of people who had been here for 20 and even 30 years, I remember saying, `If I am still here after 20 years, give me a reminder about this and make sure that I don't stay longer.' I have been a member of the parliament for 18 years, but it has been 24 or 25 years since I first sought endorsement. I think an average of those times means that it is time to depart.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Even if I had stayed, I would not have been part of the Labor government elected at the next election, and those who will be should be getting in at this point. I would also like to say that I have very mixed feelings about departing, which I guess you would understand—some regrets and perhaps some relief—but the events of today in the Senate I think confirmed in my mind that I was doing the right thing.

       I have never been entirely comfortable with making speeches, as some of you may have noticed, and I am not going to start now. I guess you could say that I am not a particularly good politician in so far as not being very good at seeking publicity. There are many things that I am proud to have been part of in the electorate, in the parliament and in the caucus. But, don't get me wrong, I am not going to go through a long list.

       It has been a privilege to have served here on behalf of the party. Being part of the national decision making process is a task that is open to very few people. I am not saying that I was always on the winning side in these matters, but it is a very great honour to have been involved in and been part of the process. There have been fewer Labor senators from Tasmania than I would have expected. On my count, there have only ever been something like 28 Labor senators from Tasmania. I guess if you look at your own states, there might be much the same sort of numbers. So a very small group of people from any one state and from any one party have had this privilege.

       I guess the one thing that stands out most of all is my years of chairing the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee under its various names. In some ways it was a thankless task—it certainly was not one that made the headlines in the Tasmanian media—but it was a task that I mostly enjoyed, even if in many public administration matters I did not achieve the outcomes that I would like to have achieved.

       It is with a mixture of some pride, some regret and some relief that I thank everyone for their friendship in this place.

I guess one of the regrets I have is the circumstances of the sorts of things that have been announced by the new government. I do not want to make a welter of that, but I do look forward to Labor regaining government and implementing the policies which we stand for.

        The budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of $10.3 billion. If we took no corrective measures it would be $9.6 billion this year. We would still have an underlying deficit of 2 per cent of GDP even though the economy has had five years of growth. Debt would be increasing and Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook or sentiment.

         The measures the Treasurer announces tonight will reduce the underlying deficit by around $4 billion this year and $7.2 billion over two years. These measures will balance the budget over the term of this Parliament. These are the net effect on the budget bottom line after the introduction of new policy to meet the Coalition's election commitments. These measures represent a historic turnaround in Commonwealth finances. In 1997-98, outlays will have fallen around 1.8 per cent of GDP, while revenues will have risen only 0.2 per cent of GDP.

       (1) One of the conditions for payment of an unemployment allowance under the Social Security Act is that customers must satisfy the activity test. The primary requirement of the activity test is that the person must be actively seeking and willing to undertake suitable paid work. Employer contact certificates provide a useful indicator of a person's efforts to seek suitable paid work. They are issued where there is reason to believe that a customer is not making reasonable efforts to seek suitable paid work.

       (6) Yes, there have been some complaints from employers about the operation of employer contact certificates. Until recently, a process for collecting information on such complaints has not been in place. However, an employer contact unit is currently being trialled in Tasmania and will be a focal point for receiving information, including complaints from employers. A dedicated phone and facsimile facility in the unit will assist employers to provide information to the Department.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) I am aware of the documents provided by the Iraqi Charge D'Affaires to which you refer, as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reports describing the humanitarian situation in Iraq under UN sanctions. I believe the UN Security Council has responded appropriately to the deteriorating situation in Iraq by securing Iraq's agreement on 20 May 1996 to implement UNSCR 986, the third `oil&amp;hyphen;for&amp;hyphen;food' resolution offered by the UN Security Council to the Iraqi Government. It needs to be emphasised that the problems of food supply and distribution in Iraq were imposed by the Iraqi government on the Iraqi people. The agreed procedures for implementing UNSCR 986 will allow Iraq to export a limited amount of oil in return for a UN&amp;hyphen;monitored distribution of humanitarian aid to the general Iraqi populace, including Kurdish populations in the North.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The Australian Government immediately welcomed this announcement and expressed its full support for the agreement, which will go some way towards alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi civilian population. We should note that the option of addressing the nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi people through this process has been available to the Iraqi Government since 1991, when the UN Security Council adopted UNSCR 706, the first `oil&amp;hyphen;for&amp;hyphen;food' resolution. Further, it has always been within the Iraqi Government's capacity simply to comply with the relevant UNSCRs thus ensuring that sanctions are lifted. As the UN Special Rapporteur on Iraq of the Commission for Human Rights, Mr Max van der Stoel pointed out in his report of March 1996 the Government of Iraq is to be held accountable for any human hardship in Iraq.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Prior to agreement being reached on UNSCR 986 the UN Security Council and UN member&amp;hyphen;states, conscious of the basic needs of the Iraqi people, specifically exempted food and medical supplies from the sanctions, and provided a facility for the approval of exports to Iraq of essential civilian goods. The UN and many non&amp;hyphen;government organisations (including CARE Australia) have throughout the period of sanctions operated an emergency relief program that met some of the needs of Iraqis most affected by sanctions. The Australian Government since 1993/94 has annually contributed a substantial amount in emergency aid to Iraq through multilateral and non&amp;hyphen;government channels.

       As a member&amp;hyphen;state of the United Nations, Australia is bound by the 32 United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) on Iraq, including UNSCR 661 which imposed economic

        sanctions on that state. Sanctions are one of the few non&amp;hyphen;military options available to the international community to encourage a Government to behave in a manner that does not threaten international peace and security. Australia has strongly and publicly supported the UN Security Council in maintaining sanctions on Iraq and since 1991 has actively contributed resources to UN activities and organisations such as the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM), overseeing the destruction and ongoing monitoring of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction capacity; and to the Maritime Interception Force (MIF) operating in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Aqaba.

The Australian Government believes the Government of Iraq must fulfil all remaining aspects of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including accounting for Kuwaitis and third country nationals still missing after the Gulf War, the settlement of reparation claims, and in particular, those relating to the destruction of its WMD capabilities.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) There appears to be insufficient data available accurately to estimate the effect of sanctions on the Iraqi populace overall. Inevitably, the economic sanctions on Iraq have impacted adversely on many areas of the economy, including basic infrastructure, the environment, local food production, the provision of health services, the rationing of essential supplies, with consequences for the quality of life enjoyed by the average Iraqi citizen, particularly women and children. The 1995 survey conducted jointly by the FAO and the Nutrition Research Institute of the Iraqi Ministry of Health revealed the seriousness of malnutrition amongst Iraqi children. The WHO report of March 1996, comparing the levels of the infant mortality rate and the mortality rate of children under 5 years during the pre&amp;hyphen;war period (1988&amp;hyphen;89) with that during the period of the sanctions (since 1990), found that the infant mortality rate has doubled and the mortality rate of children under 5 years has increased six times. This is regarded as the result of malnutrition of mothers and children; and the widespread prevalence of infectious diseases. The maternal mortality rate, based on available data, appears to have gone up several fold since 1991. The WHO report recognised that due to the deterioration in the data collection systems in Iraq since 1991, these may underestimate the true situation. It is the Australian Government's view that both the UN and the Government of Iraq have responded responsibly to this situation, by agreeing to implement UNSCR 986. This way of alleviating hardship was long offered by the international community, in the face of obstinacy and intransigence from the Government of Iraq.

After a lengthy period of consultation and detailed discussions with the states and territories, the draft Commonwealth legislation is now close to being finalised. Parliamentary Counsel's Committee, in conjunction with NSW instructors, has also progressed the model state/territory legislation.

       The legislation alone will not be sufficient to enable prisoners to be transferred between Australia and other countries.

       (1) The arbitration proceedings involved two main aspects. Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd (CODOCK) sought damages for breach of contract arising from the former Government's 1990 decision to cease Oberon submarine refits at Cockatoo island dockyard. Arbitration hearings on that aspect are completed. An interim award, except for the matter of legal costs, has been given in a decision by the Arbitrator. The Commonwealth is seeking leave to appeal that decision in the NSW courts. The second aspect involves the Commonwealth's claim against CODOCK for alleged contamination of Cockatoo island. The arbitration is currently adjourned on that aspect pending a resolution of the Commonwealth's application to have its claims heard, as a preference, by the NSW Courts. The NSW Supreme Court hearings on that application commenced on 12 June 1996.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) Yes, a decision was taken on 28 June 1996 to close all regional offices of the Department in Western Australia, starting in September and with all closures effected by December 1996. The decision was taken in the context of a review of the viability of the Department's regional network given the reductions in running costs for the Department and the issues which have arisen for the regional offices since opening. These issues relate to the complexity of subject matter, maintaining adequate and appropriate staffing levels and the capacity to keep offices open at all times.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (a) The closures have not been handled in a secretive manner. The decision to close the offices was taken on 28 June 1996 and announced to staff on 1 July 1996 and to local members on 2 July. There has been full consultation with staff and unions throughout the review process which led to the final decision on closure. The possibility of office closures was foreshadowed with staff and unions during the review process.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (b) The considerations surrounding the decision related to departmental management issues rather than to the community—particularly the capacity to provide in very small offices the depth and breadth of program knowledge necessary to adequately cover the wide range of programs of the Department. These issues needed to be worked through with staff before public announcements. On the other hand, the Department had previously had considerable input from the community on its service needs and priorities. Therefore consultation
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        with the community was not considered appropriate before the decision being made. Officers of the Department have dealt with community concerns as they have arisen in many regions. Consultation with key community stakeholders will form part of the implementation process as the decision is put into effect. This will help ensure that regional focus is maintained in the planning and delivery of services.

       (c) There will be no reduction in service levels as a result of this decision. The majority of the Department's activities are not related to direct service delivery, but to the funding of community and other organisations to provide services. The implementation process for the closures will include strategies to ensure that a regional focus is maintained while programs are administered from the Perth office of the Department. There will be a particular emphasis on ensuring effective administration and support for services for Aboriginal people.

       (1) &amp; (2) The southern bluefin tuna (SBT) is a highly migratory fish that spawns in the Indian Ocean. This species is subject to intense scientific study and international management through the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). In May of this year Australia, Japan, and New Zealand agreed on this year's global catch quota for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) at 11,750 tonnes, the same as last year's figure. The CCSBT decided national allocations were also the same as last year with 5,265 tonnes to Australia, 6,065 tonnes to Japan, and 420 tonnes to New Zealand.

       The Commission is a multilateral body established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1994. The founding members are Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, the three major SBT fishing nations. The global SBT stock has been severely depleted by overfishing, but the Commission is working to ensure that the stock recovers.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       This year's negotiations were particularly difficult and protracted, because Australian and New Zealand scientists have a more pessimistic view of the level of the tuna stock than the Japanese. As a result, Australia and New Zealand did not support a Japanese proposal for a 6,000 tonne increase in the annual catch.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The Commission agreed on a substantial program of collaborative scientific work to reduce the uncertainties in our knowledge of the tuna stock. It set down clear objectives and principles for evaluating whether experimental fishing could, in the future, provide for more responsive decision-making in the fishery. The Commission have agreed that management should be directed towards returning to the `biologically safe' level of 1980 stock levels by 2020. Setting a target recovery date is a major leap forward for the Commission, although it recognises that the tuna stock may take years to recover from the overfishing of previous decades. The CCSBT next meets in September 1996.

       Eastern gemfish was an important commercial species for the NSW trawl industry during the late 1970s and 1980s. However, from 1985 to 1989 recruitment of eastern gemfish was greatly reduced. In response, the Australian Fisheries Service, and subsequently AFMA, progressively reduced the total allowable catch (TAC) for eastern gemfish from 3000 tonnes in 1988 to zero in 1993 where it has remained. AFMA also restricted the fishing industry to low `trip limits' determined by AFMA each year in consultation with scientists, industry and management. The best estimate of 1995 spawning biomass is between 30 and 35% of 1979 levels, noting that there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding these figures. A major scientific program is currently under way, including limited experimental fishing taking place during the 1996 season which is intended to provide a better estimate of current biomass and its relationship to the management target. Eastern gemfish has been nominated twice under the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (ESP Act). Nominations were considered by the Endangered Species Scientific Sub-committee (ESSS) of the Endangered Species Advisory Committee (ESAC). In both cases the Minister for the Environment did not find reason to list the species under the ESP Act.

       School and Gummy shark form the major catch of the Southern Shark Fishery. They are also taken in zone 2 of the Western Australian southern demersal gillnet and demersal long line fishery. Limitations are in place on the length and construction of gillnets, the number of hooks which can be used, the use of automatic baiting equipment and the size of fish taken. There are also some areas in State waters which have been designated "nursery" areas in which fishing is prohibited or strictly limited. Catches of gummy shark are considered to be sustainable at current levels. The most recent stock assessment advice for school shark is that recent catches have exceeded the maximum sustainable yield of the stock, and catches need to be reduced. AFMA, in consultation with the Southern Shark Fishery Management Advisory Committee (SharkMAC) is currently developing management arrangements to achieve the necessary reduction in catch. Neither School or Gummy shark are listed on any conservation list.

       The orange roughy fishery was heavily fished during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a peak annual catch of about 40,000 tonnes. It is managed as three sub-fisheries as each is believed to contain a discrete fish stock. The main spawning stock off eastern Tasmania and the southern stock have been under TACs since 1990. A TAC was introduced to the western zone in 1992. Current estimates indicate that spawning biomass of the eastern and southern stocks are around 25 to 30 percent of 1988 levels depending on assumptions about stock structure and natural mortality rates.

The TAC is expected to be reduced further to 1,500 tonnes by 1998. The eastern and western zone TACs are stable at 2,000 tonnes and 1,500 tonnes respectively. Research is continuing into better understanding the stock structure of orange roughy as this impacts on the achievement of management objectives for the fishery.

Australia is a net importer of shark meat for consumption principally in the Melbourne market. Australia does export a number of shark products principally fins, shark liver oil and shark cartilage although information on the quantity of these exports are not recorded. Information is not collected on exports of shark by species although total exports of shark for human consumption are recorded.

          the survey and that AFMA had written to the EPA seeking its endorsement. The EPA suggested to AFMA that it designate the survey proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (EPIP Act) as it was of the view that the proposed harvest from the research program, combined with the bycatch harvest, would amount to a significant portion of the existing stock. In the light of this advice, AFMA requested the CSIRO to undertake an analysis of the effects on the spawning stock of taking 300 tonnes, comprising 200 tonnes during the survey and 100 tonnes under bycatch trip limits, during 1996. The CSIRO analyses showed that the impact of the trawl survey on the eastern gemfish stock would be small. AFMA then wrote to the EPA and advised that in view of the CSIRO advice it had decided that it was not necessary to designate the proposal under the EPIP Act and that it would therefore be going ahead with the trawl survey. I understand that the trawl survey commenced on 17 June 1996 and is due to be completed prior to 8 August 1996.

However, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency (ANCA) has commissioned a scientific assessment by CSIRO of the likelihood of Southern Bluefin Tuna meeting the criteria for listing on CITES. ANCA has indicated that this assessment is being undertaken to provide the agency with information needed for developing a whole of government approach in relation to CITES issues and Southern Bluefin Tuna. ANCA has indicated that any consideration of a possible listing of Southern Bluefin Tuna in the future will be carried in full consultation with relevant Government agencies, industry and other interest groups.

       (3) ATSIC is not aware of any Commonwealth funds being directed to the Strelley, Carlindie, Warralong, Woodstock or Lalla Rookh stations for pastoral activities. The only funding allocated by ATSIC has been to the Warralong community, which is situated on the Warralong pastoral lease. Funding to this community had been for Community Infrastructure and a Community Development Employment Project.

       (5) It is acknowledged that some pastoral stations do not have adequate facilities for all residents or may have been abandoned for short periods due largely to seasonal factors. However, the provision of Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) funding to Aboriginal organisations is separate from any funding for pastoral operations being undertaken by these organisations. In terms of the CDEP ATSIC is only responsible for ensuring that CDEP work activities are being carried out in accordance with the work plan, that wages are paid to participants and that regular CDEP Reviews

Where an organisation has temporarily left a property, it is likely that CDEP activities are no longer being performed and the CDEP project would be suspended or ceased accordingly. ATSIC is not responsible for the monitoring of pastoral properties that are not in receipt of ATSIC funding—in fact ATSIC has no authority to become involved unless it is providing funding.

       (6) While ATSIC is not responsible for the monitoring of all pastoral properties, ATSIC's Regional Offices routinely visit pastoral stations in Western Australia in receipt of ATSIC funds to ensure that the properties are being managed properly and are operating at a sustainable level.

       Furthermore, ATSIC's Western Australian State Office conducts regular Reviews of those pastoral stations in receipt of ATSIC land management funding to ensure that funds are being expended in accordance with ATSIC's requirements.

       ATSIC recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Western Australian Department of Agriculture to monitor all pastoral properties in the Pilbara and Upper Gascoyne regions. This has involved the use of a pastoral adviser to monitor the operations of each property. In the Kimberley region, 18 pastoral properties are participants to the Kimberley Aboriginal Pastoralists Project (KAPP), which is aimed at developing all properties to their maximum potential. ATSIC fully supports this project and has provided funding to assist in its development.

       In addition, the leases on all pastoral properties are monitored by the Pastoral Board of Western Australia to ensure that lease conditions are being met.

       (8)(a) The Strelley Task Force Review Report indicated that the Strelley station was abandoned in 1984 because of its proximity to the South and Port Hedland townships.

       Because of remaining concerns about the syphoning of monies into private companies, and because the consultant engaged by ATSIC did not have the right to access the records of the related entities, ATSIC has decided to refer the matter to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) for further investigation. The ASC is the appropriate statutory body to examine these issues.

       (1) Yes. Proposals to make savings in the NCA budget were outlined in the Coalition's election statement `Meeting Our Commitments' in February this year. These proposals are now firm requirements that the NCA take measures to reduce outlays in order to meet savings targets set by the Government.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) The NCA determines what steps will be taken to achieve its savings targets. As you may be aware, the Chairperson of the NCA recently announced cuts in both corporate and operational areas of the NCA as part of its savings strategy. The decision by the Chairperson to make substantial cuts to the NCA's Perth and Adelaide offices was based on an assessment of the relative level and impact of organised criminal activity in those jurisdictions, compared with that in other States. Despite the cutbacks, the NCA is retaining a core team of staff in its Perth and Adelaide offices so that it maintains a presence in all of its existing locations across Australia.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) I have previously recognised publicly that any savings by the NCA may result in a reduction in its criminal investigation capacity. Available resources have, however, been allocated to minimise the impact of the cuts on the NCA's core investigative functions.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (4) As I have already stated, these cuts were foreshadowed in the coalition's election statement in February. The Government has set savings targets for all Government departments and agencies. The NCA is simply one of those Government agencies required to meet those targets.
