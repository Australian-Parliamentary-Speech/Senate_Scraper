        International pharmaceutical and related product manufacturers are increasingly concentrating manufacture in countries where the regulatory environments provide quick and efficient clearance of their products. Australia has been able to expand significantly its pharmaceutical industry over recent years partly because of its efforts in streamlining the regulatory arrangements. The amendments contained in the Bill will support a new Electronic Lodgement Facility (ELF) system which will reduce the processing time for the large volume of less critical therapeutic goods from the current average of 5 months to a maximum of 14 days, with significant cost savings to industry and Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Due to extensive publicity since June 1994, virtually all significant Australian manufacturers have adjusted their operational arrangements in anticipation of the introduction of ELF, including the purchase of new hardware and the ELF software packages and undertaking staff training. Many have built up a substantial backlog of products in anticipation of being able to take advantage of the new system on commencement of the ELF. Early passage of the amendments in the Winter Sittings 1996 is critical in reducing the disruption to the industry caused by delay in the availability of new products to Australian consumers.

        The purpose of the bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 (the Act) to enable Australia to meet its international obligations under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and Their Disposal (Basel Convention) and relevant Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Council Decisions. The Act is at present deficient in that it generally only covers wastes for final disposal (incineration, landfill, etc), whereas the Convention also regulates wastes traded for recovery operations (reclamation of metals, recycling, etc).

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        existing legislation does not ensure Australia will meets its international obligations under the Basel Convention and the other international instruments relating to hazardous waste to which it is a party. Clear breaches of our international obligations have occurred in the past and may potentially be repeated because of the Government's incapacity to carry out the proper notification and consent procedures. The existing legislation does not cover all materials that, under international law, should be regulated. Amendment to the Hazardous Waste Act is necessary to ensure Australia can discharge its international law obligations.

        Australia's credibility in current international debates on hazardous waste issues continues to be damaged by the deficiencies in the present Act. It is imperative that Australia be in a strong position to influence future developments in relation to the Basel Convention.

         Sir Hubert Opperman was born at Rochester, Victoria, on 29 May 1904. He started his working life as a messenger boy for the Melbourne  Herald
        </emphasis>
        . It was not long before he joined the Postmaster&amp;hyphen;General's Department,
        <break page="28" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         where he rode a bicycle as a telegraph messenger and began his lifelong passion for cycling.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sir Hubert entered his first bicycle race in 1919, and quickly went on to make cycling history, both here in Australia and overseas. Among his many cycling achievements, Sir Hubert held the title of Australian road cycling champion in 1924, 1926, 1927 and 1929; captained Australia's Tour de France team in 1928 and 1931; won the French Bol d'Or race in 1928 and the Paris&amp;hyphen;Brest&amp;hyphen;Paris marathon in 1931; set a new record for riding between Lands End and John O'Groats in England; and won the Bidlake Memorial Prize in 1934.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sir Hubert retired from cycling in 1940, but not before breaking more than 100 records in a 24&amp;hyphen;hour cycling marathon around the old Sydney velodrome. At least one of his cycling records, remarkably, still stands today, making him one of the great national sporting legends of all time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sir Hubert served in the Royal Australian Air Force from 1940 to 1945, was commissioned in 1942, and held the rank of flight lieutenant when he was discharged in 1945. Sir Hubert entered federal politics in 1949 when he won the seat of Corio. His maiden speech in Parliament was characterised by his concern for the less fortunate: rural Australia, pensioners, war widows and war veterans. He believed in a community pulling together for the common good, and expressed his faith in the Australian worker.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sir Hubert served this Parliament for 17 years, in the various offices that I mentioned earlier and on a number of parliamentary committees. He was also a trustee of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust from 1959 to 1960.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was Sir Hubert's task as whip to welcome new members and help them settle down, answering their questions on when to speak, on leave and about their offices. It was at one of these meetings that a tall young member from country Victoria, one Malcolm Fraser, asked, `How tough can you be on the opposition in your maiden speech?' Sir Hubert was said to have advised in a characteristically short, simple and sturdy manner, `Malcolm,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1967 Sir Hubert resigned from parliament to become Australia's first High Commissioner to Malta, where he served until 1972. As Minister for Immigration he helped speed the demise of the White Australia policy by relaxing naturalisation requirements for non&amp;hyphen;Europeans—an achievement he singled out for mention in his valedictory address.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Many distinguished parliamentarians have passed through this parliament but few could claim such remarkable achievements in a multitude of careers—in sport, in politics and in the service of this country. Sir Hubert was appointed an officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1953 in recognition of his outstanding service during Australia's Golden Jubilee celebrations in 1951, when he was given the complex and difficult task of organising the sporting section of the celebrations. He received his knighthood in 1968.

        Sir Hubert continued to lead an active life after his retirement.

        Sir Hubert Opperman, known to so many Australians as `Oppy'—as the world knew him also—was simply one of the greatest cyclists the world has ever known. He was the son of a butcher. Oppy left school to join the post office as a telegram boy, which was a tremendous advantage for him because the job allowed him to ride a bike.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the twenties and thirties he set more than 100 world cycling records, some of which stand to this day. As Senator Hill has said, in 1928 he won the Bol d'Or in France. This was a remarkable achievement. He came from 17 laps behind to do that. That was even more extraordinary when you consider that the bike he was to ride in the race had been sabotaged. Not only did he overcome that obstacle, but he set a new world record. Another of his outstanding wins was in 1931 in the 1,160 kilometre Paris&amp;hyphen;Brest&amp;hyphen;Paris race, which is the world's longest non-stop road race.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1937 he broke the Fremantle&amp;hyphen;Sydney record by an incredible five days. In 1939 he held nine world records, four English road records, 13 interstate records, five Australian records and 32 state records. His Sydney&amp;hyphen;Melbourne record of 39 hours 41 minutes stood for 38 years until 1967. In fact, so great were his achievements as a cyclist that many competitors wanted to see the rules changed so that they could have a crack at some of those records.

         As Senator Hill has said, he enlisted in the RAAF in the Second World War as an aircraftman and was discharged as a flight lieutenant. In 1949 he was successful in winning the seat of Corio. He was the government whip from 1955 to 1960, Minister for Shipping and Minister for Immigration. As Minister for Immigration he inaugurated the Opperman doctrine, which effectively spelt the beginning of the end of the White Austral ia policy. He resigned from parliament in 1967.

        It was a very great achievement for him to win the seat of Corio. He defeated a very popular and outstanding local member in J.J. Dedman, a minister in many Labor governments. It took Labor a very long time indeed to win that seat back. Eventually, Gordon Scholes won the seat of Corio after Oppy had retired. Gordon Scholes had contested the seat and had been very roundly defeated when Sir Hubert Opperman was the Liberal Party candidate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He was an extraordinarily popular local member. His record in that seat—which he won by a very narrow majority in 1949, then building the majority to many thousands—was a great achievement on his part, even though it did cause the Labor Party great agony for a very long time in that seat.

His story is one of great achievement and personal triumph, rising from telegraph boy to winner of so many medals and so many events.

He twice captained the Australian Tour de France team and won the 24&amp;hyphen;hour road race in 1928. Sir Hubert's superlative efforts in the 1939 non-stop cycle marathon at the Sydney velodrome, where he broke 101 Australian and international records, was one of his greatest achievements before he retired from competitive cycling in order to make a contribution to Australia's war effort by joining the RAAF in 1940 as an aircraftman. He rose to the rank of flight lieutenant and was based at a squadron in Queensland.

        In 1949 Sir Hubert embarked on the next successful phase of his life when he entered federal politics as member for the seat of Corio under the Menzies Liberal government. His capabilities were recognised by Mr Menzies and he held a variety of key portfolios during his 18-year political career. After serving as government whip in 1955, Sir Hubert was elevated to shipping and transport minister in 1960, which ministry he held for three years. As immigration minister in 1963, his policy decisions allowing non-European migrants possessing qualifications positively useful for Australia to settle in Australia, as well as reducing the qualifying residential period for non-Europeans from 15 years to five years, were the first critical steps towards the end of the White Australia policy. It was during that time that he was knighted in recognition of his immense sporting achievements and his great contribution to public life.

        When he stepped down from public office in 1972, Sir Hubert continued to make a contribution to Australia through his tireless voluntary work for the Association for the Blind in Victoria, where he served as vice-president for 12 years and then as honorary councillor. In 1977 his autobiography

His sporting prowess, reflected in his achievements and international reputation, ranks him amongst the all&amp;hyphen;time greats of Australian sportsmen. He has been compared most closely to Sir Donald Bradman as being one of the true greats of Australian sport. Others have spoken of his achievements in that area and I do not wish to go over those.

        Sir Hubert was a very notable politician. He was one of the new breed of politicians that swept to power with Sir Robert Menzies in 1949. He successfully contested eight federal elections against some very strong opposition. As has been said, in winning the seat of Corio in 1949 he defeated a very influential and highly respected member of the Labor Party in the late John Dedman. He fought off many fierce challengers in the ensuing years, including—in one of his earlier contests—Bob Hawke, who later became Prime Minister of this country.

        In his parliamentary service, Sir Hubert was the government whip for more than four years. He was a minister in the parliament for almost seven years. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) noted in his comments, during a very notable period as Minister for Immigration, in March 1966, Sir Hubert presided over changes to Australia's immigration policy and Immigration Act. Those changes are generally recognised as marking the beginning of the end of the White Australia policy. Many people, including me, would regard the decisions that were taken by Sir Hubert Opperman as the

        After leaving politics, he was appointed as Australia's first High Commissioner to Malta.

As the first High Commissioner to Malta, he was instrumental in building on the relations with the Maltese community in Australia and between the two nations.

        But Opperman captured what to me is the greatest of all human qualities and he expressed it splendidly. He understood the greater state of humility. No matter what he did or where he went, Oppie was always the same. Now, throughout the whole of his life, that diffidence was there. Oppie never, to use an Australian expression, put on any side at all. He was always the same, no matter where you saw him, no matter what was going on. He was the simple, uncluttered Hubert Opperman.

        Those words could equally be applied to Sir Hubert Opperman because he believed in all of the self&amp;hyphen;effacing fidelity to sport and also had a warm welcome for the stranger in our midst.

        I remember the story of Sir Hubert Opperman finishing at John O'Groats. As he got close he said to Sir Bruce, `I'll be lucky to reach John O'Groats—I'll have to forget the 1,000'—miles, that is. Bruce Small said, `Sure, if you can now break the End to End, after the 24'—that is, the 24 hours—`that's good enough. You can have a go at the 1,000 some other time.' Little did Sir Hubert Opperman know that what Sir Bruce Small meant by `some other time' was four hours later because, having reached John O'Groats, Bruce Small gave him four hours slumber then woke him up, dressed him, put him back on a bicycle and sent him off in pursuit of the

In that story you can see the immense commitment and courage that Sir Hubert had.

With passion in his heart and guided by a sense of fairness for all, he made our nation a better place not just for his generation but for my generation and for generations who are yet to come.

        My colleague Senator Short referred to Sir Hubert's great political achievement in winning initially, and holding on to, the very difficult seat of Corio, which prior to and after that had always been exceedingly difficult for the Liberal Party to win. He was able to hold on to Corio for 17 years, winning eight consecutive elections. He first won the seat of Corio in 1949, by 234 votes. He was able to increase that majority to close to 8,000 votes in his last election. The fact that Mr Gordon Scholes demolished this majority, winning the seat in the by-election after Sir Hubert's retirement in 1967, is a testament to Oppy's high standing in the community and his popularity. The seat has remained in ALP hands ever since.

I think some of us may agree with that.

I do not know about the latter two, but I do know that he certainly did the former.

         Of course, it was not all peaches and cream in the parliament for Mick Young. I think there were three occasions when his ministerial career was interrupted, put on hold or, finally, brought to an untimely conclusion.

He was a great raconteur, a great wit, and he used those attributes as effectively as any person ever has in Australian politics. He was a great mate to many of us in the Labor Party, and mateship was all&amp;hyphen;important to Mick Young. It was the Labor movement, in which Mick Young had so much faith, where he was most admired and most loved. Mick Young was a very great son of Labor. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Mary; his daughter, Janine; his son, Michael; and all his family, his many friends and comrades. Mick, from all of us in the Labor Party, thanks.

        Mick Young was elected to the House of Representatives from Port Adelaide in 1974 and held the seat for 14 years. He held a variety of ministerial appointments. He also held the post of minister for immigration, where he made a great contribution. He was also the Special Minister of State, and he oversaw significant changes in the electoral act. He also served as Leader of the House for five years and was highly regarded for the leadership and tactical skills he demonstrated in that role. He had a quick wit, a wonderful turn of phrase and impressive debating skills that he had developed, no doubt, in the shearing sheds and later in the party organisation. His use of humour, whilst not malicious, was nevertheless a very effective weapon in the parliamentary bearpits.

        I met Mick some 30 years ago. The night he died I was having dinner with John Rau in Adelaide and we both commented on the fact that for us there was probably very little we could remember in terms of life in politics before we met Mick Young in the mid to late sixties. Clyde Cameron quite often used to joke about the fact that he and Mick first came across me when I was still wearing shorts. That highlighted the fact that we had known each other for quite a long time and knew each other in a way that rarely happens in politics, certainly not as often as it should.

I had worked for him during that period. I had worked for him in some of the portfolios that he held. We also worked together in South Australia on national campaigns and in the area of Port Adelaide. During Mick's tenure of the seat of Port Adelaide, Port

        To sum it up, very few had a greater influence on my life at the start and continuing over the decades than Mick Young. Together with Clyde Cameron, he helped me win endorsement and, together with people like Don Dunstan and Gough Whitlam, he helped mould the attitudes of not just me but so many people like me who came through the Labor movement in the late sixties and early seventies. He kept on working at it. He kept on being there at the other end of the phone, whether you expected him to ring or not, with some thought, some advice, some contribution that he felt should be made on the direction of government.

        He taught me lots but he also taught the Labor Party a lot. We were in government for more than 16 of the last 25 years. The genesis of much of this came in the late sixties and early seventies. As Senator Faulkner mentioned, the critical turning point for Labor was the `Its time' campaign at the start of the seventies. Mick was there at the creation of that campaign. He is attributed as being the creator of it.

        The attitude of, in a sense, nothing being too good for the shearer, for the worker, for the Labor movement was something that drove him on through the seventies, eighties and nineties and he maintained his close liaison with government after he retired. The same attitude of tolerance of youth and inclusiveness, which led him to be a core part of Labor success in South Australia for the time that he was involved there and for a while thereafter, is something that I am sure we will strive to get back as we resurrect our fortunes.

Mick was a very important character in the Port Adelaide area and, to have any credibility in that respect, association with the Port Adelaide football club, which Mick had had for a long time, was important.

        His involvement with soccer, as chairman of the South Australian Soccer Federation, was something he took up in a full sense after he retired from parliament.

He awarded scholarships to those who otherwise would not have been able to pay to get through school and tertiary education.

Don't they know they're Australians, they're Australian citizens?' It was that sort of latent justice that he was concerned about. He was concerned, for instance, when the Vietnamese community was condemned for a murder for which they have not been tried.

        As for his life, I suppose I was either fortunate or unfortunate to be there at the end.

Kim at that stage had spent the best part of two or three days in Mick's hospital room. I flew down from Central Queensland and was able to see Mick on Saturday night and on Sunday morning, the day before he died.

He had what is rare these days—an ability to actually see the heart of a problem and express it in a way which devastated his critics or his target and gained a laugh from all sides of the chamber, and often the victim of his remarks as well. Wit is probably the most devastating political weapon anyone can have, and Mick had it in abundance.

        Mick was a shrewd judge of character, a shrewd judge of policy and politics and a person who always remained in touch with the ordinary Australian. He could express the view from the street and the view of the grassroots of the common Australian and do it succinctly and well and in a way in which policy could be moved to reflect those views. Very few people have that ability. He was an advocate for the underdog. That remained a defining characteristic of his personality for all of his life.

        People have commented on Mick's ability as a connoisseur of Chinese food. I believe it was a taste he acquired when he, with Whitlam, first went to China and was part of the original expedition that opened China to Australia as the bamboo curtain was penetrated, before the 1972 election, in the lead-up to that election and as China was coming out from its isolation in the world. Following upon the American effort, Australia then made that contact. Mick had many friends in the Chinese bureaucracy at the very highest of levels. They are generous in their acknowledgment of him. He never conceded any policy positions but he always approached them on the basis of seeking a genuine understanding of their position—a rapprochement in the world for that nation. I think many in that country will miss him.

He was a creative thinker—a creative thinker in many respects in the working class cause—a resourceful and intelligent person and a great strategist and tactician. I regard him as the self-taught typical example of a working&amp;hyphen;class intellectual who had a strong commitment to working&amp;hyphen;class socialism and socialist ideology and who always sought to apply that in a modern way.

        From shearer to cabinet minister, Mick stayed true to his values and the people he represented. Mick was loyal and committed to the industrial and political cause of Labor.

Mick worked with Whitlam to improve the structure and responsiveness of the party. In the newer areas of public policy such as multiculturalism and indigenous reconciliation, Mick was more than just interested. As Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs he raised the profile of these issues within the Labor Party.

         It is true to say that Mick was a bridge between the old and new Labor eras. How ever, he really facilitated the opportunity for Labor to be broadly based and in government. Mick modernised the Labor Party after the devastating era which was dominated by the split. He took our party from a rigid organisation, which was at the time rather inward looking, to a positive, broadly democratic, inclusive party. He was one of the greatest federal officials we have had.

        After he left parliament, Mick was still called upon to give advice and support to Labor all around Australia. He happily contributed to the party until he died, never losing faith and never publicly attacking the party. Like everyone, he may have had problems with different aspects of policy from time to time, but he never used this to get publicity. Indeed, he shunned publicity. And who could blame him? The media treated him and his family in an appalling way during the attacks on him that he had to endure. Mick was a target because he was such an effective parliamentary performer.

        Many people now would not remember what the Labor Party was like in the mid&amp;hyphen;1960s—a narrow, parochial, sectarian inward&amp;hyphen;looking party bedevilled by states rights and bitter personal feuds going back over two or three decades. In that period there were three people who rebuilt the Labor Party. One of them was Gough Whitlam, the second was Don Dunstan and the third in the great trifecta was Mick Young.

        Mick Young has been given great recognition for the `It's Time' campaign of 1972, and I fully endorse the remarks made in that regard. He should also be given great recognition for creating the Dunstan decade of the 1970s. It was Mick Young in the late 1960s who, in helping to modernise the party at the state level, put together the campaign that led to the Labor Party not only ending the Playford era of 33 years but also ending the gerrymander in South Australia that had kept Labor out of office for so long.

        I do not think that people, in commenting about the Labor Party of the late 1960s, really recognise the change that Mick Young made to the way the party operated. Until the 1969 national conference, which is a long time ago now, national conferences of the Labor Party were held in camera and there were always arguments about `faceless men'. In 1963 Bob Menzies successfully used the national conference tag of `the faceless men of the Labor Party' to help win the election campaign in 1963.

         When Mick became national secretary, he said that the party conference should be opened up to the media and to anybody who wanted to come along and sit in and listen to the debates and see that the delegates debating the great issues were fellow Australians. I did not attend the 1969 conference, but as a party supporter I remember watching with some astonishment and then pride as Mick arranged a direct telecast from the floor of the 1969 national conference on the then

Mick said, `We'll have the debate openly and people can see the arguments,' and it was broadcast live on television, one of the first live political broadcasts across Australia. That was indicative of Mick's vision about how politics should be played and promoted in Australia.

         Mick Young gave me my biggest break in politics. In 1969, when he became national secretary as well as state secretary, he was going to have to spend a lot of time out of Adelaide and so he convinced the party they should elect a temporary organiser to work for the forthcoming federal campaign in 1969 and for the subsequent state election campaign which was due some time in 1970. I was 22 years of age and Mick Young convinced me that I should run in a ballot amongst others to be elected to that position for a temporary period as a full&amp;hyphen;time state organiser.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would not have been elected without Mick Young's support. He rounded up the numbers as only he could do it. He convinced some very old trade union officials that they should vote for a 22&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old, very callow, inexperienced youth. He did it very well: I won in the first ballot in the Labor Party and became a state organiser. It was from that step forward into the party organisation that any subsequent successes I have had in the Labor Party have come. They have grown from that initial support from Mick.

When there was wreckage all around the Labor Party, Mick Young was the first to ring at 7 o'clock that morning to have a chat with me, advise me and provide a morale boost and assistance on how to get on with the job of rebuilding the Labor Party. In one term, we got the Labor Party back into office in 1982.

         Others have mentioned Mick's success as a minister. The Electoral Act amendments he put through in 1984 have meant that we in Australia now have one of the most modern and sophisticated electoral acts, one that guarantees the participation and the support of the community in an electoral system that is as democratic, open and fair as it could possibly be. One of the things Mick always committed himself to, going right back to the 1960s when he first became national secretary, was the introduction of public funding for political parties. That was his major achievement in the 1984 act, including of course the introduction of `one vote, one value'. Even though the introduction of public funding was strongly opposed by the opposition, they now accept that it has many merits and means that all sides get a fair go to put their political view without having to worry about where the money comes from or being beholden to sectional interests.

         I, like others, would also pay compliment to Mick in his work in the community, particularly in Port Adelaide. From the day he got preselection to Port Adelaide unopposed by the party—which was no mean feat, as it is one of the safest seats in Australia—he put
         <break page="43" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          his stamp on that area and was identified as `Mr Port Adelaide' even though his family had spent three generations living there.

On the front page of the Adelaide

          was Gough Whitlam, Prime Minister of Australia, wearing a Port Adelaide football jumper and the banner headline read, `Mick Young's trainer'. That did much to cement the image of Mick's being Mr Port Adelaide. But it was not just a matter of glib publicity; there was also what he did in the electorate, hearing what the people were speaking about, delivering services and arguing for those in areas that were in great need.

         An aspect about Mick that I personally found rather daunting was his extraordinary breadth of interest in all sorts of issues. Others have commented about his love of literature, art, films, music and theatre. In all of those areas, Mick was a participant, a consumer. Others have mentioned as well, and I can confirm it, that Mick was a great bar room singer. He could sing with great passion the Irish songs of independence, but one he used to sing very well indeed was the great organising song,

         . To my great envy, I cannot sing a note to save myself, but Mick Young could. Mick Young could also quote poetry. He could quote script from books and he could advise you on what books to read. Those are great personal memories that I have of Mick.

          Mick was always capable of having a quick one&amp;hyphen;liner in politics that got to the nub of an issue. I remember the time of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan when the Liberal Prime Minister of the day announced sanc tions against the Russian government because of their invasion. Mick Young pointed out that Malcolm Fraser's wool was still being sold to the Russians. He had this phrase which summed it up and was a great political phrase: Malcolm's wool keeps the Russians warm. It was a great political example of a one&amp;hyphen;liner that could capture the essence, whether you agreed with the phrase or not.

         He could often use one&amp;hyphen;liners against himself.

I think that just killed half the argument. He was able to use those one&amp;hyphen;liners—of which I have great envy; I think most of us do—and was able to pull them off the cuff at the flick of a finger and devastate a political opponent. That is why he was one of the great performers, not only in the parliament, but in politics in Australia.

We talked overwhelmingly about the election campaign. Mick, with his usual savvy, was able to predict the result pretty accurately, unfortunately for us. He was talking about how, if we lost the election, we would need to rebuild and get on and how the party would need to keep its morale and spirit together. That is what Mick's whole life was about. The Labor Party—the Labor movement—was the one organisation in this country that he was absolutely dedicated to.

        There are a few comments that I want to add. First of all, I recognise Mick as a very astute politician. He did not know how to be other than very good at politics. He had a great nose for things political. He could smell a problem a mile off and he could see the right solution very quickly. As others have spelt out in a variety of different ways, he had the capacity to see that solution implemented, not just because he could see what had to be done but because he could draw on that extraordinary network he had of friends, political contacts, union and branch members and so on. He could speak to all of them, as all colleagues have said. He could ring at any time. You knew if Mick Young was calling it was a conversation to take seriously and you could also trust his judgment. Because of that network of friends, he was able to regularly call on people and then trust them to respond. His political instinct was based on a huge network of friends, genuine contact, inclusive involvement and that warmth and affection he had built up.

        Politics, for Mick Young, was almost a style of living. It was not just something you did when you went to work. It was not just something that happened around the Labor Party.

         One of the other things I remember about Mick Young is that whenever he spoke in any debate or argument he left you with two or three punchy lines, the pithy summation of the arguments that you could then use your self to make the case, to make the same point over and over. He had a very rare capacity. Perhaps it was, as Senator Schacht has said, that he left you with those grab lines that were not just clever comments but also were about capturing the kernel of the argument. None of us could remember them as well as Mick could say them, even if we wrote them down and rehearsed them, and of course we did not have his judgment about exactly how and when to introduce them.

There were very few people to match Mick in the chair of any meeting at all. As chair of the Labor Party's national conference, he had the challenge of trying to read that pretty fraught and complex body of people. In one particular conference, when the centre and the Left combined on an issue to defeat the Right, Graham Richardson was at pains—

All of a sudden, Mr Chairman had to say, `Your time's up, Graham'. There was not an extension of time, but Mick said, `Yes, your time's up Graham, but you're doing so well and it's so entertaining, keep going.' With that great line, Mick managed to make everybody burst out laughing, and the venom of the attack was completely lost.

         Mick Young is not to be marked as a malicious man; indeed, he was anything but. He was devastating, exacting, precise, but not malicious. He always had a great sense of humour. We have heard that said again and again. His humour was not just about being right in his timing or witty with his comment; he loved to tell a great joke and he told them particularly well.

         He told a lovely story which picked up on his passion for things to do with art.

He enjoyed the company and the personal friendship of painters like Fred Williams. On one occasion when Mick and his wife Mary were having a meal with Fred Williams at the kitchen table, Clyde Cameron came calling. Mick said, `Let me introduce the painter, Fred Williams'.

Mick's political sense knew that if you were serious about including a variety of people in the parliamentary and political process, you included women. The battle to see that some of us had an opportunity and to shepherd us into the political arena was fought by Mick just as strongly and he argued with just as much passion as he did for any of the other issues that he took up.

         Senator Schacht made the point that he stands here today because of Mick Young and that he owes a lot of his success to Mick Young. That is very true for me. It is very important to acknowledge that Mick was far ahead of his time in this regard, as he was in so many other things. I regret that I shall never be able to speak to or see Mick Young again and I join with all other honourable senators in passing on condolences to Mary and his family.

         —It is a privilege to, and with sadness that, I rise to contribute to this condolence motion with respect to the late Michael Young. It is a privilege because I, like so many thousands of other people, have known Mick Young and enjoyed his company for many, many years. It is sad because, as Senator Schacht and others have noted, Mick died at a relatively young age. He still had much to contribute, to both the Australian Labor Party and the community. Others have spoken and covered adequately Mick's contribution to the Australian Labor Party and to the parliament, although we could probably go on for much longer.

          To ALP members of my generation, Mick Young stands beside Gough Whitlam as the prime mover in re-establishing the ALP in the national political arena after

           23 years in the wilderness. Mick Young made the Australian Labor Party a party that young people in the late 1960s and early 1970s would support and would join. I recall how thousands of young people around Australia, whether on university campuses or at the large rallies, were stirred by the `It's Time' theme of the 1972 election campaign. As has been noted, Mick was the architect of that campaign, which will always be remembered in Australian political history as the pinnacle of election campaigns.

        Mick, along with Gough, had some years earlier commenced the process of rebuilding the ALP as a modern, forward thinking and outward looking social democratic party. One significant element of that process, amongst so many, was Mick's role in the establishment of dialogue and, later, diplomatic relations with China, which showed at that time political courage and an ability to move beyond the status quo.

        Whilst others have spoken and referred to Mick's contributions within the party, in the parliament and in the community, I just wish to dwell on Mick's role in the union movement, particularly the Australian Workers Union. I first met Mick Young in my capacity as an official of the AWU. I cannot recall exactly when it was but it was quite a number of years ago. Mick was a person whom, when you met him for the first time, you actually felt you had known for years. He had that rare quality, so often associated with the Irish, of being instantly friendly, of being instantly likeable—a person you wanted to continue to know and whose company you wanted to be in.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mick first joined the Australian Workers Union in 1952 when he commenced shearing at the age of 15. He went to shear in western New South Wales, an area where shearing is hard, is tough, is backbreaking work. As we all know, shearing, until recent times, was work that often required men to spend long periods away from home, away from the comforts of the cities and towns, and that was particularly true of western New South Wales and other far outback areas of Australia. It was an industry in which unionism and the Labor movement were at their strongest. Mick
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         played a leading role in the great campaigns in the shearing industry in the 1950s, particularly in 1956, when the union and the members fought and won the battle to retain the rates of pay in the shearing industry, the rates of pay which the employers at that time sought to reduce.

        Mick quickly demonstrated his great organising skills and within six years had been recruited by the union as an organiser. He worked in the Port Pirie region and whilst Mick's career in the AWU as an official was relatively short—he then went on to work for the ALP—he nevertheless gained a reputation as a great advocate for the working class, for the union, for the battlers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mick remained a member of the AWU for the rest of his life. He was, and still is, regarded as one of its finest and most popular sons. Wherever he went, he was held in the highest regard by the officials and by the membership of the AWU. I can tell you that is not easily achieved in the Australian Workers Union but Mick was one of the very few who was liked, indeed loved, by all within the union. He was awarded life membership of the AWU in 1993.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I recall the AWU's centenary celebrations in Ballarat in 1986. Mick was the master of ceremonies and in the main street of Ballarat he gave a shearing demonstration to a crowd of about 2,000 people. It was obvious that Mick was a person that ordinary people loved to be around. They were not there just because it was a demonstration of shearing; they were there because it was Mick Young who hopped up on the back of a truck and demonstrated the skills he had acquired and still retained.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mick always seemed to be the MC or the guest of honour at any AWU or ALP function. I do not think I recall ever going to a function where Mick did not get asked to speak, to chair the meeting or to be the MC. It was obvious why that was the case. Mick had all the necessary qualities: he was a great speaker, he was a tremendous raconteur, he had wit, he had charm and he had the ability to make an audience listen to his every word be it serious or humorous. As Senator Schacht
        <break page="47" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         has informed us, he even had the ability to make people listen to him when he sang.

        Just as people loved to be around Mick, so did he delight in the company of other people. It did not matter who you were, the highest office holder or a mere average person in the community, Mick always treated you with equal friendliness. As Brian Johns so appropriately noted when he gave the eulogy at the service in St Mary's cathedral: `To know Mick was to be welcome to a place at his table and no&amp;hyphen;one was more important than anyone else.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mick had great humility. He could keep you entertained and enthralled as he spoke or related stories, but he never talked about himself. He was never one to boast or to push his own barrow, notwithstanding his many great achievements. I will always remember with fondness the occasions that I spent in Mick's company in recent years after he had moved to Sydney, both as a member of parliament and also in my previous role as the General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union. Whether it was at Harpoon Harry's, Machiavelli's or any number of other restaurants, you not only enjoyed Mick's company but you also appreciated his advice and friendship. If you could not make lunch with Mick, and unfortunately we will not be able to any longer, you could always try to get a table beneath his photo at Machiavelli's Restaurant in Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, I particularly appreciated his advice. It was always constructive and it was always worth while, and other speakers have noted that when you got a phone call from Mick you knew that it was going to be an opportunity to listen and to learn. The ALP and the union movement will certainly miss that advice and assistance as we commence the task of regaining government. I was told by his son, Michael, who works for the Australian Workers Union and whom I had the privilege of working with in the union, that in the weeks after the recent election, when Mick knew he was dying, he was still on the telephone giving advice to people in the party. That demonstrates real commitment.

       A recent trend, noted in the IMB's latest report is an increase in the ferocity of pirate attacks. This trend, combined with the reported increase in the tendency of pirates to be more heavily armed, means that the risk to seafarers' lives is increasing.
