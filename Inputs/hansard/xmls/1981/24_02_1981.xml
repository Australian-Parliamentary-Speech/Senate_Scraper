       That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 7 January 1981 of the Honourable Eric Laidlaw Robinson, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of McPherson from 1972 and a Minister of the Crown from 1975 to 1980; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Eric Robinson was born in Brisbane on 18 January 1929. He was educated at the Church of England Grammar School in Brisbane and later at the Slade School in Warwick. After leaving school he enjoyed a very successful career with his family's sporting goods business where he displayed the qualities which were later to equip him so well for public office. In the political arena Eric Robinson made a great contribution to his party, his State and the nation. Prior to entering Parliament he was President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party from 1968 to 1973. This was a period of great change and development for the Party in Queensland. Eric Robinson worked untiringly in the interests of the Liberal Party. His efforts in Queensland, particularly at the organisational level, will not be forgotten. No one could doubt the strength and courage of his convictions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Eric Robinson was elected to Parliament for the Division of McPherson in 1972; he was re-elected on four subsequent occasions. His considerable abilities were recognised early in his parliamentary career and he contributed significantly to the successful functioning of the Opposition during the period 1972 to 1975. Upon entering government in 1975 Eric Robinson became Minister for the Capital Territory. From 1976 to 1977 he was Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. He was Minister for Finance from 1977 to 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       Eric Robinson administered each of his portfolios with energy, commitment and concern. Whilst he was always a fearless advocate of the policies and proposals he considered to be right, he was always willing to consider the other person's viewpoint. He possessed great natural charm and dignity. He was a man of the highest personal and political integrity. As such he won the warm respect of members on both sides of the Parliament. The loss of Eric Robinson, a man in the prime of his life and with much still to contribute to the life of his nation, is indeed a tragedy. To his widow, Narelle, and the other members of his family we offer our deepest sympathy in the loss they have sustained.

        —The Opposition joins with Senator Carrick and the Government in paying tribute to the late Eric Robinson. His career, both in business and later in Liberal Party politics, showed him to be a man of considerable drive, energy and dedication. It is interesting to record that in 1963 he is said to have invited 18 friends to his home to form the Surfers Paradise branch of the Liberal Party and that he left that branch as the largest Liberal Party branch in Australia. I make that observation simply because he was throughout his political career very much a party man. In Federal politics he was instrumental, it is said, in the rise of both Mr McMahon, as he then was, and Mr Fraser to Liberal Party leadership. After being Minister for the Capital Territory he was promoted to the position of Minister for Post and Telecommunications and then more recently to Minister for Finance.

      <para>
       Whilst those of us on this side of the Senate were not always sympathetic with the general political outlook of the late Eric Robinson, we were all able to recognise that he was a man who had the courage of his convictions and a great independence of mind. The findings of the McGregor royal commission stand as testimony to his integrity. Amongst his ministerial achievements for which he will be remembered are the setting up of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as an independent body to preside over the broadcasting industry in Australia, his dedication to the notion of taking broadcasting out of politics and his belief that the public interest was best served by having a system of regulation of the ownership of broadcasting stations. He will also be remembered as a Minister for his support to this chamber's first Aboriginal member. That support, which I understand was significant, was not only successful but also characteristically courageous. Such a man will be missed by his friends, who deeply respected him as a man of courage, integrity and personal charm. The Opposition extends its sympathy to his widow and family.

It is a shame that such a man's period on this planet should be cut so short. Mr Robinson was indeed an accomplished member of the community in which he lived. He was a man of very great conviction and dedication to those things in which he believed so strongly. His dedication and conviction were evidenced in the part he played in both the organisational and parliamentary areas of politics. Once again, I can only offer my personal sympathy and my party's sympathy to Mr Robinson's widow and his family in their great loss.

       Politically, he and I were always as wide apart as two persons could be. Even within the framework of the Liberal Party, when I was a member of that party, we would differ philosophically on almost all issues; but that never at any time hindered the very deep and lasting friendship that the two of us formed. During his lifetime I was incredibly impressed with his sense of service. We know that he was a very successful businessman. Quite often he ridiculed the low remuneration of members of parliament and Ministers of the Crown in particular-a view with which I heartily concur. He was a great campaigner for justice to be done in this area, not because of his own position-we know that he was a relatively wealthy man-but because he saw as absurd the fact that he had to pay the managers whom he had to appoint to his private business in order to keep it going more than he was receiving as a Minister of the Crown. He pointed out that absurdity time and time again.

       Eric Robinson was a man who was capable of many voluntary and involuntary kindnesses to both friend and foe alike. Typical is the time when I was not included in the Fraser Ministry when the Fraser Government was returned in 1975. One of the first people to knock on my door and enter my office to extend his sympathy was Eric Robinson. He was a man of great compassion, a man of courage and a very kind and gentle man. I also want to put on record my deep sympathy for his wonderful wife Narelle and his family.

        —On behalf of my Queensland colleagues and myself I join the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) and those who have spoken to this condolence motion for the late Eric Robinson. I will be eternally grateful for the friendship that was extended to me by Eric Robinson and his sweet and loving wife Narelle. Eric Robinson was a man of high integrity. He was honest and sincere in everything he undertook. He became the President of the Liberal Party in Queensland in 1968, when it was going through a rather traumatic experience. It was the dedication, sincerity and hard work of Eric Robinson that brought the members of the Liberal Party together and welded them into a very strong and viable force. It was in 1963, after the State election, that he formed the first branch of the Liberal Party on the Gold Coast. He was elected to Federal Parliament in 1972 because of his hard work and dedication not only to the Liberal Party but also to all people in Queensland. I believe that the Liberal Party in Queensland owes a great debt of gratitude to the hard work, the sincerity and the courage of the late Eric Robinson. There are those who will say that he was elected on Democratic Labor Party preferences, but the DLP supported him because that Party and its members had such a high regard for his honesty and his integrity.

       Mr President, I want to clear up a point here today. It has been reported a number of times since Eric Robinson's death that I beat him for preselection to fill the casual Senate vacancy in 1972. That is not true because Eric Robinson did not nominate for preselection. Therefore, what has been reported in the Press is quite inaccurate. I well recall, Mr President, the night of that preselection when I won endorsement by the Liberal Party. With my wife, my daughter, and my son and his wife, I was taken into the office of the General Secretary of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, Mr Keith Livingstone. Mr Eric Robinson spoke to us and congratulated me. Whatever Eric Robinson endeavoured to do he did well. After congratulating me and talking to me for a short time, he said: 'Neville, we in the Liberal Party are proud to have you as our endorsed candidate to fill this casual vacancy. But let me give you one little piece of advice. Neville, it must be done well'. That was Eric Robinson. Anything he undertook to do he did well, to the best of his ability. He put everything he had into it and he was ably supported by a sweet and loving wife, Narelle.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I said earlier, Mr President, I shall be eternally grateful for his friendship and for the encouragement that he gave me on many occasions, as he did so many people in my State of Queensland, not only in the Liberal Party but also outside the Party-people he got to know and people he worked with and became friends with. He was the kind of man to whom one could go at any time of the day or night for counselling or for guidance; he would willingly give that. The day when Eric Robinson was called home by our loving God was a sad one not only for the Liberal Party in Queensland but also for the people of Queensland and, I believe, for the people of this nation. He contributed much in his lifetime and he had much more to contribute. Mr President, each day you say the Lord's Prayer. You say: 'Thy will be done'. That was the case when He called Eric Robinson home to glory. On my own behalf and on behalf of my Queensland colleagues, I extend our deepest sympathies to Eric's wife and family. Let me say finally, sir, that I was proud to know him.

        —Mr President, in the savagery of Australian politics much was said of Eric Robinson which was unfair and much was done to him which he did not deserve. It is a great pity that he is not able to hear the many things that are being said of him now-those things which he truly deserved. He is not able to spurn-I doubt that he would do so-those who now see him in a far better light. Eric Robinson was a man of compassion, and I experienced that compassion some 12 months ago when I was ill. He was one of the first to brush aside the barriers which kept visitors away and he came to offer me his assistance. I regret that his illness was so complete and so finite that I was not able to respond. Although he was diametrically opposed to me politically and philosophically, I came to know him and to be friendly with him. He did not need to do the things that he did. For instance, he did not need to come to my assistance when I was under pressure in Queensland in regard to the civil liberties campaign, but he did so. For that reason I extend my words of sympathy to his widow and to his family. I knew the father well and I came to know the son well; they were in the same mould.

       Aboriginal Rights Treaty

      <para>
       whereas it has been the practice of nations established in territories previously occupied by indigenous inhabitants to reach a negotiated settlement with those inhabitants, and
      </para>
      <para>
       whereas that occupation has seriously damaged the traditional way of life of Aboriginal Australians and has caused poverty and hardship to be the fate of the great majority of their surviving descendants, and
      </para>
      <para>
       whereas the surviving descendants of the Aboriginal peoples have expressed a wish to have their rights to land acknowledged, to preserve their link with their Aboriginal ancestors and to maintain their distinctive identity with its own cultural heritage, and
      </para>
      <para>
       whereas the people of Australia in 1967 voted overwhelmingly that the Commonwealth Parliament should have responsibility for laws relating to Aboriginal Australians, and
      </para>
      <para>
       whereas it is accepted internationally by the United Nations organisation, that each country should work to establish the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination, non-discrimination and the enjoyment of their own culture, and
      </para>
      <para>
       whereas the Woodward Commission in 1974 established principles by which Aboriginal rights to land should be acknowledged and realised, and
      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government should invite the Aboriginal people of Australia to negotiate a Treaty with the Commonwealth of Australia, and any Treaty should contain provisions relating to the following matters: (i) The protection of Aboriginal identity, languages, law and culture, (ii) The recognition and restoration of rights to land by applying, throughout Australia, the recommendations of the Woodward Commission, (iii) The conditions governing mining and exploitation of other natural resources on Aboriginal land, (iv) Compensation to Aboriginal Australians for the loss of traditional lands and for damage to those lands and to their traditional way of life, (v) The right of Aboriginal Australians to control their own affairs and to establish their own associations for this purpose.

The time of greatest industrial strife in Australia was when a present member of the Australian Labor Party in another place was both the Federal President of the ALP and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a Labor government was in power. The conjunction of all those skills produced the worst industrial strife in Australia. Nevertheless, it is vital that coal and other energy products be provided to the world markets. It is vital that there be continuity of supply. There is no doubt that any protracted industrial unrest will make the preparation of contracts difficult. It is a worrying thing. I believe that a major problem for Australia in the years immediately ahead will be to find a practical and permanent solution to the causes of industrial unrest.

        Since the 1 January, 1981, any handicapped person of pensionable age admitted to an institution run by the State will receive the princely sum of $17.80 a fortnight to buy clothes, personal effects, toiletries, to spend on any outings and to save for long range events such as holidays.

        Will the Minister inform the Senate why the pension received by such handicapped residents has been reduced from $44.80 to $17.80 a fortnight when at the same time the amount for maintenance going to the State has been increased from $93.40 to $120.40 a fortnight? Will he also inform the Senate what improvements in board might be effected as a result of the increased maintenance being paid to the State institutions? Does the Minister agree that the main goal of these institutions should be the rehabilitation of its handicapped residents into community living? Does the Minister also agree that in this the International Year of Disabled Persons the Government must take the lead if it is to achieve an enlightened attitude by the public towards handicapped people? If so, will he assure the Senate that consideration will be given to removing this Commonwealth-State arrangement which makes the rehabilitation of handicapped people living in State institutions even more difficult?

         —The honourable senator did provide me with a copy of the letter which appeared in the Australian but I had in fact seen it when it was published on 9 February. The matters raised in the letter in fact relate to charges which are made in State institutions in Queensland and relate to the net income which is available to invalid pensioners after they meet those charges. I think many honourable senators would be aware that the level of those charges is determined by the State and does not come within the Social Security portfolio. On the other hand, the social security legislation which applies to benevolent institutions does provide that where a pensioner is living in an approved benevolent home an amount equal to 87 1/2 per cent of the pension should be paid directly to the home in respect of his care and accommodation. In fact there are no benevolent homes in Queensland which are caught by that legislation but the State Government has tied the charges made in State nursing homes to the level specified for benevolent homes under the Commonwealth legislation. In fact, it is Commonwealth policy to achieve as great a uniformity as possible in the charges levied in respect of long term nursing home patients.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Whilst the matter of these charges referred to in the letter and referred to by Senator Missen in his question is a matter for the State, it is a fact that there is no uniformity of charging among benevolent homes, non-government nursing homes, public hospitals and most State nursing homes. The point which I think is the central point of Senator Missen's question is whether the charges and the amount which is left for the people concerned are in line with their need for rehabilitation. That is a particular point to which I have not given consideration. It may be that different considerations ought to apply in the circumstances of those institutions. In the case where full board and lodgings are in effect being provided in other forms of institutions, perhaps for the very old people who are in them, it may well be quite appropriate. Perhaps for others it is not. I will examine that aspect of the honourable senator's question and see whether I should add to that reply.

This year a total of $4.5m is being made available on a dollar for dollar basis to each of the three States for urgent works recommended in the Maunsell report's plan to deal with salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley. In addition, two amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act which were made last year to liberalise income tax concessions to land owners in respect of expenditure on water conservation and conveyance and salinity control and drainage should provide an invaluable financial incentive to landowners to deal with salinity problems at their source. The Government also strongly supports the completion of a new River Murray Waters Agreement, mainly to give the River Murray Commission water quality responsibilities in its operations and investigations. The draft new agreement currently under examination includes provisions for the Commission to make recommendations to the States on water quality objectives and, where appropriate, standards for various locations on the river.

        As Senator Teague will be aware, on 12 February I convened a meeting of State Ministers responsible for water conservation matters. At the meeting progress towards a new River Murray Waters Agreement was particularly good. A few issues still remain unresolved. They have been taken back by State Ministers to their respective governments. I very much hope that it will be possible to produce a new agreement without much longer delay and that there will be matching Commonwealth and State legislation. I should emphasise that the issue of licences on tributaries of the Murray, except those above Albury, is the sole responsibility of State governments. The Commonwealth has no intention of interfering or exerting pressure in this matter. Rather, our main concern is to accelerate the completion of a new River Murray Waters Agreement which will give the River Murray Commission some water quality responsiblities.

What procedures will be adopted arising from the draft report? Will there be discussions with the industry before that draft report is finally settled?

It has been known that the Industries Assistance Commission has been undertaking a study of this kind for some years now.

Consequently, the matter will be open for some time yet before the IAC delivers its report directly to the Government.

         —I did see the article in the Australian of 23 February to which the honourable senator referred. The proposal which he referred to was the result of a workshop staged by the Aboriginal and Island Catholic Council on 22 and 23 January. The workshop was an initiative of the black community and was sponsored at community request by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The workshop concentrated on suggestions and proposals for alternative schooling methods to deal with special problems facing inner city Aboriginal children, the children who do not attend school and who are constantly in trouble as a result of anti-social behaviour. As a result of that workshop, a steering committee has been set up to consider, as one option, the possibility of establishing a learning centre to provide for those children a desirable alternative to truancy and to attempt to help them reach a stage where they can join the mainstream of state education.

However, at this stage no firm proposal has been advanced. There is no indication that, if an additional educational facility of this type were to be provided for children with particular social and educational disadvantages, it would be limited to black children. My Department's role in this matter has been that of facilitator to enable interested groups to meet and discuss a social problem of mutual concern.
       </para>

        I finish by saying that if there are children who are not coping with the normal education system and for whom truancy is a way of life, if people want to suggest what might be appropriate alternative means of helping them and if those suggestions come from a meeting of Aboriginal people, they should not be rejected out of hand for that reason alone.

        Do I take it from that reply that the Minister has no knowledge of whether money appropriated by this Parliament is used for purposes other than that for which the Parliament appropriated it?

I think this question in a sense is supplementary to that asked by Senator Teague. Is the Minister aware that the average annual salt load entering South Australia, excluding the wet years of 1974-75 and 1975-76, was 1.1 million tonnes? Is he also aware that in the period from 6 August 1980 to 28 January 1981 approximately 115,000 tonnes of salt or 39 per cent of the salt load originated in the Darling system in New South Wales? As this is a vital issue in South Australia, will the Minister inform the Senate when the appropriate regulation or legislation will be introduced into Parliament to give the River Murray Commission control over water quality in the River Murray system?

Therefore, I acknowledge the significance of this question. I am not aware of the precise figures that Senator Jessop has given for the volume of salt. I am aware that it has been severe and of such a quantity as to cause grave concern. Senator Jessop referred to 39 per cent of salinity originating from the Darling. I can only say that of late I have read conflicting evidence, some of which challenges that assertion. In fact I have read a substantial argument that it is not so much the Darling as other sources that contribute to the volume of salt.

Whether or not that is so, the real significance is that there is salt in unacceptable volumes and it has to be dealt with. So I acknowledge the substance, the thrust, of the question. I said previously that the discussion with the relevant Ministers on 12 February reached a point at which one or possibly two really significant matters remained to be resolved. We asked the States to consider the first matter. I believe that with good will we can reach a solution which will mean that the River Murray Commission will have some capacity not only to monitor flow and quality but also to comment upon any actions of significance that might alter the quality or quantity of water. I assure Senator Jessop that this matter is very much in our minds at this moment. We are as eager as he is to see that this agreement is put in place as soon as possible.

On 22 September of last year the Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation would undertake an assessment of the effectiveness of aerial fire-fighting techniques and he invited the Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to nominate State officers to participate in the Commonwealth-funded study. Whilst some indicated that there were doubts about the effectiveness of fire-bombing techniques in conditions pertaining to their States, they all agreed to participate. The CSIRO study will not be just a demonstration of fire-bombing techniques but a thorough scientific assessment of the effectiveness of bombing fires of varying intensities with water and fire-retarding chemicals. The CSIRO will compare this technique with conventional fire-fighting methods and will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of bushfire suppression methods.

The Commonwealth and Victoria will share the costs equally, and the CSIRO will be able to take full advantage of these trials and operations to collect data on bushfire behaviour and control.

        I should add, however, that the Commonwealth will not confine its contribution to alleviating the problem by those means only. It will make available Defence Force equipment and personnel to assist State agencies. The value of this assistance has been amply demonstrated this summer in bushfires in two States, New South Wales and Victoria. The Commonwealth also provides funds through the national disaster assistance arrangements. These actions complement those by the States. The question which Senator Archer has raised is one of continuing interest. I will ensure that as information becomes available he is provided with it.

         —There is a variety of different answers, depending upon the particular hydrocarbons in question. I shall answer in terms of crude oil itself which is the source of the hydrocarbons and therefore the available source for refining to produce on-the-spot supplies. Australia is seeking to improve upon what has been an IEA-International Energy Agency-goal of stock for some 70 to 80 days. We hope to get to, say, 90 days. Because we have Bass Strait, the best way of storing crude oil is in indigenous wells, provided that disaster or industrial unrest does not disturb it. In general we have been able to reach the equivalent of some 70 days stocks.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is a variety of answers in relation to the remainder of the hydrocarbons. My Department published yesterday the first of a series of monthly statistics which showed, for example, a decline, I think in January, in the gasoline stocks compared with the same period last year. That had a lot to do with industrial conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The stocks of refined products are not as significant in terms of the number of days if one can be assured of two things-that there will not be industrial unrest and that there will not be damage to refineries. We have set out on a policy of asking the companies to increase their storage on both the crude side and the product side of the refinery and in particular products. Today we have overcome the shortage of avgas. We do not have to import it. In fact, we are producing a surplus of avgas. We have good stocks available.
       </para>
       <para>
        The significant challenge to us at the moment is to produce more distillate, which is the fuel in greatest demand and which we need to have adequate stocks of, but at the same time not to produce a surplus of gasolene. My answer to Senator MacGibbon's question is that we would hope to publish statistics monthly. The stocks held by companies have been regarded as confidential. Some pressure has been but upon us by Senate committees-I think by Senator Thomas's committee in particular-to reveal the figures. We are doing so. I think that is good for the public dialogue. If there are specific stocks of products which Senator MacGibbon is interested in I would be happy to furnish him with the information he requires.

That is a matter which is being examined in more detail at the moment. All projects which were being funded at the beginning of the year, as I understand it, are continuing to be funded on the basis on which funding was originally agreed. The questions which are arising are questions as to the funding of new projects. In this respect I intend to make no decisions until the position in respect of the present commitments is clarified and until I have had a chance to examine the total new claims which are likely to be made on the program, and they are considerable. There is therefore likely to be a delay of some time before any new commitments are entered into.

         —On Friday last, 20 February, Mr John Kerr, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, retired. Mr Kerr began his public service with the New South Wales Department of Lands in 1936. In 1949 he began his reporting career with the Commonwealth Reporting Service in Sydney. He entered parliamentary service in 1950 when he was appointed as a reporter on the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. Mr Kerr progressed through the ranks of Hansard and was appointed Principal Parliamentary Reporter in 1978. In 1942 Mr Kerr enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces. He later transferred to the Australian Imperial Force and saw service in Papua and New Guinea. Upon the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific he served for a short time in Australia assisting to gather and prepare evidence for presentation to the War Crimes Tribunal.

        In his leisure time Mr Kerr has been active as an author of both books and plays. Several of his books have been published and some have been adapted for broadcasting by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. His plays too have been broadcast by the ABC and some have been performed in public in Canberra. In his retirement Mr Kerr will not be idle; he will be pursuing tertiary studies at the Australian National University and will continue to write books and plays.

        I am sure all honourable senators join me in thanking John Kerr for his long and valued service to the Parliament. We wish him and his wife a long and rewarding retirement. Mr Kerr's successor as Principal Parliamentary Reporter is Mr James Roberts, whose assistant will be Mr John Campbell.

        —by leave-All honourable senators will have known Mr John Kerr and over the years will have been indebted to him-as well as to his staff-for many kindnesses, and for his dedication and skill in his duties. It comes to me as a surprise that Mr Kerr should have journeyed in life to a point of retirement. He seemed to me to have retained a very youthful vigour and indeed to be perennial, and I think all of us would have agreed. His retirement gives us the opportunity to pay our tribute, as we do too rarely, to members of the Hansard staff for the very great skill and diligence they all practise and for their great courtesies to us all. How anyone can take down in shorthand what is frequently a very inarticulate discourse and with literary skill give it classic elegance is something we have all wondered at over the years. Perhaps the modern shorthand machine makes it easier.

       I have been privileged to know Mr Kerr and to enjoy his company over the years. I have been privileged to be the recipient of his service and skills. On behalf of the Government and, I am sure, all honourable senators, I want to say to him: 'Thank you very much indeed for a job well done during a career which has been wide and diverse in service to your country, both in peace and war, and for the contribution you have made through your very creative skills to the arts in the literary sphere'. It comes as no surprise to me that Mr Kerr will be going back to tertiary studies and that he will continue to write books and plays. May we wish him and his wife every happiness in their retirement. We know that he will certainly enjoy the busiest of retirements. May we also congratulate the new Principal Parliamentary Reporter, Mr James Roberts, and his assistant, Mr John Campbell, and wish them well.

I was reminded when Senator Carrick was speaking that Pirandello once wrote a play entitled Six characters in search of an Author.

        That the Senate take note of the paper.

       <para>
        I begin briefly by expressing my indebtedness to Senator Carrick for doing something to assuage my anger which I had in respect not only of him but also of Ministers generally this evening when it was brought home to me once again how absurd our procedure is in relation to these reports which are not made available as a matter of current practice, although it has been the case in the past. I understand they have been made available up to two hours before presentation. The Ombudsman's report is a document of some 215 pages. It raises a great many matters which I can now see are of real substantive significance. I have had it in my hands only a matter of minutes. Indeed, I would not have it in my hands at all were it not for the fortuitous circumstance that this report was tabled 20 minutes ago in the other place which makes it technically available to be obtained by honourable senators before it is presented in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        An absurd situation arises in respect of these reports. Senators, particularly Opposition senators, are obliged to make some response not days or weeks after the presentation of these reports but as a practical matter on the occasion of their tabling because that is when, obviously, they come to public significance. That is the occasion when it is necessary as a practical matter for some response to be made; not that it can ever be a very informed response with reports of this size. But, if it has not been our practice in recent years to make reports available-I see Senator Knight shaking his head and mumbling to that effect-I suggest that it ought to be the practice. It certainly has been the practice to make tabling statements available yet, in recent months, it has been increasingly less the practice for Ministers to make even tabling statements available. That has been my experience and that of my fellow front benchers. This matter demands attention. As I said, I am indebted to Senator Carrick for his expression of willingness to give, in fact, some consideration to this aspect perhaps in the context of a reference to the Senate Standing Orders Committe ultimately so we can get some rationality in what has long been an irrational aspect of our procedure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said all that there is obviously not much I can do by way of drawing attention to particular matters in the short time I have had available to look at the report. Two points stick out even on the very cursory opportunity I have had to look at the report. One has to do with a gentleman who will be well known to Senator Chaney in his present capacity; that is, Mr Pat Lanigan, the Director-General of the Department of Social Security, who features, albeit not by name, at some length and with some robustness on page 21 of the report where the very sad saga of Mr Lanigan's relationship with the Ombudsman on the Karen Green unemployment benefits case is retailed. The story of the unhappy relationship between the Ombudsman and the Director-General, and in particular the Director-General's failure to observe quite unprecedentedly the recommendations made by the Ombudsman with respect to the proper conduct of the Department in this particular matter, is all set out on page 21.
       </para>
       <para>
        The story is incomplete in this report, as I understand it, because the Ombudsman mentions in the report that he has referred a report of the matter to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It is my understanding, although I am not sure that this has been made a matter of public record, that the Prime Minister has accepted the Ombudsman's report. But the Director-General of the Department of Social Security has at last been appropriately chastised and obliged to follow the course of action recommended by the Ombudsman. Indeed, the Government is making some ex gratia payment to the persons in question who have been so shabbily treated for such a long period. I take the opportunity to suggest that in all the circumstances of this matter the Prime Minister should now table the Ombudsman's report to him indicating the nature of the Ombudsman's legitimate, as it proves, objections to the departmental head's behaviour and making a matter of complete public record something of a conclusion to a chapter of events which has been a very sorry state of affairs for quite some years. I think even Senator Chaney will agree that that is one matter that certainly sticks out from the text of this report.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one other matter that I notice amid the myriad of individual issues that are raised; that is, the question that is dealt with on pages 28 and subsequently of the report of the extraordinary situation that obtains whereby some of our major statutory authorities, including in particular Telecom Australia and Australia Post, continue to enjoy complete immunity from suit in respect of negligence in the conduct of their affairs. That situation gives rise in practice to some quite remarkable injustices. The situation has been remedied for a very long time-since early this century-in respect of government departments. It seems anomalous that these authorities should retain this kind of immunity. I notice with some pleasure that the Ombudsman has taken the occasion of this report to draw attention to this very long neglected and important matter. Numerous other matters demand the attention of this Parliament, but under the circumstances I can do no more than seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       I wish to make a few comments in respect of this report. One thing which disturbed me greatly was that in a letter which was dated 5 December and which, I guess, went to all members of the Parliament we were told that the Australian National Railways had changed its title to Australian National. The report tabled tonight is the annual report of the Australian National Railways Commission. Yet on 5 December we were notified for some unknown and, to many people, very confusing reason that the Australian National Railways is now known as Australian National. When I had occasion to telephone the ANR the girl who answered the telephone said: 'Australian National'. I had to ask her: 'Australian National what?' Members of the public would not know to whom they were talking-whether it was a shipping company, an airline company, a medical benefits company or whatever. It could be anything at all. It could even stand for Australian National Parliament. Why on earth should the Australian National Railways want to bury its identity under the title Australian National? It is absolute stupidity. Nobody knew anything about it until the Parliament rose and we got this letter. I would like to know who made this decision. Is it a decision of Mr Hunt's? Other decisions that he has made have forced the Australian National Railways to close down many country rail services and to run dead carriages on the Indian Pacific and the Transcontinental, about which I will say a few words in a moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       This matter causes great concern not only to me but also to other people in Australia who had taken great pride in the Australian national railway system. We now find that it is no longer to be known as a railway system; it is to be known just as Australian National. Of course that cannot be at other than the behest of this Government. This Government's record proves that it has a dead set against the railway system and that it would like to see the railway system put completely out of existence with the carriage of all goods in Australia handed over to private road hauliers.

        —Some of the figures in this report that I will read out prove the Government's record in this regard. I make the comment that the report we are now debating is signed by Mr Keith Smith, the Acting Chairman of the Australian National Railways Commission. It is the last report he will sign on behalf of the Commission because he has now retired. I would like to place on record my commendation of Mr Smith for the wonderful work he did for the railway system of Australia. I am sure that he would not have been in complete agreement with taking out of the title the word 'Railways'. Mr Smith did a very good job and on any occasion on which I had to speak with him on any matter dealing with the conditions of employees or anything to do with railways I always got a very courteous hearing. I am sure that all railway employees would agree with me that he did his best to look after their interests despite the fact that this present Government imposed great pressures on the railways.

       The report shows that for 1978-79 passenger operations amounted to $1,528,413,000 whilst for the last financial year, that is, 1979-80, the amount had dropped to $1,467,455,000. So the ANR had suffered a drop in revenue despite an increase in fares. Why was there that drop? It happened because at the behest of this Government the ANR is running dead cars on the east-west service, that is, the Indian Pacific and the Transcontinental. I have first hand information about this because recently when my wife and I tried to book on the Indian Pacific from Perth back to South Australia-I had been in Perth on a Senate standing committee-I was told that we could not get a double berth; we could get only two single berths. On making further inquiries I found that the system used by the railways was to allocate so many berths and then to allocate the rest of them to tourist bureaus. No check is made to see whether the tourist bureaus sell all the seats made available to them but upon ringing the railways one is told that they have sold all their quota and that no seats are available. When I travelled on the train I spoke to some of the people who worked on it. I found that on the return trip there are dead cars on the train and that the railway is paying staff 60 per cent of their normal wages to travel back from Parkeston to Port Pirie as passengers because the cars are not full. Why on earth cannot these cars be full? People wanted to get seats on the Indian Pacific or on the Transcontinental but no seats were available. So the railway is not doing the job it ought to be doing in selling itself to the general public and promoting the rail service it offers. I say the service it offers is second to none anywhere in the world. Over the years I have had the privilege of travelling on European railways and none of them which offers overnight accommodation can offer the service which is offered to the Australian travelling public or to visitors to Australia either on the Indian Pacific or on the Transcontinental. We hear honourable senators on the other side of the chamber say that we have to promote tourism. I say here and now that the Australian National Railways is not promoting tourism, because it could fill those trains every time they ran if it went about it in the proper way. Senator Jessop interrupted me and said that--

I say to him that if the Government is going to adopt the same attitude with that train when it starts to run as the railways are adopting with the Indian Pacific and the Transcontinental, that line will run at a loss also. I could have a great argument with Senator Jessop about my making him sick. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament he has made me sick with some of the outlandish statements he has put out and which he cannot back up. Senator Jessop cannot rebut the remarks I have made tonight in regard to the way in which the Australian National Railways is operating in running dead cars on the system. That is why it is running at a loss. Senator Jessop ought to talk to some of the railway employees who work these trains and who live in the electorate he used to represent until the people got sick of him and elected Mr Wallis and hear what they have to say about the Railways Commission operating those two passenger trains.

       I want to refer now to what the ANR is doing to the freight service. It is killing its freight service as well as killing small business. From the way in which it puts up freight charges it is obvious that it does not want the small freight items to be carried on the railway. It is giving away the source of revenue to private road hauliers, and Senator Jessop cannot deny it. It is losing as much as 50 per cent patronage in the carriage of parcels. I raised in the Parliament before it rose for the Christmas recess the case of a man who runs a dry-cleaning business in my home town of Murray Bridge and who complained to me that it was costing a customer who lived at Tailem Bend, which is about 16 miles from Murray Bridge, up to $6.50 to send a suit from Tailem Bend to Murray Bridge by rail to have it dry-cleaned and returned. It cost so much because the railways do not want to carry small packages. I have had it proved to me that a massive piece of freight can be sent from Adelaide to Murray Bridge for the same cost as that of sending a small parcel because the lowest charge that the railways now make for a small parcel is $4 to $5, irrespective of the size.
      </para>
      <para>
       It need be the size of only an envelope but that is what one has to pay if it is put on the rail passenger service. The railway is killing small business. Yet Senator Jessop is always prating about the interest that his Government has in small business. It is quite obvious that people such as Senator Jessop do not confer with people who run small businesses in South Australia. They are being run out of business as far as freight charges by the railways are concerned. The railways ought to be there to give a service to the people, not to make a profit. As I pointed out, it is stated in this report that has been tabled tonight that the ANR is earning less revenue even though its charges have increased. This is because it is chasing people away from using its services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many primary producers in South Australia have written to me-no doubt they have also written to Senator Jessop but he has never raised this matter in the Parliament; it is left to members of the Opposition-expressing concern at the closure of country services. But Senator Jessop does not tell us about that. All he thinks about is getting money for roads. The next thing we will hear from Senator Jessop in here will be a request to the Government to set up a special fund, something like that which Mr Sinclair talked about for the Stuart Highway, to construct roads in the Murray-Mallee region once the train services are curtailed then finished so that the farmers in the region can cart their stock, their grain and their superphosphate on roads in the winter time because there are no suitable roads there now. The only way one can satisfactorily service those people's needs is by way of a railway system. Under the direction of Mr Hunt, those railway services are closing down, and the present State Minister in charge of railways in South Australia, Mr Wilson, is doing nothing to prevent it. Mr Virgo would not agree with the Federal Government; he would not allow it to close the lines. That is one of the penalties that the people in South Australia are paying for having a State Liberal government. I will read from a letter which I have received, which will form a petition to be signed by thousands of people in the country areas of South Australia and which will be presented to the State Parliament with the name 'Mr Hunt' deleted and replaced by the name 'Mr Wilson' as Transport Minister. This letter reads thus:

       They are just echoing the words which I have spoken in the Parliament on many occasions about Australia's railway services. The railways were first constructed in this country to give a service to the people and to develop the country. Yet we now find people in government who say that the user has to pay. If that had been the policy when the east-west railway was first constructed under a Labor government many years ago where would we have been in the last world war conflict? As a member of the Australian forces at that time I made many trips across the Nullarbor Plain in troop trucks. If that line had not been built by the foresight of the Labor Government how would we have got across? There was no road. Of course, shipping was in danger because of mines, and many ships were sunk off the Australian coast. So the Australian defence forces could not have been deployed from east to west if it had not been for the foresight of a Labor government.

        —Of course, who is promising to build it? Senator Teague is far behind the times. As I have said in the Parliament on many occasions, when the Northern Territory Acceptance Act of 1910 was signed, part of the agreement was that a north-south railway be constructed from Port Darwin to Port Augusta. The Liberal Party coalition government or the United Australian Party-whatever you like to call it-has been in office for most of that period, apart from the short period when we were in government during the war and when we constructed, under the Curtin Government, an all-weather road from Alice Springs to Darwin. We were in government only for a short period-three years from 1972 to 1975. So no blame can be laid at the foot of the Labor Party because we did not construct the railway. The blame is on the people whom Senator Teague supports and who were charged with the responsibility of constructing that railway line, but they never did. Of course, it was the Whitlam Government which turned the first sod for the first part of the railway which will now go from Tarcoola to Darwin. It has already been constructed from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. That was when Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister. Our record of constructing railways is a very proud one. I remind Senator Teague, as an afterthought, that the record of his Government is not to construct railways but to destroy them. One of the first actions it took after getting into government in 1975 was to close the railway line from Larrimah to Darwin. The Government has a wonderful record in respect of railways. It closes them down. The Labor Government constructs them because it believes that they are there to give a service to people and that the people who use them should not be exploited.

I now mention one thing which was mentioned in this letter which will form a petition to be presented to the Parliament, and that is the downturn in the level of employment in the railways. I am quoting from the report which we are debating tonight. In 1978-79 the total number of staff in the Australian National Railways Commission was 12,676. This report, which is to 30 June 1980, shows that there are 11,939 employees. So there we see the deletion of 737 souls out of employment in the Australian railway system. God knows what the level will be when we get the report tabled in the Parliament next year for 1980-81. Of course, it will not come in as the Australian National Railways Commission report but as the Australian National report. Then we will ask: The Australian National what? That is what I continue to ask the girls on the exchange, and it is quite an embarrassment to them.

       Mr President, I will have much more to say in the weeks ahead of us about what the Government is doing to the railway system, but I think I have said sufficient tonight. I see that Senator Jessop is having a good look at the report. No doubt he will speak to it. I hope he will be able to tell the Senate tonight that he in fact has conferred with Commonwealth railway employees and that he may be able to tell us, in view of his very ribald interjections, that they have told him something different from what they have told me. I, as well as Mr Wallis, the member for Grey, and Mr Morris, the shadow Minister for Transport, have had many conversations with them. So has my colleague from the Northern Territory Senator Robertson. We travelled back from Perth just a few weeks ago to inform ourselves fully of just what was going on with the passenger system. We were able then to see first-hand. There were about 89 passengers on that train when it could have carried 144. Yet when people went to book they were told that there was no accommodation. So I hope that Senator Jessop is able to tell us tonight that he in fact has conferred with the railway employees at Port Augusta and at Port Pirie and that they told him something different. If he does, I will go back to those people very shortly to talk to them. So will Mr Wallis and Senator Robertson, who is very concerned about the service now being operated between Tarcoola and Alice Springs, to see whether in fact there are any dead cars running. As Senator Jessop has said, the Government has made the announcement that it will construct the remainder of the link from Alice Springs to Darwin.

       I am not the only one who is concerned about the way in which the Government is operating the railway system. I have an advertisement out of the Border Chronicle, a paper which is often quoted from in the Senate. It is published at Bordertown. The advertisement states:

       Freight alternatives! So those people too are concerned about what the Government is doing to our magnificent railway system. If the Government had any sense at all, the first thing it would do to try to eliminate some of the unemployment in this country would be to set about constructing a dual track, firstly between Adelaide and Melbourne so that we could run a service quickly there. I am reliably informed by people who have worked in the railways for most of their working lives that one cannot travel any quicker now on a passenger train from Adelaide to Melbourne than one could on the first day that the first train ran along the track. That is brought about because of the cross-overs. Passenger trains have to wait in sidings for freight trains to pass. I have said on many occasions in the Parliament that what we ought to do to create an increase in employment and to update our business enterprises is to set about constructing a dual track between those two capital cities. When that is done we could commence, in conjunction with the upgrading of the Crystal Brook railway line, to put down a dual track to Perth in Western Australia so that we will have a railway service which will run some of these great juggernauts off the road.

       Reports tabled in this Parliament show that among those people with the highest rates of bankruptcy are those who have borrowed money to buy and run these great transports. Before they know where they are they are run out of business. They have ruined not only their own lives but also the lives of their families and of many people with whom they have contracted to cart freight. They go flat because they cannot compete. They are all cutting one another's throats. They are driving day and night seven days a week to try to make ends meet, whereas in the railways system people work proper hours and have happier families. The husband is home so many nights a week with his wife and family, whereas the truck driver may be anywhere between Perth and Darwin or in Townsville or Cairns. He is rarely ever at home. This is the problem that we are faced with.

       I say again that I cannot understand-perhaps the Minister can explain it to me-why the Australian National Railways Commission had to change its title by dropping the word 'Railways'. I think that most concerned people in Australia have been proud of our railway system. I do not know the reason for dropping the word 'Railways' and neither do many people to whom I have spoken. I hope that the answers to some of my questions will be given before I am forced to raise them again. I do not know whether Senator Jessop wishes to speak.

Instead of the Myer Emporium we have Myer. That is one example. Instead of Trans-Australia Airlines, we would have Trans-Australia. That also is a suggestion from the same corporate image expert. The same advisers have suggested a whole number of steps which are related to the improvement of the corporate image of the Australian National Railways Commission. As a statutory authority the Australian National Railways Commission is entitled to act independently in the engagement of such professional services, and, as I understand it, it has acted independently in the engagement of those services, with a view to trying to develop a much greater degree of identity and esprit de corps within the railway service itself and a better association of the public mind with the operation which is being undertaken. It may be that Senator McLaren and other senators do not undertand this or think it is a bit way out or something else.

As I understand it, it involves a total approach to the whole of a corporate undertaking, whether it be a company or a statutory authority which is engaged in commercial activity, to bring together a wide cross-section of factors which it is believed-obviously, a large number of private sector people believed that this was a good idea-will improve its identification both for employees and for customers. If honourable senators are concerned about this, perhaps it would be more useful to have some discussion about it at a forthcoming Estimates Committee meeting as to what is intended. Senator McLaren, who raised this matter, apparently does not have the interest in the explanation which he sought.

I was trying to let Senator McLaren know what a statutory authority, given a degree of independence by the Parliament, has in its wisdom decided to do, along with a number of other things that it is doing, to try to improve the performance of its total activities. Through the independent choice which the Commission has, not only has it made a decision in relation to its corporate image but it has also undertaken, I believe rather successfully, a lot of the reorganisation of its total activity. Perhaps it ought to be congratulated for showing a degree of spirit and endeavouring to be both competitive and reasonably successful in reducing an ever-growing subsidy which it was projected would reach by 1982, I think it was, well over $100m and which has now been cut down to about $60m. It is providing a service and developing and is employing a large number of people. It believes-I am prepared to accept this on the basis of 'let us give it a try'-that it is improving the identity and association of the Commission.

I simply wish to point out that it is not a matter of attacking the Government for trying to destroy the railways. It is a matter of identifying the fact that the Australian National Railways Commission has sought and obtained advice. This proposal follows the advice which it has received.

        —I am prompted to rise to my feet because of some of the remarks made by Senator McLaren. In his usual succinct, careful and moderated language he has drawn to our attention a few matters that I think ought to be replied to. One matter which really annoyed me was his accusation that the present Federal Government has disregarded the importance of railways to Australia and is intent on diverting rail traffic to road transport. That remark deserves a reply because it is quite unfounded and quite untrue. If Senator McLaren were to observe the record of the Fraser Government in these matters he would recognise that the opposite is the case. I recall having some interest in the matter of the construction of a railway line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. Because of the interest in that development the Federal Government agreed to provide additional funding so that that railway could be completed 12 months ahead of schedule. It was opened in October of last year.

       Moreover, the Federal Government decided that it was quite important in the interest of the development of South Australia and the Northern Territory to proceed as rapidly as possible with the construction of the standardised link between Crystal Brook and Adelaide. In fairly recent times this Parliament approved finance of approxi- mately $68m so that that project can continue. It is anticipated that the project will be completed by about 1982 or 1983.

He forgot to mention that the United States of America had some interest in that road and that because of international finance it was able to complete that road. I give credit to the Labor Government for using the financial capacity of other countries to achieve that road. I draw attention to the fact also that during the latest election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated that we would proceed with the construction of the railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin at a cost of approximately $400m. I think it will cost more than that. During the last week or two he has said it was hoped that the project would be completed by 1988. I think that is commendable.

       I think Senator McLaren stated also that certain lines had to be closed down. It is quite ironical that he should comment about that because Mr Virgo, when he held the position of Minister of Transport in South Australia, recognised that those unpleasant decisions would have to be made. He and Mr Dunstan decided to flog the railways to the Whitlam Government. The Whitlam Government bought the railways at a cost of $800m or more. Therefore, we as a government have had to persist with that. The Australian National Railways Commission is now to be called Australian National. It will not take long for Opposition senators, even with their intelligence, to realise the significance of the change. I can recognise it and can quite easily come to grips with the change in terminology. We are proceeding ahead. I think the Australian National is doing a job that is quite creditable. I was ashamed of the honourable senator when he denigrated the efforts being put forward by the Australian National with regard to the need to become a viable organisation within 10 years. That is what our Government decided to do. We believe it is important that if we provide these facilities to the people they use them.

I will return to the subject and try to talk with reasoned common sense. I suggest that if Senator McLaren is worried about any railway being closed down he should encourage people to use it. The reason we use taxpayers' money to provide these facilities is so that people will use them. I know many farmers and station owners who choose to use their own transport rather than the railways. If we can persuade them to use the facilities that we provide and if we have more than one or two passengers riding on a railway train from, say, Terowie to Adelaide perhaps it will not be necessary for lines to be closed down. Despite what might have been inferred, I have been responsible for delaying decisions with respect to the closure of certain railway lines in South Australia in order to give an opportunity to re-examine proposals and to look at the volume of freight that is flowing from these areas into the centres of concern. Despite the fact that it has been suggested that I do not raise these individual cases in parliament, a lot of effort has been going on in the background.

       I do not wish to dramatise the whole issue, as some honourable senators on the Opposition side choose to do. These matters can be worked out by reasoned conversation with efficient officials of the Australian National. I will continue to operate in that way to the satisfaction of the people who choose to come to me with their problems. Therefore, I suggest that the record of the Fraser Government is clear. We are prepared to promote the interest of an efficient Australian railway system. I would like to see, as a next step, a standardised link between Adelaide and Melbourne. I think that is a project we ought to proceed with as a matter of urgency. I believe the transport projects that have been initiated and carried out, and will continue to be carried out, by this Government will be in the best interests of Australia and in particular to the mutual development of South Australia and the Northern Territory.

Each of us can look back on events in our own lifetime affecting the Royal family and they stand out in our memories. Tonight is such an occasion. Her Majesty the Queen has announced from Buckingham Palace the engagement of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer.

Australian people hold Prince Charles in special regard. From the completion of his schooling here as a young man, and his subsequent five visits to Australia, we have come to recognise and applaud his sense of humour and his dedication, his outgoing personality and his concern for people. He has spoken many times of his affection for Australia and Australians. We have a great affection for him, in which his wife-to-be will now share. Prince Charles will be visiting Australia again later this year and he will be given a warm welcome. I do not know whether we might have the great pleasure of welcoming Lady Diana to Australia but whenever that is, I am certain that the welcome will be equally warm, equally affectionate.

       Mr President, the Crown gives us a focal point in our development as a nation and links us with our history and our origins. The significance of the monarchy is not diminishing. It is not fading in Australian consciousness. The Queen and her family are part of a living and relevant institution, which in Australia is very much tied to our own institutions and emotions. We all share with Her Majesty the Queen and Prince Philip, and the other members of the Royal family, the joy of this particular occasion and to them also we extend our good wishes. The Prime Minister will be conveying our sentiments to Prince Charles and Lady Diana, and to Her Majesty the Queen, on behalf of all Australians.

        —by leave-Very briefly I should like to express the congratulations of the National Country Party to Prince Charles and Lady Diana. I agree that the announcement perhaps was not totally unexpected. It is the view of our party and certainly of the Government that royalty still does have a real meaning in the Australian circumstance. It is a symbol of unity which I believe is looked at somewhat longingly by many other countries. Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, has a very close association with this country. Most Australians feel that he is very close to being, among other things, an Australian. The proposed marriage is the start of another family and in the Australian community the family is still the basic unit. I extend the congratulations of my party to Prince Charles and Lady Diana.

I agree with Senator Carrick in that we, unlike Senator Button, were not surprised by the announcement. The only thing that surprises me is Senator Button's abysmal ignorance on this matter. Clearly he is not a reader of the Australian Women's Weekly or Woman's Day as one would expect him to be! Seriously, the Australian Democrats appreciate the announcement and commend the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government for expressing the sentiments on behalf of all the Australian people as Senator Carrick has already indicated.

       <para>
        The reports dealing with the local government grants commissions relate to the six States and the implementation of Commonwealth legislation pursuant to the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. In our consideration of the matters now before the Senate we are in the same position as referred to by Senator Evans when he spoke earlier this evening on the annual report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I heard the Government Whip and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) suggest that the present procedures in respect of the presentation of papers are no different from those which existed in previous years. In the five years I have been a member of the front bench in this place it has been the practice of the Government to make available to the Opposition copies of the papers to be presented to the Senate in sufficient time for honourable senators at least to have a cursory examination of the reports to enable us to comment on them following their presentation. That is not the position with these reports. Although the Opposition Whip was able, just prior to Senator Evans' speaking on the annual report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, to get a copy of the 1980-81 report of the New South Wales Grants Commission on financial assistance for local government, we were not able to get copies of the other reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that it is the responsibility of the Government to revert to the system that used to operate in this place instead of having the present haphazard and slipshod system of reports being presented to the Senate which have not been made available to members on either side of the Parliament. That makes it impossible for us to make any reasonable comment upon the reports. As my colleague Senator Evans indicated, a report of some 200 pages was made available to him only minutes before he had to make some comment upon it. If it is the desire of the Government that these reports and all the work that goes into them should be put away in a pigeon-hole and referred to at some future time and not debated in the Parliament, it should continue the practice of present Ministers. If, however, it is the intention of the Parliament that both the Opposition and the Government should have an opportunity to make some comments upon these reports, I suggest there is a need to revert to the previous procedure which I am sure the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) will recall was in practice when he was Government Whip. These reports were made available to the Leader of the Opposition or the Opposition Whip's office on the morning on which they were to be presented to the Parliament. They could be considered by the appropriate shadow Minister or members of the Opposition so that there was a purpose in the Parliament having these matters presented before it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Speaking in relation to this report, local government has, in fact, different practices from State to State. For example, in 1968 the New South Wales Government established its own Grants Commission. Other States were to follow slowly but surely. Each State has a different attitude to the way in which local government operates in the respective States. The areas within the States vary considerably. The areas vary region by region. Of course, State by State local government develops in a considerably different way. Yet the purpose of the Commonwealth legislation was to bring about an equalisation of services in local government. It has taken us several hours today to get a copy of this report which relates to the Grants Commission of New South Wales. It is impossible for me, therefore, to make any comment upon the other States because those reports are not available. If members of the Opposition are interested in the way in which the grants commissions are operating, surely it is not asking too much of the Government to make these six reports available in sufficient time for us to do some reading of them, to make some assessment of them, to make some comments upon them in a logical and common-sense way and to assess the worth of the report and the progress of the various State commissions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it has to be said that we are talking about the Government's intention, which was implicit in the legislation that we dealt with and which sought to bring about some equalisation. How can we deal with that matter today when local government in every State is having grave difficulties in raising its loan funds because of the increase in interest rates and the fact that local and semi-government bodies are vying for public funds in some sort of a bargain basement rate fashion? Consequently, because electricity authorities, for example, and other public authorities in the States are able to offer higher rates of interest than those granted to local government, every local government body without exception is reporting that it is experiencing grave difficulties in meeting its loan requirements. These requirements were granted by the Australian Loan Council. But the local government authorities are not, because of the state of the money market, able to raise the necessary funds to meet their requirements. That has disastrous consequences if the present difficulty is maintained. That will mean that local government will not be able to maintain its range of services and may well be forced into a position of disposing of its staff, of sacking those members of its work force who would otherwise be involved in its works programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not much use talking about the success of the Commonwealth Grants Commission legislation and the role the States play in the disbursement of the funds made available through the income tax sharing system. If, in fact, what I am saying is borne out-I am led to believe that this is the current position-the Parliament would need to consider very seriously whether the funds currently being made available by the Commonwealth to the States, which, as honourable senators will be aware, were increased from 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent in the Budget of last year, are totally inadequate, having regard to the failure of local government to meet its loan borrowings as provided for by the decisions of the Premiers Conference in 1980. One finds it difficult to make any specific comment about the six reports other than to say that the Government would be well advised, if it wants the Parliament to exercise both its prerogative and its responsibilities, to revert to the procedures whereby at least the Opposition, if not Government members, would have the opportunity of making some comments upon these various reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be argued by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that some of these reports would have been circulated during the recess period. But, Mr President, as you well know, it was not the circulation of the reports that offered us the problem. It was a question of selecting from the great variety of reports that were available which reports were likely to be placed before the Parliament. That becomes a task of some magnitude from the point of view of the members of the Senate. Therefore, there is a need for the procedures to be very carefully examined by the Government so that we can have those reports which require to be presented to the Parliament presented in such a way as would enable us on this side of the chamber-I am sure this was the case in the previous matter which Senator McLaren raised about government members also making an input to a report-to have adequate opportunity to have these matters properly raised in this place and subsequently set aside for the purpose of a more meaningful debate later. As I do not have available to me the reports other than that for my own State, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —Tonight I think I should refer briefly to one matter because this is the first opportunity I have had to do so since this matter arose. I want to lodge the strongest possible objection against the way the Murdoch Press operated during the coroner's inquiry into the unfortunate incident of the missing baby of Mr and Mrs Chamberlain. I was disgusted, as were many people who contacted me in my office, when I saw in Adelaide on 9 February a poster put out by the Murdoch Press referring to Mrs Chamberlain as the 'Dingo Mother in Disguise'. That is stooping to gutter level, whether it be by a newspaper proprietor in Australia or in any other country. It is a device to whip up the enthusiasm of people so they will buy newspapers. Murdoch stands condemned for evermore for having the temerity to allow a thing like that to appear on every news stand in South Australia. It appeared in Murray Bridge where I live. It also appeared in Adelaide. I am reliably informed that it appeared in other country towns. Mr and Mrs Chamberlain were under great stress. Yet we find a newspaper proprietor prepared to stoop to the lowest possible level to sell his rotten newspaper. I can refer to it as nothing but a rotten newspaper. Murdoch delves into gutter politics. I will not refer to that tonight because that would be dealing with other matters. The newspaper headlines read ' ''Dingo Baby'' Father Weeps'. How low are we stooping in this country when we use those tactics to sell newspapers? I leave it at that. If anybody wants to read the article I have it here. I place on record not only my condemnation but also the condemnation by people who contacted me of a newspaper proprietor who stoops to such a low level to sell a rotten, filthy newspaper. This article was published during the coroner's inquiry into a most unfortunate incident, when these unhappy people-not only the mother and father, but also the other children-were under the greatest stress that could possibly beset any family at any time.

      <para>
       Under the provisions of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling 1946, by which the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established, catch limits are agreed at meetings of the Commission. The catch limits are incorporated into the Schedule to the Convention and become binding unless objections are lodged by individual contracting Governments within 90 days of the meeting at which the catch limits are established. Under Article IX of the 1946 Convention, each contracting Government has the responsibility of taking appropriate measures to ensure the application of the Convention, including catch limits and other provisions incorporated in the Schedule. It is the individual responsibility of contracting Governments to ensure that any infractions are punished.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1972 the IWC established the International Observer Scheme, under which bilateral agreements for the provision of observers are negotiated between Contracting Governments. In 1979 the Commission reviewed the operation of the International Observer Scheme and concluded that the present mechanism of bilateral agreements operated satisfactorily. Provision has now been made for any Contracting Government willing to negotiate bilateral agreements to notify the Commission's Secretariat, where a list of such Governments is maintained, which is available to whaling nations wishing to negotiate observer agreements. Observers report to the IWC. Reports from observers are considered by the Commission at its annual meetings, together with the annual reports of infractions required of Contracting Governments.

       The USSR and Japan have an agreement which will apply in 1980-81 for the exchange of observers for their Southern Hemisphere pelagic operations.

       Pelagic catches will be monitored on factory ships by the observers exchanged between the USSR and Japan and the reports of the observers will be considered by the IWC at its next annual meeting in July 1981.

       (3) The article in the City Express of 12 November 1980 reflects a misconception that the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations require a total prohibition on the import, export, sale or advertisement of specimens of any species listed in Appendix I or Appendix II to CITES.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the provisions of CITES and the Regulations, specimens of species listed in Appendix II may be imported for commercial or private purposes provided the authorities in the country of export issue an export approval and an import permit is obtained.
      </para>
      <para>
       Cases involving the suspected importation of endangered specimens are investigated.
      </para>
      <para>
       A number of such investigations resulted in goods being seized. In other cases it was established that specimens were legally imported, that is they were derived from a species listed in Appendix II to CITES and were covered by an import permit or were imported before the Regulations came into force. In other cases involving the skins of animals such as tiger and leopard it was found that the skins were fake.

       (5) The article in the City Express is based upon cases that have already been investigated.

       This contract was an interim measure taken by the AWB to provide immediate expert assistance in public relations during a period when the AWB was taking steps to strengthen its own public relations section.

       Public relations consultants are commercial organisations operating in a competitive environment and cannot reasonably be expected to disclose details concerning their clients. Thus, to provide the information requested by the honourable senator it would be necessary for contact to be made with the Federal, State and regional arms of all political parties in Australia. I consider such an approach unwarranted.

Further, my Department is unaware of the number of medical examinations for invalid pensions conducted by part-time medical officers. The procedure whereby all medical examinations for invalid pensions are vetted by a senior medical officer of my Department before the cases are referred to the Department of Social Security was introduced progressively during 1980 in the State and Territory offices of my Department as resources permitted. Prior to this, the results of all medical examinations conducted by part-time Commonwealth Medical Officers were sent by those doctors direct to the Department of Social Security.

      <para>
       (1) The cost of raising the unemployment benefit for single persons without dependants aged 18 years and over to the standard rate of pension at November 1980 is estimated to be $104 million in a full year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The cost of raising the unemployment benefit for single persons aged 16 and 17 years to the standard Tertiary Education Allowances Scheme payment for a student not living at home ($2583 per annum in 1981) is estimated to be $33 million in a full year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The health benefit cards issued to supporting parents are the same as those issued to widows. However the health benefit card is part of either a composite health benefit/concession fare certificate (PHB2/TC.1) or health benefit/concession card (PHB2/SA28).

       Concession fare certificates and concession cards are issued on behalf of State Governments and Local Authorities.

       An environmental assessment of the proposed Redcliff petrochemical plant in South Australia is being undertaken under arrangements agreed between the former Minister for Science and the Environment and the South Australian Minister for the Environment. As the first stage of the process, Dow Chemical (Australia) Ltd released an environmental effects statement for public review from 20 May to 27 June 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following this, the statement was revised to take into account comments received and assessed as a final environmental impact statement (EIS) in accordance with the administrative procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subsequently, the former Minister for Science and the Environment wrote to the South Australian Minister for the Environment conveying the findings and recommendations of his Department arising from its assessment of the final EIS. These findings were consistent with those reached by the South Australian Department of the Environment in assessing the proposal.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the basis of these assessments, the South Australian Government announced on 10 September that there were no environmental reasons why the proposed Redcliff project should not proceed.

       However, Dow Chemical has since announced that it has deferred for two years any decision on proceeding with the Redcliff proposal.

       Yes. Where either or both of a married couple, because of illness or infinite basis and their living expenses are or are likely to be greater than they would otherwise be, each may receive single rate pension. Eligibility for single rate pension was extended to persons in this situation in 1970 in recognition that they have lost the normal financial advantages of cost sharing.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, for income test purposes the combined income of the couple is still taken into account and the allowable income remains unchanged, although the level of income at which pension ceases to be payable is extended in keeping with payment of the single rate of pension. If each were treated as a single person for income test purposes the halving principle would not be applicable and overall disadvantage could result. It is only where a couple is living apart and estranged that they are treated as separate entities for pension income test purposes.

        —The Minister for Primary Industry, in consultation with the Assistant Director-General (Plant Quarantine), Department of Health, has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) It is not possible to state precisely how the stripe rust of wheat reached Australia. The possibilities are:
      </para>
      <para>
       on air currents
      </para>
      <para>
       in association with seed
      </para>
      <para>
       with cereal straw
      </para>
      <para>
       in association with non plant items
      </para>
      <para>
       Rusts are capable of reaching Australia on air currents as is strongly suspected to be the case with peanut rust. There is a wide global distribution for stripe rust but the strain detected in Australia is a European strain which virtually precludes arrival by air currents.
      </para>
      <para>
       All cereal seed, including wheat, which is approved import into Australia undergoes a prescribed treatment before being grown for one generation in quarantine for observation. The prescribed hot water treatment of the seed is adequate to render non viable any rust spores associated with the seed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Cereal straw is a prohibited import.
      </para>
      <para>
       The spore of stripe rust is rather fragile, susceptible to sunlight and is not expected to remain viable for a long period on non host material.
      </para>
      <para>
       The introduction of stripe rust was possibly associated with a person either as an illegal introduction of wheat seed or straw or with non host material.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Experienced plant pathologists in Victoria have stated that stripe rust is expected to be regular crop disease in Victoria each season. Stripe rust is expected to reduce the 1980 yield in Victoria by one or two per cent according to officers in the Victorian Department of Agriculture. One variety has sustained losses as high as 25 per cent. Certain varieties have already shown resistance and it is likely that breeding for resistance will be the long term approach to control although spraying has been effective on varieties which are susceptible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Immediately following the discovery of stripe rust in October 1979, a request was made to the Wheat Industry Research Council for a special supplementary grant of $150,000 to build a new glasshouse at the University of Sydney Castle Hill research site to facilitate reasearch into the disease. On the recommendation of the Council, the Minister for Primary Industry approved the allocation of the funds to the project out of session.
      </para>
      <para>
       As part of the proposal the New South Wales Department of Agriculture agreed to make available an officer to work with University Staff. The glasshouse is currently under construction.
      </para>
      <para>
       Two additional projects on stripe rust are being funded by the Council in its 1980-81 program. Every effort is being made to gather basic information on the disease so that control measures can be devised and information on resistant varieties passed on to growers at the earliest opportunity.
      </para>
      <para>
       Quarantine can devise safe procedures for introductions but is dependent upon co-operation of the community to achieve success. In recent times quarantine has pursued a policy of higher penalties for quarantine offenders as a deterrent for illegal imports.

A United Kingdom resident became obstreperous during the Singapore to Brisbane sector after consuming liquor supplied by cabin stewards. Passenger became erratic and attempted to leave aircraft.

After due consideration Federal Police decided not to charge passenger and released him in safe custody of his son. The passenger subsequently returned to UK without incident.

      <para>
       (1) Transcendental meditation (TM) is not listed as a medical service in the Medical Benefits Schedule. However, if TM were prescribed as a relaxation technique by a medical practitioner during the course of a professional attendance, benefits would be payable for that attendance under the appropriate consultation item. In this situation, the benefits are payable on the grounds that there is a physical attendance by a legally qualified medical practitioner upon the patient. Because the reasons for a professional attendance by a general practitioner are normally not given, it is not possible to provide figures for the incidence or cost of such treatment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I do not consider it appropriate for me to comment on the general techniques of TM or on claims made by its proponents.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3), (4) and (5) See (1). Medical benefits are attracted for consultations by legally qualified medical practitioners. It would be neither practical nor desirable to attempt in any form to restrict the way in which doctors choose to conduct their consultations. Medical benefits are not payable for TM treatment as such. Therefore, the question does not arise as to whether contributions by members of registered health insurance organisations are being used to subsidise this treatment.

However, the Government has agreed to amend the Home Nursing Subsidy Scheme to, inter alia, remove the limitation and replace it with a cash ceiling determined in the Budget context each year. As the Home Nursing Subsidy Act provides that the Commonwealth subsidy cannot exceed the amount of State assistance, the proposed changes have been discussed with State authorities without, so far, agreement being reached.

       Macquarie Island, the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Island and the Australian Antarctic Territory are within income tax Zone A. Consequently, Australian citizens who have resided in or actually been in one or more of those areas for more than one half of a year of income are entitled to the appropriate zone allowance. The present basic allowance for Zone A is a rebate of $216. It is higher when the taxpayer concerned has dependents.

      <para>
       In relation to sales tax, goods taken to the Antarctic mainland, Heard Island and McDonald Island by Australian citizens are regarded as goods exported and are exempt from tax. Macquarie Island is a part of Tasmania and goods taken there are not regarded as being exported. Exemption, therefore, does not apply to such goods.

      <para>
       In a joint press release dated 24 November 1980, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Transport announced that the three RAN Tracker aircraft which had been conducting aerial surveillance off the north and north-west coast of Australia since November 1977 were planned to be withdrawn from Darwin in mid-December 1980, subject to the successful completion of evaluation trials by radar-equipped Nomad aircraft under charter to the Department of Transport. The Nomad aircraft have been assessed as suitable for the task and the RAN Tracker aircraft were withdrawn from Darwin on 12 December 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       The current arrangements for civil coastal surveillance were introduced by the Government in 1978 following a review of surveillance requirements. Under these arrangements the Minister for Transport is the Government spokesman on civil surveillance matters and co-ordinates the activities of the combination of Defence and civil assets employed on civil coastal surveillance operations. Civil aircraft under charter to the Department of Transport conduct daily air searches of the coast from Karratha to Cairns, RAAF aircraft fly up to 2,500 hours each year patrolling the 200 nm Australian Fishing Zone and nine RAN patrol boats are made available for civil coastal surveillance, response and enforcement operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       In announcing the new arrangements to operate from 1978, the Government stated that they would be the subject of a major review. That review, which is scheduled to be presented to Government in mid-1981, is to be a comprehensive assessment enabling firm judgments to be made about the effectiveness of existing arrangements and decisions to be taken on future arrangements for the conduct of civil coastal surveillance. I am advised that the Minister for Transport intends to make a statement to the press shortly concerning that review.

       Pharmaceutical benefit records only include data on items supplied as benefits under the National Health Act. Specifically excluded are data on items prescribed in hospitals covered by Commonwealth/State cost-sharing arrangements, as well as private prescriptions for items which may or may not be available as pharmaceutical benefits; also benefit items for persons not holding a current Pensioner Health Benefit card, where the dispensed price is equal to or less than the patient contribution (currently $2.75). Two of the four strengths of DES currently available as pharmaceutical benefits fall within this latter category.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the pharmaceutical benefits processing system is primarily concerned with the reimbursement of pharmaceutical chemists for dispensing undertaken under the provisions of the National Health Act, patient identification is not included in computer-held records. In addition, prescription forms are only retained by my Department for three years, after which they are destroyed in accordance with Finance Direction Section 34/10. Manual searching through about 300 million prescriptions processed during the immediate three year period is seen as being impractical. Even if this were to be considered, subsequent follow-up action with those prescribers willing to co-operate would be necessary to determine-

The Act does not give discretion in terms of denying approval on the basis of who owns the premises. The Act uses the term 'proprietor', who of course may or may not be the owner of the hospital.
      </para>
      <para>
       No investigation into investment in hospitals by members of the medical profession has been undertaken by my Department as there is no statutory basis for doing so. Nor is there any statutory basis for the establishment of a register of pecuniary interests of doctors.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not consider it appropriate at this late stage to specifically refer this matter to the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. Firstly, the terms of reference for the Commission are broad enough to allow consideration of the question of ownership of hospitals and, if the matter is regarded by the Commission as significant, I expect it will be canvassed in the Commission's Report. Secondly, it is too late to refer specific matters to the Commission. It is now finalising its report which is expected to be available by 31 December 1980.

      <para>
       The Minister for Defence has advised that in the 1976 Defence White Paper the Government announced it had decided to proceed with project development for the acquisition of the new tactical fighter. The only deferral in this project since then was the announcement made by the Minister for Defence on 4 December 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       In that statement to Parliament, the Minister said the Government regretted the necessity to defer selection of the new tactical fighter. The decision was made on the basis of advice from the Government's most senior professional military and civilian defence advisers.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am advised that the fundamental issue here is not that a time-table for decision which appeared realistic a year ago be adhered to, but rather that the Government should have at its disposal all the information necessary to make a considered judgement. To make a decision in our present circumstances of incomplete knowledge of the likely future development of both aircraft would be a gross irresponsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government expects additional information on both aircraft to become available around mid-1981 to enable further evaluation of the contenders. The Government will make a decision on selection as soon as possible thereafter.

       The Minister for Science and Technology has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       State legislation has always controlled trading practices in regard to weights and measures, and pricing. Prior to 1970 that legislation required the sole use of the imperial system. As a consequence of the conversion program, all States introduced transitional provisions permitting both systems of measurement to be used whilst the measuring devices were being changed.
      </para>
      <para>
       In most States that transitional phase was completed by end 1977 after which only sole metric practice was permitted but in Queensland and Western Australia the difficulties of conversion in remote areas have delayed the termination of imperial usage till now. Good trading practice, and consumer protection require that goods be priced in terms of the unit in which they will be actually measured.
      </para>
      <para>
       Regulations have been in force for two years to control the import of non-metric measuring instruments. They were intended to assist the completion of conversion of particular sector programs and have been effective in that aim. They were also designed to protect the consumer from goods which would have a very limited life as the conversion proceeded rapidly to its conclusion. However recognising that conversion would, of necessity, proceed slowly in areas such as precision engineering, adequate provision was made for imperial measuring devices to be available to those sectors. Reports in the newspapers that certain rulers would have to be destroyed or re-exported arose from a misunderstanding which has since been corrected.
      </para>
      <para>
       Metric conversion has been a major cultural change similar to, but much greater in impact than, currency conversion. In that former conversion, there was no question of freedom of choice: The old currency was withdrawn after a two-year transition period and ceased to be legal. Metric conversion, because of its complexity and for practical consideration, has taken much longer and in some areas will require many years yet. Nevertheless it is in everyone's interest to complete the change as quickly as possible.

The proportion of cost attributable to the mill is $3.28 million which will be financed by the Corporation from its own resources. This amount includes expenditure of $0.9 million by the Corporation this year. The company has entered into a 35 year agreement, whereby it will repay the total amount spent by the Corporation plus interest by way of a fixed monthly charge, which will ensure full recovery of the Corporation's costs.

       (3) The augmentation works referred to in the question provide for pumping of raw water from the Murray River direct to the mill. This ensures that the existing filtered water supply for domestic purposes is separated from the raw water supply. The separation works are in the category of 'further works' the cost of which will be added to the amount set out in (1) above and will be repaid by the company under the terms of the Agreement mentioned above.

Does the Minister agree that industry throughout Australia is having trouble obtaining suitable applicants for apprenticeships due to their weaknesses in both mathematics and English? Is there a fundamental weakness in mathematics in our primary school teachers, in that no mathematics qualification is necessary for a primary school teacher? Will the Government give consideration to arranging with industry for government and industry to speak with headmasters and school councillors to make sure that they are properly briefed on the basic academic requirements for apprenticeship? Will the Government give consideration to publicising the better job opportunities which are available in Australia to those students who persevere with the hard core mathematics and English during their secondary education, rather than the limited opportunities available to those who select soft options?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Education has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:
      </para>
      <para>
       I am aware of the comments made by the employment officer at Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd concerning apprenticeship testing. The situation he reports is indeed a matter of concern. Without a more detailed knowledge of the test administered, however, and an indication both of its relationship to the mathematics curriculum in schools and of its validity for the purposes of apprenticeship selection, I am not in a position to make any substantive comment on this specific case.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am able to offer some general observations on the basic skills levels reached by school leavers, a matter which in recent years has come under close scrutiny by Australian educators. It is relevant to note in this context that the Australian Education Council is currently investigating nationally the basic skills levels reached by 10 and 14 year-olds. The evidence from recent studies is that there has been no significant decline in basic skills when the school population is taken as a whole, although a minority of students leave school with some deficiencies in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy. It is probable, as a result of the massive increase in the proportion of students remaining to Year 10, that the range of abilities of students applying for entry to skilled trade training is now much greater than was the case some years ago, and this could be reflected in the selection test scores of applicants for apprenticeships. This may present some problems during the selection process, but the fact is that the number of new apprenticeship indentures registered annually has increased considerably over the last five years.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further question concerns the mathematics ability of primary school teachers. There has been evidence presented in the Report of the National Inquiry into Teacher Education, for example, that 72 per cent of Victorian entrants into primary teacher training in the last three years had taken no mathematics at Year 12 level. Other State reports on teacher education expressed a similar concern for the level of proficiency in mathematics of their recruits for teaching. Many teacher education students take advantage of bridging courses offered by tertiary institutions to improve their levels of proficiency in mathematics and the Report of the National Inquiry underlines the responsibility of institutions to ensure that graduates of teacher education programs at all levels have reached adequate standards in the areas of language and mathematics.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the question of consultation between industry and schools regarding academic requirements for apprenticeship, this is essentially a matter for the education systems and schools in the States to take up. The basic academic requirements for entry to apprenticeship in terms of attainment in school courses are laid down by apprenticeship authorities in each State and territory and these requirements would generally be well known to counsellors advising students who are seeking apprenticeships. On the more general level, the Commonwealth Government is of course concerned that young people should have as much relevant information as possible about employers' requirements. Under the Transition from School to Work Program, State and non-Government education authorities are being assisted to improve their career, education and guidance services and some authorities are using funds to develop closer links with industry. In addition, the Commonwealth and the States are cooperating in a review of vocational guidance services as part of the transition program. This is an area therefore in which improvements are being effected.
      </para>
      <para>
       Concerning the study of 'hard core mathematics and English', there has been considerable public comment on a recent Victorian report purporting to show that senior secondary students are deserting the more demanding subjects and courses in favour of easier options. At the national level, and at least where mathematics is concerned, a somewhat different picture emerges from a recent ACER study on secondary mathematics in Australia during the period 1964-1978. This shows that, consistent with the rise generally in retention rates through to the end of secondary schooling there was a considerable increase between 1964 and 1978 in the absolute numbers of students taking some mathematics in Year 12. There was also an increase in the number of students taking Year 12 mathematics courses leading to subsequent specialised studies involving mathematics. The overall proportion of Year 12 students taking some mathematics has remained fairly constant between 1964 and 1978, with an Australian average of about 60 per cent on both occasions, although the proportion of Year 12 students taking courses leading to subsequent specialised studies involving mathematics was lower in 1978 than in 1964. It is relevant also that the level of performance of Year 12 students in mathematics was a little higher in 1978 than was the case in 1964. In general, I consider that the education authorities in Australia are aware of the need to encourage students, particularly those who demonstrate the ability to pursue studies beyond secondary level, to persevere with subjects such as mathematics and English at senior level even though they may no longer be compulsory subjects for matriculation purposes.

Further increases have been approved under the Australian Shipping Commission Act whenever justified by increased costs together with the obligation on ANL to meet a coastal dividend target approved by the Minister for Transport (and set at 18 per cent before tax for the current year).
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to the other major operator, Union Steamship, there is no legislation that requires ministerial approval of its freight rates but I understand that they are competitive with ANL.
      </para>
      <para>
       Similarly freight forwarders' charges are not subject to ministerial approval under legislation. As you might know their charges are an aggregation of charges, of which the linehaul charge of the shipowner is only one part.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Honourable Senator will recall that in 1971 a Senate standing committee determined that freight increases implemented by ANL in the previous year were fully justified. Subsequently their rates have been examined and increased and there is no reason to believe that the level of existing Bass Strait freight rates is not appropriate.

        —On 4 December 1980 (Hansard, page 334) Senator Button asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, a question without notice concerning comments in the 1979-80 Annual Report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission concerning staffing and financial matters.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable senator referred in his questions to comments in the 1979-80 Annual Report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) concerning staffing and financial matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       I can confirm that on 20 September 1980 the ABC did write to the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Mr Staley, expressing views on its statutory responsibility in relation to staffing matters similar to those set out in its recent Annual Report. Following receipt of this letter, members of the Government met with representatives of the ABC to discuss these matters, and the views of the Commission have been considered in detail by relevant Government Departments, in consultation with the ABC. The ABC Committee of Review has been appointed by the Government to review present and future services of the ABC, its policies, organisational structure, and performance. It is expected that the Committee will make recommendations on the issues of staffing and finance raised in the ABC Annual Report, and I can assure honourable senators that the Government will give proper consideration to these matters upon receipt of the report of the Committe of Review.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is firmly of the opinion that financial allocations to the ABC should be considered within the context of the Government's overall economic strategy. Allocations to the ABC over the last five years have been provided in difficult economic circumstances during which the Government has been required to exercise a degree of financial restraint.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has, nevetheless, been responsive to the special needs of the ABC. The 1980-81 Budget allocation to the ABC of $177.6 million comprised an increase of some 11 per cent over the appropriation for 1979-80. In the five year period 1975-76 to 1980-81, allocations to the ABC have increased from some $137.1 million to $177.6 million an increase of 29.5 per cent. In addition, the Government has given the ABC authority to generate revenue from entrepreneurial activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       In all the circumstances, I believe that the level of funding provided to the ABC in this period has demonstrated the Government's determination to maintain an effective and efficient national broadcasting sector.

      <para>
       My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, relates to the price of aviation spirit for light aircraft which no doubt the Minister is aware costs considerably more than fuel for a car. In fact, it costs about 50c a litre. Is the Minister aware that due to this higher price of aviation spirit for light aircraft and consequently the cost of flying, many people who would otherwise choose flying as a career are being prohibited from doing so? Is the Minister aware that there is a drop in the number of people who are learning to fly? Will he discuss with the Minister for Transport some way of reducing the cost of light aircraft fuel so that flying training centres will be able to continue to train the pilots Australians will need in the years to come? This might help to stay in business some of the companies that fly people around this large country.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       I am aware of the relatively higher price for aviation gasoline.
      </para>
      <para>
       The latest figures available from my Department indicate that for the year ended December 1979 there were fewer student aeroplane licenses on a first issue basis than for the year ended December 1978. The respective figures were 4,952 and 5,967. However, in terms of the number of student aeroplane licenses current (which includes renewals), as at 31 December 1979 there were 20,461 as compared to 18,900 at 31 December 1978.
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable senator may also be interested to learn that for the year ended December 1979 there were 354,766 hours devoted to flying training by General Aviation, an increase of 13,670 hours (4.01 per cent) on the same activity during 1978.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question affording specific sectors of the aviation industry relief from the cost of fuel has quite significant implications for not only other sectors in the industry but for other industries within the economy. To take such a course with a particular sector, or a particular industry would distort the costs faced by the element of the economy and result in a misallocation of resources.

Will the newly foreshadowed and fourth review of the Australian broadcasting system to be conducted by the Fraser Government-according to the Minister, that review will be completed by February next year and will examine amongst other things the public interest provisions of the broadcasting legislation-be in any sense open to members of the public so that they can make submissions about important public interest questions or will it be a closed departmental review?

      <para>
       No. I might say that the other two cities with separate White and Yellow Pages, Sydney and Melbourne, also have separate deliveries for the two books because the timing of the issue of telephone directories is dependent upon the capacity of the equipment available at the printing contractor's works. Due to the cost of the equipment, the contractors cannot install capacity which would only be used infrequently, to enable two books to be produced concurrently.
      </para>
      <para>
       Improved printing and production methods at some time in the future may enable a joint distribution of white and yellow page directories to be undertaken and of course Telecom would be keeping this possibility under review.

       (1) Turbojet aircraft have never been completely prohibited from operating during the curfew. Within the conditions of the curfew two categories of aircraft may operate during the curfew; (a) under the operational provisions of the curfew which allow for, such as, emergencies, and, (b) with the approval of the Minister for Transport. Those aircraft that operate outside the conditions of the curfew constitute a third category. The aircraft in the last category break or breach the curfew; the others do not since they operate within the conditions of the curfew. The answer to Question 3129 gave details of aircraft that operated with the approval of the Minister for Transport. No aircraft broke the curfew.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Since all the aircraft listed in the answer to Question 3129 operated within the conditions of the curfew their operation does not amount to a breaking of the curfew. The reason for the curfew is to provide relief to residents around Brisbane Airport during the sensitive sleeping hours by eliminating unnecessary flights by noisy jet aircraft.

      <para>
       Both the interests of the residents and the interests of the passengers are taken into account when approval to operate during the curfew is considered. The degree of hardship to the residents, which consists primarily of annoyance and sleep arousal, is considered. The following factors are taken into account, whether the aircraft is arriving or departing (departing aircraft cause more annoyance than landing aircraft); the time of the proposed flight (flights before midnight cause less annoyance than flights at, say, 3 a.m.); the type of aircraft (some aircraft types are noisier than others); and the available runway (operations on some runway cause less annoyance than operations on other runways).
      </para>
      <para>
       The circumstances surrounding the plight of the passengers are also considered. For example, the number of passengers, the availability of accommodation should the request be refused, the reason for the delay (industrial action, mechanical problems, weather etc.) and any alternative action available to the airlines.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of the sixteen flights that operated during the period 1 March 1980 to 31 July 1980, all occurred before midnight, all six departing aircraft departed into the north-east over Moreton Bay and all but two of the arriving aircraft landed over Moreton Bay, ten of the delays were associated with industrial action and the remainder with adverse weather conditions. In these circumstances proper consideration was given the residents of Brisbane.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) For a person to be eligible to receive a Service pension, which is similar to the age and invalid pensions paid by the Department of Social Security and which is subject broadly to the same income test, he must have served in a theatre of war or, in the case of a female, served in a theatre of war, served abroad or embarked for service abroad.
      </para>
      <para>
       Service in a theatre of war is defined in section 23 of the Repatriation Act 1920 as follows-
      </para>
      <para>
       '' 'Served in a theatre of war' means served at sea, in the field or in the air, in naval, military or aerial operations against the enemy in an area, or on an aircraft or ship of war, at a time when danger from hostile forces of the enemy was incurred in that area or on that aircraft or ship of war by the person so serving''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Repatriation Commission has established certain guidelines, which relate in essence to recorded enemy activity in and around certain areas, for the application of this definition. In respect of service on Rottnest Island, the requirement is that a veteran must have served for a continuous period of not less than 3 months on the island between 3 September 1939 and 4 May 1944.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Airmen who operated aircraft out of Darwin to islands contiguous to the coast, will be deemed to have served in a theatre of war if-
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) between 3 September 1939 and 3 September 1945 they served in an aircraft which engaged in operations against the enemy or on reconnaissance or patrol duty over enemy occupied territory; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) between 19 February 1942 and 12 November 1943 they served for a continuous period of not less than three months in the Northern Territory north of parallel 14.5* south latitude or any of the islands contiguous to that part of the Northern Territory; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) at any time during the war they incurred actual danger from hostile forces.
      </para>
      <para>
       If they served in an aircraft which did not engage in operations against the enemy or in reconnaissance or patrol duty over enemy occupied territory, they would not qualify under the first provision above.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although it is recorded that islands such as Bathurst and Melville were attacked by Japanese aircraft on their way to the first bombing raid on Darwin on 19 February 1942 and that one or two Japanese aircraft were either shot down or crash landed on the islands, the islands were not enemy occupied. Therefore reconnaissance flights over the islands could not be considered as patrols over enemy occupied territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       In setting down guidelines, it is recognised that it is not possible to cover every possible situation that may arise. However, this does not automatically preclude from entitlement to benefits any person whose service does not come within the guidelines. All such cases are considered on their individual merits.

       The Prime Minister did not offer, neither as we understand it is the US considering, homeporting in Australia for nuclear powered vessels. For the information of Senator Chipp I would add that it is physically impossible for any nuclear reactor accident to result in an atomic bomb-type explosion. I refer Senator Chipp to paragraph 34 of the document 'Enrivonmental Consideration of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warship to Australia'. The presence in Australian ports from time to time of nuclear powered warships gives rise to no risk of such an explosion or therefore any need for nuclear shelters.

       Unfortunately the type of information you seek is not readily available in the form suggested in your question. In operational units themselves very few civilians are employed and the effects of industrial disruption have been negligible. The civilians involved would be most likely typists and clerical assistants covered by the Australian Public Service Association or possibly, the Federated Clerks Union.
      </para>
      <para>
       Less directly, in support functions, civilians are widely employed in categories covered by most of the larger and prominent industrial unions. These functions include administrative, stores, transport, building and vehicle maintenance and in the Navy area particularly, ship building and repair. Recent industrial action by employees in stores areas has caused delays in the sailing of some RAN fleet units.
      </para>
      <para>
       Outside the Naval area industrial disputation has been troublesome but not necessarily serious. For instance since 1975 members of the following organisations are reported to have lost time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Total manhours
      </para>

       Administrative and Clerical Officers Association  13,788 Australian Public Service Association  1,238 Transport Workers Union  772 Commonwealth Foremen's Association  2,170 Australian Public Service Artisans Association  417 Association of Draughting, Supervisory and Technical Employees  520 Federated Storemen and Packers Union  14,321 Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union  274 Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union  400 Australasian Society of Engineers  50 Electrical Trades Union  130 Federated Ironworkers Association 873 Operative Painters and Decorators Union  75 Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union  110 Printing and Kindred Industry Union  134
      </para>
      <para>
       Total  35,272
      </para>
      <para>
       Most of the time lost was due to national campaigns relating to pay claims and in protest against Government legislation. A further 8,500 manhours in addition to the 35,272 above were lost in the Medibank campaign.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Navy area, particularly in dockyards which operate within the general waterfront industrial environment disputation features regularly and is the cause of deep concern. In that area alone there could be some 30 industrial organisations covering both staff and wages employees in various locations. Organisations and employees in particular locations often react industrially with independence and in the period you mention scarcely a week would have passed without a stoppage being reported somewhere. The reasons for such industrial action would range from local domestic issues to national campaigns.
      </para>
      <para>
       While it has not been practicable to provide a more definitive response to this question, should you require specific information related to this subject I would be happy to ask my Department to look into the matter.

      </para>
      <para>
       Problems inherent in Teletext include ghosting that produces errors in messages. The Department is monitoring error rates during trial transmissions by broadcasters as part of an assessment program, and the overseas developers of Teletext are understood to be attempting to reduce errors to an acceptable level.

       I presume the honourable senator is referring to the Standards for the Technical Equipment and Operation of Television Stations. These standards, which reflect international standards and practices, are intended to ensure that the radiated signal of a television station is of sufficient quality to provide for satisfactory operation of television receivers.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not conceded that meeting technical standards constitutes the major cost in operating a community television facility. The most significant costs are in program preparation and the operation of transmitting facilities (which are essentially independent of the quality of the technical equipment used). The present technical standards allow for equipment which does not meet their requirement to be approved by me for specific purposes, especially where the nature of programming is such that a lower quality picture is acceptable to viewers. However, no foreseeable relaxation of technical standards, including one which would lower the quality of the radiated signal, is expected to substantially alter the operational costs of community access television.

      <para>
       (1) Are manually assisted trunk calls, where an additional charge is made because the caller had the opportunity of using STD but chose to use an operator, dearer than STD due to the following factors in the tariff structure:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the calls are charged in multiples of three minutes, so that a minute called is charged as for three, and a four minute call as for six;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) there is a surcharge, currently 70c, on each such call; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) during the period when STD calls are subject to a discount, manually assisted calls are still charged the full rate, so that a one hour call from Canberra to Adelaide, after 9 p.m., costs $21.60 by STD but $54.70 via the operator, an effective total surcharge of $33.10.
      </para>
      <para>

       (3) What is the justification for making these additional charges.

        —The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. However, it is unusual for calls to be as extensive as the example given in (c). Telecom Australia advised that studies conducted in 1979 showed that the average duration of a manually connected trunk call is 5.1 minutes in which case the price differential is much lower.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) There were about 54 million operator assisted telephone trunk calls connected in 1979-80 and the total earnings from these calls amounted to approximately $134m. However, it would not be possible to indicate the order of revenue that could have been received for the calls if STD rates had applied, without an exhaustive study of telephone trunk call dockets.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Telephone trunk calls booked with an exchange operator cost far more to handle than those dialled automatically by a subscriber. A recent study showed that, on average, additional costs in excess of $2.50 a call were incurred when connection by an operator was involved. Penalty rates are also payable to operating staff handling these calls in the evening and at weekends.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) and (5) Telecom has advised that there are a variety of alternative tariff structures which have been or could be considered.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to the suggestion that a manually connected call be charged as near as practicable to the cost of the equivalent STD call, Telecom is of the opinion that, if telephonists were required to time and charge on an elapsed time basis, its operating costs would inevitably increase further because a greater degree of supervision of calls would be required and telephonists would take longer to work out the cost of such calls because of the varying charging arrangements that would apply. These factors, in turn, would reduce the number of calls that could be handled in a given period of time. In regard to the suggestion of a 50 per cent surcharge, the present fee of 70 cents is designed primarily to offset, to some extent, the labour costs involved in effecting the connection of the call. These costs do not vary to any appreciable extent with distance. Under the approach suggested the shorter distance calls would attract a relatively low operator surcharge whilst those made over the larger distances would attract a high fee which would be difficult to justify on the grounds of costs incurred.
      </para>
      <para>
       Overall, Telecom considers that the existing charging arrangements most appropriately reflect the factors involved, i.e. duration, distance and the costs of handling a particular call.

       (a) to (e) There is no provision on Department of Social Security claim forms to identify whether an applicant is an Aboriginal. The Department does not, therefore, maintain regular statistics on the number of Aboriginals in receipt of unemployment benefit.

      <para>
       Certain information on Aboriginals in receipt of unemployment benefit is obtained at the time of each Quarterly Survey of Unemployment Benefit Recipients conducted by my Department. The information on whether or not an unemployment beneficiary is an Aboriginal is based on an identification system adopted by the Commonwealth Employment Service at the time of registration for work. However, statistics on Aboriginals in receipt of unemployment benefit have not been published for the last 3 years in the Report of the Quarterly Survey of Unemployment beneficiaries due to doubts about the reliability of these figures.
      </para>

       The possibility of collecting statistics on Aboriginals in receipt of social security payments by means of an additional question on application forms is currently under examination.

       (1) Aboriginal housing programs funded by the Commonwealth in the five financial years (1975-76 to 1979-80) enable the purchase or construction of 4,379 houses. In addition, 1,356 housing loans were granted by the Aboriginal Loans Commission.

       (2) 164.861m was spent by the Commonwealth on Aboriginal housing programs in the five financial years (1975-76 to 1979-80). In addition to purchase or construction of housing, these funds were applied to repairs and maintenance of housing, operating expenses of Aboriginal Housing Associations and Housing Boards and provision of homemaker services. The total value of the housing loans granted by the Aboriginal Loans Commission during the five year period was $38.799m.

       (3) Responsibility for occupancy of the housing rests with the owners, that it, Aboriginal Housing Associations, State and Northern Territory Housing Authorities and individuals. All houses provided with Commonwealth funds allocated to Aboriginal housing programs are intended to be used for Aboriginal people and their families. At any given time, only a small number of houses will be temporarily vacant as a result of tenancy changes, maintenance and repairs, or traditional reasons.

      <para>
       (1) Yes-Research has been undertaken on a laboratory scale in the US on the conversion of water hyacinth to methane which can be used as a transport fuel. Research by the US National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) indicated yields of about 14 cubic metres of methane (equivalent to 9 litres of petrol) per tonne of water hyacinth which contains 93 per cent to 96 per cent water.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) CSIRO is not undertaking research on the use of water hyacinth for fuel production. Results from the only relevant study in Australia of which CSIRO is aware, suggests that some 30 to 50 tonnes/hectare of dry matter per year could be obtained from water hyacinth growing in the Fitzroy River in Queensland. From 2000 ha, the estimated harvestable area of infestation in the Fitzroy in 1973, the equivalent of only about 0.1 per cent of the petrol used in Australia in 1977-78 could theoretically be produced.
      </para>
      <para>
       This information suggests that the area of water in Australia capable of producing recoverable water hyacinth is inadequate to support the production of alternative fuel on an economically attractive basis at the present time. Associated technical problems could further reduce the viability of such an undertaking.
