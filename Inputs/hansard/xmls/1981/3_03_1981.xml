         —The Government Information Unit has a central staff of four in Canberra and a Federal information director in each State capital. The Unit provides a service to Ministers who do not have Press secretaries. The Government has decided to enhance the effectiveness of the Unit through a modest increase in staff numbers. An additional media officer and two support staff are being appointed to the central office, and each Federal information director is to have a support staff member. Provision is also made for the appointment of a Federal information director in Darwin. The total expenditure on the Unit in 1979-80 was $279,018. It is estimated that expenditure in 1980-81 will be $340,000. This is a quite modest amount when compared with the expenditure by State governments on public relations activities. For instance-I say this with the knowledge of the huge expenditure made by the Whitlam Government in this regard-the New South Wales Government spends upwards of $1m on its public relations machinery and information services. Similar amounts are spent in Victoria and Queensland. The Government has a responsibility to ensure that its policies, programs and activities are effectively communicated. The Government Information Unit performs this role at a minimum cost to the taxpayer.

         —My question, which is addressed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, concerns the interdepartmental committee which is preparing a new legislative base for the development of an Australian nuclear industry. Is the Minister aware that the Australian States, particularly the Premiers, are currently falling over each other to sell off our coal reserves cheaply to multinational aluminium companies? Does he agree that it is utterly inept economic management to denude ourselves of coal in this way and then to assert that we have to have nuclear power plants because we are short of energy resources? Will the Minister consider setting up a Federal interdepartmental committee into solar energy, tidal energy and other forms of energy which will not produce toxic wastes lasting hundreds of thousands of years? Has he noted the committee's suggestion that 'another issue requiring further attention is provision for liability and compensation for nuclear damage'? Why is the committee contemplating such a hideous event? Has the Minister any conception of or information on what the term 'nuclear damage' entails for Australia?

         —I think the basis of Senator Chipp's question flows from a misunderstanding of the work of the interdepartmental committee. It is not normal for me to comment upon something that appears in the Press as an apparent leak because, along with many other senators, I hold in contempt those who leak documents. Having said that, I am happy to report that, as is known, the Prime Minister set up an interdepartmental committee basically to look at the whole question of the recasting of the Atomic Energy Act. The Atomic Energy Act had been, in the past, basically a defence Act. A lot of nuclear requirements these days are non-defence. For example, in industry, medicine, science and nuclear physics radioactive isotopes are a major subject. So there is a need to recast the whole of the Act. The IDC has been working on that. The terms of reference for a general review of the Atomic Energy Act were announced and tabled in Parliament by the Deputy Prime Minister on 21 August last year. These state that the review would take account of, amongst other things, the requirements for the regulation, licensing and development of a nuclear industry in Australia, but in no way do they foreshadow that one is likely in the near or immediate future.

        A report has been prepared by officials and it will be considered by the Government in due course. This, of course, will be of major importance. As to the first part of Senator Chipp's question, I am aware that there is an important discussion going on at this moment as to the use of the various resources of this country-coal, bauxite, alumina, aluminium-and their relative uses so as to get the maximum or optimum benefit for the Australian community. I think a Senate committee is doing a valuable service in studying the aluminium industry. At this moment there is a dialogue as to whether the cost of coal in producing electricity for aluminium production is a real cost. I think that dialogue is a healthy one in the public interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no suggestion that I know of at this moment that a nuclear power plant be established in Australia. The Government and I are greatly concerned that all our resources, particularly coal, shall be used to their best advantage. We have a responsibility to export because of the shortage of energy overseas. We have to balance exports, power generation, coal liquefaction and the employment of Australians. A much more important consideration overriding those factors is the preservation of reserves for the generations ahead. These considerations raise important questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been asked whether we will establish an interdepartmental committee on solar or tidal energy. I only wish that the present knowledge on solar energy were sufficient for us to probe further at this immediate time to develop it further. My estimate is that by the year 2000-that is about 20 years down the track-about 8 per cent of Australian energy will be provided by the renewable source of solar energy. If it is possible to increase that percentage we will try to do that, but at this moment there are great barriers in scientific knowledge. The best thing to do now is to apply significant research. We are doing so. Many attempts to use tidal energy are being made in the world. We have some disabilities in Australia, even though we have high tides in such places as Broome and Darwin. We are looking at that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chipp asked about possible nuclear damage. I acknowledge that any abuse or misuse of nuclear energy would cause harm. I have to say that one of the great worries current throughout the world today is that the contemplated volume of coal used for world-wide thermal use could cause-not only by pollution but also by altering the atmosphere-all sorts of great threats to health; indeed, threats to health at least parallel to those of nuclear energy. We must not simply look at any one situation. That is not to say that we are not conscious of the situation. We in Australia have the highest standards of preservation in supervision of nuclear activities. We will take the same steps with the use of coal. Throughout the world there needs to be a balance in coal for export, power generation and liquefaction. But, above everything else, there must be a preservation for the future. Within that context we will need to get an energy balance. If, in the longer term future nuclear energy is considered to be of use in Australia, I am utterly sure that it will be utilised only with the maximum safeguards that are known to science.

Of course, it has always been assumed by government that it has a responsibility to make known, by publishing, accurate accounts of the laws that are passed.

        In addition, arrangements have been made with certain publishers to publish Acts of Parliament which are in particular demand. For instance, CCH Australia Ltd's publications have provided a very useful service. By and large the publishers are more interested in doing work of that kind in respect of Acts for which there is a great deal of demand, although some representations have been made to me by Butterworths Pty Ltd to publish Acts on a wider scale. However, as far as I am aware, not a great many people are interested in publishing Acts of Parliament broadly. Where there is a special interest in specific Acts we have made arrangements with those interested publishers to permit the publication of such Acts. I believe that the needs of the public are being pretty well served by the present methods of publication.

        Similarly, spouses may qualify for special benefit where hardship is shown to have occurred.

        I am advised also that unemployed people in isolated areas may also be assisted under the Commonwealth's Fares and Assistance Scheme. Details of these programs can be made available on request. Other services also exist, including regular visits by vocational officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service to assist job seekers to find suitable employment. In addition to this, I think it ought to be said that the Commonwealth Employment Service has, as one of its fundamental objectives, the matching of people who are seeking employment and job vacancies of which it is aware. I believe improvements in service have resulted from some measures that have been undertaken. However, I will refer Senator Watson's question to the Minister to see whether he wishes to make any further response on this matter.

I make an appeal for good sense to prevail and for the unionists to go back to work.

         —The Government would examine on their merits suggestions from anyone who put them forward. In that spirit we have in fact examined the suggestions made by Mr Hawke. Of course, Mr Hawke's suggestions contain a fundamental difficulty in terms of the principle I outlined. One of Mr Hawke's suggestions is that Qantas must accept bans applied by a union or unions regardless of the nature of such bans, their duration or their impact on the operations of the company. In other words, the bans could be applied to individual aircraft or to individual pieces of equipment. They could be applied by one or more unions. That would, in fact, be a device that could bring the airline to a halt by indirect means.

        In any case, as I understand it, Mr Hawke's thesis envisaged permitting the use of staff labour when there were wild-cat strikes but not when there were not wild-cat strikes. The fact is that, if it is right to keep an airline going by using staff labour in wild-cat strikes, it is right to keep an airline going at any time. I guess there would be a great deal of contention as to what is a wild-cat strike and what is an ordinary strike; but, fundamentally, no government and certainly no airline could agree that it would accept the right of a union, in terms of a settlement, to impose bans, in fact to blackban aircraft or equipment. On that basis, there is really nothing new in what Mr Hawke has said, and it is not practicable within the principles.

The Baha'is, for instance, are denied any constitutional rights as a religious minority and have suffered gross discrimination including imprisonment and execution without fair trial, destruction of property and desecration of their holy places. It has become clear that the Baha'i faith is under systematic attack. This pattern of persecution runs counter to the Islamic ideals espoused by the Iranian Revolution and reflects a derogation from civilised standards which is also apparent, though on a lesser scale, in the Iranian authorities' treatment of the constitutionally recognised Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian minorities.

I am advised that the location of telephone facilities at official post offices is covered by an agreement between Australia Post and Telecom Australia. The rental charged for space for such facilities has remained unchanged for the past five-year period to 30 June 1980.

        A flat charge has applied throughout Australia for the location of telephones at official post offices and the charge has consisted of several components including rental of space, electricity consumption and lamp maintenance. Australia Post considers that any proposed increase in the charge would not be exorbitant but would reflect present market rental values. Telecom does not intend that the public should be denied additional telephone facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        When considering particular sites, however, Telecom believes that any proposed increases in the basic charge must be viewed against the costs, visibility and other aspects of alternative sites. Should the honourable senator have any particular location or locations in mind, Telecom would be pleased to investigate the matter further.

There are at least two of them in this place at present. I take it that the honourable senator is referring to medical benefit rebates payable to people for obstetrical services. My understanding is that this is something that emerged over the years when medical rebates were obtained on different costings which were attributed to the doctors operating in each State. I had thought there had been some movement over the last few years towards uniform benefit rebates. If there is a remaining problem I will get some more detailed information for the honourable senator.

The very point in issue is the language in which he cast his question. You ruled out of order the terms in which he put the question, not the substance of the question.

        Senator Walsh-I note that there is one difference in the wording, although of similar meaning. In the earlier question I referred to 300,000 misappropriated dollars. Today I referred to 200,000 stolen dollars, $100,000 of the amount having been paid back since the earlier question was asked. I am quite willing to withdraw the word 'stolen' and to substitute the word 'misappropriated'.

       <para>
        Senator Walsh-Mr Deputy President, these proceedings are out of order, as has been everything that has transpired in this Senate since I moved dissent from your ruling that my question was out of order. Having already entered a caveat about that, I draw your attention to a number of other matters which are already on the public record. The relevant sequence of events is this: On 6 June 1979, following a number of public disclosures and a number of debates, both in this Senate and in the House of Representatives, the present Minister for Communications publicly admitted that his father had misappropriated from the Reliance group of companies moneys in excess of $400,000. He also admitted that those moneys had been paid into the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd of which he was the primary beneficiary. A deed of arrangement issued by the present Minister for Communications on 1 August 1980 stated that under an agreement reached with members of the Walsh family the Minister undertook to forgo immediate claims for cash payment to his father's estate of $130,000 for accountancy and other fees due from the Reliance group of companies and agreed to repay, in three instalments, commencing with an instalment of $100,000 on 1 November last year, 300,000 additional dollars. Presumably since no public statement has been made, that $100,000 was paid on 1 November and $200,000 remains yet to be paid. That sequence of facts, which I stress came mostly from the mouth and the pen of the Minister concerned, prompted me to ask a question on 5 December last year, which reads in full:
       </para>
       <para>
        My question to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, who is representing the Prime Minister in this place, refers to a statement made in the House of Representatives on 6 June last year in which the present Minister for Communications acknowledged that several hundred thousand dollars misappropriated by G. M. Sinclair had been paid into the account of the Sinclair Pastoral Co. and that by a deed of arrangement dated 1 August 1979 the Minister agreed to repay $300,000 commencing on 1 November 1980. Will the Deputy Leader of the Government ask the Prime Minister whether public documents reveal that up to 1 November this year a family company of the Minister for Communications was the custodian and beneficiary of 300,000 misappropriated dollars and whether the Prime Minister approves of the use of misappropriated funds as working capital for private ministerial businesses? If the Prime Minister does not so approve, why did he reappoint Mr Sinclair to the Cabinet?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy President, I stress that that earlier question, which although more expansive and supplying more background information than the question I asked this afternoon is, in essence and even substantially in words, identical. The question I asked on 5 December was accepted without dissent by the President who was in the chair and accepted, apparently without objection, by Senator Durack, the then Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate and by every other honourable senator present at the time. Senator Durack said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I will refer that question to the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only substantial difference from the question I asked today-many might argue whether there was a substantial difference though there is some semantic difference-is that whereas previously I referred to 'misappropriated dollars', which are still, on his own public admission, in the custody of the present Minister for Communications, today I referred to 'stolen dollars'. I have already agreed to withdraw the reference to 'stolen dollars' and to substitute 'misappropriated dollars'. I do not believe that either the facts, which are not disputed by the Minister concerned, or the terms of the question, which were not objected to by the President or by anyone else when it was first asked on 5 December 1980, oblige me, Mr Deputy President, to go any further than I have done. I submit that the question ought to remain and that your naming of me be withdrawn. I also submit again that everything which has taken place in the Senate since I moved dissent from your ruling that the question was out of order, is itself out of order.

         —Earlier in Question Time Senator Colston asked me a question about a 15-year-old girl and her entitlement to special benefit. I indicated that I did not have the information he requested. I have since had a look at the Social Services Act and, in particular, section 124 which provides that the Director-General may in his discretion grant a special benefit to categories of person who are not otherwise entitled to benefit. With respect to the payment of benefit to a person under the age of 16 years there has been a standard practice, I understand, since the early 1970s, which restricts the rate of benefit paid to such a person to $10 a week.

        Having had the opportunity of a quick perusal of this document I noticed that, whilst the Minister of Water Resources in South Australia was present at the meeting in June of last year, I could find no reference at all to Mr Arnold's having referred to the quality of the River Murray water. That concerns me somewhat because since that time Mr Arnold has gone public with many complaints about the quality of the River Murray water. I would have thought that he would have raised that issue at the meeting, particularly with the Ministers from Victoria and New South Wales because those are the two other States involved. It may well be that the full copy of the minutes of the Water Resources Council meetings are not attached to the document which has been presented to the Parliament. I will have to make inquiries to see whether this matter was raised but is not recorded in the report. If it was not raised, I express my very great concern that Mr Arnold did not raise it in view of the fact that almost daily in the Press and the other media in South Australia he is criticising Victoria and New South Wales for sending saline water into South Australia. I will have something to say about that in more detail when I speak either later tonight or tomorrow when the amendment to the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech comes back on for debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the Dunstan and Corcoran governments were in office in South Australia they were cognisant that this was a very delicate matter, that South Australia, being on the receiving end of the water that comes down the River Murray, could not be overcritical of the other two States because they have first use of the River Murray, and that it may suit those two States not to have a River Murray waters agreement. It is only by their good grace and common sense that we have that agreement which we hope will be amended so that South Australia will have some legal right to better quality water. If Mr Arnold continues to carry on in the way in which he has been carrying on, I think he could put the whole agreement in jeopardy. I will say quite a bit more about that after I have made some further inquiries today by telephone. As I said, I will be speaking at some length on this matter when we debate the amendment to the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        That the Senate affirms the validity of Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission Determination No. 503 of 1980 and deplores the Government's expressed intention to reject the Commission's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the major matters facing this democracy in the latter part of the twentieth century is the question of the loyalty of the Public Service to the principles of democracy. It is a major tenet of democracy that those who are elected to govern ought to be in a position to claim the respect and loyalty of the public servants who are there to administer the laws of a democracy. However, I believe that the action of the Government in proposing to move dissent in the other place from the Arbitration Commission's Determination No. 503 after the public servants had gone through the processes of arbitration is doing little to enhance the claim by the Government for loyalty in the eyes of the Public Service. Last week we witnessed the unprecedented action of a relatively large group of Commonwealth public servants going on strike in protest against actions by this Government which the public servants saw as a threat to their conditions of service.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Public Service Board might try to skate over what happened by claiming that only a certain percentage of public servants actually engaged in strike activity and absented themselves last Tuesday, but the more relevant point is that those absent from work represented the largest number of public servants to go on strike in the history of the Public Service. What is happening is that the Government is engaged in a line of attack which has the effect of promoting the politicisation of the Public Service unions. I would like to think that the Government is not doing this deliberately but is quite unconscious of the effects of its actions. But the more I study the problem the more I come to the conclusion that this Government is not very concerned about the damage that it is doing to responsible unionism. Rather, it has seized upon the Public Service as an area where it will be extremely provocative, and when public servants react it will come crashing down like a ton of bricks upon them, all for the purpose of electoral public relations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Previous provocative actions by this Government have resulted in a turn-round of the leadership of the largest Public Service union, namely, the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. That union had leaders who were progressive and quite vocal in the fields of negotiation and arbitration but, because of the attitudes of and actions taken by the Government, this union is now under the control, in a number of States, of what are called militants. I refer to them as Volvo-socialists and white wine whingers. But responsible union leaders who pinned their faith to the way of the arbiter now have the retort shouted at them: 'But look what happened. We went to arbitration and now the Government wants to throw out the Full Bench's determination. We were told to go to the arbitrator-to the umpire-and now the Government, not being satisfied with the umpire's decision, seeks to disallow that decision by using its numbers in the House of Representatives'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting indeed that the Government has chosen the House of Representatives in which to move dissent from this determination of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and not the Senate, although it is basing its dissent on an opinion given by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I will speak about that a little more at a later stage. I do not deny that the Parliament has the power under the Public Service Arbitration Act to reject determinations from the Arbitrator, but I point out that of perhaps the tens of thousands of determinations which have been tabled in this Parliament only four have been rejected. I remind honourable senators of the statement by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Viner. He declared that this particular determination ought to be dissented from. So far as I can recall-and honourable senators may correct me if I am wrong-the Minister made a statement that the determination was accompanied by a letter from Mr R. H. C. Watson, Acting Public Service Arbitrator, which stated that he was of the opinion that these determinations were not or might not be in accordance with the following laws of the Commonwealth, namely, the Public Service Act 1922 and the Public Service Salaries Regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I recall it, Mr Viner made great play of the fact that that letter had been attached to determinations nos 503 and 504 to be tabled in this House. But let me remind the Senate that last year 400 determinations from the Public Service Arbitrator were tabled in the Senate and that 329 of those were accompanied by the same statement or similar statements by the Arbitrator-that they may or may not be in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth. The Government advances a trite sort of argument. It says that just because it is par for the course for an arbitrator to attach such a statement to a determination it is grounds for a determination to be disallowed. This determination has that statement attached to it. In that statement the Arbitrator says that it may not be in accordance with the Public Service Act. But the Attorney-General, in his statement, says that it is not in accordance with the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. Last year, 400 determinations provided no problem to senators and to members of the House of Representatives and none was disallowed. So why all the fuss about Determination No. 503? I suggest that it has a great deal to do with symbolism and electoral public relations. I suggest that the appropriate course for this Parliament is to let No. 503 proceed and if the Government really believes that it is contrary to the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act it can challenge it in the High Court. That is the place where the Government should challenge the determination; it should not use its numbers in this Parliament against the umpire's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further evidence that the Government's case is extremely weak is found in the fact that this question of whether or not Determination 503 is or may be contrary to the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act was discussed by the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I refer to the tabled documents which comprise a copy of the determination, a copy of the covering letter by the Acting Public Service Arbitrator-such a letter accompanies almost every determination that comes into this chamber-and a statement by Senator Durack. But Senator Durack is not even in this chamber to defend his opinion. He knows that his opinion is really simply a rehash of the particular laws of the Parliament. There are very few words of opinion in it other than the expression of opinion that the receptive provisions of Determination No. 503 and of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act are in direct conflict in that the Act obliges the permanent head and the Board respectively to issue instruments in certain circumstances whereas the determination provides that they shall not do so unless other circumstances have occurred. Senator Durack went on in his statement with a number of other matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the question of whether the determination was in accord with the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act was canvassed before the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Full Bench of the Commission said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a determination giving the applicants rights relating to consultation and prescribing periods of time for various procedures would not be out of 'accord' with the Redeployment and Retirement Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        There we have the learned judges of the Full Bench, this question having been canvassed before them, stating that their determination would not be out of accord with the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. Yet the Attorney-General of this Commonwealth came into this chamber, tabled a statement and then shot out of the chamber. He was not game enough to stay and defend it against the opinion of the judges of the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Whose opinion are we to have respect for? Are we to respect the opinion of the members of the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission before whom all of these points were laid out and before whom senior counsel from both sides-from the Government and from the unions-put forward their viewpoints, and who decided that their determination would not be out of accord with the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act? Or are we to respect the opinions of a Minister who comes into this chamber with a piece of paper, throws it on the table of the Senate and then darts out of the chamber and is not game enough to come back in and defend it? Under those circumstances whom are we to place faith in?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General claimed in his statement accompanying the Determination that it is out of accord. Let the Attorney-General come before this Senate and let him argue against what the Full Bench of his own Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has said and so do it justice if he is not prepared to do the Senate justice because in my view it is an insult to the Full Bench of the Commission for an Attorney-General to act in the way that Senator Durack has acted. Remember also that the Arbitrator in his statement accompanying the Determination did not mention the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. He did not say that the Determination was contrary to that Act. He cited the Public Service Act as the one with which it is or may be out of accord. The Attorney-General, from what I have seen in the short time that I have had to read his opinion, does not say that it is out of accord with the Public Service Act. He does say that the Determination is not in accord with a law of the Commonwealth, namely, the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979. The Arbitrator did not say that it is out of accord with that piece of legislation. Why is there this difference? There is obviously a conflict of opinion between the Attorney-General and the Arbitrator and between the Attorney-General and the Full Bench of the Commission before which these matters were canvassed and which stated that the procedures laid down by Determination No. 503 would not be out of accord with the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely the proper way for this matter to be resolved is to facilitate its coming before the High Court. Let not the Government use its numbers in the House of Representatives. The Government is not game enough to put a dissent motion in this Senate. The Government will do it in the House of Representatives where it has got the numbers in bags full. Surely the proper way would be not to use its numbers in a matter in which there is an obvious conflict between the opinion of the Attorney-General and the Full Bench of the Commission. Surely the best way for this to be resolved would be to facilitate the matter coming before the High Court which would mean leaving the Determination alive at least for such a challenge to proceed. I am asking the Senate to act not in a manner which is out of character but in its usual manner to allow this Determination to have effect.

         —The Australian Democrats very strongly support Senator Harradine in the action that he has taken. Unhappily my understanding of the law accords with Senator Missen's. In practical terms even if the Senate did pass Senator Harradine's motion it would make no difference unless, as Senator Harradine has already said, the Government heeded a resolution of this Senate and changed its mind. If I have not stated the correct legal position I would be grateful if some honourable senator, with the indulgence of the Chair, would correct me. As I understand it, that is the situation. Not withstanding Senator Missen's truthful interjection, I think Senator Harradine ought to be commended for bringing this matter forward today, to allow honourable senators to express a view. I hope honourable senators like Senator Missen who, I am persuaded, would agree with essentially what Senator Harradine said, would at least make a statement on the rather shabby tactic which has been adopted by the Government in this matter.

        I totally agree with the remarks of Senator Harradine insofar as this matter is so large in its implications that the Determination should be kept alive and dealt with in the only proper place that such a determination should be decided, namely, the High Court. What is the objection to that course of action? We are not talking about some piddling issue. We are talking about something which has had most public servants deeply worried and concerned. Thousands of them are concerned. Today in something that was tacked on to the papers list, as Senator Harradine suggested, the Attorney-General has given-I say this with great respect-an excuse for a legal opinion. That is appended to the Determination. I do not expect Senator Messner to react to my invitation as you, Mr Deputy President, might rule me out of order, but I would be grateful if Senator Messner, who is in charge of the business now before the House, would indicate by interjection whether Senator Durack is engaged at a Cabinet meeting at the moment. Is that the reason for his absence from the Senate? What significant reason is there for Senator Durack, the Attorney-General, absenting himself from the chamber when the very opinion upon which the Government's reaction to Determination No. 503 of 1980 is based is being discussed? Is the Attorney at a Cabinet meeting or attending to some urgent business?

         —If Senator Messner responds-and I hope a Minister will-I hope that an extraordinarily good reason is advanced why the Attorney-General is not in the chamber at this stage. I reiterate very briefly our reasons for agreeing with Senator Harradine. He has put his reasons very succinctly and logically. The Government wished to reduce Public Service numbers as much as possible as part of its cost-cutting exercise. Today I will not canvass the wisdom or otherwise of that decision. That has been done before. The Government introduced the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act in April 1979. This Act gave the Government much wider powers in the area of compulsory redeployment and retirement of public servants than had previously been the case. That was the Government's intention. Honourable senators may agree or disagree with it but that was an Act of Parliament. Understandably it caused widespread industrial unrest, especially among members of the major Public Service unions-the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, the Australian Public Service Association and the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. It is interesting that the Federated Clerks Union is not, to my knowledge, a notoriously left wing, radical, communist-led union. A combination of moderate left wing and right wing unions are united in their opposition to some sections of the Act.

       <para>
        During this unrest the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and later, Mr Anthony, while he was Acting Prime Minister, called on the unions in a most statesman-like way to use conciliation and arbitration machinery which they described as 'the way of the umpire'. Anyone who tries to interpret the English language in a fairly strict sense would have assumed from that that both Mr Fraser and Mr Anthony, speaking with the full authority of the Cabinet, would have said: 'All right, unions; no strikes, no bans clauses, no go-slows, no refusal to work as directed: Go to the umpire'. The inference was that what the umpire said the Government would accept. On 23 December 1980 the Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission handed down Determination 503 of 1980, which in effect makes it much harder for the Federal Government to retire or redeploy public servants in some circumstances. In connection with that matter I have a brief summary of the gains made by Determination 503 of 1980 which will be subject to disallowance. I am sorry that I did not pay the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) the courtesy of showing him the document earlier. It is only four paragraphs long. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.

         —I thank the Senate. On 5 February 1981-just five or six weeks later- the Government announced that it would move under Section 22 of the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920 to disallow Determination 503 of 1980, which has the effect of altering Parliament's intention. I think the unions have every right to question this matter. The Government said: 'Play the game and accept the umpire's decision: We will'. The unions played the game, the umpire made his decision and put the finger up and the Government refused to go out. I would have thought that at a time when this nation is on the brink of some chaos with the airline industry, when a confrontation is being courted with the Builders Labourers Federation and when industrial disputations are rising on several other fronts, the Government and this new Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) would want a profile of bona fides and a reputation as being a Government of its word. I would have thought that no other single act could have possibly discredited the Government or the new Minister in that sense more than this act.

If some device is used by the Government to gag this debate so that the motion is not put to a vote today, I would think that any Government senator or any Government Minister who again speaks about the sacredness of the Senate, the institution of the Senate or any more of that garbage would be declaring himself, by his own words, to be a hypocrite.

         —I would like to associate myself and my party with this motion. I wish to speak particularly because Senator Missen said that it makes no difference. It is not a motion that argues whether in law Determination 503 should remain or not, but it has vital importance. It shows that the Senate is sufficiently fair-minded to accept the umpire's decision on this question. Until this time the Government has never taken any action against working class people or the trade unions in an industrial matter unless the matter has gone to arbitration. At the moment there is an application before the Federal Court of Australia for the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation because it will not accept the decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on the Omega station in Victoria. The Government cannot have it both ways. If non-acceptance of an arbitration decision is justification for action against the Builders Labourers Federation surely it is justification for action against the Government for disallowing Determination 503.

        I do not know what industrial disputation the Government's action will cause. The Public Service, through its union, has decided to defer any action until such time as dismissals take place. I think it has decided that there will be a stoppage of work if a dismissal takes place under the rescinded determination. However long the disputation may last or whatever dislocation it may cause, there can never be justification for the Government taking action against the union or applying for its deregistration. The reason for the Government's application against the Builders Labourers Federation was that the BLF failed to accept an arbitration decision. If the Government says that it believes in the system of arbitration but refuses to accept an arbitration decision, as it has in this instance, it does not say much for the future of industrial relations in this country. If at any time one party disagrees with the decision of the umpire it will be open slather for that party to take appropriate action. It is true that the law permits the Government to disallow this determination.

But the relevant motion will be resolved by Government members in another place, not by the Parliament as a whole. At least 40 per cent of the members of the Parliament will be opposed to the motion. It is a Government action that initiates the motion that has to be resolved. Therefore it is not putting the position correctly to say that the Parliament will resolve the matter. Today the Senate has an opportunity by agreeing to Senator Harradine's motion, to say that not the whole Parliament agrees with the disallowance of a determination. We have the opportunity today to express the opinion that at least one House of this Parliament, one half of the Parliament, is opposed to the disallowance of this determination. All sorts of excuses are being used to stop decent honourable senators in the Liberal Party who know there is no justification for what the Government is doing from voting for Senator Harradine's motion. They cannot hide behind excuses or procedure as a reason for not voting for the motion. The question is: Do you believe in arbitration or do you not believe in arbitration?

        The Government, which is usually the upholder of the arbitration system, does not support that system in relation to its own employees. It supports the arbitration system in disputes between private enterprise and unions, especially when the unions are dissatisfied. The unions and the Public Service have not been treated overkindly by the arbitration system. Immediately the unions or the Public Service obtain a decision which is more favourable than the Government desires or intends the Government sees that the decision cannot be implemented.

        Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know, the South Australian Liberal Government is determined to cut expenditure in government departments. It has introduced redundancy within the Public Service. But it has assured its employees, from the time of its election, that there will be no dismissals. That Government's counterpart in the federal sphere cannot accept that. The South Australian Government will reduce its Public Service by the normal wastage that occurs throughout the years. I ask that those Liberal Party members worthy of the name 'Liberal' ensure that a vote is taken today on this motion and that this House expresses an opinion of concern about the Government's action in relation to this determination.

         —The Committee's 184th report is the product of a long-standing interest it has had in public administration, in particular the quality of information available to management on which it bases its decisions. Perhaps I should digress a little to the historical interest of the Committee. In July 1964, following comment in the Auditor-General's report for 1962-63 and subsequently in the Committee's 66th report, all departments were instructed by the Department of the Treasury to examine critically tasks being undertaken by internal audit staff and to ensure that sufficient staff were maintained for the proper performance of the audit function. Further continuing references by the Auditors-General to deficiencies led the Committee to conduct a general inquiry into internal audit in 1971. The results of that inquiry were reported to Parliament in its 139th report in September 1972. The Committee noted improvements had occurred in some departments but was disturbed by the use of internal audit staff on other duties.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In July 1973, the Public Service Board drew the attention of all departments to the Committee's comments and a year later followed up with a survey seeking information on the measures taken to ensure the effective performance of the internal audit function. Nevertheless, criticism by Auditors-General has continued. A joint management review of internal audit procedures was commissioned by the Public Service Board in 1977. This review involved a study of internal audit practices in seven large departments and eight major companies and public authorities in Australia, and included an evaluation of practices adopted overseas. The results were conveyed to the Board in late 1977 and, after circulation of the report to all permanent heads and discussions with the Auditor-General, a series of recommendations were put forward in April 1979. Aspects of this report are discussed in chapter 6 of this paper. It is a fundamental requirement that in order to obtain the maximum in efficiency, effectiveness and economic operations an enterprise must have an effective internal control. Internal audit is just one facet of those internal controls, and is a powerful management tool in assisting management to reach even higher goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst there is a pressing need for effective internal auditing, the application for which it is of the greatest importance is automatic data processing. The expanding use and increasing complexity of systems and the potential magnitude of waste and losses if internal controls are defective or deficient, makes effective internal auditing an indispensable requirement. Controls in data processing must be monitored frequently, in some cases continuously, using specialised internal audit routines. Although these audit routines provide greater assurance for the external auditor, the responsibility for their development and implementation properly belongs within individual organisations. ADP auditing problems are severe. The installation of audit needs at design and implementation stages of systems development may be difficult technically and costly, but senior management must beware of the negative comments of systems designers and take advice on these matters from skilled ADP auditors. Considering the scarcity of such auditors, the need to rationalise their availability and use with the public service becomes apparent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from the importance of internal auditing to ADP, there is a need for the effective review and appraisal of all operations and verification procedures. Internal auditing must also be concerned with ongoing reviews of overall organisational performance in a manner acceptable to senior management, although not necessarily to line management. It must include assessments, verification and the sponsoring of suggestions for improvement. Its sucess will rely upon access to senior management, a broad charter for the review of operations, and the technological capability to review and analyse performance. Ulti- mately it should provide a comprehensive feedback facility to support managements' financial and decision making systems. Management may then determine whether government policies and the objectives, goals and plans of the organisation are being achieved in the manner intended.
       </para>
       <para>
        This discussion paper looks at some of the problems of internal audit, ranging from its historical background to the work being undertaken at present to increase its effectiviness. The Committee wishes to emphasise that the recommendations it has put forward do not cover all that is needed to bring about effective analysis, review, appraisal, control and verification of public sector functions and activities. It hopes that this paper will stimulate further consideration of the broader dimensions of the problem and suggestions for the development of a balanced approach towards achieving a solution. It is patently obvious to the Committee that previous attempts to improve internal audit in the Australian Public Service have been generally unsuccessful. It is just as clear that those failures resulted from insufficient interest on the part of permanent and statutory heads and a lack of support for internal audit by senior management, a situation exacerbated by the low standard of internal audit itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        The findings of the 1977 review focused attention on the dismal state of internal audit in the Public Service and stimulated renewed efforts to bring about improvements. The Public Service Board has initiated action designed to upgrade internal audit. Its success will depend entirely on the support given by individual departments and authorities and the steps taken to ensure that the improvements necessary in their own organisations are vigorously pursued. It is essential that the heads of departments and authorities cultivate a genuine interest in internal audit and learn to use it effectively. The tendency for many permanent heads to concentrate on policy matters and ignore administrative and financial affairs cannot be condoned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Public Accounts Committee is committed to ensuring the necessary improvements in internal audit are brought about. The Committee will use every opportunity to check progress within departments and test the commitment of permanent and statutory heads and management toward an effective internal audit. It also plans to intitate a review of internal audit to evaluate progress with the improvement program within selected departments and authorities during the current Parliament. The Committee is keenly interested in ongoing developments in all spheres of internal audit and welcomes any suggestions, information or comments in response to the report. I commend the report to honourable senators and trust that it will be a useful document and provokes the discussion it is intended to provoke.

         —by leave-The internal audit is an integral part of the overall internal control procedures of an organisation. These internal control procedures are the means by which the management can safeguard assets and ensure accuracy and reliability of the financial operating statements and operational efficiency. For quite some years now the Auditor-General has been quite concerned about the standard of internal auditing within the public sector. That concern has been shared by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. A significant development occurred with the consultants report in 1977 known as the Coopers Lybrand report. As Senator Lajovic has just stated, the consultants examined seven major departments and eight major companies and statutory organisations as well as overseas operations. The consultants were fairly critical of the state of internal auditing. There were some 600 internal auditors and the cost at that time exceeded something like $7m. This included travel costs in addition to salaries. They felt that in terms of value for money they were unable to identify sufficient tangible benefits from the then current internal audit staff or the procedures they used. This was indeed a sad indictment, I believe, of the level, at that stage, of internal audit within the public sector. Since that time the Public Service Board has moved, some believe too slowly. Nevertheless, it has taken some steps to remedy some of these earlier criticisms. However, it was almost two years, I think, before a major response was made. This was mainly in the area of education. It was contained in a circular issued in 1979 and was designed to encourage departments and authorities to improve the efficiency of the internal audit system.

        Our Public Accounts Committee has launched into new ground with today's issue of the 184th report. This is the first of what we hope will be a series of discussion papers on matters of importance in the public sector and particularly in matters of administration. The Committee's authority, of course, is derived from section 8 of the Public Accounts Committee Act of 1951. One of our recommendations is that there should be a pool of internal auditors highly skilled in the more specialised audit procedures and techniques. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which comprises senators and members of the House of Representatives, has examined, in some recent reports, some of the problems arising in the high technology areas. In the area of automatic data processing the Committee has been very concerned about the shortcomings inherent in some major installations. As a result the Committee came up with a report concerning the acquisition of computers where it was concerned at the tremendous cost to the Government in delayed acquisition procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was followed by a report on Mandata which concerned the fiasco of the Public Service Board's entering into a highly sophisticated ADP complex area where it was caught in all sorts of difficulties including high turnover of staff. Basically the Board was dealing in an area with which it was unfamiliar and which resulted in tremendous cost to the Government. The Committee then followed up with a further report on overpayments to pharmacists. We have to recognise that the computing area is growing. We now have over 80 medium sized and large scale computers. The big problem is the shortage of adequate trained staff. The shortage is particularly acute in the automatic data processing area. It is not a problem that is peculiar to Australia; it is found throughout the world. Fortunately, steps are being taken to improve the level of ADP internal auditing. It is only fairly recently that the public sector has moved with any haste in this area at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased that the Board announced-I think it was in December last year-that Dr Brian Garner, Professor of Computing at Deakin University, had been seconded to provide an advanced course in automatic data processing. I mentioned this as significant to overcome serious lack of expertise. I personally believe a further way of overcoming the serious lack of expertise is for the Public Service Board to offer not less than 20 places for specialised, advanced postgraduate courses in ADP such as are offered by the Caulfield Institute of Technology or by some of the newer universities to young graduates. It is unfortunate that the universities and institutes of technology have moved so slowly in providing appropriate courses in this fast growing area of technology. The problems of recruitment will remain because on the basis of employment of about 600 internal auditors we have to recruit around 120 to 150 people at least to the internal audit sections each year to maintain current levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        The days of individual checking with the routine of an auditor green ticking each individual item are gone. Nowadays there is a move from what we term financial or compliance auditing towards efficiency auditing. We hope that ulti- mately the next move will be to develop to program auditing or the auditing of specific programs. I believe there is a need for a general upgrading in the role of the internal auditor not only at the bottom but also at the highest possible level. In fact there is the need for an appropriate classification for the chief internal auditor to at least Second Division, Level One so that the job is provided with the appropriate status. This internal auditor must report to top management. One of the difficulties in the past has concerned the appropriate role of the internal auditor. In the past some of the departmental heads, unfortunately, have been more concerned with policy matters than with administration. This is one of the reasons why in the past insufficient attention has been given to the need and to the importance of the correct role of the internal auditor. He should play an integral part in reporting to top management. Top management has been concerned about the role of internal auditing as compared with other functions such as management organisation systems. Whilst it is important for the internal auditor to report to the top management about deficiencies, the scope of the audit and improvements in organisational procedure, it is important that the internal auditor be not involved with the actual implementation of those programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our Committee has come up with recommendations that audit committees should be formed. This has the advantage of collecting and disseminating information. With the creating of committees and permitting a greater rotation of internal auditors within the public sector, the status of these professionals will be increased. Where a proper system of internal audit is operating external auditors can place much more reliance upon control procedures and adjust their programs accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe in the future there is good scope for young people to enter the Public Service via the internal auditing functions and work their way up into top management positions. This PAC report has broken new ground in the area of accountability. While the internal auditor is responsible to top management the external auditor is responsible to the Parliament. It is important to note that there is a very strong relationship between the Auditor-General's Office and the Public Accounts Committee. Mr Hill recently said that the relationship has been close but never cosy. I commend to the Parliament this discussion paper which breaks new ground in reporting to the Parliament.

        It appears that there is rather less support for these matters to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs than was apparent when the matters were first raised last week. I think that is a great pity because the issues involved are major and of potentially quite explosive significance. In the past the Senate has played a leadership role and has developed in that respect a fine national reputation in exposing corporate malpractice and identifying the kinds of legislative and administrative solutions that are appropriate to deal with it. I am referring, of course, to the Select Committee on Securities and Exchange which was chaired by Senator Rae. I believe it would be an abdication of responsibility for the Senate now, in dealing with this motion, to pretend that the issues underlying it do not exist, to put it in the too-hard basket or simply to defer indefinitely consideration of these matters in the hope that they will go away.

        At the moment Australia is involved in exactly the same kind of mining and resources-led boom, an overheated stock exchange boom, that existed in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. There has been the same kind of increase-indeed almost a doubling-in the ordinary share indices in the last two years, as there was with a doubling of the index in the period from 1967 to 1969. It is the kind of boom that has resulted in a massive degree of insider trading, other financial malpractice and spreading of misinformation as occurred in the 1970s. That kind of boom situation gives rise to the potential for exactly the same sequence of events. We are now seeing the return of the speculative float, this time not with respect to nickel but diamonds. What kicked off the present situation more than anything else was undoubtedly the Ashton consortium's finds in the Lake Argyle area of the Kimberleys in 1979. Honourable senators will be aware that it was announced last week that those findings were of such a size they may add something like 50 per cent to the world's known diamond reserves.
       </para>
       <para>
        That discovery has brought in its train quite a feverish burst of activity, the taking up of leases, the engaging in exploration activity on the ground and the recent announcement of plans to establish a major diamond cutting and polishing venture in Perth and some very keen interest has been shown in making new company floats. The Negri River float is so far the daddy of them all so far as speculative diamond ventures go, but it will not necessarily be the daddy of those to come if the present predictions as to the nature and potential of diamond exploration activity in the north-west of Australia come to fruition. One of the main underlying justifications for moving this motion at this time is to throw the spotlight on the kind of commercial activity that is possibly going on in respect of these speculative floats and to cut off right at the outset, before it gets out of hand in the way that it did, regrettably, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the kind of corporate misbehaviour that then took place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The details of the Negri float are quite complex. They are made more so by the consideration that not all the facts are on public record and the fact that to the extent that matters have been put on public record, the validity of many of them is by no means uncontested. That said, the basic issues are quite simple. First, was there a deliberate non-disclosure in the prospectus that was issued for the company of a geological report which might significantly have influenced the decision of investors contemplating participating in this speculative float? Secondly, was there insider trading in the form of profit taking by at lease some of those who took up private allotments of shares prior to the public subscription being opened and who knew of the unfavourable geological report in question and took advantage of the non-disclosure of this very price-sensitive information? Thirdly, have the deficiencies in the substance of our companies and securities law, which were identified by the Rae committee in 1974, been corrected either in the present law or that proposed as part of the new co-operative companies and securities scheme so that with the coming to fruition of the co-operative scheme an effective weapon will be available against behaviour of this general kind-I beg no questions about this particular matter-to the extent that it occurred in this case? Fourthly, have the deficiencies in the administration of companies and securities law which were identified, again by the Rae Committee, in 1974 been corrected in the activities or the development of the various State Corporate Affairs Commissions and will the new structure to exist under the umbrella of the National Companies and Securities Commission be effective to investigate and deal quickly with possible breaches of the law, again in this general area?

        They are the issues. What are the possible facts? I say 'possible' because it is not my purpose to make judicial pronouncements about the kinds of matters that have been claimed to exist. That is part of the reason why I want this matter to be inquired into by a Senate committee with the resources available to it to take evidence on oath and to determine where in fact the truth lies. What is involved essentially is as follows: The areas in issue span some 2,452 square kilometres. They are covered by the Northern Territory mining leases Nos 2092 and 2093, which abut the border of Western Australia some 100 kilometres south-east of the Lake Argyle finds. The leases in question are in the Ord River catchment area, but upstream from the Lake Argyle area where diamonds were found. Senator Puplick, who I understand is to speak later in this debate, will no doubt be able to discourse more learnedly on the geological characteristics of the areas in question. For the moment I just note the general proximity of the leases in question to the Argyle finds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us consider the sequence of events. Things really began with the leases in question being pegged out by Mr Graham Beith, a businessman who has a long involvement in various capacities in the mining industry and who remains a central figure in the tale thereafter. In April 1979 Mr Beith established a syndicate with Mr David Lance, who was a stockbroker and member of the firm of Norths in Sydney, which comes into the picture later as the underwriter to the speculative issue involved in the flotation of Negri River Corporation Ltd. The third member of the syndicate was Mr Campbell Cooper. They applied for exploration licences 2092 and 2093. On 25 July 1979 what has become known as the Solomon report was signed. This report was prepared by Dr Solomon and Mr A. J. O'Toole of the firm of International Resources Consultants Pty Ltd in Sydney. It was based on some 10 days field work involving air reconnaissance and some on-the-ground geological investigation of areas of the leases. The report in question was commissioned jointly by Mr Graham Beith and Mr Frank Nugan, who is but one of a numerous cast of colourful characters who seem to have been involved in this exercise at various stages. The point about the Solomon report, as is foreshadowed in the terms of the motion, is that it was negative so far as diamond prospects were concerned for the area of the leases in question. The report concluded that further exploration was unwarranted in relation to these leases. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Field and laboratory investigations have revealed no evidence to support the thesis that the regions under review represent a geological environment conducive to the location of either primary or secondary deposits of diamonds.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 10 September 1979 exploration licences 2092 and 2093 were granted nonetheless to Messrs Beith, Lance and Cooper, as tenants in common to the extent of some 33 1/3 per cent interest each. On 21 December 1979, a dispute of some kind having arisen between Mr Beith and the other members of the syndicate, the resolution of which dispute Mr Beith seems to have thought might have been helped by the intervention of Sir Asher Joel, who comes into the picture at this stage. Mr Beith sold some 50 per cent of his interest in the licences to Design and Construction Consultants Pty Ltd, a firm owned and controlled by Sir Asher Joel and his family. The shareholders in that company were Sir Asher Joel, Lady Joel, Dr Michael Joel, Alexander Joel and Fotheringham Investments Pty Ltd. It appears that at the time of the sale of half his interest in the licences in question, Mr Beith claims to have handed over to Sir Asher Joel's solicitors, Messrs Lane and Lane, all the documents in his possession relating to the lease area in question. I understand from Mr Beith's account that that bundle of documents included the Solomon report.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is on the basis of the inclusion of the Solomon report, among other things, in those documents, that Mr Beith seeks to establish as a fact-there are other reasons, apparently, to justify this; this is one of the matters that will need to be untangled by the Committee if it ever deals with this case-that at least Sir Asher Joel, as a later vendor of those licences, knew of the extent of the Solomon report.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been claimed by Mr Beith-again, this is a matter that will need to be tested-that in conversation in Darwin in January 1980 it was agreed between Mr Beith and Sir Asher Joel that it would be impossible to undertake a public float on leases 2092 and 2093 at a later date without revealing the existence of the Solomon report. On the face of it that is a plausible enough proposition, given its negative character and its obvious implications for investors who might be moved to invest in this area. I should mention, of course, as ought to be implicit from what I said earlier, that in the intervening period there had been the discovery of significant diamond deposits in the Lake Argyle area downstream from this lease area. So the Solomon report, to that extent, had to be looked at in the light of those subsequent discoveries, but nonetheless it is claimed that it was well understood as between Mr Beith and Sir Asher Joel that the Solomon report would have to feature prominently in any public information given about these leases which might endeavour to support a flotation of the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 25 January 1980 Mr Beith sold the remaining 50 per cent of his interest to Design and Construction Pty Ltd for a sum of $10,000, this transaction being part again, apparently, of the ongoing negotiations between him and Sir Asher Joel and his former partners to reach some kind of amicable settlement of a rather complex litigation situation which had then developed. In addition to the $10,000, Mr Beith claims that he retained, as part of that agreement, to sell a 15 per cent royalty interest in leases 2092 and 2093. So in terms of what we will come to in a moment, the amount of the potential royalty flow involved, that is not insignificant continuing interest. On 16 July 1980 the Negri River company was in fact incorporated in New South Wales, its directors being Sir Davis Hughes as Chairman, Mr Geoffrey Kelvin Gray as Deputy Chairman with Dr Brian Marshall, geologist, and Mr Michael Murray Hornibrook, solicitor, as the remaining two directors.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 28 July 1980 there was a sale of the exploration licences to the newly established company by the possessors of those licences, namely Design and Construction Pty Ltd and Messrs Lance and Cooper. They sold out, it appears, the whole of their interest in those licences to the company, the basic quid pro quo being $90,000 by way of reimbursement for exploration expenditure claimed to have occurred and, more significantly perhaps, a royalty interest amounting to 12 per cent annually of the net profit before tax that might be raised by the venture up to a maximum of $12m per annum. That is the nature and extent of the royalty interest that is here involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 5 August 1980 the transfer of licences from these vendors to the company was registered by the Director of Mines of the Northern Territory. On 2 September 1980, there was a crucial transaction-an allotment of 3,499,994 ordinary shares at 20c each for cash to a miscellaneous group of members of the Joel family, Sir Asher Joel's company, Lindfield Enterprises Pty Ltd, Mr Lance, Mr Cooper and, it appears, Mr Graham Beith, to the extent of some 15,000 shares-shares, incidentally, which Mr Beith claims not to have subsequently traded, despite the temptation to do so when their price escalated out of all subsequent recognition. So there was a private allotment of nearly 3.5 million shares, less the handful of shares held by the existing directors. Three and a half million shares, in effect, were privately alloted to the vendors of the licences and, in particular, various members of the Joel family.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 10 September the licences for the lease areas were renewed for 12 months. On 10 October an underwriting agreement was entered into between the company and Norths Securities Pty Ltd, the stockbroking firm of which, it will be remembered, Mr Lance was a member. On 10 October there was a geological report signed by Professor Allan Voisey, whose bona fides and reputability, I hasten to add, are absolutely in no way in issue in anything, either explicitly or implicitly, that might be said. Professor Voisey, in his geological report which accompanied the prospectus, indicated a rather more optimistic view of the likely exploration prospects of the lease areas. His report, it appears, were based on some direct visit to the area in question, combined with an extensive analysis of Landsat satellite photographs which bring to light the geological character of the area. He makes it clear that it is also based squarely on the conclusions which might be thought to flow simply from the fact of the discoveries in the relatively nearby Lake Argyle area. His language in this report is cautious, as is best indicated, I think, simply by quoting, from the whole of the report, only one paragraph which is the actual recommendation. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of the announced discovery of kimberlite and diamonds near Lake Argyle, it would be fair to say that the country and the gravel deposits covered by the Ord River catchment have been upgraded as diamond prospects. I recommend that Negri River Corporation Ltd, having regard to the presence within the Licence area of extensive alluvial deposits, and of major structural features which could have provided channelways for kimberlite-placement, should commence a detailed exploration programme on the Licence Area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Throughout the language of the report there are words such as 'could', 'possibly', and 'upgraded'. This is the kind of language which appears. There is no more a substantial recommendation than that, but perhaps no more substantial recommendation, based on the information then to hand, could have been expected from a competent geologist. On 15 October, following the production of that report, and the flurry of preceding activity no doubt, a prospectus was issued as the condition precedent to public flotation of the company. That prospectus had been registered beforehand at the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission. It was a prospectus which, in familiar form, sets out all the necessary basic information and contains the geologist's report in quite extensive detail, plus a page of material on the question as to prior exploration of the licence area, to which I will refer again-a page of material, the significance of which I note for the moment only in the terms that it contains no reference whatsoever to the Solomon report.
       </para>
       <para>
        In late October the following things happened: Mr Beith read in the newspapers, first of all, of the prospectus having been issued; he, according to his own account, rang Dr Michael Joel and drew Dr Joel's attention, or reminded Dr Joel, depending on how one chooses to interpret the situation, of the existence of the Solomon report and its implications for the proposed float, and was told by Dr Michael Joel that it was none of Mr Beith's business. Mr Beith then obtained the prospectus, read it carefully, and again rang Dr Michael Joel saying that he would in fact inform the Stock Exchange and the Corporate Affairs Commission of absence of referral to the Solomon report if some steps were not taken to inform the potential investing public of the existence of that report so that it could make up its mind accordingly. Again it appears or it is claimed by Mr Beith that he was told that it was none of his business and that the whole thing was in fact committed and under way and that nothing he did would change that circumstance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, it appears, Mr Beith rang Mr Willis of the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission, this being about 21 to 23 October-a date of that kind-and told him of the existence of the Solomon report and secured a reaction from that officer to the effect that the Corporate Affairs Commission would investigate the matters in issue. On 4 November subscription lists opened for the public flotation, and indeed closed immediately thereafter, I understand, on that day with the issue fully subscribed. The number of shares issued in this way by public subscription amounted to another 3.5 million at a par value of 20c, the total issued capital thus added up to seven million shares at 20c each, half of those initially by private allotment before the float, the remaining 3.5 million at 20c each by public subscription.
       </para>
       <para>
        A couple of weeks later, on 20 November, the company's shares were listed for trading on the Sydney Stock Exchange. They took off immediately, being traded at around $2 a share and getting up in fact to $2.35 on the second day of trading. It has been claimed by various people and in the Press that Sir Asher Joel and the other persons who have received, in particular, substantial private allotments proceeded to trade rather busily in that particular period and to take the very substantial profits that are associated with an increase in a share price from 20c to about $2. Whether profits were taken on any significant scale by Sir Asher Joel and the other people associated with the vending of the licences and that private allotment remains to be determined. I note that some Press accounts have suggested that the purchasers of a good many of the shares thus traded by Sir Asher Joel in the first instance were others of his own companies and that indeed no more than some circular book entries may have been involved in the process. But they are among the things that remain to be untangled if this matter proceeds to a proper investigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the day of the listing it appears that Mr Beith telephoned a gentleman in a senior position at the Melbourne Stock Exchange and told him of the existence of the Solomon report and his concern that the matter had proceeded to public listing without the Corporate Affairs Commission or, it appears, anyone else in Sydney having taken any action to stop it. It was at this stage that Mr Beith, by his own account, was told in fairly colourful language: 'Son, you are up against the establishment. Take your money and run'. Later in November, it having become clear that no Corporate Affairs Commission action or stock exchange action seemed likely to occur then, Mr Beith took his concerns, via his own solicitor, to the Press. It was at that stage, right at the end of November, that the matter, and the existence of the Solomon report, became public knowledge for the first time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should make it clear that on 28 November the directors of the Negri company made a statement to the stock exchange. That statement is on the files of the stock exchange and subsequently was made available to the Press. The directors made a statement to the stock exchange, through their chairman Sir Davis Hughes, that they were unaware of the Solomon report's existence. On 12 December the text of the Solomon report was apparently given by Mr Beith to the Sydney Stock Exchange. In the interim some kind of investigation-precisely what remains unclear-had been carried out by the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission, but on 3 February 1981 the nature of that investigation by the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission was substantially upgraded by virtue of the Attorney-General's directing a special investigation to take place which then enabled the powers under the New South Wales companies legislation for gathering of information on oath and so on to be set in train. That exercise by the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission is proceeding at this stage with some kind of report apparently being expected within the next few weeks. The Sydney Stock Exchange responded to the public disclosures made by Mr Beith and others by commencing its own investigation which was announced on 2 December last year, but the Sydney Stock Exchange has not at any stage suspended trading in the shares of the company and it is not known to me certainly what, if anything, is likely to emerge from the investigations of that exchange.

        It is a long story but obviously, just on the bare face of that account, some very important issues are raised by it. Let me just indicate as briefly as I can, because I do not want to burden the Senate unduly, some of the legal issues which seem to be squarely raised by these facts, if indeed they are facts. I hasten to add that I am in no position to make any assertions as to the accuracy or otherwise of the various things that have been claimed. Statements have been put on the record by various parties, most of whom have an interest of one kind or another in the outcome. Their veracity will have to be tested in an appropriate forum which again is one of the reasons I have moved this motion.
       </para>
       <para>
        First of all, there are the problems about non-disclosure in the prospectus. Under section 46 (1) of the uniform companies Acts, which is the existing company law legislation, there is provision for civil liability for loss suffered by reason of the wilful non-disclosure of material matter in a prospectus. That obligation falls upon every person who, having had knowledge of the matter in question, is a director, causes himself to be named as a director, has agreed to become a director, is a promoter of the corporation or is a person who authorised or caused the issue of the prospectus. There is an almost equivalent provision in clause 107 of the new co-operative scheme companies Bill which has been tabled in this Parliament. The other non-disclosure provision which seems to be relevant is section 47 (1) of the existing uniform scheme which imposes substantial criminal liability for any untrue statement or wilful non-disclosure in a prospectus upon any person who authorised or caused the issue of the prospectus unless that person can prove that the statement or non-disclosure was immaterial or believed by him on reasonable grounds to be immaterial. The prescribed penalty at the moment is one year's gaol or $2,000 fines. In clause 108 of the new national companies Bill, if I can so describe it, there is an almost identical provision for which the penalty has been upgraded to 5 years' gaol or fines of $20,000, there being a new exclusion for inadvertent non-disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The questions about non-disclosure which require investigation in the light of those sorts of provisions would appear to be these: First, whether the existence of the Solomon report was in fact known to some or all of the vendors of the licences; secondly, whether in the terms of the sections I have mentioned, sections 46 and 47 of the existing Acts, any of the vendors of the exploration licences can be said to have been either promoters of the corporation or to have authorised or caused the issuing of this prospectus within the legal meaning of those terms-a difficult interpretation question; thirdly, whether the existence of the negative Solomon report was in fact communicated to any director of the Negri River Corporation Ltd by any of the vendors of the exploration licences or by anyone else, or whether the terms in essence of the Solomon report were known to the directors by some other means. I say that is a point to be resolved while acknowledging again that Sir Davis Hughes at least has denied on behalf of the directors that there was any knowledge by the corporation of the terms of the Solomon report. The final question, of course, which is linked with all of those, is whether in all the circumstances the disclosure or non-disclosure of the Solomon report was in fact material. This is a point that I understand Senator Puplick will make quite vigorously, notwithstanding his own concern about this whole affair. But it remains very much a matter of judgment and a matter to be resolved as to whether in the light of subsequent developments and subsequent geological reports the Solomon report was significant. I simply acknowledge that that is a consideration that has to be resolved rather than simply assumed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second kind of legal issue that arises is that related to insider trading. Here again the issues are not simple but they can be stated, I think, fairly briefly. The uniform securities industry Acts of 1975 contain in section 112 a basic prohibition against insider trading. Sub-section (1) of that section provides that a person who is, or at any time in the preceding six months has been, connected with a body corporate shall not deal in securities of that body corporate if by reason of his so being, or having been, connected with that body corporate he is in possession of information that is not generally available but if it were would be likely materially to affect the price of those securities. It seems on the face of it that the existence and contents of the Solomon report would have been likely materially to have affected the price of the Negri shares. That is a question that is a matter of judgment. It may be that investors were so feverish in their inclination to get into this particular market that they would not have been deterred by anything on paper from reputable geologists such as Dr Solomon or from anyone else, but it is difficult in the abstract to argue that it was of no material significance at all. It appears likely, however, even if one accepts that, that the licence vendors, who are alleged to have been in possession of the information in the Solomon report and who did themselves trade, perhaps profitably, in Negri shares thereafter, although being 'connected' with the company within the definition in section 112 (8), did not come into possession of that information 'by reason of' being connected with the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is possible that there is a loophole there in the sense of the non-application of the section to such people. That is an important point which I am making because if it is the case that there is a loophole here or a gap there, it would appear that the alleged circumstances of this case have revealed a significant gap in the insider trading provisions of the legislation. It does seem quite unconscionable that individuals could sell exploration licences, which for the sake of argument let us say are worthless and, having failed to disclose the existence of relevant geological reports, allow an incomplete prospectus to be issued and, having acquired shares in a pre-issue allotment, sell those shares at a price which, by reason of their non-disclosure, is unrealistically high.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the point that this is one of the matters in which it is strongly argued that there is a gap in the legislation and one which a committee-preferably the one to which I would like to refer all this-should address its attention. I note that the new national securities industry legislation is couched in terms identical to these pre-existing uniform securities industry Acts which I have mentioned, the relevant provision being section 128. A further provision which I will mention more briefly is contained in section 111 of the existing uniform securities industry Acts, now section 126 of the 1980 national Act which criminally penalises a person who, by any dishonest concealment of material facts, induces or attempts to induce another person to deal in securities. I simply make the point that it may prove on investigation that there was here a deliberate concealment of the Solomon report by the vendors of the licences which had the effect of inducing other persons to deal in the Negri shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, there are a variety of legal issues as to the extent to which the existing law covers the kind of situation which, on the information publicly available at the moment, may well have existed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, there is another quite substantial issue to be resolved as to the Stock Exchange listing requirements and the extent to which they were observed in this case. Section 2B (11) of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges' official listing requirements states that a mining company prospectus must, where the company has acquired an interest in an exploration licence, include several requirements, namely, a disclosure of the purchase price paid for the interest and all other consideration including the right to subscribe for the shares offered by the prospectus. Again, there is a requirement that there be a detailed analysis of the purchase price paid by the company for interest in the exploration showing how the price was arrived at and whether or not the company had recourse to expert reports before the purchase price was set and, if so, setting out a summary of those reports. When one looks at the listing requirements by reference to what is actually in the Negri prospectus, all sorts of questions very quickly spring to mind. The third of the listing requirements which is crucial to this argument is that there has to be a statement by the directors as to whether, to their knowledge, the mining tenement has previously been prospected or developed. If so, a summary of the result of that prospecting and so on shall be set out, together with full details of the persons by whom it was conducted. The Negri prospectus does not reveal the fact that the persons allotted shares prior to the public issue were the same persons who had sold the exploration licences to the company and, under the Stock Exchange listing requirements, it should have been investigated whether part of the arrangement for the sale of those licences was that the vendors be allotted shares in that way. If that was part of the consideration for the sale of licences to that company that should have been disclosed in the prospectus in a way that there has been no such disclosure at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also obvious-this is a further important point-that the company is obliged to set out a summary of all expert reports to which it had access and knowledge of the results of previous prospecting. In this respect, as I have already mentioned in passing, the Negri prospectus is deficient to the extent that it excludes any reference to the Solomon report. There is, on page 16 of the prospectus, a fairly detailed list of prior exploratory activity both on the lease area and in nearby leases by a variety of ventures, it being indicated in each case that there had been a failure to find a significant geological prospect. Subsequent to the granting of the licences or in respect of that period there is a list of further geological dabbling and investigation that has been carried out by various people, but again, no reference is made specifically or even, it seems, indirectly, to the Solomon report other than a passing reference to the establishment of an on-site exploration camp during the 1979 dry season and the processing of small quantities of alluvial material utilised in the mobile treatment plant. That may or may not be a reference to the surveying that was carried out by the Solomon team. The reference to previous activity on the site by the leaseholders or by persons associated with them is dismissed in these lines:
       </para>
       <para>
        The work was of a preliminary nature and was not carried out by qualified personnel. Such work was intended as a guide for the formulation of exploration programs for future years. The results of such work are accordingly considered to be insufficiently verified for inclusion in this prospectus.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, the impression is given in that prospectus that the only surveying of the licence area-the only prospecting, the only exploration-that has previously been conducted is utterly negligible and utterly inconclusive. So, there is clearly scope for investigation of whether those aspects of the listing requirements have been complied with and, if they have not been complied with, about the failure, it appears, of the Sydney Stock Exchange to take precise and effective remedial action after it came to its attention that there were these deficiencies, for example, to suspend the shares from trading. An ancillary question is, of course, the accuracy and significance of Mr Beith's account that he was told by a senior member of the Melbourne Exchange, in the language I have previously mentioned, to take his money and run. So, the activities of the Stock Exchange, the activities of the Corporate Affairs Commission for its inactivity, if such it was, in taking action on this matter when the existence of the Solomon report was brought to its attention and the inadequacies in various areas of the law, if such they be, all seem clearly to require detailed analysis and investigation. There are many points of analogy with findings of the Rae Committee which, were I not rather testing the patience of the Senate, I would be happy to mention also specifically because the way in which extracts from the Rae report leap out of the page and strike one as having an immediately pertinent and relevant application to the kinds of matters to which I have drawn attention is very graphic.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that an overwhelming case can thus be made out for the Senate's taking this whole issue seriously and treating it to a proper committee investigation. The only questions which then seem to be left are which committee and when? My initial intention in this respect was to seek the re-establishment of a select committee of this Senate to pick up, in effect, where the Rae Select Committee left off. I was persuaded against this on the basis that the standing committees of this Senate are now well established and have a proper role in the following-up of investigations of the kind that were previously conducted by select committees and that it is a more expeditious, less administratively cumbrous sort of arrangement and very much within the charter of the standing committees. I was further persuaded on this basis that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs was the most appropriate committee, and I have moved accordingly. But it now appears that a majority of the members of that Committee have decided either that it is an inappropriate committee, or that it is an inappropriate time at which to be moving a motion of this kind because of likely changes in the personnel of the Committee, or perhaps because the issue is too big to handle, or that it is too hot to handle. But, for one or other of those reasons, it appears that a view has been taken that this is not a matter for appropriate reference to this Committee or, indeed, it seems any other committee of the Senate at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I acknowledge this: If the real argument is that the issue is currently at least being dealt with by the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission and that the consideration of this issue by the Senate should be deferred pending the outcome and public disclosure of the results of that investigation, then I can at least understand that argument. And I can, I suppose, with reasonably good grace accept that, although with a great deal of reluctance because I believe simply that the issues that I have put on the record as needing attention are much wider than those which are presently occupying the Corporate Affairs Commission. But, if we reject my motion, I hope we are not doing so simply because we prefer a quiet life. I hope that it is not because in the Senate we prefer the approach of pottering away, hacking out the odd weed when what is required is a fundamental reshaping of the whole landscape. There is not much good in pulling out little weeds when one is about to be engulfed by a volcano.

         —Senator Evans has moved that matters relating to the Negri River Corporation Ltd be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. As the Chairman of that Committee I wish to respond to the motion and say something about the matter. Senator Evans has outlined at some length facts and allegations and of course a mixture of facts and allegations in regard to Negri River Corporation Ltd such as the float and other details about which we have heard. I do not propose to go in great detail into the allegations. Senator Puplick will also be speaking to this motion and he will deal with the matters in more detail. He is more familiar with the controversy that has raged now for some months in regard to this matter.

       <para>
        The motion proposes that the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee inquire into and report on a number of matters. If one looks at the proposed inquiry one is immediately faced with the fact that what is suggested is a very extensive inquiry which undoubtedly would be a very controversial inquiry, which would involve people's reputations and which no doubt would involve a good deal of investigation and careful consideration by any committee. The matters which are raised in the terms of the motion cover, as I have suggested, a very wide ambit. The proposed reference concerns not only the floating of the company and the way in which it came about but also the adequacy of the prospectus and the question of whether there were geological reports that were disclosed or known by people who gained a benefit from the company. Another question is the role of the Sydney Stock Exchange in relation to listing, together with, as has been put by Senator Evans, the question of insider trading. The proposed inquiry moves from that to a very extensive inquiry into not only the problems which in the past had been considered by the Rae Committee and not only the question of whether these problems have been overcome by the existing legislation but also the adequacy of the operations of the State corporate affairs commissions and the proposed Federal legislation. This is an intimidating list of requirements for a committee to investigate and a list with which one can say without question that probably no committees of this Senate with their knowledge at the moment are particularly qualified to deal at present.

         —Are not particularly qualified to deal with at this time. I do not for one moment maintain that members of my Committee have particular knowledge in the area of company law or that it has in fact made any investigation in this area whatsoever. As in all things, there must be a start; someone must go first. On the other hand it can be said that in this area my Committee can claim no particular expertise whatsoever. I do not relate the facts; I do not go into the facts. The matters which have been raised by Senator Evans seem to me on the whole to be a pretty admirable assessment of the course of events. On the other hand, some of the matters he has referred to relate to allegations that have been made and they would of course be the subject of testing by evidence. There is no doubt that in the course of that testing persons whose reputations would be involved would require counsel, the committee would require counsel-a great deal of expert advice-and there would be a very thorough defence by anyone against whom allegations have been made. Senator Evans may say that there is scope for investigation, and I do not doubt that. At the same time it must be said that any such investigation would be a very extensive and long ranging one if justice were to be done.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This brings me to the fact that the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee has had the opportunity since Senator Evans gave notice of this motion last Thursday to consider the proposed reference. Members of the Committee decided, with Senator Evans dissenting, that such a reference should not be given to the Committee at this time and accordingly I, and I think other members of the Committee, will be opposed to the motion at this time. We do not as a Committee say that there should not be a case for later investigation. We certainly do not say that there may not be suspicious circumstances and matters which are of a good deal of concern to the community arising from the allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Undoubtedly one fact which should be borne in mind at the moment is that the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission is investigating as a special investigation the matters that Senator Evans has raised. It may well be said that some of the activities of that Commission may be the subject of some criticism. One will not know until that Commission reports whether in fact it can provide an adequate explanation of the situation and satisfy the public that the matters raised are above board and that no action should be taken. On the other hand, it may recommend the prosecution of persons. One cannot tell at this stage. It is the belief of our Committee that it would not be wise for an investigation to be undertaken by a Senate committee at the same time as the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission is proceeding with an investigation. Until that investigation is completed, in my opinion, no committee of this kind ought to engage in such an investigation. It is primarily for this reason that the Committee has recommended to the Senate that such a reference be not given to it at this time. It may well be that after the report of the New South Wales Commission is made some investigation will be taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that this Parliament is still very responsible for ensuring that the law as now proposed and the new arrangements for corporate affairs cover the problems which have been raised and rightly so by Senator Evans. It may well be that further investigations should be made in that area, but that may be an area of interest to some committee other than the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, which as I have said has made no previous investigations in this area and has not previously been concerned in corporate affairs or in the legislation that is involved in this subject. But that is a matter for further investigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        All the areas that have been raised by Senator Evans are, I think, important ones. Those areas include the question of whether there was non-disclosure in regard to the geological reports of Dr Solomon, insider trading, possible deficiencies in company law and whether they have been corrected by the existing legislation, whether the State corporate affairs commissions are operating effectively and whether the umbrella of the new National Companies and Securities Commission is an adequate way of handling corporate affairs. All these matters are matters of which this Parliament must have continual cognisance. I do not for one moment say that that is not something that ought not to be investigated. I doubt that immediately is the time, as we are still in the process of bringing the law into operation, and certainly there should not be an inquiry by us before the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission has reported on the facts of this case.

He had, in fact, mentioned that he was interested in this matter. There was nothing like subterfuge or inadequacy of discussion by Senator Evans in that sense but, unfortunately, the matter was not discussed with the Committee until after the notice of motion had been given. I make that point as a minor point. The Committee has had the opportunity since that time to consider the matter, to hear Senator Evans at length, to discuss this matter at length yesterday and to make the decision which it has made. The Committee has current work. It has a report nearing completion in regard to the qualifications and disqualifications of members. It has another reference which it is to embark upon and on which it has already sought evidence.

         —As both Senator Evans and Senator Missen have indicated, I propose to deal with some of the substance of this discussion on the Negri River Corporation Ltd in more depth than has my colleague, Senator Missen, and as somebody who had made an attempt to follow not only the progress of this matter but also the progress of a number of companies, corporations and organisations which have been involved in what one might loosely call the diamond exploration boom which has taken place over the course of the last two years or so. I would not want to traverse the same details to which Senator Missen has referred. The reasons that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs at its meeting yesterday in Melbourne found persuasive in terms of not accepting this matter as a committee reference relate to reasons regarding the amount of time, the resources, the personnel and other factors already canvassed by Senator Missen.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, I would simply stress the point which was central to Senator Missen's contribution; namely, that at least two inquiries are currently under way into this matter, one being undertaken by the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales and the other being undertaken by the Sydney Stock Exchange. It is perfectly true that both of these organisations may have questions to answer as to their own participation in the whole scheme of arrangements. The persuasive view that I think was accepted by the Committee was that at least until the Corporate Affairs Commission report is presented it would be unwise to embark on either a duplication or an attempt to second guess a report which presumably in a fairly short period will become a public document.
       </para>
       <para>
        I therefore propose to deal with a number of matters that have already been raised by Senator Evans and to add, I hope, some further details about these allegations and some of these related reports. I wish to start by putting the matter into an historical perspective as far as the activities of the diamond miners in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory are concerned. As far back as 13 June 1978 the Australian Financial Review carried an article headed 'The Scramble for Diamonds in WA'. Its sub-heading was 'Son of Poseidon'. Those familiar with activities in the nickel boom, with the activities of Poseidon and with everything which that entailed will understand that this was a clear warning given as far back as 13 June 1978 that here was an area of resource development in which one could expect a degree of speculation, a fair amount of high flying and, indeed, a large amount of risk being taken all round the place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The London Financial Times of 5 September 1978 was also anxious to put this matter into perspective. It started running stories about the Ashton consortium's exploration for diamonds in Western Australia. It quoted a remark by Sir Roderick Carnegie who, on behalf of Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia Ltd-one of the principal partners in the Ashton consortium-was asked what he thought about the eventual outcome of the Ashton activities. Sir Roderick, as reported in the London Financial Times, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Ask me after another five years and $15m.
       </para>
       <para>
        To a large extent at least the five years have not passed but the $15m is certainly starting to look like a progressively attainable target for expenditure on activities in that part of the world. The Financial Times on that occasion went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Stockbrokers are reminded of the past. It seemed inconceivable that people who had been so shaken by the Poseidon boom-and-bust seven years ago would, so soon afterwards, once again be swept to a renewed enthusiasm. Only the terminology, of course, has changed. The jargon now is of diamoniferous kimberlites, of indicator minerals-meaning pyrope garnite and pierotlmenite-that turn an ordinary volcanic plug into a kimberlite with the potential for carrying diamonds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The basic pattern is nothing new: a commodity is found in a remote area. The more exotic the commodity, the more esoteric its technology, and the more remote from civilisation the pegging, the greater the area of uncertainty, and the greater the element of speculation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that encapsulates the sort of framework which people in both the stock market and the financial Press have traded on and, that is, that there is something terribly alluring about this particular resource development. I raised the matter first in the Senate on 17 November 1978 when talking about the current Ashton explorations. I tried to indicate that I believed that many people would get their fingers burnt in this exercise for those very reasons-that the speculation, the allure, the magic word 'diamond' and all the rest of it would combine to bring about a situation in which people would be tempted to invest their money in what they hoped would be an overnight get rich quick scheme. The Bulletin and Newsweek magazines by featuring cover stories on the diamond boom and saying that people should invest their money in diamonds as a hedge against inflation were simply adding to the whole situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In May and June of 1978 Graham Beith, to whom we shall return on a couple of occasions, sought and obtained maps and reports from the Department of Mines and Energy in Darwin covering the areas known as Limbunya and Waterloo near Mistake Creek and near the junction of that creek with the Negri River. He, according to his own testimony to people, was prompted to look in that area by stories of a diamond which had turned up in Tennant Creek where it had been sold to a local jeweller by an Aboriginal who thought it was a sapphire. Mr Beith, tracking down this elusive diamond, had managed to find the Aboriginal concerned; he managed to track him back to a situation in which he obtained information that this sapphire, which in fact was a diamond, had been found by the Aboriginal near Mistake Creek. Mr Beith obtained rights over what are known as exploration licence areas 2092 and 2093 in partnership with Mr Campbell Cooper, a well-known prospector and one who established his reputation at the very height of the Poseidon nickel boom by managing to peg the right places at the right time, and Mr David Lance who, as Senator Evans has said, is a stockbroker associated with the firm of Norths in Sydney.
       </para>
       <para>
        After a while, in order to obtain some further information about the area contained within ELs 2092 and 2093, Mr Beith, together with Mr Frank Nugan, commissioned a report from a well-known and reputed Sydney geologist, Dr Peter Solomon. I do not propose to speculate on Mr Nugan's involvement in his matter. I do not think anybody would be able to ascertain at this stage exactly what it was, how it was, what motivated it or anything about it. It would simply be one of those curious and interesting alleys down which, undoubtedly, any Senate investigation would wander for a little while before presumably coming upon either the same blank walls as have been encountered by most investigations of the activities of Mr Nugan or some wild allegation that, in fact, Negri River is one of the continuing alleged Central Intelligence Agency plots for undermining something or other in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyway, Beith and Nugan commissioned Dr Solomon to undertake his investigation. Dr Solomon's report which is dated 25 July 1979 was cautious but essentially negative. Dr Solomon, in the first part of his report which runs only to some two and a half pages, indicated that he had found no minerals of economic significance in the area. He believed that further work in the area was unwarranted, and he recommended that exploration licence applications 2092, 2093, 2120 and 2121 be withdrawn immediately.
       </para>
       <para>
        It ought to be said of Dr Solomon's report that he was not on the ground for a particularly long period. It also ought to be said that included within the framework of Dr Solomon's report there is not a detailed study of the Landsat photographs covering that area. I mention that because those Landsat photographs become of some relevance when one progresses to the next major geological report on the area. I think it is also of significance to know that Mr Beith communicated with a solicitor in a letter dated 7 December 1979, a letter addressed to Mr T. G. Peken, Esquire of Higgins, Morgan and Partners, Temple Court, Elizabeth Street, Sydney. Mr Beith in his letter to this solicitor said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise at this point that Solomon did not attempt a sampling at any point West of 129 degrees East, and that at best, his work, because of the financial limitations placed on him, was perfunctory.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, I think, important to understand that Mr Beith who is one of the two persons who commissioned the report subsequently described the report as being-his word-'perfunctory'. That leads us later to certain judgmental values to which I shall refer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next thing I want to say about negative geological reports, particularly as they affect diamond mining, is as follow: First, not all negative reports mean that one should put away any hope that prospects exist. The famous story that goes around the geological circles is of the very distinguished geologist who, in 1947, said that he would drink all the oil that was found in Alberta which now bases its economy upon its extensive discoveries of oil; secondly, it should be noted that all published geological maps of Western Australia failed to show kimberlite bodies where they have subsequently been found; thirdly, it should be indicated that indeed very extensive field work in areas now known and proved to contain kimberlites prior to their actual discovery on the ground did not record the presence of kimberlites; that is to say, of areas bearing diamond deposits.

        The two important events that occurred after the following report, however, are these: First, in late 1979 the Ashton partners, exploring on their Argyle leases which are about 100 kilometres removed from the area which we are discussing, the Negri River, made major discoveries of kimberlites and, indeed, of diamonds. In fact, the most recent work on this, published by Leo Chapman, the book entitled Diamonds in Australia: The Fields and the Prospectors was published last year by Bay Books in Sydney, and says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Late in 1979, the Ashton Joint Venture made a major discovery of alluvial diamond beds and a kimberlite pipe near Lake Argyle close to the Ord River Dam and the cattle port of Wyndham in the Kimberley region. CRA termed the find 'a new diamond province'. The alluvial diamonds were found on Smoke Creek 120 kilometres from the Argyle pipe. The biggest stone recovered before the onset of the wet season was 7.03 carats, found in the Smoke Creek alluvials.
       </para>
       <para>
        The book then goes on to discuss another Ashton exploration at Ellendale. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Ellendale is problematical, but a strong point in its favour is the high proportion of gem diamonds found in tests so far.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to weary the Senate with precise geological explanations of this but it is interesting to note that the bases of the Ashton discoveries have been not only diamonds in kimberlite formation but also diamonds in alluvial deposits. The Negri River system is part of the same river system-in other words, part of the same alluvial system-as the deposits so far encountered in other branches of the Ord River system by Ashtons and by others.

         —The way in which the river flows at the moment is not necessarily relevant to the way in which the river system may have been flowing at the time when the riverbed sank, leaving the alluvial diamond deposits along its entire course to be either found or exposed at a later date. It is important that they be part of the same river system. The fact that we may be talking about what happened 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years back in terms of the alluvial nature of the region does not necessarily mean simply that because things are in upstream and downstream relationship to each other at the moment in fact that was the case at the time when those alluvial deposits were laid down.

       <para>
        The second event that has occurred since the Solomon report came into existence is that the partners concerned in the Negri River exercise have commissioned a geologist, Dr Alan H. Voisey, a former Professor of Geology at Macquarie University and about whose bona fides Senator Evans has already spoken this evening, to undertake an investigation. I guess that his investigation could be described as perfunctory in some respects. He certainly studied the Landsat photographs of the area, unlike Dr Solomon, and spent some time, not a great deal of time I agree, on the ground in the particular area. His report dated 10 October 1980, is contained on pages 6 and 7 of the Negri prospectus, and draws a couple of matters to our attention. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the latter part of 1979, an announcement was made of the discovery of diamonds in two distinct geological environments in a portion of the Ord River catchment, upstream from Lake Argyle, in the northeast of Western Australia . . . The environments constituted a diamondiferous kimberlite pipe and, in the major drainage system downstream from the pipe, extensive diamond-bearing alluvial gravels.
       </para>
       <para>
        His recommendation was as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of the announced discovery of kimberlite and diamonds near Lake Argyle, it would be fair to say that the country and the gravel deposits covered by the Ord River catchment have been upgraded as diamond prospects. I recommend that Negri River Corporation Limited, having regard to the presence within the Licence Area of extensive alluvial deposits and of major structural features which could have provided channelways for kimberlite emplacement, should commence a detailed exploration programme on the Licence Area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Voisey, questioned later about the existence of the Solomon report, is quoted in the Australian Financial Review of 4 December 1980 as saying that even if he had been aware of the Solomon report it would not have caused him to alter the comments which he made and which appeared in the Negri prospectus. The article in the Financial Review states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Alan Voisey stated yesterday that even if he had seen the report by Dr Peter Solomon recommending immediate abandonment of the Negri areas, it would not have caused him to alter his recommendations to the Negri board that the areas were prospective for diamonds and warranted investigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        A major judgmental decision for people to make as a result is this: Is the extent to which the 'perfunctory' reports-that is Mr Beith's word-from Dr Solomon had not only been superseded but indeed had also been rendered totally irrelevant by the two new and significant factors, namely, the Argyle discovery and the Voisey report sufficient basis for not including in the prospectus the details, in precise terms, of the Solomon report?
       </para>
       <para>
        The next substantive group of issues to which I wish to turn concerns various agreements in which Mr Beith was involved, in the period from July 1979 to January 1980. On 25 July 1979 Mr Beith, in a hand-written document, authorised the stockbroker, David Lance, to sell out his interests in ELs 2092 and 2093 for a sum of not less than $2,000. On 8 August 1979 he purported to sell to a Mr S. Griff his interests in those two exploration licence areas for the sum of $2,600.
       </para>
       <para>
        In November 1979 Mr Beith engaged in some sort of dispute with his former partners, Cooper and Lance with Griff and sent telexes to the Northern Territory Mines Department indicating the existence of some dispute about the ownership or otherwise of the exploration licences. In January 1980 all of these disputes appeared to have been settled one way or the other and on or about 16 or 17 January 1980 Beith finally sold part of his interests in licence areas 2092 and 2093 to Design and Construction Pty Ltd of Mt Isa, a company which is owned by Sir Asher Joel and his family interests. One cannot help feeling that Mr Beith has somewhat sold his heritage for a mess of pottage or, having traded the proverbial cow for a couple of beans, he finds that the beans are unlikely to grow.

The Negri prospectus was subsequently issued and, like all prospectuses of this nature, it bears on the front page in fairly bold type a four word disclaimer which simply reads: 'This issue is speculative'. As Senator Evans indicated, it was issued on 15 October 1980 with Negri having four named directors. The directors of that company were Sir Davis Hughes, former leader of the National Country Party in New South Wales, former Minister, and former New South Wales Agent-General in London; Geoffrey Kelvin Gray who would be known to people in Sydney as the principal of G. K. Gray and Co., the auctioneers; Dr Brian Marshall, about whom I must confess I know absolutely nothing, and Michael Murray Hornibrook who is a solicitor of some repute in Sydney. Some honourable senators will know of my interest in greyhound racing. Mr Hornibrook is the solicitor for the National Coursing Association and handles all of its legal work. From my own knowledge, Mr Hornibrook is a solicitor of integrity and a person who would not be associated with any untoward dealings.

       <para>
        As I have said, the prospectus included on pages 6 and 7 the full details of the Voisey report. Page 16 of that prospectus also included reference to certain explorations that had taken place in the licence area. In fact, four of them of fairly negative character were indicated in the prospectus-the 1970 Antrim Copper Project Joint Venture, negative results; the 1973 Amoco Minerals Australia, negative results; the 1976 A.O. (Australia) Pty. Ltd., results which the report says were regarded as having negative features, and the 1979 Anaconda Australia Inc. program. The report says Anaconda conducted a reconnaisance program searching for large scale base metal deposits in the Victoria River region but reported that no significant discoveries were made. The matter then hit the popular Press, one might say, once the prospectus was released and on 22 October 1980 the Australian Financial Review led with a story under the heading: 'The Gem Float No One's Shouting About'. I will read part of the article and I will seek to have the whole of it incorporated in Hansard. The report reads, in part, as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        The areas cover the south-eastern part of the Ord River catchment, up-river from Lake Argyle and abutting the Northern Territory border.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, they represent Northern Territory equivalents of the areas where the CRA group has outlined its extensive Argyle deposits.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the prospectus practically tries to not sell the shares on offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from the comment by the company's consulting geologist, that because of the Argyle discoveries 'it would be fair to say the country and the gravel deposits covered by the Ord River catchment have been upgraded as diamond prospects', there is no speculative invitation discernible in the prospectus.

       </para>
       <para>
        THE Sydney stockbroker Norths is one of the more careful and older-established firms working out of Bond St, which makes its association with a diamond exploration float unusual.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the vendors of the diamond property are Cam Cooper, who made himself famous by pegging the mining warden's court in Leonora during Poseidon days, Sir Asher Joel, who is best known as director of Sydney Festivals and a media entrepreneur, and one of Norths' own consultants, the idea begins to sound unlikely.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps this is why Norths has approached the market to offer 3.5 million fully paid 20c shares in Negri River Corp Ltd, with a property that less circumspect members of the broking fraternity would regard as red hot, so quietly that almost no one has noticed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Negri float is to raise funds to carry out initial exploration on very extensive alluvial flats included in the 2,452 square kilometres of two licence areas being put into Negri.
       </para>
       <para>
        The areas cover the south-eastern part of the Ord River catchment, up-river from Lake Argyle and abutting the Northern Territory border.

       <para>
        Apart from the comment by the company's consulting geologist, that because of the Argyle discoveries 'it would be fair to say the country and the gravel deposits covered by the Ord River catchment have been upgraded as diamond prospects', there is no speculative invitation discernible in the prospective.
       </para>
       <para>
        The promoters of the float have gone to extreme lengths to achieve a near impossibility, in making a highly speculative mining prospectus read respectably.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only are Norths the underwriters, but Laing and Cruickshank, one of the big 10 of the London Stock Exchange, are London brokers to the issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the eagerness shown by local investors for recent diamond exploration raisings, attracting a London broker may seem a redundant touch for an issue which only seeks to raise $700,000, but the name is an impressive inclusion.
       </para>
       <para>
        So are the names of the officials of the company. Sir Davis Hughes, former leader of the NSW Country Party and Agent-General in London is chairman, Geoffrey K. Gray the auctioneer, is deputy chairman, and the other directors are Dr Brian Marshall, who has a reputation in geological circles, and Michael Hornibrook.
       </para>
       <para>
        The understated geological report included in the prospectus is signed by Professor Alan Voisey, the company's consulting geologist.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then there is the news that the vendors of the area are actually subscribing for their interest in the company, through a prior issue of 3.5 million shares also at 20c each, and will immediately get out of it only $90,000 to cover part of their expenses to date on the areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The vendors' interest is even more highly speculative than most as it is not particularly marketable, consisting of a 12 per cent royalty on net profits from any mining operation that results up to a maximum of $12 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to David Lance, one of the vendors and head of the research department at Norths, the other extraordinary aspect of the float is that the vendors came by their property before Lake Argyle became the most fashionable diamond address in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The licences were applied for in April, 1979, before CRA announced its Lake Argyle results, and before CRA started pegging all the alluvial country in sight.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is why such an obscure consortium is sitting on land surrounded by areas held by the big names in diamond exploration, including CRA, Western Mining Corporation and CSR.
       </para>
       <para>
        The vendors, finally, secured the areas after following up consistent rumours, from an English school teacher and Aborigines, of diamonds in the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several companies including Antrim Copper, Amoco Minerals Australia, A.O. Australia and Anaconda Australia have been through the areas, mostly looking for copper or large-scale base metals deposits, and have come up empty handed.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far the licence holders have managed a limited program of work, including basic geological outlining, but as they say in the prospectus 'the work was of a preliminary nature and was not carried out by qualified personnel. Such work was intended as a guide for the formulation of exploration programs for future years. The results of such work are accordingly considered to be insufficiently verified for inclusion in this prospectus'.

        The point I want to make is that for a period of some days prior to the float opening on the Exchange in Sydney the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales was in possession not only of the prospectus but also of the Solomon report and the Commission, charged as it is with the responsibility to oversee matters of company legislation and behaviour in New South Wales, did not seek to intervene in that period. There are a number of possible explanations as to why that occurred. Quite clearly it may have been, indeed I believe, that it made proper judgment that there was no basis to intervene. It may have been as has been suggested that the Commission was simply negligent or indeed that somebody was paid off. There are a number of possible explanations, but they do not detract from the fact that the Solomon report was in the Commission's possession.

        A number of things, of course, were occurring at the same time. On 4 December 1980 the general atmosphere of the market was good for diamonds. On 4 December 1980 the Sydney Morning Herald led with the headline 'Ashton's 13 carat stone . . .' The story read:
       </para>
       <para>
        A 13-carat diamond-the largest so far found in the Kimberley search-has been recovered by the Ashton joint venture in its exploration of the Smoke Creek area near Lake Argyle.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even Senator Evans's speech on 5 December did not dampen this market because on 8 December the Australian Financial Review led with the heading 'Ashton's Smoke Creek diamonds ''worth $53m''.' The article stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Ashton mining NL has estimated reserves at its Upper Smoke Creek deposits-
       </para>
       <para>
        I interpolate that that is part of the same river system--
       </para>
       <para>
        At about four million carats of diamonds worth about $53m.
       </para>
       <para>
        The atmosphere was pretty good for people getting in on what they thought may well have been a speculative issue. As I said, Senator Evans spoke on 5 December and his speech received fairly wide Press publicity despite the fact that he said-I think I can recall his speech-that certain things had not been included in the prospectus. Some members of the Press chose to write this up by saying that certain things had been omitted from the prospectus. Perhaps those words have the same meaning; I would not have thought so. Senator Evans was certainly careful to say that things had not been included but most reports exaggerated it in quite an improper fashion by saying that things had been omitted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The debate in which the honourable senator was engaged-during the course of it I made some interjections-also raised the extent to which Mr Beith had sought to provide to parties the Solomon report, with certain conditions attached, at the cost of $10,000. I think it is important to understand within the context of the whole situation that Mr Beith was acting not quite the white knight in shining armour role but was prepared to sell a report which he presumably had in his possession for $10,000. Next, the Australian Financial Review drew attention to the speculation in Negri affairs with a report, including a picture of Sir Asher Joel, which appeared on 12 December. The article was headed 'Negri vendor's staggering profits'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article went on to state:
       </para>
       <para>
        A company associated with Sir Asher Joel and his family has sold its entire shareholding in Negri River Corporation Ltd for a gross profit of $1.36 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, that if anything, is one of the most damaging indictments that one could find of the way in which the financial Press operates in Australia. It is one of the sloppiest pieces of reporting that one could possibly find. If one looks at what happened on that first day of trading it will be found, indeed, that the Bulletin, which got into the act on 23 December, wrote as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Certain sections of the Press are running a campaign of harassment against Sir Asher Joel, one of the vendors to the Negri River Corporation diamond prospecting float.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article went on to discuss the way in which the Australian Financial Review had alleged that the Joel family had made $1.36m. The Bulletin article further stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The company, Lindfield Enterprises Pty Ltd-
       </para>
       <para>
        Which I interpolate is a Joel family company--
       </para>
       <para>
        owned 1,040,000 Negri shares when that company listed on November 20. Shortly afterwards the shares were dispersed to four other companies, including Morrisons Outdoor Catering Pty Ltd (100,000 shares) and Tilliana Pty Ltd (924,998 shares).
       </para>
       <para>
        The article further stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Financial Review's breathless expose said: 'Tilliana's registered office is c/- Coopers and Lybrand, chartered accountants, of Mt Isa, but the identity of the shareholder or directors of the purchasing company remains a mystery'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Any mug should know-and particularly a finance reporter-that Mt Isa is one of the centres of the Joel family's operations, where they publish the daily newspaper and the national Mining Newspaper.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact the Joel family control both Morrisons Outdoor Catering and Tilliana-so far from selling out, they are still very much committed shareholders, and their 'staggering profits' are very much a paper exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, this exposes the weakness of financial journalism in this country because, in fact, Morrisons Outdoor Catering Pty Ltd is not one of the companies owned by the Asher Joel interests. The Bulletin in its 'Wildcat' column on 16 December 1980 tried to put the matter into some perspective with the heading 'Negri hysteria.'
       </para>
       <para>
        It indicated, as I have done, that the Solomon report had largely been overtaken by the Asian discovery and by the Voisey report. It indicated that AOG consultants-AOG is one of the mining explorers in the area-had recommended the surrounding areas as areas where leases should be taken out and that they had been advised by Geoffrey Nannes who has 29 years' experience in Australia and Africa and Dr Bruce Walpole, who has 30 years' experience, including 15 years at the Bureau of Mineral Resources. It was indicated that a large number of people in that area were still taking leases over related areas because they believed that it was, in fact, a good prospect. Indeed they continue to do so. De Beers is interested and only yesterday Diamond Mines of Australia announced a float for its leases on the Lennard River. On 2 December 1980 the Sydney Stock Exchange had decided that it would undertake some investigation and that the Chairman of the Stock Exchange, Mr Mullens, said that the executive committee had already examined the Negri River situation and had decided that there would be no suspension of trading in Negri shares at that stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next point I wish to make-honourable senators will be pleased to know that we are coming towards the end of this saga-is that on 24 February 1981 Mr John Brown, a member in the other place, made a speech on the National Companies and Security Commission Amendment Bill in which he made reference to this matter. It is important because he raised the position of Graham Beith once again. Earlier today Senator Evans described Mr Beith. I think his words were that he was a 'central character' in the whole of this exercise. Mr John Brown indicated that Beith was allotted 15,000 shares in the float but to use Mr John Brown's words ' . . . to his eternal credit he refused to trade in them.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans made reference to Mr Beith in terms of what Mr Beith is alleged to have said to Sir Asher Joel and what his alleged understanding was with Sir Asher Joel about the extent to which the Solomon report would-to quote Senator Evans again-'figure prominently' in public statements about this mater. Mr Beith is a former employee of the Joel family interests. He was employed in Mount Isa and later in Sydney on the Australian Miner, a newspaper which is owned and operated by the Joel family interests. It is unfortunate that the question of Mr Beith's position has to be taken into account and examined closely.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think Mr Beith is a witness of credibility. There are legitimate grounds for Senator Evans being prepared to put a certain weight on his evidence and for me to be prepared to put a certain different weight on his evidence. Mr Beith has a number of outstanding judgments against his name for the non-payment of debts. He is a person who has been in a position that he may well, for one reason or another, have done himself out of a potentially lucrative situation-whether by his own activity, whether he has been deceived by somebody, misled by somebody or whether he has been misinformed by somebody, one does not know. I think it is difficult to establish a pattern of credibility to the evidence of Mr Beith when he was prepared to sell the Solomon report for $10,000 on certain conditions and build that into a central pillar of a case to be made about persons involved.

Even that sort of point indicates the difficulties that arise. It is certainly true that a large number of public reputations are at stake in this matter. Sir Asher Joel's is only one of them, but his has been the most prominent. Sir Asher is not a particular favourite of many persons. He is not a particular favourite of the Corporate Affairs Commission. I do not think he is a particular favourite of Mr Walker, the Attorney-General in New South Wales. The fact that he was such a prominent character witness in the trial of Mr Ian Sinclair might make people form judgments on that basis. It is important to understand that for a Senate committee to be invited, given the limitations that Senator Missen has described as far as such a committee is concerned, to undertake an investigation into this matter without the time and resources that would be required would be a mistake.

Those concerns and matters of interest do require investigation when there is, as appears from newspaper reports, to which I restrict myself, an apparent instance of the public's not being fully informed on matters which were apparently known to the directors of the Negri River Corporation Ltd float.

        If it were the case that this matter was not under investigation by any competent authority it may well be that the Senate at this stage ought to use one of its committees to commence such an investigation, but the fact is that the matter is under investigation by at least two authorities-one being the Sydney Stock Exchange, which I put to one side, and the other being the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission. While that investigation is being conducted by the officers of that Commission, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs is an inappropriate vehicle to carry out a parallel investigation.

        I base my opinion on the ground which I believed Senator Puplick was making at the beginning of his remarks but which he completely undermined in the course of them. I do so on the basis that it is not for the Senate to impugn the integrity or competence of the Corporate Affairs Commission until we have its report before us. Senator Puplick did impugn either the integrity or the competence of the Corporate Affairs Commission. He said that it was either totally incompetent and negligent in not making available the Solomon report which was in its possession or that perhaps somebody had been paid off not to make it available.

I do not accept that we should make that sort of impugning of the integrity or competence of the Corporate Affairs Commission until we are in possession of its report. We may then come to the sorts of conclusions that are being hinted at by both Senator Evans and Senator Puplick as to that body. I have heard no reason so far which would persuade me that at this moment the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs should undertake a parallel investigation. For that reason I am content to wait for the Corporate Affairs Commission report to be made public.

         —I have listened to the debate. I think the matter of Negri River Corporation Ltd is an eminently suitable matter on which a Senate committee could undertake a follow-up to what has already been done by a Senate committee. If a case were made out that it was practicable and timely for a committee to do so I would have thought that it would be appropriate for the matter to be referred to that committee. But for some time I have believed that we need to introduce a new system in relation to references to committees which would provide for a two-stage procedure whereby a question is raised as to whether or not a matter should be referred to a Senate committee and the committee or some other group then considers how practical and timely it is for a committee to investigate that matter.

       <para>
        What we have before us tonight is an example of that procedure. Because Senator Evans gave notice of his motion last week and because the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs was able to meet yesterday the Senate now has before it, in effect, a report in which a majority of members of the committee which it was proposed should take the reference stated that for various reasons which have been explained by them they do not regard it as appropriate at this stage. So although prima facie I would have supported the motion I do not think we can do so in the face of a report from the Standing Committee saying that at the moment it does not think it should have the reference. From the point of view of the Senate's procedures I believe that a Senate committee's preliminary report as to whether it is practical, timely and appropriate for it to have a reference is something that should be taken not as final but certainly as being of considerable persuasiveness to this chamber when dealing with a proposition such as that contained in Senator Evans's motion.

         —I propose to speak a little more briefly than the subject matter of this Bill perhaps deserves, not least because of the time that I have already taken today trespassing on the patience of the Senate. Nonetheless some important issues are raised by it and I think it needs at least some serious consideration by this chamber. The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations was established by statute in 1976 on a co-operative national basis and has been operative since 1977. It consists of 21 members-representatives of the Commonwealth, States and local government, some citizens and observers from the two Territories. Its function is essentially to advise, as might be expected, on matters of intergovernment relations generally, subject from time to time to direction from the Premiers Conference as to the manner of its investigations and also to act on the basis of more explicit references to it by the Premiers Conference from time to time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill simply puts the structure and organisation of the ACIR on a proper statutory basis. To that extent its terms are quite uncontroversial. The only extraordinary feature of the legislation is the time that it has taken for it to be brought on. Problems in the formalised structure of the institution have been allowed to linger on for several years. That has caused a number of significant practical difficulties, some of which have been referred to in recent times in this chamber. I refer in particular to the problem of getting the accounts of the organisation properly audited by, as was always intended, the Tasmanian Auditor-General, Tasmania being the State in which the Council is physically located. The Tasmanian Auditor-General took the view that not only did he have no responsibility but also he had no power to audit the books of the Council in the absence of any express statutory authority to that effect. That kind of nonsense is now being resolved by the passage, at last, of this Bill. Its terms are welcomed by the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not purport to be a fervent admirer of the activities of the ACIR. Its actions for the most part tend to be a little too cautious, its approach a little too tunnel-visioned, for my taste but at the same time I believe sufficiently in the utility or the potential utility of the organisation to have been participating in its deliberations for the last year or so, first as a stand-in deputy for Mr Lionel Bowen, one of the Opposition nominees, and more recently as a member of the Council in my own right. I believe from that perspective that the work of the organisation, whilst in many ways frustrating because of its inevitable tendency to be preoccupied with compromises and hastening slowly, nonetheless has a real potential utility in making this cumbrous federal system of ours ultimately work.

        The Council is staffed by a highly competent group of researchers led by its current director, Mr Mark Lynch. It has produced a large number of working papers and information papers and has now commenced to produce a flow of significant reports containing useful recommendations on a variety of subject matters. Initially the scope of the activities of the organisation was deliberately small-scale and narrow. The first task undertaken by the Council was the production of a report on the question of interchange of personnel between different levels of government to develop an understanding of the way in which the system operated in other jurisdiction and to help, as a result, make the wheels turn a little more easily in the future. Nothing much seems to have happened by way of implementation of that report, even though there has been no significant dissent from any quarter in Australia as to the merit of the recommendations in it. The major ongoing research project of the Council is simply entitled 'Relationships' reference. Indeed, the terms of reference given to the Council by the Premiers Conference are about as wide as possible, namely:
       </para>
       <para>
        An examination of the relationships which should exist between Federal, State and local governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the development of a detailed approach to that reference that has preoccupied the Council for the last two years or more with the primary focus of activity being on the role of local government in the total system. A lot of empirical research as well as more conceptual work is being done to try to identify the strengths and, more obviously, the weaknesses of local government and to identify ways in which the system might be able to work more equitably and efficiently. The more specific matters that can be identified as also being the subject matter of the Council's concern are particular projects, such as intergovernmental relations in subject areas such as care of the aged, and another study on the Australian Loan Council which has more recently been embarked upon, not with the total support of State and Federal treasuries but nonetheless with sufficient arm's length willingness to participate to make it possible that some fresh approach will be identified and articulated in terms of the operation of our public borrowing system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the most immediately useful report that the ACIR has so far produced is a very recent one on the subject of roads or what ought to be the responsibility of the respective level of governments for road funding and for road administration in this country-a reference prompted by the consideration that the road funding arrangements that had prevailed for a number of years were winding to a close in June last year. That period was subsequently extended by another year. It was based also on a fairly universal recognition that there were some fundamental problems in the multiplicity of authorities and agencies with responsibility in this area, and some fundamental irrationalities in the way in which funds were disbursed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it has been generally acknowledged that the quite substantial report, prepared largely at the instance of one of the research directors of the Council, Mr John Jamison, has in fact been a quite substantial and thought-provoking contribution to the debate and one which may indeed have considerable influence. I think it ought to be mentioned also that the annual reports of the organisation that will appear in the future are likely to amount to quite a useful commentary on federal affairs or intergovernmental issues as they are breaking in a whole variety of contexts and environments. The kind of record that will be built into the terms of that annual report in future will, I think, be quite a useful resource document.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question that concerns me more than all this, however, is not so much the past and the present activities of the Council but where it might go in the future. It is one view-it is probably the prevailing view, and indeed an understandable view-that the survival and the continued funding by the various governments to the Council depends essentially on its doing no more than producing small and incremental recommendations about various things in a context in which society never moves fast enough or far enough to offend more than a small minority of politicians and bureaucrats at any given time. But in that way lies a recipe for survival for this and most other sorts of organisations within the governmental system. But I suspect that the real credibility of this organisation, measured from some retrospective platform of years hence, and the real utility of the organisation for the future of the nation will increasingly depend on its willingness to tackle some rather harder issues, some rather bigger issues, some issues which are likely to stir the possums and really to create opposition, perhaps in the first place wrong-headed or pigheaded opposition, and to do the sorts of things which will require people to rethink the basic assumptions on which they operate in participating in intergovernmental relations.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the issues which I think it would be desirable to see the ACIR confronting, at least as a longer term project, is the future of tax sharing arrangements in this country. It must be apprarent to everyone by now that Fraser's fiscal federalism-I am tempted to continue the alliteration down a rather different track-is, at the very least, a fraud. This is a question which is, of course, assuming a great deal of prominence and a great deal of significance with the winding up in this financial year of the Whitlam tax sharing formula which has indeed been about the only thing so far which has kept the States financially viable against the Huns and the Visigoths of the Commonwealth Treasury, bent as they are on winding back public sector expenditure, and that channelled through the States in particular.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be obvious that the kind of new federalist fiscal model that has been developed and articulated on so many platforms around the country by Mr Fraser since 1975 is no more and never has been anything more than an excuse for winding back Commonwealth participation and, more importantly, Commonwealth financial grants to a whole variety of activities-roads, housing, urban development and community-based health and welfare services, those areas simply being, I suppose, the most obvious and conspicuous examples of where the winding down of Commonwealth funding is hurting most and is operating most visibly. It ought to be perfectly obvious that this has gone on because the present Government, politically sophisticated as it undoubtedly is, knows all too well that the ideological appeal to federalist instincts that in fact it has been making in developing the new federalist model-the calling on the States to carry out their own responsibilities and to assume the financial responsibilities for the functions they in fact exercise--

         —That goes for my colleague on my right from South Australia, too, not to mention my colleague from the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Fraser knows perfectly well that the motions he is going through, the ideological appeal he is making to the States to carry the can for the functions that they exercise and to assume the fiscal responsibility for financing those functions, is no more and no less than a bluff-a big 'B' bluff. It has ever been thus. The trouble is that the world has moved on since the 1942 uniform tax case and all the atmospherics and the emotion that went with it. Despite the continuance of the rhetoric of States' rights, the reality is that, as every State Premier in this country knows, for the States to impose their own income tax surcharges to pick up the financial burdens where the Commonwealth grants leave off is no more and no less than signing ones own electoral death warrant. That has been the attitude not only of Labor Premiers but also of conservative premiers, even those who waxed most indignantly rhetorical about the inequities of cutting off Federal funds and those who have waxed most enthusiastically rhetorical about the new federalist model and the recession of power back from the Commonwealth to the States where it rightfully belongs.

        I am reminded on these occasions, as I have been reminded on numerous occasions over the years, of that famous ditty penned by Sir Robert Garran at a Premiers Conference, or it may have been a Loan Council meeting, in the early 1950s when, as Sir Robert Menzies used to do very successfully, indeed, once again he succeeded in calling the States' bluff on a question of restoration to the States of their own income taxing powers. It became perfectly apparent that the States, whilst they were prepared to carry on about the matter publicly, had no such intention. The ditty by Sir Robert Garran, with which many honourable senators will no doubt be familar and which was pushed down the table at the Premiers Conference, was to the following effect:
       </para>
       <para>
        We thank you for the offer of a cow
       </para>
       <para>
        But we can't milk

        We answer in a loud resounding chorus
       </para>
       <para>
        Please keep the cow and do the milking for us.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly the attitude which has prevailed ever since the uniform tax arrangements became a fait accompli in the wartime circumstances of the 1940s, and despite all the huffing and puffing and all the nonsense about new Federal fiscal models, that is the contemporary reality. If we are to get some equity back into the distribution of the revenue derived by the public purse in the payout between the Commonwealth Government and the States we must somehow elevate our conceptual thinking beyond the banal and rhetorical level which operates at the moment. Whether the ACIR will ever have the clout, the competence or the vision to impose some more rational tax-sharing formulae and conceptual apparatus to justify it than that which prevails at the moment, I do not know; but I would like to see the attempt made.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area in which I would like to see the ACIR playing a more prominent role in the future in rationalising governmental relations is the whole question of reshaping the constitutional demarcation of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. There are an innumerable number of familiar areas in which the present constitutional division of powers limits the Commonwealth's competence to quite a restricted range of matters, being those within the rather narrow vision of the founding fathers in the 1890s developed by them against an ideological perception in favour of small government generally and small central government in particular. There has been a general recognition, I believe, among many sections of the community-unfortunately that does not extend as far as the State Premiers and many State politicians-that there does need to be some reordering of the present layout of responsibilities. One of the most obvious areas in which the cry of pain has been heard, and heard often, is that of family law-and indeed a whole variety of other kinds of laws affecting personal status of one kind or another-where there remains a quite unfortunate division of responsibilities, and limitations really, as to what the Commonwealth can do compared with the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a whole variety of safety issues-road safety and occupational safety-in respect of which again there is an incapacity, as present consititutional arrangements stand, for any kind of uniform law to be applied except at the cost of years and years of negotiation, very often resulting in the lowest common denominator compromises of the kind with which we are all too familiar in the corporations and securities area now. In this morning's Press an organisation raised a question about the absence of a capacity to pass national laws with respect to facilities for the disabled. That is another obvious area where the multiplicity of jurisdictional responsibilities militate against rational decision-making and rational provision for the interests of the community. Defamation law and other perhaps more controversial areas of the law affecting the media could also arguably benefit from more national vision than is possible under the present Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply mention also a much more financially significant point than any of those; that is, the whole question of constitutional power to deal with the resources boom and its economic implications. We are all too familiar with the kind of competitive bidding to attract multinational investments that has been so characteristic of the Australian resource scene and energy development scene in recent years and how States have been falling over each other to underbid and to sell off energy resources at the lowest possible price at the expense of the overall interests of the nation. I think that is easy to argue and to establish. We are forced into that position by the absence of constitutional power to impose rational national planning on these very vexed issues. There are many more points that could be made along those lines, but I think they are all familiar and speak for themselves. If anyone is to bring a fresh vision to bear and perhaps be the vehicle through which some of the necessary thinking can be done, maybe it is the ACIR in the longer term.
       </para>
       <para>
        The largest question of all and, I suppose, the one that the ACIR, along with everyone else, is most reluctant to tackle, is the question of the whole future of the federal structure itself with the three-tier system so far, it seems, being taken for granted by everyone. It involves one Comonwealth with, as we have seen, limited constitutional powers; six States with rather larger powers but acting within quite irrationally and arbitrarily drawn nineteenth century colonial boundaries; and two Territories, one of which is aspiring to statehood although it has a total population not much bigger than a grand final football crowd. Of course, I refer to one in Melbourne, not in Sydney.

         —Sydney might have one big enough in Parramatta but I do not want to get into that argument. In addition, we have over 900 units of local government of one kind or another. So to govern a population of not much more than 14 million people we have nearly 1,000 separate legislative chambers, approximately 1,000 full time parliamentarians and, on top of that, another 10,000 or more part time parliamentarians in the shape of councillors for local government. Australia is one of the most spectacularly governed countries in the world in terms of quantity, if not quality. When one looks at the bare statistics I have outlined, this question arises: Is this the most rational way of governing this country or indeed any other? I have always been impressed when I have considered these things by what that well known Liberal Sir Percy Spender had to say on these matters in his 1972 opus called Politics and a Man. This is something that ought to be engraved on the hearts of some honourable senators opposite who are all too inclined to accept alternative propositions and to give them shibboleth status. On page 51 Sir Percy stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Nothing has, however, retarded the concept of Australian unity so much as the public attitude and performance of the State-righters and the posturing of State politicians.
       </para>
       <para>
        There it is. That comes from the heart. That comes from one of the great, gilt-edged Tory politicians of all time. I will be prepared to concede that he did not know much about international law, but he knew a fair bit about the pigheadedness, the stubbornness and the tunnel vision of the States-righters, the politicians who, I regret, operate most of the powers that are available to governments in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        For years I have also been impressed, as have most honourable senators on this side of the chamber and even a handful on the other side-although it is more than their preselections are worth ever to admit it-by the whole approach to rethinking the federal structure that has been most effectively articulated over the decades by Gough Whitlam, former Labor Prime Minister, and by others who, like him, have seen a more rational governmental future for Australia in very different terms from the continuation into the hereafter of this leaden, three-tier system that we have at the moment. I am referring, of course, to the regional model of Australia's future which would be built up around the concept of a central government exercising the major legislative and executive powers, in particular the major powers that are necessary to be exercised in the national interest so far as resource allocation is concerned, but with a very substantial devolution of actual on-the-ground administrative decision-making in addition to a significant devolution of locally relevant legislative powers to perhaps 70 or 80 regional assemblies around Australia which would be somewhat intermediate in size and also in terms of powers between the present local governments and the existing State governments. That is the kind of model which assumed notoriety-I suppose that is the only word for it-during the Whitlam years. 'Whitlam centralism' became the kind of catch cry against which a generation of political reputations were made and broken.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it would be unfortunate if this kind of thinking, which is much more participatory, much more genuinely democratic and much more devolved in its intended operation than its critics have ever given it credit for, did not remain part of our vocabulary and our thinking when it comes to intergovernmental relations. It ought certainly to remain part of the conceptual apparatus that a body such as the ACIR and its staff continues to bring to bear in thinking about a more rational division of powers in this country. I acknowledge the extent to which vested interests and the strength of parochial preoccupations are absolutely fundamental phenomena in the Australian political scene at the moment and how irrelevantly visionary a lot of this must seem. Nonetheless, I hope that there will be a willingness over the decades to come to explore just some of the possible alternative bases on which our whole system of government might be structured and premised, and that the ACIR might be the kind of organisation which would be prepared to take some leadership in that respect in the future. Of course, it is always easier to tackle easy questions than hard ones. It is always easier for bodies of this kind, for Senate committees even, to make easy decisions rather than to approach and to contemplate the making of hard decisions. But if the ACIR is to become something more than a mere vehicle for the apologetic defence of the status quo, it has to think in these terms otherwise it will be an utterly worthless institution.

         —The Bill which the Senate is looking at tonight is an amending Bill and relates to the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. It is, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) and other honourable senators have said, a machinery measure and therefore is not a major piece of legislation. Nevertheless, I will take the opportunity of saying that it has very strong elements of importance because it provides the opportunity for the Senate and for any legislative body to have some general discussion upon the whole matter of government, upon the whole area of the tiers of government that we have in this country and, as Senator Evans has just said, the relationship and usefulness of those various levels of government, bearing in mind our historical structure, our geographical development and the number of people we have in this country. We can try to determine whether we can afford or benefit from not only those three tiers of government but also the fairly substantial number of people who are involved and who make their contribution. So, it gives the opportunity to the Senate and to the Parliament to look at not only the matters of this Advisory Council but also the interdependence between the various tiers of government in Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations was established in 1976 and has been entrusted with the important task of improving inter-governmental co-operation. The Council is made up of representatives of the three levels of government in Australia-the Commonwealth Government, the various State governments and, of course, the all important area of local government. It carries out its task by inquiring into and reporting upon matters relating to the improvement of inter-governmental co-operation. But while this Council is constructed the way it is and while it has the responsibilities it has, it is important to observe-I am not sure that I agree with the principle-that the only matters it can inquire into and report upon are matters which are referred to it not by any one of the tiers of government but by no less a body than the Premiers Conference. However, the Bill before us, as the Minister has said, is 'aimed principally at reinforcing the Council's independence in the performance of its functions by providing for the Council to become a body corporate with its own bank account, to have control over its staffing arrangements, exempting the Council from Commonwealth and State taxation laws and by making it clear that the Council is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Commonwealth'. In other words, this machinery Bill is designed to strengthen the Council's independence, effectiveness and usefulness in its advisory role to governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been looking at the latest annual report of the Council and two matters appear to have been referred to it for inquiry and report. Its first reference dealt with a study of the costs and benefits of an interchange of personnel between the three spheres of government. Its second reference was to examine the relationships which should exist between Federal, State and local government. This has been described as the relationship reference while the earlier one was described as the interchange reference. Neither of these inquiries impressed me as being of particular significance yet I think it is very important that this Council, carrying as it does a membership drawn from the whole range of the tiers of government, spend its time in conducting this sort of examination because it will confirm the kinds of results that have been reached by all manner of people who, over the years, have looked at the relationships between governments and the possibilities of interchange. In 1978, a Premiers Conference suggested that the Council, when examining the reference about the relationships between Federal, State and local governments, should concern itself with the relationships that should exist between what I will call the third tier, that is, the tier of local government, and its relationships with the Commonwealth. The inquiry into the interchange reference which relates to staffing matters has been completed and the report has been released. The Council suggested that a greater amount of co-operation might be established and understanding might be improved if there were opportunities for personnel to transfer from one to the other, thereby increasing and improving the services each to the other.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the relationship reference, it was decided to commission a number of papers. This has been carried out and honourable senators will see reference to these papers in the report. They look at specific areas of governmental relations both in this country and abroad. We have had papers presented on local government in Australia, the functions of government in Australia and the relationships between State and Commonwealth governments. Others refer to roads, housing and care for the aged. Beyond Australia, there has been a study of inter-governmental relations in England, in the United States and in the Federal Republic of Germany. While all of these papers were commissioned primarily to help the Council, they were, of course, of great interest to anyone who was interested in federations and, in particular, in inter-governmental relationships within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we refer to the specific inquiry that dealt with the relationship between local government on the one hand and Commonwealth and State governments on the other, it is important to remember that the Council focused its attention in a number of areas. Some of these dealt with the role which local government should perform in serving ratepayers and citizens, the responsibilities of providing a community infrastructure, the matter of revenue raising capacity, the machinery for co-ordination, consultation and co-operation and, most of all, the resources required to improve the effectiveness of local government. This apparently aroused a great deal of interest because about 230 submissions were received and a whole range of public meetings and seminars were held in well over 20 centres in all of the States and in the mainland Territories. These inquiries give some indication not only of the good work which the Advisory Council is doing, but also of the kind of work it is capable of performing. I am interested in this matter because if the Council undertakes this sort of work I believe that in future it has every possibility of carrying out even wider and more significant inquiries as to how inter-government co-operation can be achieved and how inter-government understanding can be improved within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations has an enormous scope. I think it is important that it is established in our community. I think it is very important that it is strengthened within our community because in a federation such as ours there are periods when and various areas in which governments-Commonwealth, State or local-come into tension or conflict one with the other over issues and some of the problems are not easily or readily resolved. The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations can provide a lead to government in solving some of these problems. The nature of its relationship to local government is of particular interest to me. I think the strengthening of the Council for which the Bill provides will be of benefit to local government. In the local government relationships reference the Council has decided to examine the topic of revenue raising capacity. That involves the matters of financial relationships and assistance and the continuity of fiscal arrangements in our whole range of government structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        May I recall for the Senate the discussions which we have had earlier in relation to this matter as far as local government is concerned. Honourable senators will be aware of the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act under which the Government apportions to this sphere of government a fixed amount of the country's income tax receipts. This move has been of great assistance to local government because it has allowed councils to have a considerable degree of independence and flexibility in determining their own programs, setting their own priorities and in the provision of local government services. As honourable senators will be aware, at present local government receives two per cent of the Commonwealth's personal income tax collection, a percentage which this current financial year will provide over $300m for local government in Australia. It is important to point out that this amount represents a 35 per cent increase over the funds which were made available in 1979-80. This has been of considerable benefit to local government. I believe careful attention has to be paid to the proportion of income tax revenue allocated to local government because the matter of local government financing in the 1980s is of considerable importance and significance.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are living and working in a time when taxation reform is being widely discussed and debated both within government and public circles. There could be a move away from a personal income tax sharing system because this system has been described as a declining tax instrument. I have made this point before in dealing with legislative measures that have been put before the Senate in relation to local government and its share of total income tax revenue. There is a demand in the community for a reduction in the level of income tax. Such a reduction might well reduce the money that could flow to this level of government, that is, the area of local government. I think this has to be recognised and has to be watched because if the Council for Inter-government Relations is to have any function at all it has to exercise a very strong watching brief in this matter. It seems to me that in the years ahead local government might well be required to have a closer involvement in the decision making as far as this financial base is concerned and the financial arrangements which might be worked out. Local government will be required to have a closer and more intimate consultation with Commonwealth and State governments. I suggest that it is here that this Council which is the subject of the legislation now before the Senate can be most useful, most effective and most operative. The new powers, limited though they may seem to be, which are given to the ACIR may prove to be most useful and most effective.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have already mentioned, the references are directed to the Council by the Premiers Conference and the Council reports its findings to the Commonwealth and State governments as well, be it noted-may I add with some emphasis-as to the Australian Council of Local Government Associations. This body which is located here in Canberra represents local government bodies throughout Australia, but does not have the ability to initiate inquiries as do the State and Commonwealth governments subject to the approval of a Premiers Conference. It would appear to me that as the provisions of the legislation now stand the Commonwealth and the State governments in this matter of government have an advantage over the third sphere of government in Australia-local government, an area of government in Australia to which we pay a good deal of tribute and lip service but which we all readily recognise is one of the most important areas of government in Australia because it involves not only the people who are close to the action scene but also people who live and work in areas to which local government is related. Obviously there would be problems in dealing with the situation and amendments might very well be proposed in due course to allow local government bodies to make suggestions directly to this Council rather than through individual members of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations.

        These things are fairly simplistic in their stating and one recognises that there are more complexities than would appear just by stating the facts. But as government systems develop in this country I think it is important, if we have any regard for federalism at all and if we have any regard for the three tiers of government, to recognise that local government has come a long way in the last 100 years and that within it there are people of authority, understanding and effectiveness and they need to be provided with the opportunity to make significant input rather than just standing back to receive whatever is agreed to be apportioned to them.

        Local government and the Council of Local Government Associations feel that this Council about which we are speaking, the ACIR, is performing a good function. Local government generally believes the reports produced by the Council are of great value and are of great benefit and that they engender debate on topics which is extremely useful and upon which answers are not always readily available. I mention this because at the last three annual conferences of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations there have been resolutions of very strong support for ACIR. They have approved the work which the ACIR is doing and have undergirded the initiatives which it has taken. So the strengthening of the ACIR will be of value to the Australian Council of Local Government Associations and marks yet another step of progress in relation to relationships between the various levels of government in this country.

        I want to refer to a situation in another area which, nevertheless, has a close connection to the subject matter. It exists probably more particularly in South Australia than anywhere else. This matter has been raised in this Senate many times and again as late as this afternoon. I refer to the salinity problems in the River Murray. I do not intend to initiate a debate on this area of public interest. This river flows through the States of Victoria and New South Wales and into South Australia. For many decades a salinity problem has been identified but concerted action to overcome the problem has been hampered by a lack of co-operation and co-ordination not only between the States but also between the various levels of government. I trust that honourable senators will forgive me for referring to a report with which you, Mr Acting Deputy President, are familiar. I refer to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution. I know it is 10 years since we put that report down in the Senate, but I take this opportunity to cite a couple of paragraphs from that report. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Some Australian rivers are naturally saline. The salinity of others is increased by the actions of man. Both natural circumstances and the activities of man affect the River Murray, which has the most important salinity problem in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report also states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . there is . . . evidence indicating . . . a lack of co-ordination between the States, an even more lamentable lack of anti-pollution powers among the organisations involved with the management and use of the Murray, and a pressing need for some overall organisation which could analyse the problem and effectively solve it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that these sentences were written well over 10 years ago and many things have happened since then. I emphasise the quotation which emphasised that there was a lack of co-ordination between the levels of government and between the States. I would commend to the ACIR for the work which it is already doing in the area of governmental relations. It should assist or even pave the way for co-operation between the various levels of government within this country. It should find a solution or at least call the authorities together to find a solution to this one problem on which I place some emphasis. Of course, there are other areas where problems have arisen. Their solution has been delayed because of intergovernmental relations difficulties and by a failure of governments at various levels to exercise clear constitutional powers.

        The Bill has my support. The Council has my support; but I draw attention, with some emphasis, to the statement of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) when introducing the Bill. Referring to the amendments, he said:

       <para>
        These amendments are aimed principally at reinforcing the Council's independence in the performance of its functions . . .

       <para>
        I hope that that will be borne out, as the Minister hopes. One of the problems we have with the establishment of organisations of this kind seems to me to be the degree of inactivity that seems to come from them. The intergovernment situation in Australia seems to me to be at a watershed position. The way that this Advisory Council performs its duties will influence the way governments and authority in this country develop. Local government stands to gain a great deal if it is given room to move and, what is more, the wherewithal to operate. We seem to be in danger of drowning in a sea of intergovernmental organisations and councils. Inquiries multiply, references proliferate and no one can make a decision. Everyone is waiting for some report. Everyone is waiting for someone else to do something. State Ministers seem to refer back and public servants seem to be unable to pronounce or even to decide.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Advisory Council is to be supported. It is to be undergidered and it is to be strengthened. It is to be supplied with leadership, with encouragement and with the opportunity to move, to make decisions and to do things for the good of this federal system which we have. I hope that this Bill will find a reflection in the new activity and the new assertion which this Council will have and that before too long we will be able to see the benefits that will flow from this legislation.

         —Firstly I would like to direct some comments to the remarks made by the two previous speakers. My colleague, Senator Evans, was something akin to an insider speaking out. He is an insider because he is a member of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. I will be quite different. I will be an outsider looking in. Because I am an outsider looking in I might have a quite different approach from that of my colleague, Senator Evans. He looked to the future and to what might happen to the ACIR. I will be looking at the Council as it exists at present. I certainly will not be as conceptually orientated as my colleague was but I will look rather more at the practical aspects of the Council.

        I would like to make some remarks about some of the comments made by Senator Davidson. He mentioned that at the moment local authorities are guaranteed 2 per cent of income tax collections from the Commonwealth. Local authorities will have to be wary in future-and as I have moved around and spoken to members of local authorities I have seen that they realise that they will have to be wary in future-if there is a major shift in the focus of taxation by the Commonwealth Government. If there is a shift and if income tax collections as a proportion of the total tax collected by the Commonwealth become smaller, it may be that the local authorities will have to have a higher proportion of the income tax collections or share in some of the other taxation that is being used to make up for the income tax collections. I was quite taken with what I thought was a significant and worthwhile suggestion by Senator Davidson. He suggested that local government authorities should have an input into the ACIR. This sort of input would be necessary if we found that local authorities become financially disadvantaged because of a shift in the way that revenue is being raised by the Federal Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existence of the Advisory Council recognises the fact that Australia has a three-tier interdependent system of government. The authority of the Federal Government is clearly set out in our Constitution and by implication, so too is the authority of each of the State governments. Those powers for which the Federal Government does not have competence-the residual powers, as they are often called-lie with the State governments. On the other hand, local authorities owe their existence to State government legislation and thus their powers vary throughout the Commonwealth. For the effective functioning of government in Australia it is imperative that these three levels of government co-operate with one another. The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations was established to improve such intergovernment co-operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Council has 22 members. Five members come from the Commonwealth Parliament. One member comes from each of the six State parliaments. There are six local government representatives, and five citizens appointed by the Prime Minister after consultation with the State Premiers. For some time Queensland was not represented on the Advisory Council. This fact was something of a disappointment to me because I, as a senator for Queensland, had hoped that Queensland would participate from the very beginning. In mid-June 1979 Queensland became represented and has been a participant on the Council ever since.
       </para>
       <para>
        In general the Council operates under the direction of the Premiers Conference. The amendment Bill now being debated is designed to strengthen the independence of the Council. At first glance criticism of the Council would appear to be indefensible. After all, who would suggest that there should not be co-operation between our three levels of government? I certainly do not suggest that. I suggest that now that the Bill is being debated it is timely that some of the activities of the Council were examined critically. I would like to mention the financial commitment that centres upon the Council. Considerable funds are required for the upkeep of the ACIR and these funds come from the Commonwealth Government, the State governments and the Australian Council of Local Government Associations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to outline some of the receipts of the Council for the latest year for which I have any information, the year ended 31 August 1979. The Commonwealth contributed $156,500; the New South Wales Government contributed $35,500; the Victorian Government contributed $30,000; the South Australian Government contributed $17,500; the Western Australian Government contributed $17,000; the Tasmanian Government contributed $13,500, which would be a considerable sum to Tasmania; and the Australian Council of Local Government Associations contributed $30,000. All of these sums are significant sums to the bodies involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worthwhile having a look at how this money was spent. Salaries and payments in the nature of salary amounted to $189,453. This represents a fair slice of the money that was contributed by the Commonwealth, the States and local government associations. I was also somewhat amazed to see that fares amounted to $37,000 and that permanent premises were purchased for $106,000. A total of $431,000 was spent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mention these figures because it is worthwhile having a look at what contribution the ACIR is making if this sort of money is involved. In terms of total budget, expenditure of the magnitude that I outlined is not large but, on the other hand, it is an amount which should not escape scrutiny. For half a million dollars a year one would hope that some significant steps towards intergovernmental co-operation were being made. With that in mind it is pertinent to examine what the Premiers Conference has referred to the Council for inquiry and report. The third report-the latest report available-outlines that in April 1976 the interchange program was referred to the Council. This concerned a study of how personnel could be interchanged between spheres of government. The Council was asked to make a recommendation on how this could be implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        The relationships reference has been mentioned by other speakers. On 24 January 1978 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) suggested that with regard to the relationships reference the Council should study, at the start, the relationship which should exist between local government and the Commonwealth and State governments. These two references-the interchange reference and the relationships reference-are the only references that have gone to the Council so far. The interchange reference has been completed and a report has been presented to this Parliament. The report on the interchange reference is mentioned in the latest report of the Council as 'Staff Interchanges between Governments in Australia'. This report outlined procedures for short term interchange of staff. The recommendations in the report tend to formalise existing practices. No co-ordinating committee has yet been set up for the interchange of staff.
       </para>
       <para>
        Early in 1980 an interdepartmental committee was set up to consider how the report could best be implemented. The major problem seems to be the portability of superannuation. My information is that this has been referred to the State Public Service boards and superannuation authorities for further consideration. The fact that this report has been referred to an IDC implies some level of government acceptance of the report's recommendations. I have been informed that since this report has been referred to the IDC, the Commonwealth Public Service Board has displayed a greater inclination to arrange short term interchanges. If this is so it supports the conclusion that there is a certain level of government support. But it is well to question whether this report of the Council has yet had a major impact.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fine to have a report; it is fine to refer that report to an IDC. But something more than that is required before the Council's report will be seen to have had a major impact. I am not implying that nothing will be achieved as a result of this reference, but so far little seems to have been achieved. If this is the case it is a pity that we have all the work done to provide a report which will achieve so very little. For half a million dollars a year some positive results are warranted, not merely reports, IDC discussions and referring a problem back to the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been one published report concerning the relationship reference. An examination of this report indicates that much work has been carried out in respect of that reference. Nevertheless, to the outsider, there does not appear to be any prospect of an early implementation of the findings from this study. In the second annual report a number of studies which have been undertaken by academics are mentioned. As a one-time academic I have no objection to work being carried out by well-qualified people from universities and colleges of advanced education. Yet I do have doubts whether any tangible benefits are likely to come from the research which is being undertaken. It may be open to question that this type of research should be funded through this Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. Perhaps it should be funded through the universities themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together with other senators, I support the concept of the ACIR and the amending legislation which is being debated. But let us not allow ourselves to be so supportive that we do not critically examine the Council's work and achievements. It has a real role to play in intergovernment relations in Australia and has the potential to achieve much for the three levels of government. Even though the Council must operate in accordance with directions from the Premiers Conference, it is incumbent on members of the Federal Parliament to scrutinise its work and to see that the Commonwealth, the States and local authorities are obtaining value for money. In this regard, namely, the scrutiny of the activities of the Council, I level another criticism. I hope that the criticism will be taken as a constructive one. Section 6 of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations Act directs that as soon as practicable after 31 August each year the Council shall prepare an annual report. That report is then to be furnished to the Prime Minister, the Premiers and the Australian Council of Local Government Associations. Section 7 of the Act requires that the Prime Minister table a copy of the report within 15 sitting days after he has received a copy of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against that type of information it is worthwhile noting that the first report for the year ended 31 August 1977 was presented to Parliament on 1 November 1977. I regard that short time between the end of the year and the tabling of the report as quite acceptable. A prompt tabling of the Council's report allows senators and members to have up to date information on the Council's activities. In the next year the situation was not as good. The second annual report for the year ended 31 August 1978 did not come into the Parliament until 20 March 1979. This means that the report's information was at least six months old before senators and members could read it. However, the latest report-the third report-for the year ended 31 August 1979 was not tabled until 26 August 1980. At that stage the information was five days short of being 12 months out of date. Those senators and members who want to fulfil their duty to scrutinise the activities of the Council are being frustrated by the late tabling of these reports. This criticism does not apply to tabling of the first report. That was tabled quite promptly. The tabling of the second report was not quite as prompt as the tabling of the first. But the third report was tabled in this Parliament quite late. It was tabled nearly 12 months after the end of the period to which the report referred. There is no reason why reports should not or could not be tabled as quickly as was the first report. All those who are responsible should see that this occurs.

        In the course of my comments this evening I have made some criticisms-some mild criticisms, I think-of the ACIR. The concept of the ACIR is something that we in the Federal Parliament should all support. On the other hand, it is a body that requires finance from the Federal Parliament. Because of this we should be able to scrutinise the activities of the ACIR and scrutinise them clearly. I trust that my comments and criticisms will be taken in the light in which they are intended. They are intended to be constructive criticisms. I hope those who are responsible will take them as such.

         —I stand tonight briefly to make a request and perhaps a criticism in relation to the present situation, as I see it, within the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. I have had quite a lot to do with this Council over the last four years. I retired in the last few months from the Council. I was one of the foundation Commonwealth Government members of the Council. The Council has five representatives from the Commonwealth Government. I served for the first two terms during the setting up period of the Council. I am fairly aware of the work that it has done, where it is going and what has brought it about. The Premiers conferences found over the years when they were debating various matters there was a necessity for someone to carry out research on the various matters that came before them. So the ACIR was formed so that the Premiers could refer various matters to the Council which is comprised of 22 members. These 22 members, as other honourable senators have said, are from the Federal government, State governments, local government and chosen citizens from around Australia.

        Senator Colston made some remarks on the ACIR expenditure. Perhaps he did not realise that the amount of money that was spent in purchasing a headquarters was necessary. That body is situated in Hobart. It was felt that it should be in Hobart as a clear indication to all that whilst the ACIR was set up under a Federal Act, it really was of State interest and was not really a part of the Commonwealth Government. The ACIR has been particularly jealous to ensure that it did not get the image of being Canberra based. Many of its meetings are held around Australia. Since that body was inaugurated it has travelled widely and in carrying out its inquiries, many citizens have appeared before it throughout Australia.

        It is not my intention to go through the various amendments in the legislation that have been outlined. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who is in charge of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations Amendment Bill 1981 has clearly indicated what the amendments are all about. Really, the Bill proposes to make the Council more autonomous. Once again, the Commonwealth Government is clearly indicating with these amendments that it is making the ACIR stand on its own two feet and that it cannot be looked upon in any way as a Commonwealth instrumentality. I believe that this is essential because, as other honourable senators have said, it is a body that has to bring about cohesion and co-operation among the three tiers of Government. From the commencement of the ACIR the various States have been represented. The two Territories-the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory-did not actually have representation but participated in an advisory, honorary capacity. Perhaps this was all right in 1976 when the Council was established, but in regard to the Northern Territory the situation is now very different because in 1978 the Northern Territory achieved responsible self-government. The Northern Territory now has all those responsibilities that a State has. I have no doubt that at some time in the future the Territory--

         —The Minister said: 'Except for national parks'. Perhaps that situation may be corrected at some time in the future, perhaps even before statehood is granted to the Northern Territory as I hope it will be. The Northern Territory has developed in a different way from the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Capital Territory was given the opportunity some time ago to have more of a voice in its own affairs and it rejected that opportunity. The Northern Territory has continued to grow. Despite this, the standing of the Northern Territory in the ACIR, has not changed. It has been represented by an advisory member. I commend the Council for treating the members who came from the Territories, as much as possible, as full members. They participated in debates and so on. The fact is that under the present legislation they are looked upon merely as advisory members and not as full members. The Minister responsible for this legislation has clearly indicated the attitude of the Commonwealth Government; that is, that the Northern Territory should participate in the ACIR as a full member. Despite this, it has not come about. I am disappointed that in the legislation before us tonight an amendment to make the Northern Territory a full member, as all the States are, is not included. This is despite the fact that the Minister and the Commonwealth Government wish it. I am disappointed that some States still stand back from giving their agreement that the Northern Territory should get full representation.

        My point in standing up tonight is to be highly critical of the States which are prepared to frustrate the decision that the Northern Territory should be represented. I cannot imagine why the States-I think probably only two States-have held back in giving their consent. I can only wonder at the reason for this. Is it jealousy? What is it? Do they not realise that the Territory is growing up and it has a right to participate? I leave it at that. I demand that those States-or the State-that will not give permission for the Northern Territory to be represented on the ACIR reconsider their situation and in the near future consent to the Commonwealth Government's request that further amendments be passed to the legislation to allow the Northern Territory to be a fully participating member.

         —In 1969 the foremost authority on Federal financial relations, Professor Russell Mathews of the Australian National University, described our federal system as 'the chief factor responsible for economic inefficiency and inadequacy in the public sector' and called our system 'a yoke around the necks of Australian people'. When the Australian Labor Party came to office in December 1972 some of this burden was eased by the Whitlam Government. Substantial reforms were made to the relationships that existed then between the Commonwealth and the States. The Opposition believes that the Fraser Government has now turned the clock back to the stage we were at when Professor Mathews made that statement in 1969.

        Let us analyse the Advisory Council. We recognise, of course, that it is just an advisory council for inter-government relations. In other words, it is a body that meets from time to time with representatives from the six States, local government and the Australian government for the purpose of reviewing the relationships particularly relating to finance and advising the Commonwealth about the sort of financial arrangements that ought to be entered into. That is a noble perspective and one which the Australian Labor Party supports. In fact, what we did in government in 1972-75 was to set in train the sort of processes which this legislation embodies. The amendment seeks to make some improvement.

       <para>
        It seems to me that we have to analyse the purpose of the Federal government and recognise the role that it plays in the process of government in Australia. It seems to me that we ought clearly to understand that part of the central role of our national government is to create a society of equal opportunity for the provision of goods and services for our citizens, to help the disadvantaged in the community and to enact such laws and provide funds that will enable all our citizens to partake of the services provided by government. Because of the way in which our Federal system has evolved-or should I say staggered from 1901 to where it is today-we recognise that there are other arms of government that have particular and specific areas of responsibility. Part of the obligations of the Federal Government is to assist those other public bodies to carry out their duties. Of course, as honourable senators are aware, the States have tremendous responsibilities in respect of hospital administration, education and the administration of a whole range of social services and public work activities. It would take much too long to enumerate the responsibilities which fall upon State governments. They would be known to honourable senators.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, we have, of course, a role which has become of more importance in the post war years. This concerns the increasing role played by local government in the scheme of government and the increasing areas of responsibility passed down to it by State governments and the impact of policies made at the national level on the responsibilities of local government itself. Clearly, of course, if a national government is to carry out its responsibilities it has to provide funds to State governments and to local government so that their particular areas of responsibility can be carried out. I think that in round figures the policy of the Fraser Administration is to bring about 100,000 migrants to Australia each year. If that policy is continued over a 10-year period about an additional million people will have to be provided with services by both State and local government. Therefore, there is an obligation in pursuance of the responsibilities of government at that level to follow through the policies which are solely the responsibility of the national government.

        As Senator Kilgariff correctly stated, probably we have reached the stage where we need to see the Northern Territory involved in this process. After all, the whole purpose of the Advisory Council and the process which is set in train here is to act as a conveyor belt for the difficulties and problems of the other arms of government as well as to integrate the policies enunciated by the national government. Of course, the role of the Federal government as distinct from those other arms of government is to intervene in the machinery of government at the national level, for example, the economy, when private actions are taken by corporations or other interest or power groups within our society which affect the rights of others. So often we hear of the rights of people that are affected by the actions of trade unions but we rarely consider how the rights of individuals are affected by the actions of corporations-particularly the big corporations. Surely we are starting to see some of the results flowing from the unplanned activities of these corporations as our resources boom in this country gets underway.

        If the Government were seriously concerned with reforming the state of inter-government relations in Australia, the provisions now being inserted in the Bill would have been inserted a long time ago. Whilst the Opposition recognises that we are dealing only with an advisory council, we ought to set ourselves the task of getting that advisory council's house in order efficiently and quickly so that we can see meaningful dialogue and meaningful action on the subject of inter-government relations. What has been the policy of the Fraser Government since it came to office in 1975? There has been the development of a concept which it has called co-operative federalism in Australia. This is pertinent when we refer to the Advisory Council which has such a wide charter. I draw the attention of the Senate to one section of the Bill about which I feel uneasy. I refer to clause 6 of the Bill which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 4 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after sub-section (1) the following sub-section:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1A) in the performance of its function, the Council shall not be subject to any directions other than directions referred to in sub-section (1).
       </para>
       <para>
        This particularly refers to the meaning of 'direction' as amplified by section 4 (2) of the Act. It is necessary for me to quote from sub-section (2) which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The reference in sub-section (1) to directions given at a Premiers' Conference shall be read as a reference to directions given by the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the participating States, or their representatives, at a conference known as a Premiers' Conference.
       </para>
       <para>
        The criticism by Senator Kilgariff has some relevance to this section. We can see from this that the combination of the Commonwealth and the States has an advantage over the third level of government-local government-because it is not even represented at the Premiers Conference. So if there is any ground for the criticism that Senator Kilgariff has made, I think it is equally valid for me to make a criticism about local government not being represented at Premiers Conferences. It will be recalled that this was one of the issues considered by the Whitlam Government at the time of its dismissal by the former Governor-General, Mr Kerr. In my view because matters which could have been the responsibility of local government cannot be placed directly before the Council it could be said that local government, is clearly disadvantaged as a direct result of Federal Government policies and the competition taking place with respect to resources development in our country. I particularly refer to a statement made in this evening's paper.

         —I will not need to repeat it. It is at page 109 of the Senate Hansard. The Minister will recall that I made a request of him to visit the Ralkon Agricultural Co. at Narrung and talk with the directors and shareholders. He stated, in his answer, that he would be going to South Australia and that he hoped to visit as many Aboriginal communities as he could. He stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Once the Parliament rises for the summer recess, it is my intention to get out and I hope to include South Australia in my program of visits.
       </para>
       <para>
        I did see a Press report in South Australia that Senator Baume had in fact visited South Australia, but I am reliably informed that he did not visit the farming enterprise which is in question or make any contact with the company. Had the Minister done so the problems now confronting the company may well have been resolved, and I may not have had to raise this matter in the Senate tonight. I have not raised the problems confronting Ralkon in the public arena for some time now because I was of the firm belief that the previous Minister, Senator Chaney, was in the process of solving the problem that has existed there for a long time. However, this did not eventuate before a change of Ministers occurred. Senator Baume is now the third Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whom I have approached to take some firm action within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to solve the problem. It now appears to me that none of the Ministers has been prepared to take this action. One can only assume that each one has been prepared to listen to the point of view of departmental officers rather than sit down and talk with the Aborigines themselves and learn at first hand of the problems which they have been confronted with.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to repeat the history of Ralkon to the Minister as he was the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare at the time the initial problem was referred to that Committee by the Senate. That Committee then referred the matter to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Unfortunately, as I have explained on many occasions in the Senate, the Ombudsman had not made his report available either to the Government or the Committee before the Chairman of the company wrote to the Ombudsman and told him to forget about the whole thing because it had dragged on for so long. It was nearly two years before a report was made, and the company was disgusted with the treatment it was getting and had got before from the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Viner. I was asked to bring the matter before the Senate to see whether a public inquiry could be carried out. A public inquiry never took place. It is very unfortunate for all concerned that that public inquiry did not take place so that everybody involved in this sorry state of affairs could have been called before the Committee and given evidence on oath. Then we would have solved this problem. The Government has been duck-shoving around for far too long now. As I told one of the departmental officers the other day, the matter has now come back into the political arena. We have to get some action.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was concerned today when I received a telephone call from the management of Ralkon that Mr Wayne Prior, who is now the Regional Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission in Adelaide, sent a telegram to the company on Friday. The company received it at 4.30 p.m. The crux of the telegram was that he would be coming down on Monday to inspect Bartlett's farm, which is one of the three farms which make up the Ralkon company, and he expected not to be denied access. That was the sort of telegram that Mr Prior sent. He expected not to be denied access. There is no way that a reply can be made by telegram when it is received at 4.30 p.m. on a Friday. Yesterday, when one of the directors of the company was about his business of looking after the farm, he came across a car that was parked on one of the roadways that goes through the farm. Who should be in the car but Mr Prior and two other people. I can only assume that one of those people was an agricultural consultant-not the one who had been doing the consultancy on the farm for some time and not at the behest of the company itself, but at the behest of the Department. That person was not in the area yesterday. We do not know the names of the people who were there. They never even had the courtesy to call at the homestead on the way through to where they parked to say that they had arrived.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, if one of the directors had not come across them no one would have known they were there. The director, courteous as he is-he knew Mr Prior-spoke to him and invited him to come to Bartlett's farm to make an inspection. In fact he opened the gate for him to get on to the farm and they spent an hour on the farm in one paddock only. If they were making an assessment of the value of the farm they could not have done so by sitting in a car in the middle of a paddock for an hour.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter which concerns me and everybody else in relation to the Ralkon Agricultural Co. is that Mr Prior is reported to have made a statement last week that he would put Bartlett's farm on the market for sale. The Minister knows, as I have approached him on this matter, the Ralkon Agricultural Co. has been seeking title of this farm for a long time. His predecessors, Senator Chaney and Mr Viner, knew that the company wanted to get some form of title to that property so that it could spend the profits it is making on improving it. It cannot do so now because it does not own the property. The property belongs to the Government. The question I intended to ask of the Minister today was whether he could verify that Mr Prior has said that he intends to put Bartlett's farm on the market. If he does it will leave Ralkon only with a property known as Block K, the original block, and one of the blocks which is owned by the South Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust and the Point McLeay settlement itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those two blocks will not be large enough to carry the stocks presently on the property. I have not checked on the number of stock. The last time I was there the company owned over 3,000 sheep and some 2,000 cattle which were all in prime condition. If the Minister cares to check the stock markets at Murray Bridge, Tailem Bend or any of those markets around there, he will see that every time the Aboriginal enterprise, Ralkon, puts cattle into the market the cattle top the market. That shows how good those farmers are. Yet three Minister were not prepared to sit down and talk to them and give them some equity in that property. The Government will not let them show to other people the pride they have and their ability to run a farm. Does the Government want to see this farm collapse so it can then say: 'Well, Aboriginals cannot run their own enterprises. We have done all we can to help them but they cannot run their own business'?
       </para>
       <para>
        This farm which, as I have said publicly on many occasions, under the managementship of Mr Hillock, can be operated profitably. It has proved to be profitable. Yet every time those people want to do something to try to improve themselves they have run up against some of these desk wallahs in the Department who would not know a bull from a bee. Those departmental officers went out there and examined the jolly place. This is the sort of action which makes the Aboriginal people down there so damned disgusted at the way they are being treated. I plead with the Minister to get down there and talk to those people. Forget all about people such as Mr Barry Powell, who has run the Department in Adelaide for years and will not admit that the Department made a mistake many years ago; Mr Prior, who is now the Regional Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission; and Charlie Perkins who is the Acting Chairman. Charlie would not know a bull from a bee either. As the Minister will discover if he is prepared to go down there, Charlie has made some offers to the Point McLeay Council to try to upset the whole applecart down there and bring the whole thing down so it can be said: 'We have given the Aboriginals the opportunity. They cannot run their own enterprise'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other matter which has raised its ugly head again-honourable senators may care to look through the minutes they have-is the continuing saga, that is, the elections to be held each year for the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council. We find that a bit of duck shoving is going on again. The Minister may have helped to get a returning officer appointed. The people of Point McLeay had no returning officer until a few weeks ago but now they have an independent returning officer to conduct the local council elections, which are due to take place on 21 March. No roles are yet available. The people cannot get them from the local council.
       </para>
       <para>
        The chairman of directors of the Ralkon Agricultural Co., who is an Aborigine and was born on the settlement but lives just a few miles from Point McLeay in the township of Narrung, today received a letter from the chairman of the council stating that he is not entitled to vote in the council elections and is not entitled to stand as a candidate for council. Yet he was a councillor for many years. He resigned because of the mess the council was in. Today he has received a letter from Mr Wilson, the chairman of the council to say that the council will not allow him to vote and will not accept his nomination as a candidate. Honourable senators can imagine the problems that are going to rear their heads at Point McLeay if this state of affairs is allowed to continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not say any more tonight but I will continue to raise this matter not only in this chamber but also outside unless the Minister is prepared-I think he will be; I have always considered that he has a compassion for the Aboriginal cause, particularly where the Aboriginals are prepared to help themselves-to make every effort to contact the company and to go to Point McLeay, not in the company of representatives of the Aboriginal Development Commission, the people who, I feel, have let the Aborigines down. I ask the Minister not to worry about Barry Powell, if he is still a director in South Australia. He may not be; he may be in Western Australia. He was in South Australia for far too long in my view. I locked horns with him. He is the only departmental officer in any Commonwealth department with whom I have had problems in the 10 years that I have been a member of the Senate. Everybody else has been prepared to listen to reason and to do his best for the people whom he was supposed to be looking after, but not Barry Powell or some of his officers. I got on very well with some of the officers and visited the farm with them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I again plead with the Minister to make every effort to go there before the council elections are held and to talk to the people themselves. I ask him not to be snowed by the officers of the Department. I am sure that if he looks at the record of Aboriginal affairs over the years he will find that too many Ministers have been snowed not only by departmental officers but also by people who are employed by Aboriginal communities as Aboriginal advisers and who get away with the loot on too many occasions. Senator Chaney told me that when he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he was not going to allow the situation to continue whereby people could be given these jobs and get away with money that is rightfully owned by Aborigines. I think the Minister knows what I am talking about without my publicising the matter. There have been court cases about it and perhaps I had best not say anything more about it. I plead with the Minister to go to Ralkon and to talk to these people. If I have been wrong in what I have been saying on behalf of these people I will be quite prepared to apologise in the Senate for what I have said over the years.

         — I apologise for rising to speak in the adjournment debate. My remarks will be very brief. The Senate will recall that on Wednesday last, 25 February, I asked Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), a question concerning the Commonwealth Employment Service. I asked:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Is it a fact that Commonwealth Employment Service job interview cards are sent to unemployment beneficiaries unenveloped for all to see?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister responded, in brief, saying that she would certainly refer the matter to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and seek his response for me. I have risen tonight to ask whether senators, having addressed a question to the responsible Minister and awaiting a response from that Minister, should be expected to receive the reply on the 7.15 a.m. news on Saturday from the marketing manager of a local CES branch. Is there a new development whereby the Minister does not take responsibility but it is taken by an official of the CES? If that is so I believe that it is not proper or consistent with the role and responsibility of the Public Service or the role and responsibility of a Minister. I have already stated today that I oppose very strongly the politicisation of the Public Service. I find this matter intriguing, to say the least. My question was:
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it a fact that Commonwealth Employment Service job interview cards are sent to unemployment beneficiaries unenveloped for all to see?
       </para>
       <para>
        It was stated on the 7.15 a.m. Australian Broadcasting Commission news on Saturday, 28 February:
       </para>
       <para>
        The CES has denied claims that it has posted without envelopes interview cards containing personal details. The marketing manager for the CES, Mr Graham Hill, said all cards were mailed in envelopes except if they were delivered by courier. . . . Mr Hill said the cards contained no personal information except name and address and an invitation to an interview. They did not indicate that a person was receiving unemployment benefit or that they were even unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        That statement, apart from the fact that the officer appears to have assumed the role of the responsible Minister, begs the question. The gist of the question was: Are these interview cards sent to unemployed beneficiaries unenveloped for all to see? The CES officer stated that the cards were mailed in envelopes except if they were delivered by a courier. To all intents and purposes so far as my constituent, who lives in a country district, was concerned, the card was delivered by the person who does the roadside mail deliveries. I wish to know whether that is right or wrong. So far as she was concerned, it was one and the same person. The card might have been delivered by a CES courier but it was unenveloped. To say that nothing was stated on it to the effect that the person to whom it was addressed was not an unemployment beneficiary is begging the question. Obviously, in most cases the interview cards are sent to unemployment beneficiaries. As my constituent said, quite rightly, one of the main topics of conversation in country towns is the so-called dole bludger. The People who live in a very small community are concerned about this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, I point out that the card, a copy of which I have before me, was addressed to this person without even the title of Mr, Mrs or Miss. I think that that matter also ought to be looked at by the Minister. I wish to state finally that as a senator from Tasmania raising a matter of principle I expect a response from the Minister, which I am sure the Minister intended to give me. I appreciate Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle's response on Wednesday. In an individual case, my normal practice is to go to the particular Commonwealth department and sort it out with the officer in charge of the department. I always do that. This matter seemed to involve a matter of principle, and that is why I have raised it in the adjournment debate. As it is a matter of principle, I expect a response from the Minister rather than from an official of the CES.

         —Two matters have been raised on the adjournment tonight. It might suit the convenience of the Senate if I respond first to Senator Harradine. I have a copy of the question which he asked last week and to which he referred tonight. I notice that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle started her answer by saying:

       <para>
        Senator Harradine raises a valid point . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed he seems to have a valid point. I understand his concern tonight is on two grounds. Firstly, he is concerned about whether the response he heard on the radio is correct and comprehensive or whether a further explanation is needed. I understand that point. Secondly, he is concerned about the manner in which the response became known to him, namely, that he heard it on the news and that, at the very least, it is a remarkable coincidence of events that he asked a question on Wednesday and the matter was referred to on the Saturday news.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will undertake to have this matter referred to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) in another place. I imagine that the Minister is already preparing a response to Senator Harradine's question. I will ask him to make sure that he prepares a response to the honourable senator which takes on board the further two matters, namely, whether the news item was comprehensively correct and, secondly, whether there was any discourtesy, however unintened, in that due process may not have been followed in responding to the honourable senator's question.

       <para>
        Senator McLaren raised a matter which has been one of great difficulty for a number of years, namely, the question of the Point McLeay community, the Ralkon Agricultural Co. and matters pertaining thereto. He began by reminding me of the answer which I gave in the Senate when I expressed my wish to visit that community. He is quite correct in saying that I have visited South Australia since I gave that answer but I was not able to leave metropolitan Adelaide on that occasion. I was aware that it was desirable then to try to get out to Point McLeay in view of the undertaking I had given him. The last time I was there was with a committee chaired by Senator Keeffe, and must have been in 1974 or 1975. That is altogether too long ago. I repeat that I would like to get back to the community. I understand his concern that I should be there to listen to the people and to see the situation for myself, and that I will undertake to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the problems in that area really are quite considerable. What we have is a fight between two factions in an Aboriginal community, something which is not unknown. The honourable senator shakes his head, but that is part of the problem; there is considerable dissention within the community. Part of the fight at present, amongst other things, is over the forthcoming elections for the Point McLeay Community Council. The Point McLeay Council and the Ralkon Agricultural Co. are interwoven in terms of control, ownership and interest. I have no knowledge that Bartlett's farm has been placed on the market.

         —I have no knowledge about that but I will undertake to look further at that matter. It would be of news to me. I take a moment to remind the honourable senator that on 31 December, when I responded to him, I made a number of points known in my letter which related to some of the difficulties. I advised him then that the title to Bartlett's farm is held by the Aboriginal Development Commission. The title is not held by the Department of Aboriginal affairs. It is held by an independent commission created by the Parliament. Its establishment was debated in the Senate. One of its jobs is to acquire land for Aboriginal communities, as it has done in this instance. The ADC has considered Ralkon's request that title be handed over to the company but it will not make a decision on this matter until it has considered its attitude to the holding of titles on a nationwide basis. My latest understanding is that such a decision is still to be announced by the Aboriginal Development Commission. The ADC has, however, confirmed a grant of interest in the land and it has confirmed that grant to the Point McLeay Community Council.

         —The honourable senator again illustrates to me his concern that that may not be the appropriate body, but that is the body to which the ADC has made the grant of interest. The ADC has agreed to consider the requests both of the Point McLeay Council and of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. once the Council can provide certain information relating to the management affairs of the Council and of Ralkon.
        </para>

       <para>
        There were other matters which I referred to in my letter and to which the honourable senator adverted in his speech, which are probably better not discussed at the moment. They are matters which are before certain courts, and we do not have to discuss those things. Mr Acting Deputy President, one of the problems is that an election is coming up very soon in that community for the positions on the Point McLeay Community Council. The election is due to take place on the 28th of this month. The nominations for the Council, I think, were declared open by the returning officer two days ago-1 March-and they will close on 21 March. As happens with so many elections, there is considerable concern about the electoral role-about who is eligible to vote and who is not eligible to vote.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that the Point McLeay Council has a constitution and that section 7 of that constitution lays down how the electoral role will be produced and of what it will consist. That section states that the electoral roll of eligible persons shall be prepared and maintained by the returning officer. The honourable senator said that the returning officer was appointed. He is preparing the roll. The Department has no electoral roll. It is not in possession of an electoral roll in relation to this election. Some people have asked whether the Department could supply a copy of the electoral roll. It does not have an electoral roll. It is being prepared by the returning officer.
       </para>
       <para>
        That section of the constitution also specifies that persons may be included in that electoral roll only if they have been legally resident on the Point McLeay reserve for a period of three months prior to the date of the election. I did not produce that constitution, but it is a provision of the constitution that to be eligible to vote a person must have been legally resident there for at least three months prior-

         —I am grateful for the honourable senator's interjection. I will try to chase up that point which he has just raised. A returning officer has been appointed. I hope that the election can proceed and can be concluded. The Department is looking to see some accommodation of interest between the two groups. It seems to me to be very unfortunate whenever we have this hint of dissention or disagreement within what should be a unified Aboriginal community.

        The honourable senator raised one other matter, and that concerns an inspection which took place at Bartlett's farm. I understand he is quite correct. An officer from the ADC-I do not know who it was; Senator McLaren said it was Mr Prior-did an inspection of the ADC property yesterday. I think he is quite correct when he says that one should assume that such an inspection would have been welcomed and that an officer going out there would not have to enter as of right, that he would be welcomed. My information is that the inspection was made to gauge the condition of the property before any action might be taken to clean it up later. The Commission wanted only to get an idea of what the property is like at the moment, and only the ADC portion was inspected. I understand that some soil samples were taken and that a report will be made. If there was any lack of courtesy on the part of the ADC officer, I think that would be most unfortunate and I think it would be most regrettable. I hope that is not the course of action that officers of the Commission adopt normally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, the situation in that community is a very complicated one. I can say to the honourable senator that his suggestion that I go there as soon as possible is one which I endorse. I will look at my program. My situation is quite difficult. There are 800 Aboriginal communities in Australia, and some of them have very acute problems. I will undertake to try to visit that community at the earliest possible date.

Specific instructions regarding the procedures to be adopted in respect of medical records seized, by virtue of a search warrant, for evidentiary purposes, have also been issued to all members of the Australian Federal Police to ensure further that the confidential nature of the doctor/patient relationship, in particular, is protected. The President of the AMA has seen these instructions and has expressed his agreement with them. (See the reply to question No. 172, Hansard 25 February 1981, page 142)

      <para>
       (1) The Insurance Company of North America and the North America Reinsurance Company obtained approval for their general insurance branches in Australia in December 1947 and January 1973; that is before the introduction of the Government's policy concerning foreign investment in insurance companies and before the establishment of the Foreign Investment Review Board. Both were nevertheless subject to the provisions of the Insurance (Deposits) Act 1932 and are now subject to the provisions of the Insurance Act 1973. In 1978 the Insurance Company of North America (Australia) Ltd was formed to continue the operations of the two branches.

However in its 1980 Report the Board, in its comments on foreign investment in private hospitals, states that approvals in this sector were given subject to the operation and development of the hospitals meeting the requirements of the Commonwealth and State Health Authorities and subject to the relevant company introducing not less than 35% Australian equity into its local operations within three years.

       $ Salaries  73,376 Overheads  61,101 Travel  10,850  In addition to the above, the majority of recipients of WRTF grants provide some input into projects from their own resources. Such additional support is not accounted separately by such bodies as a general rule and hence no precise estimate of its magnitude can be given.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Australian Wool Harvesting Program was established in July 1973 by the AWC, largely in response to the recognition by industry and research bodies that a potential future problem could be emerging in relation to increasing costs of shearing and decreasing availability of adequately skilled shearers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since that time much development work on alternative approaches to wool harvesting which will allow cost reduction has been carried out by organisations such as CSIRO, State Departments, Universities, the AWC, private and commercial organisations and individuals. Many trials have also been conducted or observed by the AWC. All the experience gained has confirmed the substantial difficulty of producing a wool harvesting on the existing methods and a long-term viable solution to the problem of increasing costs and declining availability of skilled labour.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst no effective overall solution has yet been found to the problem it has been shown from practical trials and costing studies that the total wool harvesting costs involved in conventional manual shearing of sheep held 'on the board' by shearers can be significantly reduced by the introduction and use of improved layout in shearing sheds and ancillary equipment, by the use of hydraulic self-pinning presses and the use of simplified classing procedures.
      </para>
      <para>
       In practical trials, involving about 30,000 sheep, equipment based on the concept of mechanically restraining and positioning sheep for manual shearing by professional shearers (or less skilled hired labour) has been shown to result in per sheep costs in excess of those incurred by conventional shearing.
      </para>
      <para>
       Several sheep restraint and positioning systems for both chain (sequence or production line) and non-chain shearing have been developed and some devices have been commercially available since 1974. Although they allow 'do-it-yourself' shearing, at least for smaller flocks, at reduced cash outlay per head compared with commercial shearing, none is outstanding on a comparative basis and few growers have shown interest in using their own or their family's labour to do their own shearing by this method.
      </para>
      <para>
       While most early developments were related to seeking to modify and improve the existing shearing system and some promising work still continues in this area on improving the life of shearing combs and cutters, the main thrust of the wool harvesting research program is now towards novel methods of wool removal such as chemical (and/or biological) and/or automated wool harvesting methods. These novel systems are undergoing intensive scientific and engineering investigations and trials to determine technical feasibility and provide data on which future assessments of likely commercial viability can be made.
      </para>
      <para>
       The AWC itself is not undertaking any technical research or development projects in wool harvesting. The Corporation does, however, have a responsibility under section 69 of the Wool Industry Act to remain au fait with research in progress and provide advice and recommendations to the Minister for Primary Industry in relation to projects supported by the Wool Research Trust Fund. At this stage it is not possible to identify cost savings to the degree that cost saving comparisons can be made between options. However, a major review of automated mechanical shearing is underway and will be completed by March 1981 at which time the AWC will make a decision about the future support it feels can justifiably be recommended for this technique.
      </para>
      <para>
       The bulk of the chemical/biological defleecing work is being undertaken by CSIRO. The AWC is currently assisting the CSIRO Division of Animal Production in a preliminary economic assessment of its latest chemical shearing developments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) See answer to (4) above: with research projects there can be no guarantee of ultimate commercial success.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) It is not possible to put firm dates on the outcome of research work. A major review of the automated mechanical shearing program is underway and will be completed by March 1981. The future of that program will depend on the outcome of the review. None of the programs referred to in this question have reached the 'development' stage and so it is not currently possible to give a fully reliable estimate of their costs to woolgrowers. However, in the review of automated mechanical shearing, great care is being taken to ensure that the estimated costs are as realistic as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is important for the wool industry to have available the best information on the various options for wool harvesting by manual, auto-mechanical, biological or chemical means.
      </para>
      <para>
       Research reviews planned or in progress are designed to provide such information and thus aid industry decisions and relate them to shearer training programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Although the AWC has never been able to obtain a proper objective assessment of Mr Geary's actual devices, it has been able to assess the principles of restraint shearing in chain (sequence or production line) or non-chain shearing systems. Shearing trails under practical conditions involving around 30,000 sheep have demonstrated that per sheep costs of shearing in systems based on these principles using professional shearers or hired labour are unlikely to be less than those that can be achieved using conventional 'on the board' shearing in an efficient shearing shed with modern equipment and using simplified clip preparation procedures. Devices embodying the principles of Mr Geary's systems have been developed by organisations and individuals to the stage where they have been, or can be made commercially available. The poor response from woolgrowers to these devices indicates they do not see them as being sufficiently attractive over the existing shearing system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The response to this question is largely covered by that to (7). The AWC's assessment of the limitation of restraint shearing is based on practical field trials in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia involving around 30,000 sheep. In addition, although in the past Mr Geary has been given encouragement and financial assistance from the AWC and from independent woolgrowers to produce and demonstrate his equipment, he has failed to produce equipment that could be properly assessed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) As explained in the answer to (4), the use of devices that modify conventional shearing techniques has been shown not to produce significant economic savings. The Able Star handpiece has been commercially available for approximately ten years and the AWC has used it in shearing trials and public demonstrations and has described it in published brochures. Whilst it has some advantages over conventional 'down tube' shearing equipment in terms of manoeuvreability, comb and cutter lubrication and other claimed advantages, it has not been taken up to any significant extent by the Australian woolgrowing industry, possibly due to the additional cost of providing a satisfactory compressed air supply.
      </para>
      <para>
       A manoeuvreable handpiece such as the Able Star is useful in conjunction with mechanical restraint shearing but as has been explained previously few woolgrowers or shearers appear to find this form of shearing attractive.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Total expenditure from AWC and WRTF on wool harvesting matters between 1972-73 and 1979-80 in the public/private sectors has been:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Public Sector $7.526m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Private Sector $0.376m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) By way of explanation, the purpose of the AWC in making recommendations for the use of the Wool Research Trust Fund in wool harvesting is to enable new ideas and initiatives to be investigated and to disseminate useful information to the Wool Growing Industry. It is not normal practice to recommend the application of the Fund in respect of innovations which have been developed to the stage where they can be commercially implemented.
      </para>
      <para>
       In earlier years of the Wool Harvesting Program emphasis was given to the more obvious and easier potential solutions, many of them devised by woolgrowers themselves as well as other innovative individuals. It is not uncommon for an inventor to make over-optimistic assessments of the value of his invention and in many instances it was necessary to assist in the construction and testing of such innovations to determine their potential value to the industry as objectively as possible. To a certain extent therefore the AWC responded to a demand from the industry to test such new devices, largely in the area of mechanical restraint shearing and to assist in making the more promising of these devices known to the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thus the AWC, through its recommended use of the Wool Research Trust Fund and/or the provision of technical assistance, was associated in varying degrees with the testing of chain (or production-line) shearing in the 'six-cutter' and 'two-cutter' versions of the overhead track system, the 'Tunsey' belt chain system and many variations of 'one man-one sheep' restraint shearing, either involving the principles of upside-down restraint as used in overhead track chain shearing or shearing tables and cradles such as the Thomas-Wundenberg cradle (later manufactured as the 'Pederick' cradle) and the Clark cradle. Other devices embodying similar principles and developed at about the same time, but with less involvement of the AWC, are the McKinnon and Meclock Shearing Tables.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the same period the AWC was associated with the development of the 'Derriere' sheep handler and, later, the Rotary Sheep Delivery Platform.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of these devices were constructed or purchased with grants from the Wool Research Trust Fund or borrowed to enable their display to the Wool Industry under working conditions at field-days throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of these new devices ultimately became commercially available but after initial interest from a minority of woolgrowers, that interest waned as it became evident that the devices did not provide an acceptable alternative method to conventional shearing.
      </para>
      <para>
       Hence, many of these devices were developed by individual woolgrowers with the public sector being involved in testing, demonstrating and in some instances development to the stage where an objective evaluation could be made but not beyond that point to commercial production and sale, which is not a normal avenue for expenditure of a rural research trust fund.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most of the developments which have proven of use to woolgrowers over the period from 1972-73 to 1979-80 have arisen in the activities associated with shearing rather than the actual shearing operation itself. Amongst such developments have been:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) better shed designs, in which public sector bodies such as the University of Melbourne and the State Departments of Agriculture have played a major role;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) heavier shed bales, which reduce costs of packs, transport and warehousing, and which have been advocated by public sector bodies such as the National Materials Handling Bureau and the AWC for at least a decade. The development of presses to make such bales has occurred within the private sector as press manufacturers have responded to grower demands;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) simpler wool preparation, such as the use of Objective Clip Preparation which reduces labour requirements in the shearing shed and largely arose from research undertaken by the University of NSW and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in the late 1960's and subsequent activities by the AWC and CSIRO in the 1970's. (Further savings are likely in this area as a result of continuing research by the AWC and CSIRO into wool preparation procedures);
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) virtual elimination on piece picking, which has been materially assisted by AWC studies showing that many woolrollers/classers are unnecessarily skirting fleeces too heavily, thus leading to the loss of good fleece wool in skirtings or the need to employ a piece picker to separate out this fleece wool from the poorer skirtings.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Of the total funds allocated by the AWC and other bodies in 1980-81 as stated in respect of (2) above:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) 90.3 per cent has been allotted to the Public Sector including universities; and

       The Australian Embassy in Tripoli was closed on 24 November 1980. The decision of Ministers to withdraw from Tripoli was taken in the context of regular reviews of Australian representation overseas. The reviews include an examination of the allocation of staffing and financial resources of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Resources and other Departments represented abroad. The shortage of accommodation in Tripoli was not a contributing factor in the review. At some time in the future, when staff and financial resources permit, it may be possible to give consideration to re-opening the post.

        —On 27 November 1980 (Hansard, page 107), Senator Young addressed to me as Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate, a question without notice concerning the exemption from sales tax of safety helmets worn by cricketers. I undertook to refer the question to the Treasurer who has provided the following answer:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Following a similar question addressed by the honourable senator to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs in the Senate, I arranged for the question of exempting all sporting goods from sales tax to be considered during the preparation of the 1980-81 Budget. Cricket helmets are not the only safety items worn by participants in sporting activities that are subject to tax and it would have been discriminatory to single out helmets for individual consideration in the budgetary context. By the same token, it might have been seen as a partial approach if sporting safety equipment had been considered and not the basic playing equipment. That is why the budgetary consideration extended to the whole range of sporting equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The view taken at that time was that the prospective budgetary situation was such as to preclude the introduction of this and other particular concessions that had been sought in both the sales tax and the income tax areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       As for the distinction mentioned by the honourable senator between the sales tax treatment of cricket helmets and cyclists' helmets, playing gear is subject to tax but not clothing worn by players. The exemption for clothing does, however, specifically exclude protective headwear, protective pads, guards, gloves or mittens which are of a kind used exclusively or primarily and principally for the purposes of sport or recreation. Cricket helmets are clearly covered by the exclusion. On the other hand, most cyclists' helmets are used by persons who cycle for purposes other than sport or recreation (transport being the main use) and are not caught by the exclusion.
      </para>
      <para>
       I add that, whether safety gear is exempt or not, it seems to me that prudence and self-interest would point strongly to the desirability of players wearing such gear. However that may be, where prudence and self-interest are insufficient persuaders, it is very doubtful that the modest reductions in retail price that might be expected from a sales tax exemption would prove sufficient in that regard.
