         —Order! As honourable senators are aware, approval for the making of a film on Parliament to be shown in the theatrette has been given by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and by me, with the agreement of senators and members. The film is being made by Film Australia under the auspices of the Parliamentary Education Office. It is intended that it will be ready for showing in the theatrette by July of this year. The producer, Geoff Barnes, and his production team are shooting the film within the parliamentary precincts during this sitting period. Filming will take place in the Senate chamber today and later this week as well as next week. I am sure that honourable senators are aware of the need for a film which conveys to the two million visitors who come to this Parliament each year some understanding of the function and institutions as well as the activities and work of senators and members.

       Violent Television Programs

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:
      </para>
      <para>
       We are concerned about the increase in violent television programs for children and particularly those programs promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.

      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray; That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programs that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.

       X-rated and Violent Video Material
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.
      </para>
      <para>
       All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.
      </para>
      <para>
       We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the well being of the Australian community in general.
      </para>
      <para>
       We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.

       Home Ownership
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.

The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon.

        The Committee's concerns related to Regulation 130 which provided that where evidence is given (whether orally, by statutory declaration or otherwise) before the Court, Commission or Registrar, that evidence may, in the discretion of the Registrar, and subject to such terms and conditions as he or she determines, be used in any subsequent proceedings before that Registrar. Oral evidence can only be used in subsequent proceedings where a written record of that evidence is available.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was concerned about the possibility of evidence being re-used in proceedings involving a party who was not able to challenge that evidence when it was given originally, and thereby being possibly prejudicial to that third party. The Committee suggested, that if this indeed was the case, the regulations be amended to provide for objections to the use of the evidence by the affected third parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Minister explained that Regulation 130 was a direct equivalent of a previous regulation, and was not aware of such a problem previously arising, he agreed to amend the regulation in accordance with the Committee's suggestion. The Minister also undertook to make two technical amendments.

        These regulations established procedures for the registration of wool sampling sites and laboratories.

        Regulation 31 provided that the Secretary may decline to deal further with an application for registration of a sampling site or laboratory until the site or laboratory had been inspected. Regulation provided that the Secretary may cause the site or laboratory to be inspected. There was, however, no requirement that the inspection be carried out within a reasonable time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was concerned that delay in inspection (and registration) could be commercially disadvantageous should costly sites remain unused, and sought advice as to whether the paragraph could be amended to include a ``reasonable time'' requirement. The Minister agreed to the Committee's proposal.

        The Committee's concerns related to clause 75 which created an offence of strict liability and dual liability, which could only be expiated by an innocent owner by payment of the ``expiation fee'' with no opportunity given to provide explanations. The Committee believed this to be unfair and suggested a form of amendment.

        Dear Minister,
       </para>
       <para>
        At its Meeting on 9 March 1989 the Committee considered the Industrial Relations Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 12, tabled in the Senate on 28 February 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee noted that section 130 provides that where evidence is given (whether orally, by statutory declaration or otherwise) before the Court, the Commission or the Registrar, that evidence may, in the discretion of a Registrar and subject to such terms and conditions as he or she determines, be used in any subsequent proceedings before that Registrar provided that, in the case of oral evidence, there is a true record of the evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee acknowledges that, if the subsequent proceedings before the Registrar are follow up proceedings in the same case between the same parties, then the re-use of such evidence may be time and cost saving. The Committee believes, however, that if the evidence could be used in proceedings involving a party who was not able to challenge the evidence when it was given originally, then the re-use of the evidence could possibly be regarded as prejudicial to that third party. If it is possible for the evidence to be re-used in such circumstances, the Committee asks whether the Regulations could be amended so the third party could object to its use rather than have the complete discretion resting with the Registrar.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this context the Committee assumes that the Regulations will be amended shortly in any event, to accommodate the change from the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) (referred to in Schedule 3 of the Regulations) to the OTC Limited upon the commencement of the relevant provisions of the OTC (Conversion into Public Company) Act 1988. Any amendment could also correct the reference in line 2 of paragraph 112 (1) (a) to ``registration'' rather than to ``registration''.

        Dear Senator Collins
       </para>
       <para>
        Thank you for your letter of 9 March 1989 concerning consideration of the Industrial Relations Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 12, by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have considered the Committee's comments, particularly those relating to regulation 130, which provides for the use of previous evidence in proceedings before a Registrar.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regulation 130 is the direct equivalent of regulation 165 of the repealed Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations. I am not aware of any difficulty arising from the use of the previous regulation. I should also point out that there is an appeal to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under s. 81 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 against any act or decision of a Registrar under the Act or Regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even so, I accept that it would be preferable to make it clear that the provision should not be capable of being used oppressively. Accordingly, I have directed that, at an early opportunity, the regulation be amended to give a party to proceedings before a Registrar the right to object to the use of evidence from earlier proceedings in which that party was not involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should mention that the other technical points referred to in your letter will also be addressed.

       <para>
        I refer to the Wool Marketing Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 14, tabled in the Senate on 7 March 1989. The Committee considered the Regulations at its meeting on 6 April 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee noted that the Explanatory Statement which accompanied the Regulations did not have the usual paragraph by paragraph description of the legislation. The Committee believes that such an important piece of delegated legislation should be accompanied by these notes, in the same way as other delegated legislation made through your portfolio. The Committee would be grateful if your departmental officers could ensure preparation of Explanatory Statements which are as helpful as possible to the Committee and the Senate, and which include a detailed treatment of individual provisions as well as broader issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee also wishes to raise with you an issue in the Regulations themselves. New Regulation 31 provides that where an application is made for registration of a sampling site or laboratory, the Secretary may decline to deal further with it until the site or laboratory has been inspected, and may cause the site or laboratory to be inspected. There appears to be no specific time limit on the Secretary or even a requirement that the inspection shall be carried out within a reasonable time. The Committee believes that a delay in inspection (and thus in registration) could be commercially disadvantageous to someone with a costly site remaining unused, and asks whether a ``reasonable time'' requirement could be included in the power to cause the site or laboratory to be inspected.

       <para>
        At its meeting on 6 April 1989 the Committee considered Australian National Railways Commission General By-law Amendment No. 2, tabled in the Senate on 28 February 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has two important concerns about the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, clause 75 of the Amendment creates an offence of both strict liability and dual liability. The only way a completely innocent owner can expiate the offence (to use the language of the legislation) is to pay the ``expiation fee''. There is no opportunity given to offer any explanation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee points out that the result of clause 75 is that if, for example, a car is stolen and left on railway property, the owner would be liable to a penalty. Again, if a person is driving someone else's car lawfully and commits an offence, both the driver and the owner commit the offence. The Committee believes this is unfair and suggests that the matter might be dealt with in the same way as section 159 of the ACT Motor Traffic Ordinance 1936, the relevant provisions of which are:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(3) The owner of a motor vehicle shall not be deemed to have committed a parking infringement if the motor vehicle was, at the time of the alleged parking infringement, stolen or illegally taken or used.
       </para>
       <para>
        (4) The owner of a motor vehicle shall not . . . be deemed to have committed a parking infringement if, within 14 days after the service of a parking infringement notice . . . or within 14 days after service of a summons . . . he furnishes to the Registrar a statutory declaration made by him stating-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) that it is made for the purposes of this section;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) that he was not in charge of the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged parking infringement; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) the name and address of the person who was in charge of the motor vehicle at that time.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, clause 79 presents difficulties. Clause 79 (1) provides for a ``conclusive proof'' certificate of a type generally considered inappropriate for modern legislation. The Committee believes the provision should be amended to conform to the suggestions in the 1982 Report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on The Burden of Proof in Criminal Proceedings. It is understood that the office of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide assists with the drafting of your By-laws; the AGS should be able to provide a suitable form of words.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, the effect of clause 79 (2) is that a totally innocent driver whose car has been stolen or whose car is being driven by someone else is forced to the expense of going to court to prove his or her innocence. The Committee believes this might also be remedied by provisions similar to those in the ACT Motor Traffic Ordinance.

        —by leave-It gives me great pleasure to report to the Senate on the Second Conference of Australian Delegated Legislation Committees, held in Parliament House from Wednesday, 26 April, to Friday, 28 April 1989. The conference was opened by His Excellency the Governor-General, who was introduced to the delegates by the President. This was in fact the first occasion that the Governor-General, in his capacity as Governor-General, conducted a function in this Parliament House.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The conference was attended by some 50 delegates from the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory and all States except Tasmania, whose delegates had to withdraw because of the State election. Overseas delegates attended from Botswana, the British Virgin Islands and New Zealand. The conference was, I believe, an outstanding success. Major papers were delivered by the Legal Adviser to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan; the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor Dennis Pearce; the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, His Honour Justice Trevor Hartigan; the chairmen of two State delegated legislation committees, Ken Jasper, MLA, from Victoria and Bob Hetherington, MLC, from Western Australia; a former Chairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Austin Lewis; and me. The various working sessions of the conference were chaired by me; by the Deputy Chair of the Senate Committee, Bronwyn Bishop, and by the other members of the Senate Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       For me the atmosphere of the conference is best illustrated by the contributions from Senator Austin Lewis which, I might say, was outstanding, and from Bob Hetherington, MLC. The conference heard these two speakers, one from the Commonwealth and one from a State-one from the Liberal Party and one from the Australian Labor Party-present impassioned cases for the continued bipartisan scrutiny of delegated legislation by parliamentary committees. Their obvious strong commitment to the best ideals of parliamentarianism, coming as I have said from both sides of the political fence, was an inspiration to all of the delegates at the conference.
      </para>
      <para>
       Perhaps the most important result of the conference was a resolution, unanimously supported, that all committees investigate quasi-legislative instruments, particularly those which are not subject to parliamentary control and which represent a developing trend towards informal executive law-making. Such trends mean that the law becomes more obscure and more difficult of access and parliamentary scrutiny powers are removed. Both Commonwealth and State delegations from all sides of the political spectrum expressed concern about such trends.
      </para>
      <para>
       The conference also resolved that it would accept the offer of the Western Australian Delegated Legislation Committee to host the Third Conference of Australian Committees in Perth in 1991. The Senate Committee, on behalf of the other delegated legislation committees, is grateful for this generous offer. I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Queensland Committee of Subordinate Legislation, which organised the First Conference in 1986 and thereby established this important forum to enable Australian scrutiny committees to exchange views. Proceedings of the conference were recorded by Hansard and will be produced in a convenient form and tabled for the information of honourable senators before the end of this financial year.

        —by leave-I wish to support the statement made by Senator Collins regarding the Second Conference of Australian Delegated Legislation Committees. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I would like also to express my concern in that members of the press did not seem to take a great interest in this conference. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee, which helped to arrange this conference, was founded in 1932. I believe that it is an outstanding committee and an outstanding example of non-partisan participation in this Parliament. I am concerned that no interest was expressed. I believe that the press did not see this as an important issue and an important conference.

      <para>
       The Regulations and Ordinances Committee was set up in 1932 to scrutinise subordinate legislation. It has been copied throughout the Westminster system and it is something of which Australians ought to be very proud. I hope that the proceedings of this conference will be read by those who can promulgate its findings and its deliberations throughout the community. I second Senator Collins's remarks and thank the staff who made this conference possible.

      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) the fee was imposed without legislative backing,

       (iii) on 9 December 1987 the Attorney- General's Department advised the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in writing that in the absence of an express provision authorising imposition of fees there must be doubts whether it would be possible to impose, by administrative means, a fee for the reconsideration of decisions',
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) on 25 February 1988 the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department wrote to the Secretary of the Department drawing attention to the advice of 9 December 1987 expressing doubts regarding the lawfulness of the fee pending the enactment of retrospective legislations, and adding that the better view of the matter is that the imposition of the fee without legislative authority is unlawful,
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) in a legal advising on 8 April 1988 Mr Black, QC, and Mr Bell, QC, said of the question as to whether payment of the fee was lawful `Obviously, the matter is not free from doubt',

      <para>
       (vi) on 19 August 1988 the Attorney- General's Department confirmed in writing to the Department that `This Department has previously expressed doubts about the legality of the fee',
      </para>
      <para>
       (vii) on 14 November 1988 Mr Roberts, QC, and on 1 December 1988, Mr Scully, QC, advised the Department that there are considerable difficulties in the way of the Minister in successfully arguing that the charge was valid and that the Federal Court would hold that it was inpermissible to levy the charge, and
      </para>
      <para>
       (viii) the Commonwealth Ombudsman in his report dated 17 March 1989 said unequivocally that the fee, collections of which as at May 1989 total $2.7 million and involve 11,400 people, was unlawfully collected, and that the Department had acted unreasonably in continuing unlawfully to collect the fee after 9 December 1987 in the context of the legal advice it had at the relevant time';
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Notes that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Ray) claimed in the Senate on 7 April 1989 that he regarded the date of 12 December 1988 as the date beyond which it would be improper to collect the fee on the grounds that that was the date on which he had received advice from the Attorney-General;

         —The investigation into the killing of Assistant Commissioner Winchester is an extremely complex one and involves indeed many lines of inquiry which are being exhaustively pursued. Those lines of inquiry are being pursued by various elements within the Australian Federal Police (AFP), so it is not quite accurate to say that Commander Worthy headed the investigation. The fact is that the murder investigation has been designated as a national operation under the command and control of the Deputy Commissioner, Operations. A team of investigators of the AFP's Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region is carrying out a traditional homicide investigation while a team at AFP headquarters is examining the possible involvement of organised crime. That division of responsibility, utilising the two different teams and various expertise available within the AFP, is a well-regarded method of investigating serious homicides, used in the United Kingdom, as I understand it. Both avenues of inquiry, both methods, are important to allow the cross-fertilisation of ideas between the two teams and are believed to be necessary to the investigation. I am told by Commissioner McAulay that he personally instigated that methodology and believes that it is proceeding satisfactorily.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Commander Worthy had been leading the Winchester investigation in the ACT region. It is true that he has been stood aside pending the outcome of certain inquiries by senior AFP investigators. The investigations into certain allegations made concerning Worthy and any possible incident or relationship with Mr Winchester is still under way. Any action that may be contemplated can be taken only after all the facts are gathered and the investigation is properly completed. I am able to inform the Senate that the AFP is satisfied that Mr Worthy personally did not kill Mr Winchester and has confirmed Mr Worthy's movements on the evening of the killing. However, the allegation made to Mr Masters suggested a possible motive, and it is that issue which requires full and proper investigation. That investigation is being undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the situation as I was able to ascertain it just before Question Time. I believe that this most important and crucial investigation, which demands the utilisation of extensive resources within the AFP and which the Government is supporting, is proceeding satisfactorily. I believe that Commissioner McAulay is able to supervise and superintend the investigations that are being undertaken, and I hope that those investigations will bear fruit in the near future.

I appreciate that he has a very large brief in front of him and that he has given us a lot of the information contained in the brief but, with respect, he has not answered the kernel of my question. The alleged difficulties or differences between Commander Worthy and Mr Winchester were known by a number of senior officers. While that information was within the knowledge of such senior officers, why was Mr Worthy appointed to lead the investigation? Why was he allowed to continue to lead the investigation until a journalist raised the matter on a television program, when it was decided that he should not be allowed to continue to lead it?

         —I do not believe it is true that the alleged difference-if that is what occurred-between Mr Worthy and Mr Winchester was known to senior police officers within the AFP. The allegation made by a certain police officer to Mr Masters that such a difference or some sort of incident occurred was first made known, as I understand it, to that journalist. It is for that reason that there is concern that the police officer did not make that knowledge available either to senior officers within the investigation teams or to the Commissioner. He could have made the incident or difference he alleges took place known to the Commissioner personally, but he did not take that opportunity and he informed the journalist first. That raises certain misgivings. But I believe that Commander Worthy was appointed because of his expertise and his well-deserved reputation in detective work of a high order in relation to homicides.

         —Mr President, I did see the article. The statement that Senator Childs quoted was attributed to Mr Peter Middleton, acting in his capacity as President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and it ought to concern anybody who is interested in sensible debate on such questions in Australia. One would have hoped that an official of the Institute of Chartered Accountants would check his facts before making such sweeping assertions. It is not clear from the article exactly what Mr Middleton had in mind by `relative reliance on personal income tax'. If he meant personal income tax as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), he was very wide of the mark. I have a table derived from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for calendar year 1985. There may have been some minor changes since 1985 but they would not affect the conclusions. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard.

         —I am coming to that. The table shows personal income tax and payroll tax separately and the honourable senator will have a chance to look at it. It shows that, as a proportion of GDP, Australia is less reliant on personal income taxes than 13 of the 21 OECD countries for which data are available. If he meant personal income tax as a percentage of total tax collections, he is closer to the mark but still wrong. I have not checked through all the OECD countries' figures but, clearly, West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium are at least some Western countries which, on this definition, are relatively more reliant on personal income tax than is Australia-`relatively more reliant' in this context meaning personal income taxes making a greater contribution to total tax collections.

        I want to make one final observation about Mr Middleton's reported statements. If he has been accurately reported, he seemed to be asserting that whatever tax mix happens to exist in the Western world, or would be the norm in the Western world, is the tax mix to which Australia should move towards. One of the consequences of that is that the Western world norm is to place much greater reliance on payroll tax than Australia does. It would be interesting to know whether Mr Middleton believes that that example or norm should be replicated in Australia.

While obviously accepting that nobody likes increased taxes, I ask the Minister: On what grounds can there be any possible objection to a State government taking responsibility-and being accountable to its electors for doing so-for raising taxes in order to discharge its own responsibilities and, indeed, in the second case, applying the user-pays principle in doing so?

        I am glad that Senator Stone asked this question because during the New South Wales election campaign, which was just over one year ago, there was an unequivocal commitment in Mr Greiner's policy statement to spend on roads in New South Wales every cent of the money collected from the then existing petrol tax. If Mr Greiner were to actually honour that promise there would be close to $200m a year extra available for spending on New South Wales roads. If he believes that there is a case for spending that much more money on New South Wales roads he ought to honour the pre-election commitment which he gave. I leave open the question of whether there is a case for spending much or, indeed, any more at all on roads. I think that anyone who is reasonably familiar with roads around Australia will know that the condition of the roads has never been better than it is now.

         —On the question of the finances of the New South Wales Government, Mr Greiner does what Tory politicians in office always do; he cops out. He takes the easy way out. He satisfies the demands being imposed upon him and on his Government by the Country Party or the National Party of Australia, as it calls itself these days, not by taking a rigorous approach to expenditure but by increasing taxes. I am surprised at Senator Stone's implicit endorsement of that strategy to say the least.

        The question of degrees of Commonwealth control or discipline for State fiscal irresponsibility is a rather vexed one. In the State which Senator Stone now represents there have been plenty of examples of fiscal irresponsibility. Indeed, they are examples of a great deal worse than fiscal irresponsibility over a number of years. The revelations of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, not to mention the internal memo of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, which I tabled in the Senate a couple of months ago, show so far as Queensland's finances are concerned that it is much worse than irresponsible; indeed, it borders upon criminal negligence. Perhaps I should not have even put the qualification in.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the States really want independence, collectively or individually, from the Commonwealth my answer is an answer which, I think, Senator Stone probably endorses. It is: let them accept the responsibility for raising all their own revenue.

         —These are two very sensitive questions, and it is appropriate that I outline the Government's position in relation to them. As to the first matter there certainly does appear to be substance in suggestions that have been made that a centenary rugby tour of some kind to South Africa, involving Australian players, is in active contemplation. At a press conference on 14 April the Chairman of the International Rugby Board in London indicated that the IRB last year had given its imprimatur-either explicitly or tacitly, although it was not made public at the time-to the South African Rugby Board to approach IRB constituent unions with invitations for their players to participate in matches in South Africa later this year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In discussions I had with the Australian Rugby Football Union (ARFU) representatives on 5 April their position was put to me that if the IRB gave its imprimatur, which at that stage was not on the public record, and an invitation should now be sent from the South African Rugby Board for up to six Australian players and accompanying officials to participate in such matches, presumable as a component of a World XV, then, provided that a particular condition was satisfied, namely, that Australian players be allowed fully to express their views on the situation in South Africa, the ARFU would pass on such an invitation and not penalise in any way the individuals in question for accepting it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have written to Mr French, the President and Chairman of the ARFU, to advise clearly, in the light of the recent information from London, that this Government remains, both as a matter of strongly held principle and pursuant to our specific obligations under the Gleneagles Agreement, strongly opposed to any participation by Australian players in any such rugby matches whether as a national team or a group of individuals. I have strongly urged the ARFU to reconsider the position it has adopted in relation to a South African invitation of the kind which is apparently in contemplation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the question of Dr Craven's possible visit to Australia, so far as I am aware no application for a visa has been made by Dr Craven. Indeed, a press report today quotes him-whether accurately or not, I am not sure-as saying that `to accept an invitation from the Australian Rugby Football Union I would have to fill out an application form for a visa and that is something I will never do'. Be that as it may, the ARFU did, however, raise with me at that meeting earlier last month the possiblity of issuing an invitation to Dr Craven to visit Australia. I promised that I would put my views on the record in that respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        So in the letter which I have recently written to the ARFU I have said that, while these matters of visa issue are ones for my colleague, Senator Ray, it is the case that in sensitive foreign affairs areas the Minister for Immigration consults the Foreign Minister. I indicated that in the event that a visa was sought my response to such consultation would be to advise refusal. My reasons are again that the Government remains totally committed to our specific obligations under the Gleneagles Agreement and our strong principled commitment to not giving recognition nor support in any form to South African sporting organisations, so long as the system of apartheid continues to discriminate racially against the majority of South Africans, including in the sporting field.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst some efforts may have been made in recent times by the South African Rugby Board under Dr Craven's leadership to break down the barriers of apartheid in rugby, those efforts do not appear to date to have been so remarkable, and certainly not so effective, as to justify any special recognition or exception being made to the general principles.

        So whatever Dr Craven's personal qualities, or whatever his personal efforts may have been-and there is some argument about their extent, but for the sake of argument let us accept it-to mitigate the impact of apartheid in rugby administration, the nature of his position and the nature of any likely invitation to him from the ARFU would necessarily mean his coming to Australia for the overt purpose of strengthening sporting links between the two countries. For all the reasons I have indicated that is not something the Australian Government can accept in present circumstances.

         —I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to the takeover bid by the British food conglomerate Ranks Hovis McDougall for the Australian-based company Goodman Fielder Wattie, a company which produces much of Australia's basic foodstuffs and, as I understand it, the largest Australasian food company, having annual sales of approximately $A3 billion and a market capitalisation of about $A2.5 billion. Is the Minister aware that in the reverse situation, that is, when Goodman Fielder Wattie attempted a takeover of Ranks Hovis McDougall, Mrs Thatcher's British Government stepped in to prevent the takeover on the grounds that it was not appropriate that an overseas-owned company should take over a British company which dealt in basic foodstuffs? Can the Minister say whether the Australian Government will step in to prevent the Ranks takeover of Goodman in the same way and, if not, why not? If the Government does not propose taking any action, does the Minister believe that the takeover will be in Australia's national interest and, if he does, on what does he base this belief? If the Government is not prepared to move, is this sort of attack on an Australian company what we can expect to see happening increasingly as a result of the recent watering down of the foreign takeovers legislation, passed in this place with the enthusiastic support of the Opposition parties?

Any application by Ranks Hovis McDougall, a British company, for a takeover of Goodman Fielder Wattie would be assessed on the merits and not on the basis of some sort of tit for tat with the British Government. When Goodman Fielder Wattie moved to take over Ranks Hovis McDougall in Britain, the British Government, on advice from the British Monopolies Commission, rejected that application.

         —It was subject to investigation by the Monopolies Commission. I am not familiar with the details of what it said about that. But there have been several such rejections of applications by Australian companies to operate in the United Kingdom market. Nonetheless, in spite of the interjection, the point I am making is that here it will be assessed on the merits, not on the basis of some sort of takeover trade war between us and Britain.

       <para>
        The procedure for assessing such an application is for the takeover company concerned to apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board for approval of the takeover. A number of issues in this one should be referred to briefly. As I have already pointed out, Goodman Fielder Wattie, in making an application to take over the British company, recognised that there was some synergy between the two companies in their international operations. When that step is taken here I assume that Goodman Fielder Wattie will be in the position of saying that that synergy exists. I saw a report in today's Age which suggests that, far from it being a takeover, there may be a sort of friendly merger between the two companies which, again, would have to be subject to Foreign Investment Review Board approval. But there may in fact be a friendly merger between the two companies and that is consistent with the synergy argument which I put a minute or so ago. I do not know whether the report in the Age is correct.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next part of Senator Haines's question really deals with the issue of whether such a takeover is desirable. I want to make a few points about that. In my view, the issues which have to be considered are these: firstly, a takeover of Goodman Fielder Wattie would involve a significant increase in the level of foreign ownership of the Australian food industry which already has a high degree of foreign ownership. Secondly, if there were such a takeover, there would be the potential for increased domination of the cereal market in Australia, given the merged company's increased size.

         —Let me answer the question. The honourable senator can have a go later. Thirdly, there could be an inhibition of optimum commercial outcome in that sort of relationship. If a bid were successful, six out of 10 of the largest food companies in Australia, excluding breweries, would have substantial overseas ownership. They would account for almost 30 per cent of the food industry's turnover and, in some very important areas, would control 70 per cent of supply. The takeover itself would not necessarily directly increase market dominance by the combined company in any product segment but the new company would have significantly increased market power and the Trade Practices Commission has indicated its intention to investigate the takeover on that basis. At this stage the takeover has also been referred to the Foreign Investment Review Board which, in consultation with other departments, will prepare an assessment for the Treasurer based on the national interest, taking into account some of the matters which I have mentioned.

       <para>
        In my view and, as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, I would be concerned, on the present information available, about a takeover of this kind. I say that not only because of market dominance questions but also because often some significant trade restraint policies are imposed by British companies operating in Australia on their Australian subsidiaries. That is very detrimental to Australia's export effort. Whether or not that would occur in this case I do not know, but there is always a risk that an overseas company controlling an Australian subsidiary will prevent that Australian subsidiary from operating in particular markets. As I have said, that is very detrimental to this country's export effort. Those sorts of matters concern me in relation to this matter. At the time when advice is sought from other Ministers, certainly I will be asking questions about those issues.

        No agreement has been reached on any rationalisation proposal between the Royal Hobart Hospital and the Repatriation General Hospital. What has been agreed at the Commonwealth-Tasmanian standing committee meeting is a draft concept for rationalisation projects. Since the meeting, the draft concept has been rigorously analysed and investigated. The proposal involved the Royal Hobart Hospital undertaking major surgery for the Repatriation General Hospital and the Repatriation General Hospital providing day surgery and eye surgery facilities for the Royal Hobart. The Repatriation General Hospital (RGH) would still undertake orthopaedic and neurology surgery, medical care, aged and extended care and rehabilitation. The rehabilitation unit would be a joint Royal-RGH activity. The concept discussed on 28 February at the standing committee meeting was also discussed on the previous day with representatives of staff associations, hospital staff, and ex-service organisations. Details of the proposal were again set out for staff in a memorandum dated 28 March from the Department's Deputy Commissioner in Tasmania to all RGH staff on the transfer and rationalisation of the RGH.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of the discussions and the memorandum, input was received from staff associations and changes were made to the original concept. The proposed concept has been examined and analysed, with respect to the general siting arrangements at the RGH and the feasibility of the proposed treatment mix, but there is still much work to be done on funding arrangements for veteran patients at the Royal and community patients at the RGH. There is also further work to be done on staffing arrangements for the proposed rationalisation concept.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 11 May in Hobart progress made in investigations will be reported and discussed with staff associations, hospital staff and ex-service organisations. Once the concept is a workable plan, detailed consultations will begin with unions and ex-service organisations prior to any final agreement being reached.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, let me repeat: no decisions have been taken on the rationalisation concept as discussed at the standing committee meeting in February, nor will there be any until detailed consultation has taken place with the staff associations, hospital staff and ex-service organisations. Members will be well aware that the Government guarantees to staff and ex-service organisations, relating to the transfer to the RGH, that there is no intention whatsoever to renege on these undertakings. I think the honourable senator also asked for a guarantee that everything would stay as it was. I think the flow of my answer suggests that that will not be the case. The parties are looking for a rationalisation, but one which is gained by a consensus approach of the staff associations and ex-service organisations.

        In regard to any indemnities of which Senator Hill speaks in relation to Verducci, of course any immunities or indemnities are offered by State and Federal Attorneys on the basis of requests by the Directors of Public Prosecutions in the various jurisdictions concerned. In fact, the indemnities were given on the basis that Verducci would answer questions truthfully and frankly in the Queanbeyan hearings. That did not transpire, and it is well known to senators that the magistrate suggested that Mr Verducci's role in relation to this matter be looked at.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that, so far as the Federal Attorney is concerned, it was on the basis of advice from the Federal Director of Public Prosecutions that an indemnity was offered to Verducci in relation to any criminal proceedings that might transpire under the laws of the ACT. That was done, as I understand it, at the request of the State DPP in New South Wales. Because an indemnity had been given or was in the course of being given by the New South Wales Attorney in similar terms, the Federal Attorney agreed to offer an indemnity to Verducci to bolster that which had been offered by the New South Wales State Attorney.

       <para>
        Senator Hill asked at what level Verducci being run as an informant was sanctioned within the AFP. I believe that it was at a high level. I am unable immediately to say at exactly which rank. I think questions were asked in the Estimates Committee about the procedures. Certainly in relation to current procedures it is quite clear that any such running of an informant in such a situation would be subject to the most rigorous scrutiny by persons much higher up than the officer who was running the informant.

        It has become quite clear that the allegations of corruption and the misgivings surrounding them have been adequately dealt with.

I am not sure that I knew then of the exact nature of his link to it, which was running an informant. I was informed by the National Crime Authority on the day after the murder that it had fully investigated this matter and no criminality was involved. They were the exact words used to me by Mr Peter Clark of the National Crime Authority-`No criminality was involved'. I satisfied myself as to that matter.

         —This week the former national Royal Commissioner inquiring into Aboriginal deaths in custody, Mr James Muirhead, QC, has transferred the responsibilities for that task to Mr Elliott Johnston, QC. I believe that it would be appropriate to say that Mr Muirhead discharged with great distinction a very onerous duty placed on him by all the governments of Australia. He took on the most difficult of the early cases that fell within the purview of this inquiry. Lengthy examinations were required and he undertook them with great skill. I believe that he discharged his duties very responsibly and to the benefit of this nation. I believe that this whole chamber would wish him well in his taking up the role of Administrator in the Northern Territory.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Mr Elliott Johnston in taking up his role today has indicated on behalf of all the commissioners that the Royal Commission will be tackling its task with some vigour and is helped in that regard by the fact that the governments have decided that no Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander deaths occurring in custody after 31 May ought to be inquired into by this Royal Commission. We believe that the stage has been reached where a death in custody, if such a tragedy were to occur again after that date, would be subject to such intense scrutiny, both at the police investigation stage and at the coronial inquiry stage, that one can have confidence that the matters requiring to be aired as to the facts surrounding that death and the allocation of blame if any foul play is alleged will be put under intense scrutiny such that a royal commission's special powers will no longer be required.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission also will be able to take into account those coronial inquiries which have already occurred. It should not seek to duplicate or rehash matters which have been adequately subjected to an exhaustive or properly conducted coronial inquiry. I believe that it is in no-one's interest that there be a re-run of those coronial inquiries if in fact they have been adequately undertaken. What is important in the end is that the terrible rate of deaths in custody be put in relation to the quite disproportionate rate of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, a matter which, I think, Senator Hamer brought to the attention of the Senate earlier this session by way of a question. The fact is that the rate at which Aboriginals find themselves in a police lock-up or in a prison cell is far out of proportion to-it is some 10 times more than-that of the white population. Clearly, if one can find a way to prevent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders ending up in such detention or custody, one will have gone a long way to preventing the tragic deaths which have occurred. For that reason, this week-I think, tomorrow-a working party agreed to by the Prime Minister and the Premiers--

         —I will answer this as shortly as possible but I believe of great interest to honourable senators is the way in which Federal prisoners are dealt with by the courts. The fact is, as honourable senators know, that there are no Federal gaols. That means that we take advantage of the State courts to sentence Federal offenders, such as those who import drugs or commit fraud against the Commonwealth, and they are incarcerated in State gaols or other institutions. What has happened up to this point is that, when a judge pronounces a sentence of 10 years' maximum, six years' minimum, for importing heroin, quite often the Federal offender is released after serving, say, three years and a few months. It is an intolerable situation where the sentence pronounced by the judge is not actually implemented, is not actually the sentence served by the Federal offender. State remissions ought not eat away at the sentence imposed by the courts. After all, the judge, after hearing all the evidence, is in the best position to determine for what period that person should be imprisoned, deprived of his or her liberty.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I believe strongly that the public wants sentences that are definite and certain. The present situation really amounts to a fraud against the public when the sentence pronounced is not the sentence served. For that reason it has been decided that the remissions which are available under State law should not be available for Federal prisoners, and that the minimum sentence pronounced by the judge will in fact be the gaol sentence served by that particular Federal prisoner. I believe that, in the case of persons who import drugs into Australia or who engage in fraud against the Commonwealth, and therefore prevent revenues flowing to the Commonwealth to be used on behalf of all Australian people, such persons should, if they are sentenced to a gaol term, serve that term as pronounced by the judge. That will be the effect of legislation to be introduced into the Parliament shortly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make it clear that this is not to engage in a bashing exercise whereby harsher or more draconian penalties should be imposed by courts; it is, rather, that certain and definite penalties be imposed by courts. I think there is a distinction and, together with the stripping of those who commit serious crimes of their assets, of their profits and the moneys and assets that they accumulate from their nefarious activities, one will have in place a sentence and deterrent regime which should help in the fight against organised crime.

         —The fifth meeting of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council was held last Friday in Moree, New South Wales, and was attended by Ministers from the States of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales and by three Ministers from the Commonwealth-my colleagues Senator Richardson and Mr Kerin and me. It should be said that the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council and the Commission over which it presides are one of the few very good examples of Federal-State cooperation at its best and an example of the State governments, irrespective of their political definitions, working concertedly with the Commonwealth in protecting the soils and water supply in one of the most important agricultural basins in Australia.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Murray-Darling Basin is a major source of agricultural output in this country for both domestic and trade purposes. Twenty-five per cent of cattle and dairy farms in Australia are found within the basin. Fifty per cent of sheep and lambs and crop land is also within the boundaries of the basin. The basin contains 75 per cent of all irrigated lands in Australia. The total value of annual agricultural production from the Murray-Darling Basin is $10 billion measured in 1987 figures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Zakharov asked a question of two parts. The first was a reference to the $600m per annum lost due to soil degradation in Australia. That is lost agricultural production. The real value of the loss to the country is much greater than that, of course, as I have always said. The real cost is in the silting up of river systems, in flooding and in the works that are necessary to combat the effects of soil degradation and groundwater salinity around Australia. The $600m is just the forgone agricultural production in dollar terms that results from soil degradation in this country. The national soil conservation program that I announced a fortnight ago is aimed, at a national level, at combating that loss.

        The Council last week did a number of important things. One of them was to present a draft national resources management strategy to restructure the community advisory council, which strategy is now open for discussion with the communities of the Murray-Darling Basin. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth and the States there is an undertaking to adopt a salinity and drainage strategy for the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin. The strategy provides a framework for joint government action and includes expenditure by the four governments over the next three years of $29.4m on several salt interception schemes, of which the Commonwealth will contribute $7.8m. The strategy will result in a reduction of 20 per cent in the average salinity of the River Murray as measured at Morgan in South Australia and it will provide the opportunity for protecting up to 500,000 hectares of high value land in the basin. The salinity and drainage strategy now in place is a component of the natural resources management strategy. I take this opportunity to table in the Senate the communique issued by the joint governments from the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, and the salinity and drainage strategy adopted by the Council.

I took Senator Knowles's question on notice at the time and responded to it on 11 April 1989.

I immediately made inquiries of the Department to clarify the issue, and made a full statement to the Estimates Committee that evening. In that statement I told the Committee that Greys had advised the Department on 12 April that the information provided on 10 April had omitted the cost of labelling at $2,000, and that the cost of printing the contents, which was not included in the earlier advice, was $11,000. This brought the unit cost to $2.15. I added that the Department still had not received a final detailed invoice from Grey Advertising. Following the discussions in the Senate Estimates Committee I asked the Department to seek from Grey a final breakdown of the final cost of this exercise with the necessary supporting invoices. This has been received, and I table the documents which have been provided to me by the Department. In summary, the table shows that the cost of the exercise was $75,904 and the unit cost is now $2.36. It is now clear that the difficulty which the Department has obviously had in providing completely accurate information on the actual costs stems from its not having obtained a final cost reconciliation first. I have made clear to the Department my dissatisfaction with this failure to provide the information, and ordered that steps be taken to ensure that it will not happen again.

       I deny that I have either inadvertently or directly misled the Parliament. I have checked Hansard and cannot see how Senator Short can claim that I have misled the Parliament in any sense. In the press release and the subsequent article in the Australian Financial Review no reference was made to a Hansard page number or a quotation. It is fairly hard for me to track down exactly what Senator Short was getting at. However, I believe that when one is accused in this place of misleading the Parliament, one should at the first opportunity at least put down a denial until further evidence is produced.

         —Only a few years ago Australia's scientific community was one of the jewels in the crown of our nation. It produced Nobel Prize winners, it led the world in numerous areas of frontier research and it contributed mightily to the growth of our economy. We had a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) comprising keen and dedicated scientists who knew that they had the respect and the admiration of the Australian people, professional and competent leadership and the unqualified support of their national government. Today, after six years of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government and after years of mismanagement by Ministers Button, Jones and now Dawkins, we have a scientific community which is confused and angry, starved of funds and under siege. Young people no longer wish to enter the science profession and increasing numbers of our best and brightest are being driven overseas in despair and frustration.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        After several years of languishing under the dead and incompetent hand of that arch Labor political crony, Neville Wran, we have a CSIRO which is abused by its own Minister, used as a political plaything, with its funds turned on and off in response to political and not scientific demands, lacking in leadership, direction and funds, with top scientists calling for their chairman to go before it is too late and with no hope of survival or revival without an immediate change of government in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us consider the Australian Labor Party's record of support for science in this country. Under Labor, Australia's position in research and development spending has dropped to sixteenth in a list of 22 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. We have been overtaken in recent years in the funding stakes by Canada, Italy and even Denmark. Government and business spend around 1.18 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) on research, while Japan spends 3.19 per cent and the United States, 2.88 per cent. We have a chief executive of CSIRO, Dr Boardman, saying that he regards the CSIRO as having been better off 20 years ago. We have the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) pointing to the fact that between 1983 and 1988 there was a 21.6 per cent drop in government spending on science. In areas as vital as research into the greenhouse effect, CSIRO's leading climate scientists such as Dr Tucker are being forced to scrap their work and to cancel projects which are of importance to the community. The 1987-88 science and technology statement reveals the overall position. It is disgraceful. I quote from that statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        Projected Commonwealth direct expenditure of $1,179m on R &amp; D for 1987-88 shows almost no increase relative to the 1986-87 total of $1,178.5m. . . This represents a real decrease of about 5.9%. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In real terms, Government support for science and technology has decreased by approximately 1.7 per cent compared with 1986-87. As my friend and colleague in the other place Mr Smith, the honourable member for Bass, pointed out, the world's strongest economy, Japan, boosted its research and development expenditure from 0.84 of GDP in 1955 to 3.19 per cent in 1987, becoming the first country in the world to top the 3 per cent mark.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP has only just regained its levels of 20 years ago. The CSIRO has had its funds cut by 32 per cent in cumulative terms since the Government of which Senator Button is a member has been in office. If this state of affairs resulted purely or solely from Labor's economic incompetence, which is manifest every day in this country, it would be bad enough, but it does not. It results almost as much from Labor's warped and corrupted ideological prejudices in regard to the way science policy is administered. Above all, it results from Labor's deliberate policy of starving basic research of funds. The absolute essential nature, the intellectual underpinning, of basic scientific research, the very sine qua non of our progress as a scientific and technological nation, has been assaulted by Labor's deliberate policy strategy in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Secretary of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor Jonathon Stone, noted that last year's Budget contained two sharp messages for Australian science: firstly, the need for more industrialised control of research and, secondly, the need for more promotion of commercially and industrially oriented research. He said that, while there was good reason to encourage the economically productive cooperation between science and industry, the Government was seeking this goal at the cost of basic research. He concluded:
       </para>
       <para>
        By omission, the Government makes clear that it has no policy on science, except that it should provide short-term economic returns.
       </para>
       <para>
        If that is the case, then this Government is selling short not only the intellectual resources of this country but also its future. In October last year the Canberra Times contained a letter, signed by a dozen or so of the most eminent scientists and technologists in this country, which concluded with these words:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's failure to recognise that creative basic research underlies all scientific and technological progress is a serious flaw in current attempts to control and direct the course of scientific endeavour.
       </para>
       <para>
        That sort of a strategy is inherently weak. It is inherently flawed. In the long run it will fail, to the cost and the detriment of the Australian community. Professor Alex Lazenby, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania, has spoken on a number of occasions, for example, about the importance of intuition and serendipity in research. He has said that that should not be underestimated. It is underestimated by this Government, which believes that science funding is simply a short term palliative, a quick fix, to try to combat the economic disasters and failures with which this Government's policy has manifestly saddled our nation over the last five or six years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Compared with other countries, we are heading in precisely the opposite direction with regard to science funding. In the United States, for example, under the Reagan Administration, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of money devoted to science. Even when one takes out the money devoted to the Defence Department, one can see that the amount of basic and applied research paid for by the Government rose by 4 per cent to $64.6 billion in the Reagan Budget. Of that total, the funding devoted to basic research grew by 6 per cent, to $10.3 billion. That is the commitment made to basic research excepting and taking out the money directed to defence research, Star Wars and other programs connected with the military.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, we have the comments made recently by Professor Adrienne Clarke, one of the most distinguished scientists in this country and a person who has built a large part of her reputation on the way in which she has advocated a greater interaction and a greater integration between the business community and the scientific community. She has criticised the Government for its basic failure to ensure that universities are adequately funded in terms of basic research. She has raised the critical question of the replacement of obsolete equipment and material needed by the universities to continue to undertake basic research and to produce scientists of quality and of understanding.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one looks at the recommendations of the recently received Smith committee report, one can see the extent to which they acknowledge the critical state of science funding in Australia. The report calls for the higher education system to receive an injection of $65m to its funding base over the two-year period remaining in the current triennium in order to remedy what it calls serious inadequacies in research infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the situation of the CSIRO at the moment. My colleagues Senator Archer and Senator Brownhill will be dealing in more specific detail with the CSIRO and, in particular, its application of resources towards support and funding in rural research. One can see on the part of the Chairman of the CSIRO, Mr Neville Wran, an almost total incompetence in standing up for the CSIRO and in securing for it greater access to funds and to government support. If one looks, for example, at an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald in December 1988 under the heading `The Science of Politics and Rebellion' one sees this comment:
       </para>
       <para>
        Many looked to the CSIRO chairman, Neville Wran, to take up the battle cry-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the battle cry for increased funds-
       </para>
       <para>
        but Wran issued only a brief public statement suggesting the Budget might hold good news.
       </para>
       <para>
        Good news! After the Budget Mr Wran was forced to concede that the Budget had not been as good as he had hoped. Mr Wran was put there allegedly-we were told this when his appointment was debated in the Senate-because he was going to be an effective advocate for the CSIRO within the financial and budgetary deliberations of the Government. He has manifestly failed in that regard. He has manifestly failed to provide the CSIRO either with access to funds or with leadership. We have the ludicrous situation of the Acting Chief Executive of the CSIRO, Dr Colin Adam, having to rebuke his own Chairman, Mr Wran, for his ill-informed criticisms of the body of which he is Chairman, over questions of tenders not being submitted for work to be undertaken for environmental management issues in New South Wales. As I have said, we have the Acting Chief Executive having to rebuke his own Chairman for his attack upon the very body of which he is supposed to be the leader. We have Dr Clive Coogan-a friend, I see, from Senator Button's recent letter in the Australian newspaper-in relation to Mr Wran saying this:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Wran does not have the respect of the scientific community . . . He is in a different ballpark, and is therefore judged under different criteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, an eminent scientist such as he is, is saying that not only does Mr Wran not have the respect of the scientific community, but also in his 37 years in the CSIRO he said, `He has never seen the organisation quite as disoriented and distracted'. We have the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, who is responsible for the CSIRO in the ultimate political sense, attacking and criticising the CSIRO, not for its failure to produce the scientific goods, but for complaining, as it has the right to complain, about the way in which this Government has consistently and constantly cut funding and support for the CSIRO.
       </para>
       <para>
        The CSIRO has been used as a political football. After the 32 per cent cuts that have been imposed on the CSIRO, suddenly, when a political problem arises in relation to the greenhouse effect in Australia, there is a $7.8m emergency injection of funds largely into the CSIRO-a body which, as I said earlier, had to cut out a large number of its climate research projects because the government would not provide the funds for them. Yet all of a sudden, when a political problem arises, it is to the CSIRO that the Government turns; it throws money at it; and it expects it to be able to pick up the ball and run with it after all those years of dispiriting attack which the Government has made upon it. In December last year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put out a statement saying, `Perhaps now that Mr Jones had talked to everybody they understood the problem and they were going to do something about it'. The Prime Minister's press statement of 13 December tells us `We are all now better informed'. They may be better informed but there is no evidence that the Government has actually done anything about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have manifest failures in terms of the Government's policy. We have the Australian Academy of Science calling on the Federal Government to sack one of its most senior advisers, Professor Don Aitkin, a social scientist who has been put in charge of the Australian Research Council. The people who are the primary recipients of grants under that system-the people in the physical sciences-have no trust whatsoever in Professor Aitkin's ability to handle this vital job. We have Dr John Hutchinson at the Australian National University telling us that we have `lost almost an entire generation of our most outstanding scientists overseas'. We have Dr John Storey from the School of Physics at the University of New South Wales telling us that the number of people studying for entry into the sciences as a result of this Government's science and education policies is at its lowest and, indeed, a critical level. We have the Age newspaper in August last year criticising the Government for its slicing of $13m from the CSIRO budget. We have Mr Jones telling the Cabinet that he is to quit over the way in which science funding has been handled, which presumably is the reason that the science statement has been put off for another week. Apparently Mr Dawkins is accusing Mr Jones of constantly `whingeing to the Cabinet' about a poor deal in science funding but never coming forward with realistic proposals or propositions. We have Professor Lewis Chadderton, one of the most eminent scientists in this country, in an article which appeared in October last year, saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Never in the history of this nation have we seen our scientists-young, old, theoretical, experimental, government, academic-so united against the foolhardy interference on the part of the Hawke Government in the why and the wherefore of the way research and innovation is carried out. I say clearly that these are times in which great caution is admittedly called for, but they are also times in which this Government must perform that volte-face, and disown its anti-intellectual approach to science, technology and education.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even in the Government's own designated areas of important research for Australia there are manifest failures. There has been no adequate response, as yet, to the report of the Biotechnology Consultative Group which reported to the Government in June 1988, yet biotechnology was to be one of the great achievements of this Government's science policy. No adequate funding has been provided for the superconductor research which was to be so important and which Mr Jones so lauds. As yet no adequate response has been received to the basic propositions of the Smith committee in terms of the funding which needs to be provided if we are to have some reversal of the disastrous trend which has occurred as a result of Labor Government policies. The Liberal and National parties, in their recently released science policy, have indicated quite clearly their continued support for the CSIRO. We have stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Our goal for the CSIRO is to create vigorous, outward looking Institutes conducting and delivering high quality research for the greatest benefit of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We say that we will:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . provide an environment which will enhance the reputation for scientific excellence developed by the CSIRO over six decades, and encourage greater interaction between it and industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        We say:
       </para>
       <para>
        We recognise the vital importance of, and the need to engage in basic scientific research, particularly in those areas where we have particular expertise and special needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, we on this side of the chamber believe that, over the course of the Hawke-Keating Government, the continual attacks that have been made upon the funding of CSIRO and upon support for science and technology in general have betrayed a whole generation of Australian scientists and researchers. They have had a permanently deleterious effect upon the capacity of this country to meet the challenges of the future. The scientific effort of this country is not there to be turned on and off as a short term economic palliative to overcome the economic failures which have marked this Government over its term of office. We believe that the lack of support, the lack of funding and the lack of leadership, at the level of both the chairmanship of the CSIRO and the Ministers responsible for science and education in this country, are an absolute national disgrace.

         —I listened to that diatribe with a great degree of interest. I could not help recalling, having been here for a few years, that we are in the Senate; we are not taking part in a school debating society. The school debating society technique of Senator Puplick is to grab every quotation he can find from various people, throw them all together and read them out to the Senate. Not once in his speech was there any idea of conceptual issues relating to science policy, not once in that speech was there any idea of what the Government's policies have been in relation to the policies of previous governments, and not once in that speech was there any regard for facts as distinct from fiction.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I know that the Government is going to bring down a science policy statement next week. Senator Puplick also knows that. I knew that this speech would be made today, thrown together by the Opposition at the last moment so that it could say when the Government's statement was brought down, `We provoked all of that. We raised all these issues last week. What a vigorous Opposition we are'. That is the purpose of this so-called matter of public importance today. I have often accused the Liberals of being the 1960s show. Their ideas and minds are firmly rooted in the 1960s and stuck there, regurgitating in a whole range of policy areas the things they stood for in the 1960s. Senator Puplick is said to be one of the trendies of the Liberal Party, but he is doing that again today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me address the basic problem which this Government had to face when it came to office: the worst record in research and development in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development after 29 out of 30 years of Liberal Government in this country. That is the issue we had to address when we came into government in 1983 following the last Budget of those opposite in 1982. We had a situation in which people complained all the time about various issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Puplick has been at it again today. Japan, he says, has an enormous record in research funding. Does Senator Puplick not know that 80 per cent of Japanese research funding is conducted by the private sector? Does he not know that in Australia 70 per cent of research funding is paid for by the public sector and that that figure was 80 per cent when the coalition was in office? Does Senator Puplick not understand those figures? Does he not understand that the very fact of commitment to private sector research in Japan has been a great strength to the Japanese economy, whereas we drifted along for 29 years under Liberal governments with nothing being done about these issues? I thought the philosophy of a Liberal party was to lay stress upon the importance of the private sector in dealing with all these issues. Did the Liberal Party ever lay stress on the importance of the private sector in dealing with issues of science and technology in this country? Not at all. It allowed the general level of funding for research and development to decline in those 29 years of government, including the seven years of Fraser Government, the most crucial period of neglect in Australia's history. It allowed all of that to happen and it left it all on the plate of the Hawke Government when it came to power.

        Senator Archer asked me, for example, whether he could table a document from the National Health and Medical Research Council in relation to medical research in Australia. When the honourable senator uses that document he ought to get up and tell the Senate about the increase under this Government in research and development funds available to medical research in Australia. Let him get up and tell us that rather than him give us the annual whinge from medical researchers about research funding. He should tell us what the increase has been when he uses that document in a speech. I hope he does not blush when he says it. He ought to blush when he compares the increase of research funding for medical research with what happened in the days of his Government.

       <para>
        Throughout Senator Puplick's speech he dealt lightly with the truth on all of these issues. He said research funds had been cut by 32 per cent in cumulative terms. Where does he get that figure from? I think he gets it from the Opposition spokesman on science. What a source to go to if one wanted to get an accurate figure on any of these issues! Perhaps he gets it from the Opposition spokesman on education, who keeps talking about the Department of Science, which was abolished two years ago, who keeps talking about research funding in universities as if nothing had happened in the last 10 years. Perhaps he gets it from one of those two shadow Ministers, the people who would be over here-God help the country-if the misfortune ever came about that those opposite were elected to government. There were crass inaccuracies in much of the material which was regurgitated by Senator Puplick in his speech today. It was a most discreditable effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the question of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation funding, to which Senator Puplick gave some attention in the course of his remarks. CSIRO's budget has not been cut by 32 per cent, as Senator Puplick alleged, or by 28 per cent over the past five years, as some people have claimed. It is true that the Government appropriations for CSIRO have been reduced by 17 per cent over that period, but the overall budget of CSIRO has been reduced by only 7.5 per cent. Why? This Government was confronted with a situation where 80 per cent of research was being done in Australia in the public sector, paid for by the taxpayers. In countries such as Japan and in various European countries almost 80 per cent of research and development was being done by the private sector and paid for by the private sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        We say that in Australia the balance should be shifted more towards a balance between taxpayer-funded research and development and private-sector funded research and development. That is deliberate government policy. We have asked CSIRO to earn 30 per cent of its earnings from private industry. The Opposition did nothing about that for 30 years and the CSIRO languished because of it. We have asked CSIRO to earn 30 per cent from outside and have permitted it to retain the earnings it makes from outside. That is a low proportion, compared with what the great international research institutes require in respect of their budgets. It is only 30 per cent. We think that is about the right figure, in the Australian context, because the CSIRO has very important core capability roles in terms of the agricultural sector, the environment, meteorology and things of that kind. We have embarked on a deliberate strategy. Senator Puplick does not seem to understand that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, Senator Puplick talked about a reduction in funds for CSIRO. That reflects a reduction from a capital works budget for major projects such as the Australian Telescope, at a cost of $50m, and the Clayton Material Science Laboratory, at a cost of $148m. The Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong is a monument to the sorts of things which Senator Puplick would do if he ever became Minister. The Fraser Government did that. It cost $50m. Can Senator Teague get anybody to get up and say that that was a good spending decision? These were the things which money was spent on, and properly so in respect of the first two projects I mentioned. That is where the comparison is made. Big sums of money were spent by the previous Government on these projects and of course the CSIRO's funding has declined, particularly in capital funding, but also in recurrent funding, for the reasons I have given.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Puplick also made a point about basic and applied research. It was a silly point. Probably one of the best basic researchers in Australia at present is also a very distinguished applied researcher. There is a continuum between basic and applied research, and to create an artificial argument between the two is rather ridiculous. I want to make a few more information points in the time available to me in this debate.

         —I knew Senator Boswell would come in with the brown paper bags. The fact is that government funding of research and development as a proportion of GDP is higher in Australia now than in Japan, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. Total research and development expenditure in this country is up 39 per cent in real terms since 1981-82. Consult any of the international journals, Senator Archer, if you speak in this debate. As a share of gross domestic product, research and development expenditure has grown from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent since this Government came to office. That is not good enough, but it is better than it was in all the time those opposite were in government. Business expenditure on research and development has doubled between 1981-82 and 1986-87 and is continuing to rise. Business spent $1,200m on research and development in Australia last year. None of these things was mentioned or acknowledged by Senator Puplick. Judging by the tone of his remarks, I would not think that he even knew about them. He quoted some scientist who said that there is a great brain drain of scientists out of Australia. The fact is that there have been 12,500 new research and development positions created in Australia between 1981-82 and 1986-87, largely in the private sector and in education institutions. There has been a net gain in the number of scientists, engineers and so on over the past five years. It is true that many young scientists go overseas. They always have, and 80 or 90 per cent of them leaving Australia come back. They leave with the intention of coming back, and that has always been so.

         —Senator Teague interjects about the morale in CSIRO. That organisation is going through a period of restructuring as a result of an inquiry which this Government commissioned. It is a restructuring which the Government thought should take place, and is the most major restructuring of its kind in the 63-year history of its organisation. It had to undergo that, as many other sectors of the Australian economy have had to undergo restructuring and change. That has led to some difficulties in the management of CSIRO. There have been many spokesmen from all parts of CSIRO talking about these things, and I understand that, but it is part of a deliberate strategy. CSIRO has to be the best of its kind in the world, if together we can make it so. That is why government is committed to better equipment for CSIRO and similarly to better equipment in the universities.

         —We will be making a statement about some of these issues next week. When we discuss these issues, let us not be like Senator Puplick who comes in here and sounds as though any scientist who writes a letter to a newspaper, any scientist who writes a letter to Senator Puplick, any scientist who makes a bit of noise on a television program would, if Senator Puplick were the Minister, immediately receive a cheque in the post saying `Dear Professor Chatterton, we know you are aggrieved about funding for science and we are sending you a cheque for $25m by return mail'. That is Senator Puplick's attitude when he comes in here and thinks that the Government has these sorts of responsibilities. He feels that the Government must respond to all these requests wherever they come from, and from whatever section of the community, by saying `Cheque in the post by return mail. We are an efficient government. We will show you how to handle these people'. That was the tone of Senator Puplick's speech: `I have got all these letters, all these articles in newspapers, showing that people are a bit concerned about change and about one thing and another. What is the Government doing? It ought to respond with money'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That is not the style of this Government. The style of this Government in respect of these matters is to recognise that we have been stringent with these organisations. We regret that. The style of this Government is also to see that these organisations are modern, progressive and capable of responding flexibly-an organisation like the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research capable of responding to the needs of Australian industry whether in the primary, manufacturing or service sectors; capable of reacting to and interacting with industry in a way which never happened in this country before. People come along with their complaints, like `We invented the black box in Australia. What happened to it? It went overseas'. `We invented this or that in Australia. What happened to it? It went overseas'. That is their complaint. That all happened in the period of government of those opposite because they did nothing about these issues of producing interaction between industries and scientific organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        When some scientists hear these sorts of remarks from somebody like me, they say, `He is unrepentant. He wants us all to be wearing blue overalls and working out there in industry'. That sort of talk is a lot of bunkum. All I am saying is that there has to be better reaction and interaction between government and scientific organisations and industry. It is no good listening to every second wimp who writes a letter to the newspaper because he is particularly aggrieved about a particular matter. One has to have a strategy and a policy for these things. The strategy and the policy is to help people to improve the performance as much as we can within proper economic responsibility by improving the equipment, the conditions, the interactions and the capacity for exchange; by increasing the critical mass of scientists working in Australia; and by helping them to relate better to international science and what is going on here. By doing all these things we shall encourage an environment in which science can grow and develop in this country consistent, among other things, with the economic needs of this country.

       <para>
        Senator Puplick comes into this chamber and says that there are fewer students doing science as part of the higher school certificate now than there were 20 years ago. That is absolutely right. The number of students doing physics as part of the HSC has been declining by one per cent a year for 20 years. That is a tragedy. One cannot turn that around overnight. One can only do it by making a positive and constructive environment, and to reach that environment for science one has to have change. One cannot walk away from that and again put on the 1960s show of the Liberal Party. One cannot go through all the stuff of doing nothing for 20 years and leaving a subsequent government in the sort of mess in which those opposite left us in connection with this issue, as on every other issue they failed to face up to in their years of government.

        I take Senator Button's point that the question we are debating this afternoon is much more serious than simply saying that if we observe an area of need and throw money at it, somehow we will get a scientific result. One can illustrate the point that Senator Button was making by referring to the 1987-88 report of the Australian Science and Technology Council which observes that 1.33 per cent of gross domestic product went into research and development in 1968-69, that the percentage fell progressively until 1978 through to 1982 when it was only one per cent, and that since then it has risen marginally to 1.16 per cent in 1985-86. The percentage is still below what it was in 1968-69 but certainly it has increased since the years of the Fraser Government. The problem is not just one that concerns Senator Button and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones). This Government as a whole has indicated a clear anti-intellectual and anti-science bias. I believe that it has also shown a complete and utter misunderstanding of the role and function of science and research in society.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Government is about to turn around its support and I believe that this will be presaged in a statement which will be made next Monday. It is quite clear from the evidence that it is not turning around its basic philosophy. It has not suddenly discovered an understanding of the role and function of science and society. The Government has discovered that there are votes out there in the area of science and research funding. It is turning itself around for purely political reasons because the course it has been following for the last six years has been proven to be politically unpopular. As I indicated, I find that there is very little to choose between the Government and the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of turning around for political reasons, one need only reflect on the urgency motion on the Antarctic which Senator Vallentine put up in the Senate barely a fortnight ago. The Opposition amended and thereby rejected the thrust of Senator Vallentine's motion to protect and preserve the Antarctic as a conservation zone. The Government and the Opposition voted together in support of that amendment. Now, barely a fortnight later, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) says that he will move to protect the Antarctic. We find precisely the same political duplicity on the part of the Government in relation to science funding and science support.
       </para>
       <para>
        Minister Jones, who is mentioned in this matter of public importance, is clearly at odds with the Government over science policy. For instance, I note that Mr Jones published the book Sleepers Wake shortly before this Government came into office. One of the first actions of the Hawke Government was to call a National Economic Summit Conference. Mr Jones sought to read a paper which would have clearly outlined the sorts of philosophies that come through Sleepers Wake. Mr Hawke refused Mr Jones permission to read his paper to the National Economic Summit Conference on the grounds that he did not want industry to hear a message which would have been too disturbing. At the Australian Labor Party conference in Hobart in 1984 Mr Jones described the Hawke Government's science policy as `intellectual vandalism'. He said that the Government should `reject the slot machine approach to research funding'. It is reported that when that statement was made Mr Hawke walked out of the conference.

       <para>
        In 1985 Mr Jones was invited to lead discussions at a seven-nation conference on technology in Ottawa. Mr Hawke refused Mr Jones permission to attend that conference. I understand that Mr Jones paid for his own fare to Ottawa. He travelled second class while the head of his Department travelled first class to the same conference. As recently as 11 March this year, in an article in the Courier-Mail, Mr Jones stated:

       <para>
        The problem is not just with Mr Jones or Senator Button, as outlined in the matter of public importance. There is a lack of understanding throughout the whole of the Hawke Ministry which extends to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), Senator Button, Senator Walsh and Senator Cook. I repeat: I believe that they have a complete lack of understanding of the role of science and research in society and that attitude really needs to be turned around. As I have indicated, I find that same attitude is held by most members of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is very little experience in either this chamber or the other chamber in actual research. Out of the 224 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, I think only three people have any actual practical research experience. I have said that there is little difference between the Government and the Opposition. Quite clearly, both would direct research through a competitive market system. As I have indicated, the market system is not directed towards the goals of society; it is directed towards those things which are economically profitable in the short run for those who control the market, and that is certainly not the whole of society. At a very early age, Dr Ferrington published 30 papers in international journals. This scientist, who has presented another 30 papers to scientific societies, has had strong support from his supervisor, Professor Rowe. Dr Ferrington is doing important work in understanding the nervous system and furthering the knowledge of chronic pain. However, he is quite incapable of surviving on his income of $30,000 a year and has recently given up his job in scientific research to become a computer programmer. It should be noted that, in the market-driven system, a computer programmer gets $60,000 a year for a 40-hour week. That is the sort of direction that our research work will take if we continue to believe that we can allow the private market profit-oriented system to direct the goals to which that research effort should be bent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, quite clearly, wants to cut back direct government funding. It has expected the private sector to pick up some 30 per cent of that research funding with respect to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the universities. As I have said-I think it must be repeated-that is the wrong direction to take if we want science to be properly integrated into society, if we want science to be directed towards proper socially determined goals and not merely towards those things which result in short term profitability.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hate to use the words `pure research', but certainly there is a distinction between long term research which is not intentionally directed towards application and those developmental types of activities which are clearly directed towards an application with the hope of profit at the other end. As Senator Puplick pointed out, that type of pure research is very often of a long term nature and does not necessarily produce, even in the long term, results which can be applied and which will be turned to profit. But occasionally it is, and it is that long term research which very often causes the major changes in technology which become extremely profitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that research there is also an element of serendipity. One can point to the development of the transistor which led to an enormous shift in the way research work is done. It came out of pure research which at the time was in no sense directed towards an application. The Watson-Crick model of DNA, the understanding of the structure of DNA, which led to an enormous explosion in practically applied research, initially was not in any way directed towards that sort of research. In terms of serendipity, I point also to the discovery of superconductivity. If cold fusion, which has been in the papers a lot recently, turns out to be a valid observation, it is another example of serendipity, not the sort of result that comes from the directed research by industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Science is of enormous value to society. The understanding of the world in which we live is a culturally enriching experience and that has been downplayed by the Government. To repeat the words of Barry Jones, `Science is not a slot machine'. We do not simply put in so much money, pull a lever, and within three years get out a result that we can apply in some development which will be known to be profitable. Some areas of research will never be funded by private industry. I refer, for example, to the work on soil conservation which is vitally important to this country, and to the work on biological control of pests and so on. By and large, that sort of research would be inimical to the interests of chemical companies and they are not likely to fund it. It is vital that that research be funded by government. If the Government directs society towards competitive greed-it is the motive that it talks about constantly-we will not have the young going into those areas of research which are of social benefit. The young will go into those areas in which there are quick returns, high incomes and the potential to acquire a large number of material goodies as quickly as possible.

        Dr Smiles, the head of the CSIRO Division of Soils, just recently pointed out that some $600m-worth of nutrients are lost to Australia each year from agricultural production which is exported. Last week he told me that what worried him was that the $600m did not occur anywhere in the national accounts. It does not occur in the national accounts because neither the Government nor the Opposition keeps the equivalent of a capital national account in which that money might occur. Again, we find a gross directed type of economics in both the Government and the Opposition, which fail to take account of these things and which therefore fail to put a proper value on them. The public perception of the value of science is diminishing.

         —Today we are debating the appalling lack of attention the Government has given to science funding in Australia and particularly the roles the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, have played in this deterioration. Senator Puplick has already very well led this debate for the Opposition and made some very pertinent points. The chronic neglect and deterioration in the financial, capital and human resources within the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is a stinging indictment on this Government. The Government's view of life goes no further than each successive election and it has carried on in this manner for the past six years. Its entire range of policies reflect this blinkered vision for Australia, but no more so than in the area of research funding.

        The Government's attacks on CSIRO are not new, as has already been mentioned today. It has been nibbling away at research funding for years, hoping no-one will notice. It most probably presumed that scientists, being a dedicated group, would accept the restrictions and give their time and resources freely to allow their work to continue, as many have done. But this year the scientific community has said, `No more'. Scientists have at last dared to speak up and out against what has amounted to a betrayal of their profession, led in no small measure by the CSIRO Chairman, Neville Wran, the former Premier of New South Wales. The CSIRO scientists have felt betrayed because, in their hour of need, when they might have expected their Chairman to come to their aid and to speak out on their behalf, he remained absolutely mute.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Puplick has already outlined the savage attacks that have been made on industry research and other areas of research. Today, I highlight the damage the Government has done to the rural sector. I do not need to remind the Senate that it is the rural sector that provides our much needed export income. It is the rural sector that is expected to continue this role for years to come. Senator Button can say and do all he likes about manufacturing in this country, but we know the futility of his words. Our future does not lie in manufacturing exports; it lies with the rural sector, the primary industry sector. Senator Button and Mr Wran would do well to remember that when they next try to apply the knife to rural research.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lest it be thought that this is a beat-up by the Opposition and a few disgruntled scientists, as Senator Button has said it is, we should hear what others think about the Government's approach to research funding. A leading rural writer, Julian Cribb, in the Weekend Australian last October said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian science has entered a new Dark Age in which its funds, community support, staffing, physical resources and scientific morale are being whittled relentlessly away.

        The hidden message is that for decades to come Australia will be paying for other people's technology. Instead of earning income from research, we'll be blowing it, with inescapable consequences for our overseas debt and living standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, would be concerned about those things. Julian Cribb, to back up his comments, lists a veritable who's who of Australian scientists who have moved their work overseas where, they say, they are appreciated and paid for what they do. Among them are Dr Tony Fischer, pioneer of Australia's conservation tillage research effort, now in Mexico working on world wheat research, and professor Peter Gresshoff, the CSIRO scientist who pioneered the super soy bean, who is now in the United States. He visited our area a few years ago to tell us about the super soy bean. They have left because of higher salaries and research funding three or four times greater than that available here. Of more importance is the assurance that they will be able to complete their work because of adequate funding and sufficient technical backup. The Bulletin writer David Barnett is another who has attacked the cutbacks to CSIRO. Nearly 18 months ago, he wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        The windback in research is occurring at a time which is increasingly critical for the major primary industries, because of environmental and animal welfare concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia exports insect-free wheat because of a clever use of pesticides. It may in due course have to export wheat which is pesticide-free as well as insect-free. Meat exports have had problems. Irrigation has produced massive salinity problems in the Murray Basin. Concern about chemicals points in the direction of what has been a major area of CSIRO activity, the search for natural predators and enemies of exotic weeds and pests: myxomatosis for rabbits, insects which eat Paterson's curse, Salvinia and other unwanted plants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Canberra Times in February this year claimed that Australia was sliding into mediocrity in science funding. Last November it was even more scathing when it said:
       </para>
       <para>
        If this shameful axing of science and engineering in Australia continues, in the long term the nation's industry will suffer, its income will fall and so will taxes. And then there will be even less money for the Government to buy votes with.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is probably a good thing for Senator Walsh to remember. The National Farmers Federation President, John Allwright, claims that science policy in Australia is in disarray, wandering aimlessly from fad to fashion. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is apparent that the disregard for the importance of research reaches right to the highest levels of government-and that is a national disgrace.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what he told the National Science Forum in Canberra recently. His concern is completely understandable. Australian farmers, even some of those who live near Senator Walsh, are considered to be among the most efficient and productive in the world. They have reached that level, however, only with the help of the scientific community. Rural industries have always been strong supporters of CSIRO research, and their investment has returned some handsome dividends, such as better yielding crops and plants, faster growing animals and greater control of pests and diseases.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me give some examples. The blowfly is the scourge of the Australian bush. CSIRO scientists developed a dung beetle-which, by the way, is working very well this year-suitable for Australian conditions that would eat cattle dung, which is the breeding ground for the fly. This work was done in Canberra by the Australian National University John Curtin School of Medical Research, which has made enormous advances in embryo technology in cattle and has gone on to increase knowledge in in vitro fertilisation technology. This has enabled Australia to remain at the forefront of breeding; has allowed imports of genetically superior cattle; and, as my colleague Senator Archer, an eminent former breeder of limousin cattle, would know-he will follow me in this debate-has allowed frozen cattle embryos into this country without exposing the industry to potential disease risks.

        I have been fortunate to visit the CSIRO animal production unit at Prospect in Sydney where Dr Trevor Scott headed a team of dedicated scientists looking at automated defleecing of sheep, at immunology solutions and at parasitic control. Sadly, Dr Trevor Scott is a casualty of this Government. Much has been said and written about the CSIRO's loss of Dr Scott. He felt that it was impossible to continue to lead his team under ever-worsening conditions, on less and less funding and with restrictions on equipment and vital research projects.

        In recent weeks, much publicity has been given to joint State-Federal initiatives in soil conservation. Senator Cook spoke about that today. As a long-time crusader for the cause of soil conservation, I welcome and applaud those initiatives, but I am cynical enough to question the sincerity of these announcements when, at the same time, we are losing more than $600m annually in soil erosion and CSIRO scientists with expertise in this area are being sacked and their laboratories closed down. That is a question I should like Senator Cook to answer later during this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian fishing industry is similarly under threat and with it are the research projects and scientific staff that would help the industry survive through to the next century. The Government has attacked the purse strings of CSIRO. It has done this systematically for years without apparent objection from the community and, to a large extent, from the scientists themselves. But the rot has gone on for too long and has now penetrated the core of research in this country. The scientific staff themselves are now realising the overwhelming hopelessness of their situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        A survey done recently among scientists at the Australian National University and CSIRO had alarming results-results that ought to concern very much the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and, indeed, the Minister for Industry, Technology, and Commerce (Senator Button), whose sensitivity in this area could be regarded as a bull in a china shop approach. The results showed that 78 per cent of scientists perceive their career prospects as poor, and a total of 49 per cent would be prepared to leave Australian research. They are alarming figures. Of more significance is the age structure of scientists at places such as CSIRO. This Government is programming a scientific drought for the years ahead. Senator Button has claimed that scientists have never had it so good. Of course, that is a statement that Whitlam made before he lost government, which was a long time ago.

         —Of course, Senator Walsh said that we have never had the roads so good, or that the roads have never been so good. Instead of trying to understand and listen to scientific community grievances, Senator Button has bashed them over the head with the big stick approach. He has claimed that 12,500 new scientist jobs were created between 1982 and 1986, but this would be equal to nearly three CSIROs or three defence science and technology institutes. The numbers simply are not there.

        The Government says, in its defence, that it is not its fault that science funding is at its lowest percentage of gross domestic product for 10 years at 0.646 per cent. It says that it is the fault of industry and that industry should be paying more. That may be so, but we cannot cut funding off one day and expect someone else to pick it up the next. Another factor that has been forgotten is that many Australian companies-in fact, most-are too small to have a viable research capacity. This Government has attacked industry for its lack of contribution and in some cases that criticism is warranted, but it has also attacked scientists, and that is decidedly the wrong approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button said in his speech today that the style of this Government is to recognise that we have been very stringent. I would say that that would be pretty right. But he also said that the Government had been capable of responding to industry. He said `bunkum' to some of the statements made by Senator Puplick. I say `bunkum' to some of Senator Button's statements. He said that the strategy and policy are to improve performance, equipment and interaction, but I can tell him that the morale of the scientific community is very low. I say, `Bunkum to Button', and that is not bunkum.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rural industry has paid its fair share of the bill as far as the scientific community is concerned. The Australian Special Rural Research Council seeks parallel funding from industry for its projects. During 1987-88 it supported 154 research projects, contributing $3.1m to them. In 1988-89 the Council will contribute $3m to 170 projects with a further $1.7m coming from industry. The wheat, wool, sheepmeat, beef, poultry, pig and grain industries all support research through levies on growers, and it is those industries that will pull this country out of its foreign debt crisis. Take away their support in terms of rural scientific research and this country is condemned to permanent economic chaos. The Government is aware of the difficulties that it has created, although I wonder about that after listening to Senator Button today. Various scientific bodies have provided sound documented proof of their claims, but the Government continues to turn a deaf ear to the scientific community. It cannot continue to do so and it must not. I have much pleasure in supporting Senator Puplick, as I know Senator Archer will shortly, in putting forward a matter of public importance in the following terms:

        The failure of the Ministers responsible for science policy and funding, in particular Senator Button and Mr Jones, and the failure of the Chairman of the CSIRO, Mr Neville Wran, to give adequate support and leadership to either the CSIRO or to the Australian scientific community.

         —This debate has taken a fairly unhealthy turn, not so much in the chamber today as in the community at large. Senator Puplick, of course, disappointed me again. Speaking on behalf of the Opposition, Senator Puplick, in initiating this debate, was prepared, in his usual Shakespearian way, to make one or two rather poetic statements about the future of science in this country and to slam together some hastily cobbled up facts, and then to depart the Shakespearian stage that he created-exeunt, I would say, to the left or to the right. It is a bit difficult for Senator Puplick nowadays to work out whether he is going out through the left or out through the right after the drubbing that his colleague Senator Bishop gave him.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It was unfortunate that Senator Puplick should, in this place, have simply gone off on what was a fairly erratic approach towards what is a very real problem in Australia at the moment, that is, the question of just how we promote science not only in terms of what is applied in the business community and to the benefit of the community at large but also in terms of how we sell the importance of science to the whole community. I will come to that issue at a later stage in my speech. In the end, we are not just talking about what a government can do about science and what a government can do about the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). We are talking about a partnership between government, the scientific community and the business community so that the full benefits of the work that Australians do with regard to science is felt right across the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Puplick, somewhere in that Shakespearian attack on the Government managed to find time to bring up one or two specific complaints. I address some of those now. His first complaint was that there was a failure by the Government to make the CSIRO commercially active and viable. One only has to look at the record of this Government compared with that of previous Liberal governments. We have taken one simple initiative which was so simple that I wonder why, for example, it was never done by previous Liberal governments. I guess it was basically because they were conservative. They talk about, for example, exposing Australia to the marketplace. We hear that so often from their party room. Of course it causes all sorts of damage in their party room when they are forced to work out the difference between their theory and their practice and where they get their votes. Nevertheless, for people who talk about marketplace economics and about the role of the market in changing what we do in politics in this country particularly with regard to the economic reorganisation of Australia, they seem to be a long way off the mark when it comes to science. We as a government introduced the approach that at least one-third of the budget of the CSIRO should be brought in from external sources, that is, basically selling its skills in the marketplace particularly to Australian business and to businesses that have an export orientation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That approach in itself, of course, has affected the funding of the CSIRO, particularly if we take out some of the major capital works programs that have been completed. The funding of the CSIRO, on the face of it, has gone down. But, if we take out those capital works and if we take out a number of other factors, we find that the funding drop has been about 7 per cent once we take into account the return that the CSIRO is getting now from some of its commercial activities. That an institution which has been around for 63 years should be forced to go out into the marketplace and to say, `We have special skills that are valuable to the Australian community, particularly the business community', is a healthy sign. If it was my choice as the responsible Minister, I would increase that percentage, probably close to half, which would be more in line with what is being done overseas. Australia being what it is-a country that has a small population spread out over a large geographical area-we must accept that governments probably have to do a little more in certain areas than they would in other countries. Nevertheless, that proposition that the CSIRO should fund itself, at least to the extent of one-third, through externally generated sources, is the most appropriate decision that this Government has made with regard to the CSIRO since I have been in this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The results, of course, are simple to see. There are approximately 20 equity arrangements that the CSIRO has entered into with private enterprise. Some of these arrangements will strike difficulties. If one is going out onto the threshold of business activity if one is doing something different, if one is doing something that can promise benefits further down the line if one is challenging the frontiers of business activity and applied science, one will make some mistakes. Any parliament that sits here and says, `Let's play it safe' is in fact returning to that 1960s approach that we took across the whole economy when we said, `Let's play it safe. Let's put up tariffs if our industries are in trouble. Let's not worry about exports because they happen to be more difficult to achieve. Let's import what we need. Let's sell our patents overseas so that major companies can buy those patents and then we have our ideas exported back to us'. That was the approach we took. We said, `Let's through a quota system limit competitive goods from foreign countries'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Look at where we ended up. We have a manufacturing industry in this country employing less than 15 per cent of the work force. What an indictment that is on all politicians in this country over the last 30 years but, particularly, politicians in the Liberal-Country Party Government which dominated politics in this country for most of that period. What an indictment! Yet Senator Puplick had the nerve to come into this chamber, to dredge up some ideas about the problems that we are experiencing with the CSIRO and to look away from the major issues that we are talking about here. I cannot understand how a man who is theoretically so intelligent, a man for whom I used to have time, can suddenly become just another two-bob politician who is prepared to make a speech and then walk out of the chamber rather than listen to the other side, let alone to open his eyes and ears to the debate about this very important issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are some other issues I wish to raise today because they have been missed in this debate. The first point that I make is that science is not just a matter of what the top, most brilliant people in this country do or what the people based in the CSIRO and some of the higher education institutions are doing. It is not just that. It is about the whole community being exposed to the ethos, the practice and the excitement that science has. Yet what do we have? If we look at our schools we see that a large percentage of women students still are not exposed to science. They deliberately refuse to take science as an option in their school courses. We see a significant number of intelligent young people who have the ability to study science taking courses which are an option. For example, they will do an arts course rather than undertake a mixed course of arts and science. We see so many young people deliberately turning away from science in this community.
       </para>
       <para>
        To some extent that problem has been caused by the inability of some of the people at the top levels of scientific activity in this country to sell the notion that science can be exciting, important and a career opportunity that most people should look at. The science community has pushed its head into the sand for the last 30 years in this country. How many of us in this chamber have some reasonable scientific background, some contact with science or some feeling of excitement about science? I would say few, very few, indeed. That is very much a problem which lies at the feet of scientists themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that Senator Archer in another place in another time has made statements to the media that scientists are now taking their heads out of the sand, they are becoming real political operators, they can demonstrate, they can make public statements, they can attack governments for not getting enough funding as if that is the right thing for scientists to do. It may well be that it is a necessary part of putting science on the political agenda. But it is a very superficial approach. If we are talking about changing this country and making science more important in what we do, we are talking 10 to 15 years down the track. We are talking about scientists needing to change the whole ethos in this community about the way we approach science. Holding demonstrations in Canberra and shouting at the Prime Minister and Minister Jones will not necessarily change votes. It will not even change what we really need to change in science, which is our general approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Puplick has done us all a disservice today by coming in here with this very superficial motion which is intended to gather a few votes from disaffected scientists who probably had their hands out for research money and did not get it. As Senator Button said, one of the ways that Senator Puplick would solve our scientific problem-or at least get it off the political agenda-would be simply to hand money for research to those people who are, at the moment, being vociferous about the position of science vis-a-vis politics.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is room for debate about science. There is certainly room for debate about the CSIRO. For example, who has raised the issue in this chamber about where the money is allocated within the CSIRO for research and development? Let me quote Mr Paul Grant, currently a patent attorney who, over 15 years, built up the CSIRO's commercial branch before leaving in 1984. He described the CSIRO as `a huge monument to past problems'. I am not criticising the CSIRO. I am saying that one view is coming through loudly and clearly which we need to debate in this chamber. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a huge emphasis on mining and agriculture, but there are no longer problems in these areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        These industries should now be doing their own research, instead of having it subsidised.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the point I want to finish on. He has raised one issue: the role of private enterprise in this country in funding research and development. This Government already funds, as a percentage of gross domestic product, more scientific research and development than Japan, Italy and Canada. I particularly mention Japan-the country that is known for the amount of money that it has put into research and development. Our Government spends more than the Japanese Government, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, on research and development. That is because private enterprise in Japan pulls its weight in that area. Despite the 150 per cent tax grant which we give in Australia private enterprise has only managed to double its investment in research and development from a mere 0.24 per cent to about 0.48 per cent of gross domestic product. It is still a long way behind the eight ball.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister, Senator Button, is moving in the direction of making private enterprise understand that it must, in Australia's interests and in its own long-term interests, put more into research and development. The scientific community ought to be backing that approach and this Parliament and this chamber should be backing the Minister too, instead of, as I said, supporting the Shake- spearian flourishes of the Opposition's spokesman, Senator Puplick, as evidenced by his appalling performance in this chamber today. I oppose the matter of public importance.

         —Today's debate on science, research and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) brings shame on the country, on the Parliament and on the Government in particular. My two colleagues, Senator Puplick and Senator Brownhill, have outlined many of the issues. I was disappointed that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), in leading the debate for the Government, was not able to put forward anything to do with this subject. He was strong on bluster, as usual, and totally avoided the question, as usual.

       <para>
        Something which both Government speakers, the Minister and Senator Aulich, did not seem to take into account is that while other countries are spending more money overall, we believe that we can get by with spending less. Whatever those two speakers may have said, the fact is that everybody is spending more. Expenditure is increasing in all developed countries, but not here. It is all very well for Senator Aulich to say the best way we can get these people to work is to starve them-that is what it amounts to. Because it has been decided that a 30 per cent cut will do the CSIRO good, Senator Aulich comes up with the bright idea of making it 50 per cent. Thirty per cent did not work, so why would 50 per cent?
       </para>
       <para>
        We should look at our position. The accepted definition of a Third World country is one that, firstly, has relied on agricultural exports for economic development and, secondly, has a lack of intellectual infrastructure. Does not that definition fit Australia the way it is today? Until recently Australia had the intellectual infrastructure to make it a developed nation but, with this Government's policies, we are being driven towards the famous banana republic prophecy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). This is something that the Government can ensure comes true.
       </para>
       <para>
        How can the Government continue to wreck the future of science and Australia? Clearly, not one person or organisation has a good word for the Government or its science policy. It is interesting to note that the two Government speakers could not name one person or one organisation that has a good word for the Australian Labor Party since it came to government. The widely broadcast domestic brawls that go on on the subject within the Government are well known. It is no longer funny to see hopes built up by news items and then see them dashed. The status of Mr Barry Jones has been totally destroyed. In my term as shadow Minister, I greatly appreciated the many courtesies he showed me. But it is pathetic to see him now stripped of the duties for which he exhibited both a liking and a real enthusiasm, unlike anybody else in the Hawke Ministry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it any wonder that the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 March 1989 reported that Jones was near to quitting the Cabinet? A couple of days later a newspaper report stated that, to try to patch things up, science might get a $350m injection. What did science get? It got nothing. Of course, that promise was rejected also. I would also like to refer to the despicable and disgraceful comments of Minister Dawkins, which were accepted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other Ministers, and the abusive way that he behaved when Mr Jones was at least trying to do something to get money for the science budget. Is it any wonder that things are in the disgraceful state they are?
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia-wide scientific morale is appalling and most disturbing. There are so many statements to this effect that I do not know where to start. I was interested to see whether Senator Aulich was able to come up with one person or organisation that could have given the Government any support at all. Of course, he could not. My difficulty is knowing where to start and how many examples I can give in a short time. The point is that absolutely no-one supports the Government.

        Senator Brownhill referred to the address given by Mr Allwright on 29 September last year to the National Farmers Federation. I will read a passage which the honourable senator did not quote. Mr Allwright said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Scientific research has received shabby treatment from the Hawke government. Whether this is through ignorance or neglect is not clear. Frankly, it doesn't matter. The Government has no co-ordinated policy on the role of science and research apart from a few motherhood statements by the Labor Party Conference.
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 3 of his address, Mr Allwright quoted what the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had to say. That OECD report stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia needs to . . . promote understanding in the country and in the administration of the . . . relationship between technology, science and economic well-being. There seems to be less agreement about these relationships in Australia than in other industrialised countries.

        The Australian Society for Medical Research, in a letter of 6 April, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am writing to draw your attention to a meeting of medical research scientists which occurred on 4 April at the University of Sydney. This followed meetings earlier this year of scientists, including medical researchers, at Lorne (Victoria), Melbourne and Canberra, all of which made representations to the Federal Government about the parlous state of science and medical research in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does this mean we are gong to let medical research go down the gurgler too? Obviously it does. The letter further states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1989, less than half of the `highly recommended' medical research projects could be funded by the NH &amp; MRC because of lack of money.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not a lack of money; it is a lack of desire. The Treasurer is spouting about how much of a surplus he has. He has a surplus all right, because he is not spending money in essential areas. Further on, the letter says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The whole tenor of the meeting was that we are facing over the next decade a virtual collapse of the scientific and medical sections of tertiary education.

       <para>
        The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies represents 60,000 people employed in industry, government research establishments and throughout the education sector involving mathematics, science and technology. This is how it sees the situation. Its letter of 10 April addressed to me says:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is with much regret that I write to you of what we see as the state of science and technology in Australia . . . Senator Button, the Minister responsible for the CSIRO, is blind to the problems that exist . . . Confidence in a career path in science and technology has been undermined by poor working conditions in the CSIRO, universities and colleges. Increasingly students are opting out of tertiary courses involving mathematics, science and technology.

       </para>
       <para>
        The shortage of trained personnel in key areas-For example, we are currently graduating fewer Ph.D's in the core sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, statistics and computing than we did five years ago even though there is high demand for them. We do not have sufficient experienced younger scientists and technologists in the system to replace the soon-to-retire large cohort recruited in the 1960's expansion of tertiary education and the CSIRO. The true picture is even more serious than the raw statistics indicate since in 1987 24 per cent of doctoral completions in science were from overseas;
       </para>
       <para>
        Low job security and poor working conditions of young researchers-Opportunities in science and technology are not attractive enough to provide a basis for young researchers to build a secure career. A series of three-year contracts have become the norm for most young scientists. Students are now perceiving poor prospects for science graduates. There has been a 40% drift over the last decade of more talented students opting out of mathematics, science and technology at the end of secondary school. The latest evidence is of disastrously low cut-off scores for entry into some tertiary science courses;
       </para>
       <para>
        The run-down of equipment in universities and colleges-A Department of Science survey showed a third of equipment to be useless or obsolete;
       </para>
       <para>
        The switch of resources away from agricultural and geoscience research-The rapid expansion of the Asian economies will increase demand for commodities. We need to maintain our competitive edge through improved research. Primary products will continue to underpin the export sector for many years;
       </para>
       <para>
        The low level of private sector research-The major problems are that many Australian companies are too small to have a viable research capacity; foreign-based transnational corporations have tended to carry out research at home; the stockmarket crash decreased the volume of venture capital and made it less adventurous so that new companies find it hard to get going; currency fluctuations deter planning of export expansion, what can sell at 65 cents US might not compete at 80 cents US; high interest rates make any kind of long-term investment unattractive, profits have to be distributed so that dividends can compete with bank rates. Companies will not carry out research when commercialisation of the results is problematic;
       </para>
       <para>
        The lack of a co-ordinated Science and Technology policy to address these problems-Australia has no national policy on science and technology just a number of unco-ordinated initiatives in different portfolios.

       <para>
        If interest rates remain high R&amp;D should be encouraged in areas where research can be commercialised without large-scale investment-examples of this include computer software, scientific and medical instruments. Other research can be encouraged where the capital investment has largely been made, as in geoscience and agriculture, and in support industries such as chemicals.
       </para>
       <para>
        R&amp;D geared to product innovation and/or quality rather than cost-cutting can overcome problems of currency fluctuation particularly in exports to countries where innovation and quality matter more than price-Western Europe, North America and Japan. Product innovation depends very much on basic research and this should be strongly encouraged.

        <para in-line="1">
         —In the Canberra Times of 7 April, Professor Larkins, the President of the Federation, was reported as saying:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As long as the CSIRO reports only to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, there is a real danger that its research will be distorted to conform with the department, according to the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Professor Larkins sees the problems as being that CSIRO reports to the wrong department. I think we all agree with him. But the Government sees it the other way. It is making science more introverted. Less real research is going on. Senator Puplick quoted Dr Coogan. Dr Coogan is certainly not a wild radical. He says much the same as many senior, dedicated people say. What does the Academy of Science say? Senator Puplick also mentioned Professor Stone, the Secretary of the Academy, who said:
       </para>
       <para>
        By omission, the Government makes clear that it has no policy on science, except that it should provide short-term economic returns.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what the Government is looking for. That is the perception of industry and academia. It is quite true. On 22 October last year a letter appeared in the Canberra Times which started off by saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        WE, COUNCIL members of the Australian Academy of Science, are deeply concerned over trends in the funding and administration of scientific research by the Federal Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The academy is appalled by the lack of effective consultation about many of the changes which have already taken place, as well as those currently under consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The letter is signed by the entire executive membership of the Council. What about the Australian Institute of Engineers? On 12 April this year an article appeared in the Australian, which stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The reorganisation of the CSIRO implemented by its chairman, Mr Neville Wran, was out of control, the director of public affairs of the 45,000-member institute, Mr Michael Dack, said.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what the Australian Institute of Engineers says. It is not what I say. It is not what some newspaper says. It is what Mr Dack says. He speaks for the Institute of Engineers. My comments so far have covered the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Society of Medical Research, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, leading CSIRO scientists, the Academy of Science and the Australian Institute of Engineers. All these people are saying the same thing. The Board of the CSIRO asked for extra money. What did it get? It did not get anything, either. The situation is disastrous. No one with any clout in the Government is dealing with it. Where can we hope to go? It is a pity.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the scientific community is not going to get support from outside, what about from inside? Mr Wran, the Chairman of CSIRO, does not say, `The CSIRO is made up of a great bunch of people, but there are various problems'. He was reported on 6 December as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . there was no demoralisation at the CSIRO and that any dissent among its scientists came from people who `are not doing their jobs properly, because if they were, they'd be too bloody busy to be demoralised'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is that not lovely? This is the Chairman of CSIRO speaking about his senior scientists in this manner. He was reported as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        `We're going through a slightly difficult patch, but I don't regard it as a crisis in CSIRO. It's a period of change,' . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        There is only one change that the CSIRO needs, and that is right at the top. Any scientist in Australia will say the same thing. If the CSIRO does not get support from its Chairman, what about the Minister? The following headline appeared in the Australian newspaper on 3 April, `Button attacks CSIRO on research'. That is a lot of help. It is a great morale booster for people who are working in second rate conditions. They are short of equipment, short of leadership, diminishing in numbers, lurching from one crisis to the next. On 9 April this year the Canberra Times reported the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . CSIRO would need to reduce spending by $14.2m in 1989-90, mainly due to shortfalls in land and asset sales.
       </para>
       <para>
        `This will mean that some research will have to be stopped . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        `The number of appropriation-funded staff will need to be reduced by 500 over the next three years to achieve a proper balance in the budget,'.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one were a research scientist in the CSIRO, would that not give one great courage? Would one want to arrange for one's student children to go into science and research and look for a position in the CSIRO if that were the future? An article in the Age on 30 November talks about the Australian Research Council. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Its placement in the Department of Education, Employment and Training represents a further fragmentation of science policy-making, which is already scattered between Senator John Button's Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Mr John Dawkins's Employment, Education and Training, Mr John Kerin's Primary Industry and Energy and Mr Hawke's own Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
       </para>
       <para>
        That list does not even include Senator Richardson's Department. Where are we heading? What is happening to Australia's position in the world? We are behind only Brazil and Mexico when it comes to what we owe. We have not done enough homework to see that we are up to date with the latest technologies, trends and manufactures. Why would we want to keep going down this path when clearly there is something we can do? I do not think that Australia can or will return to a reasonable level of international scientific research with the current Government attitude. The Government should stand condemned for what it has done. I certainly support the matter of public importance.

         —As Senator Button said in this debate, obviously the Opposition had to bring before the Senate something like this matter of public importance today because of its great concern that next week's statement will chop out the ground from underneath it. It is quite clear that the matter of public importance was ill-considered and ill-prepared. We have had the photocopy-led science policy. A series of newspaper articles has been trotted out by three Opposition speakers, who somehow managed to take up 50 minutes of the Senate's time reading a series of excerpts from a lot of other people.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Unlike most honourable senators who have spoken in this debate-but not Senator Archer, I acknowledge-being a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, I have had the opportunity to visit the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and talk to the scientists there not once but on several occasions. I have also visited the Australian National University. I had the opportunity to go to the CSIRO on its open day. I met the shadow Minister for science as he then was, Mr Warwick Smith. I found it interesting to see that he was held in high regard. Obviously, he had done a lot of work. People thought that perhaps somebody in the Opposition was starting to come to grips with science policy. On that day he returned to the Parliament from the open day of the CSIRO to find that he had been sacked. He must have been starting to find out something about science policy. As I have said, I also had the opportunity recently of going to the Australian National University and visiting several science research schools. I take this opportunity to thank the relevant scientists for their courtesy and assistance on that day.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to draw on some of that experience and on some of the things that were said to me on those occasions, but before I do I want to make two preliminary comments. Members of the Opposition have a continuing problem in issues such as this on which Government members are called upon to speak. They refuse to recognise that, in the Federal Budget, the whole must equal the sum of the parts. They keep advocating that the Budget should be cut and that fiscal policy should be tighter, but on every issue that comes up they want more money to be spent. The problem is that we cannot have both. The whole must equal the sum of the parts. We do not need a science PhD to work out that if we spend more money in each area the total Budget will get bigger and fiscal policy will not be tighter. We cannot have both.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I go to the main thrust of the debate I want to make one other comment. I was surprised to hear Senator Archer's comments-he quoted people of authority, people for whom I have a lot of regard-about health and medical research funding. I happen to have before me-I am not surprised that they were not mentioned in the terms of the matter of public importance-figures for the last six years of funding of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). In those six years funding has increased by 110 per cent.

         —There is never too much. I am not pretending that it is a waste, but funding has gone up from $33m to $70m-in real terms, an increase of $13m or 40 per cent to $46m. There has not been a cut in funding to the NHMRC; there has been a substantial improvement. A lot of other good research is going on in the public sector, of which I know Senator Archer is aware from his experience. That research should not be ignored. It should be acknowledged that a lot of people are doing very good research work.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Rather than dealing specifically with the CSIRO, although I will make reference to it as Senator Button and Senator Aulich did, I want to refer more to science policy generally, including the CSIRO. The matter of public importance proposed by Senator Puplick today fails to recognise, amongst other things, that the comparative shortfall in research and development in Australia even now is not a shortfall in government research expenditures but in private sector expenditure. As other honourable senators have said, Australian Government funding of research is higher than that of Japan, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. The figures are quite clear and quite stark. Excluding defence expenditure, the Government spent 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) on civil research and development in 1985-86, which is more than the amount spent by Italy, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States of America, apart from all the other countries that are recognised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as small research and development performers. The countries that I have mentioned are recognised as large research and development performers. The problem is that at that time the private sector was contributing only 0.36 per cent of GDP to research and development, which was less than the figures applying to many other countries which certainly would not be regarded as leading research and development countries and has put us in the bottom half dozen countries in the OECD. So it has been quite proper for the Government to give a lot of emphasis and priority to encouraging private sector research and development. There has not been as much success as the initiatives deserved, but there has been substantial success. While recognising that the principal shortfall is in the contribution of the private sector, it is nevertheless necessary for the Government to act. We cannot sit and wait for the private sector to do its job. We must encourage it and give it the incentive, but the Government needs to act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unlike some of the matters of public importance on which I have been called upon to speak during my relatively brief period in the Senate, this matter of public importance, however ill-considered Senator Puplick's arguments in support of it might have been, at least raises an important question. I suspect that it fails to recognise the distinction between talking about important things and doing something important, but at least it brings into the Parliament a discussion of an important issue. Perhaps it has not been done in the best way it might have been and perhaps it is not the most positive proposal we have had-I have heard nothing positive whatsoever-but at least it brings up this important point: scientific research and development are very important to the economic restructuring of Australia. We will not turn our economy away from its dependence upon what we can grow, what we can dig up and what we can chop down without substantial research and investment by the private sector, turning that research into commercially valuable products or services. It is essential that we recognise that reality in this difficult period of restructuring.
       </para>
       <para>
        This debate needs some positive elements-not negative ones. It is not much use listing a litany of complaints-some of which might be valid and some of which might not-without an analysis. Let us get down to talking about some positive things: things that the Government has done and things that it appears will be under serious consideration next week and which I hope will be done. The Government has been doing the most important short term thing in the area of research and development, which is addressing the question of encouraging the private sector, not because it is the only area where we need research and development but because that is where the greatest shortfall has existed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Total research and development in Australia has increased by 39 per cent in real terms since 1981-82. That figure sounds pretty grand. I do not want to overstate its significance because we started from an appallingly low base. It is always easy to get an increase when the base from which we start is sufficiently low. We were left with an appalling legacy, but there has been some achievement. As a share of GDP, Australia's research and development has gone from one per cent to 1.25 per cent, which is a substantial improvement, but we have a long way to go before we start to get into the big league of the large research and development performers which have figures of over 2 per cent and in some cases nearly 3 per cent. Even the medium range research and development performance within the OECD is 1.74 per cent. We have a long way to go even to get there. We have to increase our research and development three times as much as it has been increased since 1981 to get to that level, and that should be a minimum objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is laudable that business expenditure in research and development has almost doubled since 1981-82 from a deplorable 0.24 per cent to 0.46 per cent in 1986-87. That trend continues to increase. Last financial year the private sector spent $1.2 billion on research and development. Those things are welcome. They are not enough but they are welcome. They are substantial. That is the first positive thing that needs to be recognised. The first positive thing that needs to be asserted is that more needs to be done. I certainly have the view that the options that are open to continue that incentive ought to be seriously considered and at least some of them adopted. For example, the continuation of the 150 per cent research and development deduction and the associated grants for industry research and development scheme can make a substantial contribution. There is also the teaching company scheme, which will add to the private sector's contribution to research and development and contribute to the very important aspect of the retention and development of our scientists. Sometimes in listening to the advocates of the scientific community one would think that the purpose of government science policy was to give jobs to scientists. That is certainly not the case, but we cannot achieve our science objectives without people feeling that there is a career option ahead of them: some encouragement to pursue science as a career and to remain in science as a career, and to stay in Australia to do so.

        The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) spoke about the brain gain. As he has referred to it in other circumstances, I will not. Nonetheless, some real concerns need to be addressed concerning the Commonwealth postgraduate research awards, which are referred to in the Smith report. The Smith report also refers to the need for fellowships for outstanding young scientists. A problem is emerging in the area of higher education staffing, with a surge in staffing in a whole range of areas-for the moment, we are just talking about science-that occurred in the early to mid 1970s. In the first few years of the 1990s there will be a substantial retirement of senior academic scientific staff. We now need to phase in the the replacement of those people so we do not get another surge in the early 1990s and then another 15 years of stagnation. We need to be able to phase in the staffing of scientists in our higher education institutions. This may raise the question of the nature of tenure for new academics as they come in, particularly scientists, not just in higher education but also in the CSIRO and elsewhere. This needs to be done in order that we do not get the extremes of lifetime tenure and the probably too short three-year contract with no guarantee of renewal, under which scientists are operating in those institutions at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to refer briefly to the point made by Senator Aulich about the encouragement of our young people, particularly women, to study science. That is mainly a question of the community's attitude, for which the Government and the Opposition have to bear some responsibility. We both have not done sufficient in that area. The Government has already taken some initiatives in the area of scientific infrastructure with the announcements in March and there are, as I understand it, more to come.
       </para>
       <para>
        One proposal which I think needs serious consideration in the development of science policy is the question of the supply of super computer facilities in Australia and the establishment in Australia of a national super computer centre. Five of these centres have been developed in the United States and others are about to be developed in our region. The provision of access to super computer facilities opens new opportunities for Australian scientists. These facilities will provide assistance to Australian business, with the capacity to earn and to make Australia a research centre, a hub of advanced research in the Asian-Pacific region.
       </para>
       <para>
        The one contribution which this matter of public importance might make-and it is a pity it has not been made more positively-is once again draw attention to the importance of science in economic restructuring. Next week's statement, added to the March initiatives and the other initiatives which have been announced by the Government since that time, should enhance the Government's role in research and development and encourage the private sector to take up its share of the burden so that Australia can make the contribution in research and development that is needed for economic restructuring. Australia needs to get into the big league of research and development; it needs to make a contribution. The talent of young Australians needs to be given the recognition it deserves. Young Australian scientists should be given the opportunity to have the ideas which they have developed so successfully turned by Australian industry into solid economic achievements, into a solid return for the Australian economy, because, otherwise, there is no hope for successful economic restructuring in Australia.

         —The Senate is to have a very brief opportunity to debate the economic statement put down on 12 April, both in this place and in the House of Representatives. The debate on this statement has proceeded partly in the Parliament. The Hon. John Howard responded on behalf of the Opposition on the day after the statement was made. Of course, there has been considerable debate in the media. That debate has been notable because of the uniformity of the criticism of the quality of the statement and its relevance, or really its irrelevance, to Australia's very pressing economic problems.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Any debate we have now in the Senate will simply be a reflection of views which have been put abroad a great deal and which have been given greater currency by the rather childish response of the Treasurer, Mr Keating, to the criticisms which he has received. In fact, the statement made on 12 April marked the end of Mr Keating's reputation as an economic manager. I think that reputation has been dead in the community for many years. I think in the suburbs and towns of Australia, where people have actually felt the effect of Mr Keating's so-called `economic magic', there has been very little doubt that he is a failure. It is probably true that, until very recently, many economic commentators have been fairly respectful of him. In particular, the Canberra Press Gallery seems to have shown a considerable respect for him. I would suggest, in opening this debate for the Opposition in the Senate, that that is more a tribute to his thespian skills than to his skills as a Treasurer. As I have said, I think he has been on the nose for years in the community and at last economic commentators are seeing through him.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement reflects that, at a time of very considerable economic difficulty for Australia, Mr Keating has actually given up. I think he has ceased trying to tackle the problems that we have and is now following a purely political course. His reaction to the adverse economic criticisms he has received has been classic Paul Keating. He has simply turned on his critics. He has reserved his special venom for the Sydney Morning Herald, but he has managed to have a few passing shots at the Australian on the way through. I would like to refer to that, because I think it is a reminder of the person we are dealing with and of his preparedness to eschew serious debate on serious matters in favour of personal abuse.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 13 April in the House of Representatives Mr Peacock brought forward a matter of public importance on living standards and referred to an editorial in the Australian. Mr Keating referred to that editorial as having been `written by a rabid right winger'. When Mr Peacock referred to Paddy McGuinness, Mr Keating's comment was, `He is just as mad'. When Mr Keating himself responded in the debate, we found the same sort of comment. Poor Mr McGuinness was referred to as `the jilted guru'. When Mr McGuinness was referred to as writing in the Australian, Mr Keating said, `He can prosper with this right wing rot'. Probably the most offensive comment was that made with respect to the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, Ross Gittins, who was first said to be somebody whom Mr Keating admires. Mr Keating then went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        the sad thing about Ross Gittins is that he does not have the personal courage to write what he actually believes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think there could be nothing more offensive to a serious journalist than to have that comment made about him, particularly by the Treasurer of the country.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, of course, a simple and classical `shoot the messenger' response, which is typical of the abuse which the Opposition has certainly had to take from one of the foulest-mouthed politicians we have. It is interesting to see him extending his range. Mr Keating repeated his insulting remarks about the Sydney Morning Herald, and Mr Gittins in particular, at his press conference on 18 April when he again made the same allegation in these words:
       </para>
       <para>
        Gittins and these people know this, they know it to be right but don't have the courage to write it because they don't want to look like they are supporting me.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Sydney Morning Herald . . . has poisoned the whole reception of economic news in the city of Sydney and the State of New South Wales. The whole analysis is flawed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to that, because it is typical of one of the most distasteful elements of this Government. Such a totally cynical statement-I call it `a totally cynical statement' because it is a statement clearly rooted totally in politics which does not come to grips with our economic difficulties-is an attempt to frighten people off and to prevent the sort of analysis which is necessary. I would like to remind the Senate that the history of this statement is quite well known and I think widely understood in the community. It was last year that Mr Keating said that he was to have a wage-tax deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Honourable senators may recall that he went so far as to suggest that that deal may well include the fact that there would be no wage rises at all this year in return for the moderation in inflation which he wrongly predicted and in return for the tax cuts which he said would apply from 1 July.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to remember that at a time when tax cuts were both needed and appropriate-and I refer to a period more than 12 months ago-the Government made the totally cynical decision to withhold tax cuts from wage and salary earners in the interest of the Government having a capacity to bring down a large tax cut just prior to an election. I do not think there is any thinking person or objective observer who denies that that was the timetable, the program and the motivation of the Government. When in this chamber we produce figures which show that Australian families have paid an increasing proportion of their income in taxes, we see that that has been accelerated, increased, exacerbated by a government which has been prepared to hold back on necessary tax relief purely to try to set itself for an election.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was rather to be expected that one would get the cynical response to the April statement which was evident in the community. Any media attempt that I saw to interview members of the community and to get their response to the April statement produced a totally cynical response from those who were interviewed. People knew that the tax cuts would be eaten up, if they had not already been eaten up, by interest rate rises, that any wage rises would be eaten up by further inflation, and that they would wind up worse off, not better off. The totally cynical response of the people of Australia to this statement is a reflection of the totally cynical approach which has been adopted by this Government with respect to economic management over the past year, and a quite criminal failure to come to grips with the real economic dangers that we face. It is in that circumstance that those who dare to criticise are traduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not have time to go through the various comments made by financial journalists and journalists generally on this statement which have brought forward the abuse to which I have referred, but I wish to make quick reference to some of those matters. Though I have heard Labor members complaining about members of the Opposition in the Senate today quoting from what other people have said, I think it is important to see that it is not merely the Opposition which has been a constant critic of this Government's economic policies or which has taken issue with the Government at this stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first matter to which I wish to refer is the speedy diagnosis immediately after the statement that the tax cuts which had been provided by the Government still would leave families, and indeed everybody, paying higher taxes than they were paying at the time this Government came into office. The truth is that within a very short period the Government has taken over $10 billion in additional taxes and is giving some $5 billion back. The most hard hit people in the community-those people who have children and whose position has been identified by the Institute of Family Studies as being the hardest hit in the community, medium income people with dependants-will still be worse off than they were when this Government came to power and will still be comparatively worse off than other people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sorts of comments which have been made and which have brought forward the response to which I have referred are as follows. One reads `Keating hopelessly lost in blind alley', which is one of Mr McGuinness's early observations. The headline in the Hobart Mercury was `Keating heads for economic limbo'. The Sydney Morning Herald of 13 April, the day after the April statement, offered a general condemnation of what had been done. It said that the statement `was an exercise in crisis management, made necessary by the Government's misjudgment of the strength of domestic demand'. The Australian's comment on the next day was that this was `a package for the ACTU, not Australia', and that the Government had disqualified itself from running the Australian economy. Mr McGuinness made the statement, `Ideology is always a substitute for thought in the Labor Party', and Mr Gittins's comment was:
       </para>
       <para>
        I read and re-read the mini-Budget in search of Paul Keating's economic strategy. Since I can find none, I conclude that the new strategy is: cross your fingers.
       </para>
       <para>
        One could go on and on because there has been an absolute welter of comment explaining why independent observers, not political observers, believe that this Government has totally failed to come to grips with the serious problems that we face in Australia. I put some emphasis on this because it is important to see this as part of a wider pattern of an approach to government which is thoroughly destructive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind honourable senators opposite that it is typical of the way they behaved with respect to Mr Ian Temby, for example, who was appointed as the Director of Public Prosecutions with a great deal of Labor praise and who, when he made independent decisions prosecuting some Labor personalities, constantly became an object of criticism. He was obviously regarded with suspicion and with something like contempt by some members of the Labor Party because he did his duty. I remind the Senate of the way in which officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission have been treated. If they have dared to disagree with the prevailing views of this Government, they have been traduced or sacked. It represents an attempt to override all criticism by the use of whatever means are at hand. I believe that it represents a very serious stepping back from the proper traditions of government in this country and from a proper approach to government.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the critics are saying, and what the facts bear out, is that what this Government has done in the April statement is to disclose that it has no strategy for solving our economic problems. That is simply demonstrated. At a time when everybody knows that the debt situation and the balance of payments are at the heart of our crisis, the sad fact is that our exports are declining. At the same time our imports are rising. Our imports went up by some 20 per cent and our exports fell by about one per cent. Just as critical and indeed central to the reason why these things are happening is the fact that our productivity is falling. Again, there is a great deal of debate about that, but the truth about productivity in Australia, if one looks at it from the point of view of what we produce per person employed or from the point of view of a combination of labour and capital output, is that we are declining while our competitors increase their productivity. In those circumstances it is not surprising that interest rates are kept sky high and that families are being squeezed. It is these fundamental things which are not being dealt with by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        One virtue of this debate is the fact that it has drawn Mr Keating into the debate in a way in which he has not been drawn before because he has been challenged so widely. I was interested to see what he had to say in reply to his critics in the Sydney Morning Herald when they gave him an article in that newspaper which was published on 28 April. I do not intend to try to dissect the technical matters which the Treasurer deals with, because I found in that article one sentence which seemed to me to bring out, with blinding clarity, the real problem we have and the area this Government should be attending to. I quote what Mr Keating said in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 April:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is really only one message that can be drawn from our current circumstances . . . It is, simply, that our current account deficit is too high because we are spending more than we can produce.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that there is anyone in this Senate who would disagree that that is a fair summary of our problem: we are spending more than we can produce. If that is Mr Keating's view of our problem one would have expected that the April statement would direct attention to the solution of that problem. The truth is that that problem is not mentioned in the April statement. Certainly there is nothing in the April statement that suggests that the Government is seriously addressing itself to that vital question.

         —As my friend Senator Michael Baume interjects, in fact, it is going to worsen it. Mr Deputy President, I think that there are a couple of questions that need to be asked if one accepts as I do, and as I think the community would accept, that Mr Keating has accurately diagnosed our problem as being one of spending more than we can produce. One might ask: What is happening to production under the policies of this Government? What is being done to facilitate production and remove areas of waste and inefficiency? Let me deal very quickly with the question: What is happening to production? Are we, in fact, on an increasing scale of production, or is the movement in the wrong direction? Just after Mr Keating put down his statement we had preliminary production figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for March. What those figures show is that in 18 of the 27 industries for which seasonally adjusted estimates are given, output is declining. In other words, at a time when the Government acknowledges that we are not producing what we wish to consume, that we are spending more than we can produce, the current figures show that there is a declining level of production in about two-thirds of the industrial items which are produced in Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I put out a press release on that on 27 April in an attempt to draw the attention of the people of Australia to that rather sobering reality. It was not I think until 1 May, just yesterday, that in the Financial Australian the writer Mr David Potts drew attention to just how serious that deficiency is. In an article which pointed out that we have the risk of a crash landing rather than a hard landing in the economy, and after reference to the fact that two-thirds of the 27 main industrial items produced in Australia recorded large falls, he went on to make this point:
       </para>
       <para>
        You're probably wondering, as I am, how such an obvious economic turning point could lumber past the press gallery, which normally pounces and pronounces on any statistic that moves, without so much as a by-your-leave. But it did.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the Canberra literati, or the economic illiterati might be a better way of putting it, have become so convinced by the nonsense that the economy is over-heating, when the real problem is that industry is not competing. It cannot comprehend that the threat to Australia is stagflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        And so it goes. That is what is happening to production. Our production is falling. What is being done to make our production rise? The sad answer to that question is that nothing is being done which could be done to make our production rise; indeed, the Government is locked into a situation where those things which obviously could be done are going to be blocked by its friends in the trade union movement. We had a glaring example of that when the Inter-State Commission produced its report on the waterfront and put forward proposals which, at a cost of some $270m, had the capacity in the view of the Inter-State Commission to make efficiency gains of some $600m per year. That report brought a speedy response from the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia which said that it would oppose the rearrangements which went to the membership and the power of the Waterside Workers Federation. Of course the ACTU came out in instant support of the Waterside Workers Federation. In a nutshell that is the problem which faces this Government and, whilst this Government remains in power, faces Australia. The truth is that there is a great deal that could be done to remedy the problems which Australia has and these are the matters which could have been made the subject of the April economic statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is often said that it is easy for oppositions to be critical of what the government is doing or not doing; it is harder for oppositions to assert what should be done. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that within 24 hours of delivery of the non-statement by the Treasurer, the Hon. John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, laid down a list of essential reforms in his reply in the House of Representatives. He referred to the need to reduce government spending and stamp out waste and inefficiency; to the promotion of domestic savings and a more family-oriented tax system; a comprehensive program of privatisation and a more productivity enterprise-based industrial relations system; to a more flexible and entrepreneurial higher education system; to fundamental freeing up of our coastal shipping and the waterfront; and to reduced barriers to competition in many areas of telecommunications.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a list, I do not believe that there would be an observer, commentator or economist in the country who would deny that reforms in those areas which will free up the productive capacity of this country and increase our output lie at the heart of solving our problems. For those of us who are concerned with improving the position of Australian families-before the conclusion of this speech I will refer to what that means in personal terms to the people of Australia-there is no avoiding the need for government to tackle that agenda of reform. This is not a time to be attacking the financial journalists who diagnosed the problems that the Government is refusing to tackle; this is a time for tackling those clearly identified areas of waste and inefficiency in the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time as the Hon. John Howard delivered the response on behalf of the Opposition, he tabled in the House of Representatives a series of detailed proposals for reform in areas of the micro-economy. He tabled a paper entitled Contracting Out-A Means to Cost Savings and Better Value for Money in Government. Governments of all complexions around the world have shown that there are substantial areas of savings, there are substantial ways of eradicating waste by contracting out services which are currently being provided by the public sector. The time of this debate does not permit any detailed consideration of that paper, but I propose, with the leave of the Senate, to table in this chamber also the four papers which were put down by the Leader of the Opposition.

         —I thank the Senate. The paper on reform of the waterfront gets to the vital point that what is required is genuine competition on the waterfront if we are to get away from the tremendous waste in that area. The paper on coastal shipping gets to the nub of the matter by saying that coastal shipping will be opened up to foreign competition because at the moment coastal shipping represents an area of complete protection for the domestic industry and as in all areas of complete protection there is gross waste and inefficiency. In the area of award restructuring the Opposition puts forward proposals which will get away from the current proposals of the Government which will simply lead to further centralisation of the labour market and to a less flexible approach which will, therefore, be even less productive than the system that we are currently trying to break out of.

        They are the sorts of specifics which could be done now and which could, therefore, be used to ease the position of Australian families and Australian taxpayers. What was pointed out in the Opposition response to what was put forward by the Treasurer in the April economic statement was that we have the highest inflation rate among major industrialised countries, we have home loan interest rates at record levels, we have a balance of payments in chronic deficit, our productivity levels are amongst the worst in the industrialised world, and the living standard of an average family has declined sharply over the past six years. Almost all of the major economic forecasts contained in the last Budget have gone hopelessly astray. I will quote John Howard:

       <para>
        There is, in fact, no relief in sight because of the April economic statement. It is accepted by the Australian people as reality-and it is reality-that already the high interest rate policies of the Government have robbed them of the benefit of the tax cuts which will not be delivered until 1 July and which will repay about half of the increased taxes which have been taken by this Government. It is accepted because it is so obvious that the wage rises which have been negotiated with the ACTU and which are not backed by productivity will, in turn, simply lead to greater inflation.
       </para>

        The tragic fact is that the April statement represents another lost opportunity for Australia. Those lost opportunities have been multiplying since the banana republic year of 1986. It was in that year that we had a temporary period of honesty on the part of Mr Keating when he correctly disclosed to the people of Australia the perilous economic course on which we are set. In 1986, because of the momentary honesty--

         —As Senator Stone said, the momentary honesty of the Treasurer soon came to an end because of the action of the Prime Minister. It was followed by the limp-wristed, lacklustre address to the nation by the Prime Minister which simply failed to capitalise on the understanding in the Australian community at that time of the urgent need for change and reform. The improvement in commodity prices has temporarily masked the crisis that we face as a country. That temporary masking is falling away and we are again in a situation where the Government, in its April statement, has failed to meet the challenge that faced it and has thereby failed Australia. This is a sad statement which simply fails to live up to the responsibilities that are required of government.

         —The Australian Democrats welcome the tax cuts and the increased social security payments that were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) a week or so ago as being largely considerably overdue. Again, to a very large extent, the Government is giving back only a part of its increased tax take as pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers have moved into higher tax brackets. The reaction from most of the public the day after the statement was brought down reflected the growing cynicism in the minds of the general public with regard to this Government's taking with one hand and giving back considerably later a little bit of that with the other hand.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        From a political point of view, the Hawke Government has suddenly woken up to the fact that wage earners, who were barely surviving as a result of the reduction in real wages engineered by this Government over the last five years, cannot be squeezed any further and are moving away from the Labor Government in droves as far as poll support is concerned. To a certain extent, what the Treasurer offered the Australian people in the April statement was an attempt to claw back some of that lost support from middle and lower income Australia in the same way that Mr Hawke's injunction to his Cabinet Ministers to clean up their language was an attempt to claw back support from the women's vote which, through the polls, was noticed to be declining.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite all the hype from the Treasurer in announcing the so-called largess that was dished out during that 20-odd minute speech a week or so ago, the fact is that successive Liberal-National Party governments and the current Labor Government have done nothing to redress the long term trend for more tax revenue to be taken from PAYE taxpayers than from any other taxpaying group in the community. Certainly, over the last 20-odd years there has been a dramatic shift in the proportion of tax paid by individual Australians and that paid, for example, by companies. As the proportion of tax paid by some of the biggest companies in this country has dropped back, so the proportion of tax paid through personal taxation by ordinary individuals, largely middle and low income earners, has increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from questioning the collusion between the Hawke Government and the Liberal-National Opposition to protect the interests of their big business mates which we have noticed increasingly over the last few years, we need to ask why and how this dramatic change has happened. One indicator would be to look at an article that came from a report prepared by Mr Greg Crough, an academic and author working with Sydney University's transnational corporations research project. The report that was done for the parliamentary inquiry into international profit shifting found that 15 Australian companies made more than $1,000m in tax haven profits in 1987-88. While it is certainly true that the Government has taken some steps to reduce the incidence of Australian companies shifting profits to tax havens it has not acted quickly or in any dramatic sense.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first step that the Government took was to announce in the May statement last year that income derived by Australian companies from foreign companies and trusts operating in a tax haven would be taxed in Australia. Those of us who were disturbed by the amount of revenue lost to Australia were heartily pleased to hear that announcement. One year later, however, we have another announcement in the April statement that the new measures will take effect only from the 1990-91 income year. We can very quickly change access by pensioners to their cost of living increases and cut back Austudy for 15-year-old students from poorer families when the Government and the Opposition have a mind to cooperate, but when it comes to cutting back on revenue lost through tax haven rorts, this Government is not willing to act quite so quickly. It will be two years from announcement to implementation and in that time, according to Mr Crough, something like $2 billion of potentially taxable profits will be lost. This is one of the reasons why Australian companies pay less and less tax while pay as you earn taxpayers contribute more to Consolidated Revenue and, ironically, get less back.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Sydney Morning Herald-these figures are backed up by magazines such as Business Review Weekly and Australian Business-some of Australia's largest companies end up paying a pathetically small proportion of their pre-tax profits in tax. In 1988, for example, Qintex paid 0.15 per cent of its pretax profits in tax, an improvement, I might add, on 1987 when the percentage was minus 16.5 per cent; Equiticorp paid 0.8 per cent; Bond Corporation, 0.97 per cent; and Northern Star, 1.3 per cent-and that at a time when the company tax rate was 49c in the dollar. In the interim, the Government, with the support of the Liberal-National Opposition, has cut company tax by 20 per cent from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar. If the sorts of tax havens that have been used are left available to these people, the taxpayers will be paying them back money each year. Negative taxation will become the norm for some of these large companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the tax cuts were more illusory than real and were nothing more than a part payment to middle and low income Australia of what the Government owed it in any event. The social security measures were even less than official in real terms. Certainly, the Australian Democrats welcome the long overdue indexation of things such as family allowances, because that sort of failure in the past has probably been more damaging to a lot of low income earners, pensioners, beneficiaries and families than the much derided bracket creep has been with regard to marginal tax rates. So we welcome the increase as well in family allowances, the increases in the level of income that pensioners can earn before they pay tax and the removal of the six-week postponement of consumer price index adjustments to pensioners which was introduced by this Government and supported by the Opposition in 1986. Assistance to pensioners and beneficiaries pales in comparison to assistance given to the wealthy by this Government. For example, last year the legislation to give companies almost $2 billion in tax cuts was passed with the support of the Opposition, and the tax cuts of pay as you earn taxpayers announced in April are estimated to cost something like $4.9 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        By comparison, the social security package is estimated to cost $710m but will be more than offset by a series of government savings in the same social welfare area. These include, of course, a further attack on social security recipients allegedly to reduce social security abuse, a new pharmaceutical benefits scheme and further cuts to State governments which will, of course, have to increase their charges with regard to utilities and so on if they are to meet the increased costs that they will have to bear because of cuts to government funding from the Federal level.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, the April economic statement has seen the Australian Labor Party, the party supposedly there to support the workers, the low income earners, the people in need and the social welfare recipients and beneficiaries, march further and further to the right. It has introduced its own version of work for the dole by compelling the unemployed to accept part-time employment regardless of qualifications and regardless of the fact that part-time employment is generally poorly paid and unreliable. What is more, of course, it is depriving people who are unemployed from finding the time to look for more worthwhile, long term types of employment. Young people in Australia, the permanently unemployed and the unskilled, the under-skilled, or those whose skills are no longer relevant to industry and commerce, are being penalised by the Government and will quite probably be squashed entirely by the policies of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both the Government and Liberal-National parties talk about increasing incentives, deregulation and wage restraint at a time when unemployment remains a very real social problem, when the number of sole supporting parents living below the poverty line is growing and when company profits are expanding. We do not need those sorts of additional screws applied to those who are already underprivileged and living below the poverty line. What we do need are progressive, inventive job creation schemes and genuine tax reform. Instead, the Government gives us draconian legislation aimed at further penalising the poorer, less socially and economically advantaged segments in our society.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a fact, whether Government members like it or not, that the Hawke Government has failed to act on the poverty traps that are creating child poverty. Children of the unemployed, of sole supporting parents and of other beneficiaries will still be living below the poverty line despite, or maybe even because of, what this Government has done in the April statement and in previous Budgets and May economic statements. A sole parent beneficiary with two children receives an additional $5.25 a week, leaving her-and it is almost always a her-$15.75 below the poverty line. This is in stark contrast with an employee sole supporting parent with two children on $500 a week who gains $23.95 from the package. There are not, I might add, a large number of those people because, unless their children are reasonably advanced in school years and do not require to be taken to and picked up from school each day, most sole supporting parents are not able to go into full-time employment. Those whose children are not of school age find child care so prohibitively expensive that they are essentially prevented from finding work, no matter what their qualifications are.
       </para>
       <para>
        An even more striking example of the Government's entrenchment of inequity in the social and economic systems is seen in the extra $121 a week gained by the two-child, two-income family earning $45,000 per annum. Where is the equity in such decisions? Because the tax threshold has not been lifted and because tax rebate increases have been confined to age pensioners, the poverty traps remain. No impact has been made on the equivalent marginal tax rates which are a disincentive to those people returning to paid employment. In addition, another anomaly has been created. Single pensioners will have to wait until 1990-91 to receive the full amount of $40 in the income test free area, whereas married pensioners are able to receive their full increase in the current financial year. For a government which espouses a social justice strategy, the package is a sad comment on its attitude towards disadvantaged minorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third element that the Treasurer mentioned in his April statement was the question of wages, the accord and the issue of the new Industrial Relations Commission determining wage increases. The important point that needs to be made is that the outcome of the announcements by the Treasurer in the April statement with regard to the wages package is highly speculative. It does depend on decisions to be made later this month in the Industrial Relations Commission and the arguments put before it by the unions which are able to prepare a satisfactory case. Appendix D of the economic statement says:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the ACTU and the Government are agreed that wage increases in 1989-90 will need to be consistent with an outcome for growth in average earnings . . . of the order of 6 1/2 per cent . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That would be a reasonable enough target to be aiming at. The question is: how can we achieve this outcome; how can we ensure that the much vaunted restructuring and productivity measures actually occur rather than simply be used as excuses to give pay rises to the most powerful unions? What about the areas in which restructuring and increased productivity cannot be quantitatively or even qualitatively produced? For example, where can productivity increases be achieved in areas such as nursing, teaching or many of the other caring professions? I do not believe that it will be easy for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) or the various business organisations, whether they are big or small, to achieve the twin aims of keeping wage increases at 6 1/2 per cent and ensuring that the wage increases that are given result in a more efficient work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has been left out of the statement? The answer is essentially more than was actually in it. There is, for example, no attempt to look at the twin problems facing middle Australia of an encouragement to save and the issue of increasing interest rates. The Democrats came into this chamber in the August 1981 Budget session and acknowledged then that Australia was facing a problem in the area of savings. At the time by way of a private member's Bill, we introduced a method by which the Government could encourage savings. That Bill and a Bill relating to housing interest rates were sent to a committee by a combined vote of the then Fraser Government and the Labor Opposition and the report came back saying, `Do nothing in 1981 about holding down interest rates and encouraging savings'. We can see now in 1989 the mess that has come from the combined Labor and Liberal-National parties do nothing approach. Had these things been listened to seven years ago perhaps we would not be seeing the sorts of problems that we are currently faced with.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition has suddenly, however, discovered that there is a problem. The Hawke Government has yet to recognise it. The simple fact of the matter is that Australians need to save more if we are to spend less overseas and reduce our growing dependence on foreign borrowings. In so far as there is a danger with the tax cuts and the wage increases promised in the April statement, it is that they will be translated into an ever bigger demand for imported goods because people have no reason to save. A large amount of their interest is eaten up in tax and they can see no way to save for a deposit for a home because they do not believe they will keep up with the pace of the increasing prices in housing or that they will ever be able to meet mortgage payments. It is therefore imperative that the Government act in this area. In line with this belief, in March this year I introduced legislation to exempt from tax the first $2,000 of interest earned in savings accounts with financial institutions which lent for housing provided those accounts pay 12 per cent or less in interest. There would be a number of beneficial effects from this. It would encourage savings in general. If offers small investors, especially the elderly and the retired, a secure investment with a good return. It would assist those who are saving to buy their first home and interest rates for housing loans would drop as the pool of money to be lent for housing increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        If ordinary Australians are to be helped with regard to interest rates we need to level the playing field in the area of borrowings. We need to return to the days when we had at least some tax deductability on mortgage repayments to help families who are struggling to meet the increase in home loan interest rates which are continuing, inexorably, to move upwards, with recent predictions of 18 per cent. Again, last month I introduced legislation to give tax relief to people who are buying the house they live in. It does not go anywhere near matching the generosity of tax concessions to owner home buyers in the United States and the United Kingdom. But it goes some little way to levelling a playing field which in Australia gives a tax reduction to people who want to borrow money to invest in housing to rent to people who cannot afford their own home but does not offer it to those people who want to put a roof over their own and their children's heads. We have either to level that playing field or to go back to the days when it was not possible to negatively gear in the real estate area. What we have seen since that was reintroduced is a very significant distortion of the home buying market where fewer and fewer people who are borrowing are first home buyers and more and more who are borrowing are investors.
       </para>
       <para>
        This, of course, leads us to the question that also was not answered nor was even attempted to be addressed in the Treasurer's April statement-that is, why are interest rates as high as they are? Fairly obviously there are a number of reasons for that. Our foreign debt, somewhere in the vicinity of $121 billion at the end of last year, does not help. It means that Australia has become a very risky country to lend to. The way of compensating for that, of course, as far as governments are concerned, is to encourage interest rates to be high so that we can encourage foreigners to invest in this country. Interest rates have been forced up in this country by a Government keen to attract foreign lenders.
       </para>
       <para>
        Inflation is rising, too, despite the fact that imported goods should have been cheaper over the last two quarters as a consequence of a rise in the Australian dollar. This has not happened and the Government was very slow to sool the Prices Surveillance Authority on to retailers in this area. The deregulation of the financial system has meant the Government has given up its ability even to control interest rates in some areas and to control bank lending through the mechanisms of the past. It is time to reregulate at least part of the financial sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        What can and should be done to introduce some sort of social and economic equity into the system? We could look at a surcharge on luxury imports. This would either cut imports directly by discouraging people from purchasing those higher priced items or, at the very least, make the well-off who can afford to pay even the higher price to make their contribution to our balance of trade problems. We could discourage private overseas borrowings by ending the current tax concession used by companies who borrow overseas. We need to recognise that the bulk of our foreign debt is private. At the end of 1988 our top six corporate borrowers-Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, News Corporation, Bond, Bell, Industrial Equity Ltd and Elders-were responsible for something like $26 billion worth of foreign borrowings, $3 billion more than the foreign borrowings of the Federal Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I mentioned earlier, we could discourage consumption of imports by encouraging savings. We could do this, as I said, with a tax exemption on some of the earnings of people who save with banks and building societies that lend for housing. We need to acknowledge that company profits are high while wages have been squeezed. We need to acknowledge that prices have not dropped despite the fact that imports are cheaper to the importer and to the retailer as a consequence of the appreciation of the dollar. We have seen inflation rise as a consequence. The beneficiaries of this are obviously not middle and low income Australians. They are in fact executives who are paid ever-increasing salary packages with no need to justify those increases before the Industrial Relations Commission. Companies which are importing at cheaper prices without passing on the price reductions are benefiting. Major shareholders of companies where profits are increasing are, of course, also benefiting. These are people who are already well off and need extra assistance like they need a hole in the head. What we need to do is to apply far stricter controls on prices and on executive salaries. I find it quite offensive that one of the major private banks in this country is paying $1 1/2m salary packages to its senior executives in Japan and America whilst charging pensioners and low income earners fees on small bank accounts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition alternative is to provide tax cuts but to fund them through things like expenditure cuts in the areas, presumably, of education, aged care, social security and health. One wonders how people on low incomes will pay for those services if they are forced to dig deeper into already shallow pockets for the money. The Opposition still has as its favourite solver of all problems, of course, privatisation. We need to ask ourselves whether low income Australian families and, in particular, rural families will benefit from privatisation; whether they will be compensated sufficiently to meet the extra expenses of privatised utilities such as Telecom, Australia Post, the hospitals or the schools systems. Furthermore, since the Government, of whatever flavour or colour it happens to be, can sell those enterprises only once, how are the tax cuts to be sustained? The next favourite item is something like a broad-based consumption tax which, of course, hits lower income earners hardest.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that none of these things or, indeed, the next favourite item-selling off Australia to overseas interests-will help middle and low income Australians. At best the solutions are short-term and at worst they substitute a foreign debt problem with a foreign ownership problem and/or hit hardest those on lowest incomes through the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we need instead is a return to a policy of social and economic equity. We need to recognise that our wages are no higher than those of our major trading partners, except Korea; that Australia has a generous tax system-tax levels and deductions-especially for companies when compared with our major trading partners; but that we have an adversarial political and workplace system which is a sad heritage of our colonial past. Until we get rid of employee versus management conflict, and until we come to an across-the-board agreement about tax and social services equity, we will not see Australia pulled out of the mire. Until these sorts of problems are attended to this country's economy will continue to decline and take middle and low income earners further down the mine than they already are.

         —This evening we are addressing the so-called economic statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of 12 April. I say `so-called' because there can rarely have been a document put down in the Parliament which has carried such a misleading title. There is a statement, but there is very little economic about it. It is ludicrous to describe it by such a term.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The package, which the statement comprised, consisted of three elements, as we all recall. Firstly, it consisted of a significant set of tax cuts, although I will come back in a moment to their magnitude compared with some other considerations. It consisted, secondly, of a welfare or family package of a relatively modest kind. Thirdly, it consisted of the setting down of an agreement between Mr Keating and the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Mr Bill Kelty, on a set of wage and salary increases to be rubber-stamped a little later by what is now called the Industrial Relations Commission, and what used to be called the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-Mr Kelty's or Mr Keating's creatures.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer, in that statement in the House of Representatives on the evening of 12 April, said that this package could only be delivered by a Labor government. He was totally correct in saying that. Only a Labor government-and I feel I can almost say only this Labor government, led by the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the present Treasurer-could be so cynical as to deliver that package on 12 April, describe it as an economic statement and suggest to the people of this country either that it had addressed the problems which were being experienced by ordinary Australians in their everyday lives or, still less, that it had addressed the problems being encountered by this country. Some of those problems, of course, are not as immediately apparent as they might be because they are being swept under the carpet by the ever-rising tide of foreign debt into which this Government has been leading Australia, not to mention, of course, the ever-rising volume of sales of Australian assets to foreigners. Those two forms of poultice have been used to staunch some of the wounds which we would otherwise be encountering. The only other comment I would like to make on the text of Mr Keating's statement, before turning to some other aspects of a more general kind arising from it, concerns his statement on page 4 where he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        If we leave you with one single thought tonight it is this: if a Government cannot run wages in Australia it cannot run the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I predict that those words will come back to haunt this Treasurer. If there is one thing that is clear already and is becoming clearer day by day as we see the working out in the labour market of the results of this Government's failed accord, it is that this Labor Government has failed to run wages in Australia in a manner which is in any way commensurate with the needs of the Australian economy and, hence, the future of the Australian people and their children.
       </para>
       <para>
        A few days ago when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was speaking in Brisbane he noted, I think in response to a question, that the next election in this country will not be fought on taxation and matters of that kind but it will be fought on, among other things, the state of our foreign debt. In laying down that point-and I applaud Mr Howard for doing so-the Leader of the Opposition was putting his finger on a matter which is of increasing concern throughout this land. Wherever I go and talk to meetings of ordinary Australians I continually encounter the question, `What about our foreign debt?'. In the same context I continually encounter the question, `Why are we having to sell off so much of Australia to foreigners?'.

         —Because, as Senator Michael Baume quite rightly interjects, Mr Keating has sent us broke. That is why we are having to borrow, and that is why we are having to sell off Australia. I will have further comments to make upon that in due course. I wish to put one or two facts on the record. The Australian Bureau of Statistics recently put out one of its regular quarterly publications on foreign investments in Australia by which it really means, in this context at least, foreign debt. It is instructive to see that at the end of December last year our foreign debt was $95,474m. Although this publication does not contain figures going back sufficiently far, it is my clear recollection that at the time this Government came into office that figure was about $22,000m. The amount has increased approximately four and half times in six years of this Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At the end of last December that figure amounted to just over 30 per cent of our gross domestic product. The interest payment which we made on that net debt alone-not gross debt-in the 12 months to the end of December were $8,700m. That is the amount in exports we have to make simply in order to get the funds to pay the interest on our foreign debt. That is how far we start behind the eight ball every year in this country today. How have we acquired that debt? We have acquired that debt over a long period by living beyond our means and, particularly during the last six years, we have acquired it at a bewildering and frightening rate.

         —Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I had drawn the attention of the Senate to the state of our international indebtedness. I had begun to develop the point that that has not arisen by accident, that it is a result of this Government's failed policies-the policies of six years of hard Labor. How have we acquired that debt? We have acquired it because for all of that time we have been living beyond our means. What does that mean in terms of the economic concepts we are talking about? It means that each year during the life of this Government we have not earned enough abroad to pay for all our imports of goods and services and to pay the interest on the debt we have previously accumulated.

        Each month, as honourable senators are aware, and as the public is these days painfully aware, the Australian Statistician publishes a balance of payments account. It is probably the most eagerly awaited statistic in the stock markets and the financial markets generally these days. I am sure that everybody can recall the sickening feeling we all had a week or two ago when it was revealed that in the month of March alone Australia had spent $1,624m more on our external payments than we had earned on our external income. That meant that in the first nine months of this financial year we had accumulated total deficits of that kind of $12,688m-almost $12.7 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if we do only as badly in the last three months of this financial year as we did in the last three months of the last financial year-I emphasise that so far we have been doing a good deal worse-we will finish this financial year, 1988-89 as a whole, with a total deficit of $15,622m, or $15.6 billion. As a percentage of our domestic product that would be greater than the very high deficit we recorded last financial year, even though this financial year our international terms of trade have improved further by about 14 per cent. This is a measure of the pass to which this Government has brought us. It is against that background that the Treasurer brought down his so-called economic statement, which fails to address any of these problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sometimes-I am very keenly aware of this-economists go on about these matters in a way which I think many people in the rest of Australia regard as rather rarefied, full of jargon and so on. I often think it is best to think about the problem faced by this country as the same problem a family has if it is living beyond its means, that is, if it is spending, enjoying the life of Riley, to a degree which it is not actually able to afford in terms of its household income. We all know that in those circumstances a family can do so only by doing one of two things: it can either borrow from the bank or somewhere else, or it can sell off some of its assets if it has any to sell. That is precisely what Australia has been doing hand over fist during the life of the Hawke-Keating Government. We have been borrowing hand over fist and increasingly, particularly in the last couple of years, we have been selling off Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am continually amazed to find in my own State of Queensland the Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Wayne Goss, standing up on his hind legs and criticising the Queensland Premier, Mr Mike Ahern, when we hear the latest news about some piece of the Gold Coast or some cane farm at Cairns being sold off to some foreign purchasers, usually but not always Japanese. I am amazed that Mr Goss has the total impudence even to mention the subject because the reason why those sales of Australia are occurring is the policies of Mr Goss's Party's Government in Canberra. It is that Government which has put in place, and maintained for six years, policies which have continued to send Australia down the plug-hole. It is those policies which are forcing Australians, including many private corporations, to borrow abroad or to finance our deficit by the only other means, namely, by selling off bits of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        To continue the analogy of the family, how does a family finding itself in such a situation get out of the mess? Again, there are only two ways it can do so. If it wants to stop borrowing and to stop having to sell its assets, assuming that it still has some left, it can do so only in one of two ways: it can either pull in its belt and reduce its standard of living or it can go out and increase its family income. It can bring more income into the household, it can work harder and better or in some other way increase its earning capacity in the outside world, the world outside the family. The economists would call that increasing its productivity. It is the same for a nation. It is the same for Australia today. Faced with the situation which we do face, but which this Government seems to be prepared to go on ignoring or sweeping under the carpet-it was barely referred to in the Treasurer's statement of 12 April-Australia has only two options. Either we can pull in our belt on average, or we can increase our performance, lift our game, raise our national productivity. Given that those are the only two solutions open to us, one might have expected Mr Keating's statement of 12 April to have referred to one or other of them as a means of solving our national problems, the problems of the Australian family, but not a bit of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned at the outset of my remarks before dinner that Mr Keating's package consisted of three elements: a tax cut package, a welfare or so-called family package and a set of wage and salary increases which he says he has agreed with Mr Kelty and the ACTU.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will put to one side the second of those elements, the welfare family package. Nobody, as far as I am aware, has any vast objection to that. The reason I do not have any objection to it is that Mr Keating proposes to finance that element of his total package by cutting other areas of his budgetary expenditures. No net increase in Government spending will arise out of those decisions. All Mr Keating has done in that limited area of his statement of 12 April is simply to re-arrange his priorities. I would say that his priorities are now better than they were and we would therefore approve of that change, but let us not overrate its importance. It is a fairly minor set of changes all told, amounting to something like $700m, from memory.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other two elements are much more significant: the tax cuts-$4.9 billion worth in the next financial year-and the wage and salary increases. By definition, I would have thought that to provide $4.9 billion worth of tax cuts is hardly a means of pulling in our national belt. One could say that we have been forced to pull our belts in for the past two years, indeed for more than two years. In that sense Mr Keating is simply giving us back a notch or two on a belt that has already been pulled in a very long way. However, the fact of the matter is that, as we stand today, we are still running that big deficit in our external accounts of almost $16 billion. It is no good in one sense saying that we have pulled in our belts in the past under this Government and, therefore, we can afford to let them out a notch or two now because the fact is that we cannot. We are not in a position to let them out a notch or two now, whether we like it or not, and it is no good Mr Keating telling us that we can.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Keating also claimed in that area of his remarks that this did not constitute a relaxation of his budgetary or fiscal policies. Of course, that is economic nonsense. He claims that because he says that he proposes next financial year to have the same Budget surplus that he has this financial year. If that is the only degree of economics that Mr Keating has learnt in the course of six years in the Treasury I regret to say that Treasury has been less educational for him than it has been for most of his predecessors. The plain, obvious fact of the matter is that he is giving a tax cut of nearly $5 billion-in fact the annual rate is rather greater than that-and that constitutes a fiscal stimulus, even though it may be the case that next year we do have a Budget surplus the same as this year's. I have not time to argue that further other than to state my astonishment that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia should commit such an economics fallacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Take the second element-the wage and salary increases that, according to Mr Keating and Mr Kelty, everybody will get in 1989-90. Again, by definition, that is hardly pulling in our belts. Mr Keating says that that will result in an average increase of 6 1/2 per cent in wage and salary levels in Australia in 1989-90 as a whole. I think other independent commentators suggest that the outcome will be appreciably higher than that, but let us take Mr Keating's figure for what it is worth. Does Mr Keating seriously suggest that productivity in this country will rise in 1989-90 by 6 1/2 per cent? I do not think even Mr Keating is barefaced enough to make such a claim. He and perhaps Mr Kelty also would claim-this is another piece of jargon which is being thrown around-that we will have this phenomenon of award restructuring that the ACTU has spent so much time dreaming up over the past 12 months or so. I do not have time in these remarks this evening to go into the whole extensive set of arguments surrounding that subject. Let me say only that there are some very interesting comments in the latest issue of the Industrial Review by the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI). The National Employers Industrial Council has published the results of a fairly extensive study of the award restructuring proposals as they are now emerging in the cold light of day in the form of the submission by the ACTU to the Industrial Relations Commission in the so-called national wage case now under way in Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is well and truly on the record that I have by no means found myself always in agreement with the opinions of the Confederation of Australian Industry which I happen to regard, in some ways, as part of the industrial relations club and, in that sense, perhaps not of the same philosophy in this area of labour market reform that I inhabit. But I am bound to say that some of the things that Mr Brian Noakes and the CAI have set forward in this document are very interesting and highly informative. In that sense I congratulate them on doing a useful job of public education, which is badly needed. They point out, for example, that far from these increases being confined to amounts such as 6 1/2 per cent or the figure of $30 a week which has been floating around for some time in the public discourse, particularly in relation to minimum award rates, the projected movements-these are illustrations provided by the ACTU itself in its evidence to the Industrial Relations Commission-amount to 18.8 per cent in the case of storemen and packers, 23.3 per cent in the case of a metal industry fitter, 15.9 per cent in the case of a three-year experienced filing clerk and 17.4 per cent in the transport workers area.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are kinds of increases in the minimum award rates the ACTU is setting out to get. Of course, we all know, among other things, what the outcomes of such a set of wage increases at the minimum level could be if they were to take effect. There would be sharply increased unemployment among the people concerned-of exactly the same kind that we got in 1982 after moves by the trade union movement at that time, still under the influence of Mr Kelty, only at that stage much more under the influence of people such as Mr John Halfpenny, Mr Laurie Carmichael and some of the other communist or crypto-communist members of the trade union movement. We had increases of 23 per cent and figures of that kind. The result was that 100,000 metal workers were out of jobs in the following 18 months-an accusation which, I remind the Senate, was made not by me but by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, Mr Keating, against Mr George Campbell, the Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, at the Australian Labor Party biennial conference in Hobart about 18 months ago. If I may say so, for once Mr Keating was quite right on that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have, therefore, is a statement on 12 April which has simply not addressed the problems of the country. It will make the balance of payments worse because it will increase incomes and lead to a greater demand for imports. Therefore, it will make our foreign debt position worse or force us to sell off assets to foreigners even faster than we are already doing. It will make inflation worse and it will keep interest rates higher for longer. Of course, on that last point our Treasurer has recently signalled that he does not want interest rates any higher. He would like to have it both ways. He has signalled to the markets, through a remarkable series of events which I do not have the time to go into, that the next time we get another bad piece of economic news-I should say that this signal was given on the morning that the last balance of payments figures were about to be published-the market reaction ought not be higher interest rates but a fall in our exchange rate. One might ask: What is wrong with that? We all know that, at present, our exchange rate presently is overvalued. We certainly do not want to see interest rates rise any higher; we would like to see them come down if there is the capacity to bring them down responsibly. But Mr Keating seems to have failed to understand that, by doing that, he was playing with fire. He was giving an open invitation to every speculator in our financial markets to take a one-way bet against the Australian dollar.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Keating seems to have forgotten that, for years now, his economic policy has been financed with hot money and that our financial markets are awash with money from overseas on very short terms. The Reserve Bank of Australia, which has some responsibility to handle these things as distinct from making leaks to the press about them like our Treasurer has done, has obviously been very alarmed by this development and it has taken, for it, quite extraordinary overt action to tell the market that that is not the way it will be. It has called in the money market dealers and told them that there is no basis for that sharp run-down in short term bank bill rates that they were in the process of doing immediately following the leak that I am talking about; and the Governor of the Reserve Bank has said some very unusually blunt things in a public statement-maybe he is approaching retirement. Last week the Reserve Bank put up the treasury note discount rate, again in what might otherwise have been called an unexpected fashion. It generally signalled to the markets, by one move after another, that it regarded this guidance from Canberra as totally inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is hardly surprising that the Reserve Bank should be alarmed because, as I have said, people all over the world are now looking at us with growing concern. Only this morning there was an article in today's Australian by Maxwell Newton who happens to be a school mate of mine and of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). However, he is now writing from New York. Basically, he summed up by saying that the Australian dollar was in for a tremendous bath in the next few months. He may or may not be right about that, but what he said is more generally reflecting a feeling of growing concern out there about the way this economy is being handled. Quite frankly, the only thing likely to prevent that outcome is a sharp recession. I am not predicting that we will have a sharp recession, neither do I rule it out as a possibility further down the track.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, in this morning's Australian, Mr David Potts, by focusing on the March production figures which I think were referred to by Senator Chaney when he opened this debate, argues that that recession is already under way. I think that is perhaps calling the shots too early. Certainly a whole series of figures which came out yesterday regarding retail sales, motor vehicle registrations, building approvals and housing finance approvals provide very mixed evidence for any such conclusion. In my opinion, they do not provide sufficient evidence at all, other than to say that maybe-just maybe-the economy is slowing very slightly.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a government which has no strategy. It had one last August. At that time its strategy was to have a sharp reduction in our balance of payments deficit; to have inflation come down; to have the wage increase of 1989-90 cut back to a very low level, and then to have an election. That was its strategy. The Government no longer has that strategy as it has been blown out of the water by its own incompetence. All we have left is the Government saying, `We will not cut our own spending. We will ask the States to cut theirs. We will not do anything worth while about reforming or deregulating the labour market; we will not tackle the terrible problem of excessive trade union power; we will not tackle the waterfront; we will not tackle coastal shipping. We will simply sit here and bully economic and financial journalists and cook the books by having a new version of the consumer price index to be released next Thursday'.

       We had a matter of public importance today regarding research and funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. This particular report refers to the Australian Special Rural Research Council's annual report. It is one of our smaller expenditures on research in this country pertaining to new and existing rural industries which are too small to justify the establishment of rural industry research funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       One would find, while looking through the report, some innovative programs which have been conducted by different research bodies, departments of agriculture and researchers around Australia. I would like to take a few moments to comment on some of those programs. These projects are funded, and are encouraged to be funded, on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the Government. This does not apply to all of them. Some of the research projects are so small that they have to be fully funded for the small amounts of money which are involved, to allow this innovative research to continue.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Council supported approximately 154 research projects in 1987-88 and contributed $2.4m in financial assistance to these projects. The percentage cut-ups of the particular funding were about 37 per cent for horticulture; 22 per cent for field crops; 11 1/2 per cent for animal industries; 11 per cent for vegetable crops; 7 1/2 per cent for forestry farm trees and 10 1/2 per cent for multi-industry and national interests. The projects were so diverse that one could find research going into such things as investigation in relation to commercial snail farming and marketing of snails in Australia as food, and deer farming. One project that particularly caught my eye was that being undertaken by the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture to develop a vaccine against toxoplasma abortion in goats. That might sound very insignificant, and a very small matter, but last year when I had the pleasure and honour of being part of a parliamentary delegation to, among other places, Sabah. I was shocked and staggered to witness, along with one of my colleagues from the other place, Mr Alasdair Webster, the result of toxoplasma abortion in goats caused by stress in a shipload of goats sent from Wyndham in Western Australia to Sabah. The feral goat industry has just started in Australia and has great potential. Unfortunately, because of stress caused by a number of things a lot of these pregnant goats aborted on the trip or on arrival in Sabah. Consequently, out of a shipment of 400 goats nearly 100 died. It was rather a sad sight to see these poor animals aborting young goats here, there and everywhere. I am pleased to see that some research is going into trying to develop a vaccine to contain this particular malfunction which is jeopardising what I see as potentially a very important export industry for Australia.

       Many other things are mentioned in the report; for instance, rust resistance in triticale, which would please Senator Brownhill. There are hundreds of other matters.

        —I would like to support Senator Calvert's motion that the Senate take note of this paper. Of all the research being done at the moment by the Australian Special Rural Research Council, a very important project is Farmsafe 88. I attended the Armidale three-day seminar of Farmsafe, which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, opened. I stress the importance to the rural communities of the question of safety and occupational health. Action in this area probably has been sadly lacking over the years. Honourable senators are aware that a Senate committee is now inquiring into the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals.

       Senator Calvert has already mentioned the debate that was held in the Senate earlier this afternoon regarding the lack of funding for research. This flows through to all avenues of research in Australia, especially in the primary industries. The present Government, and indeed future governments, will have to ensure that, if Australia is to remain the primary industry producer generating income for Australia, we must continue to put money into research. I commend this report to the Senate and I note the points made by Senator Calvert. I particularly note the research that has been carried out into national oat rust control, and also assessment of loss in grain yield resulting from hail damage to sorghum at various growth stages. As a sorghum grower and also a grower of other crops, I know that the comments in this report will be very helpful to people in the agricultural communities.

       The Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account annual report, which was tabled in the Senate today, contains a set of accounts which was certified by the Minister's delegate on 3 November 1988. That was a long time ago. The auditor's statement is dated September 1988; yet, for some extraordinary reason, this report is being submitted to the Senate in May 1989. The letter from the advisory committee to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) was not signed until 2 February 1989. This chamber has every reason to ask why this report, which was prepared and audited before the Senate rose last year, has taken until May to be tabled. It seems to me to be improper that a publication such as this, which involves significantly controversial matters, should have been kept from public scrutiny for this time.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is significant that this annual report has been tabled in the Senate today, too late to be discussed by the Senate Estimates Committee. Surely the Senate is entitled to express grave concern that the very serious matters raised in this annual report were not available to senators when they had the opportunity to examine officers of the Department. It seems to me to be a disgrace that that is so. What happened was that one of my senatorial colleagues had the opportunity to see a copy of this report after the Senate Estimates Committee had inquired into the Aboriginal Affairs Department, and he put questions on notice relating to these figures. I understand that he has received some replies to those questions on notice.
      </para>
      <para>
       To indicate to the Senate the significant nature of the controversial matters, I submit that we have here in this Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account revenue which comes from royalties paid by mining companies, theoretically for the benefit of the Aboriginal people, amounting to $21.9m, of which some $12m has gone in payments to land councils for administrative expenses. More than half the total of the funds available for the benefit of the Aboriginal people has gone to the administrative expenses of two land councils, the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. This has occurred despite the fact that the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account administrative expenses are entirely paid by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. This state of affairs is extraordinary. In fact, only $9.7m out of $21.7m was available to be distributed to the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council for the benefit of Aboriginal people and in the payment of general grants.
      </para>
      <para>
       I find it incredible that this kind of administrative cost can have been incurred, particularly as it involves an increase of over a third in administrative costs in the 12 months ending last June, for which we have only just received the report. There has been this huge increase in administrative costs, and there has been not one ounce of explanation in this tawdry, tatty, late report as to where the money was spent. The late production of this report to this chamber is an utter disgrace. The Government has an obligation to ensure that reports of this nature are available to senators before they are involved in Senate Estimates committee hearings.

      <para>
       The report of the Automotive Industry Authority on the state of the automotive industry in 1988 in many respects is a report looking to the future. It is a compliment to some of the achievements that have taken place during the past 12 months, some of which I shall detail. For example, there has been a 13 per cent increase in domestic sales of passenger motor vehicles to 410,473 vehicles. There has been an increase in domestic production of 4 per cent. There has been a stabilising of employment in the industry at around 58,000 people, and an aggregation of profits to a figure of $174m for passenger motor vehicle operations in the plan producer sector. Furthermore, there has been an increase in aggregate profits of the specialist component producer sector during 1987-88.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Senate and indeed the community will be aware that in recent years the Australian motor vehicle industry has been through some hard and stringent times. In these few remarks I wish to pay compliment to the industry on its achievements to date. I also wish to sound a warning note relating to threats which are on the horizon and which may affect the good operations of the industry in the years to come.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer specifically to a problem that has arisen in my home State of Western Australia in recent months relating to the importation of allegedly cheap second-hand Japanese vehicles. This matter must be addressed not only by the Federal Government but also by the Government of Western Australia. Since December last year, a total of 4,170 used cars was imported. I take that information from an advertisement which appeared in the West Australian newspaper on Thursday last week. I also have before me an article in the Daily News, another Western Australian newspaper, which appeared on Friday of last week and which contains the information that a further 2,000 second-hand vehicles will be on their way to Perth in the coming month. That is over 6,000 vehicles in a six-month period which, aggregated over a 12-month period, would be 12,000 vehicles. That is but the tip of the iceberg, as the Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Australian Automobile Dealers Association, which represent the Australian car industry, have stated. Dealers are obviously suffering because of increased competition from a sector of an industry that does not have to comply with all the rules that govern the importation of new vehicles into Australia. There are two separate standards: one which governs the importation of new vehicles and another which governs the importation of second-hand vehicles. It would appear that only one State is allowing the latter to come in.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the article in the West Australian which I mentioned previously, it was stated that all States except Western Australia had imported only 52 cars so far this year and that the figure for Western Australia was 4,170. As I said before, it is something to which we at a national level and those at the State level have to give real attention because it could be a real threat to the Australian automobile industry and the possible successful completion of this very innovative plan for that industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Threats and counter-threats have been waved around among the different operators involved in the sale of motor vehicles in Western Australia. It has been reported to me that one of the manufacturers of vehicles in Australia has said that if something is not done very soon it will start importing cheap second-hand Japanese vehicles. When the manufacturers start that in a big way they will show the present importers what competition is really like. We all have to be aware of the importance of this sector to the economy. I think that together we can address the problem and impose equal standards on new car importers and to second-hand importers. Let nobody miss out on what other sectors are able to take advantage of.

        —I rise also to make a few remarks on the very important report on the state of the automotive industry and the work that goes on behind it in the automotive industry. In essence, during the 1980s we have seen two trends in the automotive industry. The first trend was in sales, 1985 being the best year ever for the sale of motor vehicles of all types. This was the year in which the best sales of imported as well as locally produced models took place. The reasons for peak sales in 1985 and declining sales in 1986 and 1987 are complex. One principal reason was the mandatory introduction of lead free petrol models in 1986. Questions were raised about the performance of such vehicles and about additional costs involved in their purchase. The decline in the value of the Australian dollar in the years 1985 and 1986 made not only imported models, but also local models that involved component sources overseas, more expensive.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is good to see in the report that during 1988 the sales curve had turned again and sales increases were taking place. From my own inquiries it would appear that this trend has continued during 1989. Consequently, the industry is again seeing healthy sales figures and profitability. Whilst sales in 1988 were obviously better, 1988 saw the progress that has been made in the industry by the Government's car plan. Before the Button plan was put in place, the future of the automotive industry was looking bleak. Unable to cope with the imported units, protected by huge tariffs and producing models that were perceived by much of the local market to be inferior, the automotive industry in Australia prior to 1984 looked decidedly unhealthy. Since the inception of the plan we have seen the rationalisation of much of the industry. We have also seen cooperation between vehicle builders on specific models.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most pleasing, however, is that we now see that Australian automotive industries are back in the export business. Recently Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd in my State has announced extensive export plans to sell units in Japan. The year 1988 was the mid-point in the Government's car plan and, despite all the doubts raised in 1984 about the plan not being viable, it is obviously working on target. The motor vehicle industry in Australia now has a more profitable and stable future to look forward to. I commend the report to the Senate.

        The report of the inquiry into the death of Christine Lesley Ann Jones by Commissioner O'Dea, the Royal Commissioner looking into Aboriginal deaths in custody, tells us of a tragic story of neglect concerning Christine Jones, not only by her parents in her early childhood but also by the community. She was born on 27 October 1958 and application was made under the provisions of the Child Welfare Act and by order of the Children's Court at Carnarvon in Western Australia in 1964, when Christine was declared a neglected child and was committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department until she was 18 years of age. It is a very pathetic story.
       </para>
       <para>
        During her adolescence she became an alcoholic and was convicted for drink-related offences. She had no income because she was unemployed and had no social security because she had never been taught how to apply for the dole. She died in custody on 18 October 1980 and, as we often find with coronial inquiries, different accounts were given. The post-mortem alcohol content of Christine Jones's blood was recorded as 0.25 per cent, yet there were differing accounts of her condition. She was described by various officers as being slightly affected by alcohol; as having been drinking but showing no signs of being drunk; as having had a little to drink; as being moderately affected by alcohol, and as being noisy, abusive and affected by alcohol, but not drunk.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is not time to draw the Senate's attention to the whole of this report but I would like to draw attention to the following statement in the report by Commissioner O'Dea:
       </para>
       <para>
        The treatment of persons arrested for drunkenness has also changed. I am told persons are now released as soon as they are considered to be in a condition which will enable them to care for themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        But people are most at risk during the early stages of drunkenness because it is at that stage that they are least able to care for themselves. It is also at that stage that other conditions such as cerebral haemorrhage or a heart attack can be hidden from the people who are looking after the person in custody.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commissioner O'Dea recommends that the feasibility of compulsory breath testing should be looked at. This may have been opposed by police in lockups as being a further erosion of civil liberties, but as we have compulsory breath testing on the road these days that does not seem to be much of a point. He also recommends that an independent legal practitioner should be appointed to assist the coroner in cases in a death in custody, and that certainly would be approved of by a great many people who have some doubts as to the independence of our coronial inquiries. He further recommends that police officers or other persons looking after people in lockups should have some training in the assessment and supervision of prisoners. He also recommends that they should take all reasonable steps to notify relatives, friends or the Aboriginal Legal Service in the case of the imprisonment of an Aboriginal person. Certainly, had the parents been notified in the case of the death of Stephen Wardle in the police lock-up in Perth, I am absolutely sure that would have been one less death in custody.

       The three papers are records of the sixth, seventh and eighth meetings of the Tasmanian World Heritage Area Council. I am pleased to see that Senator Tate is in the chamber as he is a member of that Council. I point out that for all the huffing and puffing about World Heritage areas in Tasmania that has been going on for quite some time now-with an election coming up a lot of extravagant claims have been made by some of the independent candidates about what should be done with the environment-the Tasmanian State Government and the Federal Government are agreeing on matters that are quite significant in terms of enabling the people of Tasmania to involve themselves in the environment in a much more meaningful way. I draw attention to the funding of the Cradle Mountain huts, which are probably some of our most significant environment centres. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth is providing something like $1.2m towards that project which is one of the offshoots of the World Heritage agreement between Tasmania and the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       A matter of concern to me was raised in the seventh meeting in June last year. I refer to the erosion of the banks of the Gordon River. It is stated in the paper that Senator Richardson understood that there had been no major erosion problems over the past year and that this was due to restrictions on the speed of tourist vessels and the low rainfall for the period. The ministerial council agreed that the Commonwealth and State would share monitoring of the bank erosion for a further complete season. That was back in June 1988. We are now approaching June 1989. The matter has been the subject of much publicity in Tasmania and has caused quite some concern to environmentalists and tourist operators alike. I would hope that the Heritage Area Council will put more time and effort into trying to solve the problem.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The year 1988 was an extremely busy one for the Committee which met on 69 occasions, tabled 15 reports and recommended the construction of projects estimated to cost just over $1 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee welcomes a number of legislative amendments introduced during the year which altered the Public Works Committee Act (PWC) in the following ways:
       </para>
       <para>
        to remove ambiguity the definition of the terms `work' and `public work' will now provide that a `work' means an architectural or engineering work and specifically excludes intangible things, movable works and engineering equipment not being integral components of a work;
       </para>
       <para>
        to ensure that works financed by deferred payment or similar arrangements are referable to the Committee;
       </para>
       <para>
        to facilitate consideration of new types of projects and delivery systems, types of works can be declared to be works or public works by regulation. Similarly, types of works can be declared not to be works or public works. From the Committee's viewpoint an attractive feature of this amendment is that it provides for consultation with the Committee prior to regulations being made;
       </para>
       <para>
        the amendments will allow works to be referred to the Committee at an earlier stage than has been possible in the past. This will allow works to be referred where, because of their nature, only limited design work can be completed before Committee consideration is necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee is satisfied that the changes will facilitate its operations and activities and wishes to record its appreciation to the Hon. Stewart West, Minister for Administrative Services, for making officers of his Department of Administrative Services available to brief it on the proposed changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one matter on which I wish to comment and one which is of considerable concern to the Committee and I refer to the exemption from the PWC Act in August 1988 of the following government business enterprises:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Postal Commission;
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSSAT Pty Limited;

       <para>
        Overseas Telecommunications Com- mission;
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Telecommunications Com- mission.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the Committee does not deny the right of the Government to make such a decision, it is extremely concerned that there was no opportunity for it to put its case before a decision was made. The Committee made its views known to the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the Hon. Gareth Evans.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is with some surprise then that I have to inform the Senate that a similar situation may occur should a proposal to exempt the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation be approved by Cabinet without any prior discussion with the Committee. This matter which has been before the structural adjustment committee will shortly go before Cabinet, again without any discussion by the Minister with the PWC. This is a matter on which the Committee feels very strongly as it believes that the principle of legislative scrutiny of the executive is being eroded by such actions. I also doubt whether in fact these authorities are eligible for exemption under the terms of the PWC Act and the Committee will be seeking a legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department on the matter.

        The purpose of this Bill is to establish the Australian National Maritime Museum as an independent statutory authority. The Government considers that the museum should have an independent role similar to other national collecting institutions, which will provide it with a permanent and distinctive presence in the community. The museum's statutory status will also strengthen its ability to seek sponsorship from the corporate sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many honourable senators will have already noticed that the museum's prominent building, with its billowing sail roofline, is taking shape on its prime site at the entrance to Darling Harbour. In November 1985, the then Government agreed to provide $30m to enable the construction of the building for the Australian National Maritime Museum. The cost of establishing and installing the exhibitions, including the fit-out of the building, will be $9.5m. Most of this expenditure will be incurred in 1989-90. The site at Darling Harbour, which provides a superb maritime environment for the museum, was provided by the New South Wales Government. It was hoped that the museum would open during the Bicentenary. However, it is now anticipated that the museum will open its doors to the public during the second half of 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The need for an Australian National Maritime Museum, reflecting the significance of maritime activity in the history and cultural life of Australians, was recognised over a decade ago in the 1975 Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections, better known as the Pigott report. This Government has reaffirmed the need for an institution to provide Australians with a central and comprehensive record of their past and present dependence on the sea. The Australian National Maritime Museum will provide a national focus for our maritime history and an insight for its domestic and international visitors into a major facet of our cultural heritage tradition, until now little acknowledged.
       </para>
       <para>
        An earlier Bill to establish the museum was introduced in Parliament in 1986, but lapsed owing to the 1987 Federal elections. Subsequently, the Government reviewed its involvement in the development of Commonwealth museums and similar collecting and exhibiting institutions and this has further delayed consideration of this matter. The Government announced in the 1988-89 Budget context that the Australian National Maritime Museum should be primarily an exhibition oriented institution and provided capital and recurrent financial resources to reflect this decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The functions of the museum will be to exhibit, in cooperation with other public and private institutions, maritime historical material included in the national maritime collection or objects on loan to it. The museum will also be able to conduct, and assist with research and disseminate information relating to Australian maritime history and also the functions of the museum. Most importantly the museum will have a national role and will not compete with State or Territory institutions. Rather it will complement their collections and already strong co-operative links are being forged between the national, State and regional maritime museums.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill empowers the museum to develop a collection of maritime historical material known as the National Maritime Collection. The Museum Council will determine the material to be included in this collection, based upon criteria and guidelines approved by the Minister. The museum will also be able to purchase historical and other relevant material, accept gifts and bequests and acquire and operate vessels of historical interest and significance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maritime historical material is defined in the Bill to mean material relating to Australian maritime history and archaeology which includes the natural history of Australia, the history of the interaction of human beings with the Australian marine environment and the history of sea travel for every purpose. The reference to Australian marine environment includes the sea above the continental shelf and the subsoil of the continental shelf adjacent to the Australian coast. It also includes the environment of the lakes, rivers and internal waters of Australia. This allows the museum effectively to acquire any material of a maritime nature provided it has a connection with Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will apply not only to the Australian mainland but to its external territories, past and present. However, material of significance from Australian external territories in the Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans and Antarctica will be transferred to the National Maritime Collection only after consultation by my Department and the museum with the local governing body of the relevant territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much of Australia's historical material reflecting the involvement of its people with the sea has never been exhibited on a large scale. The Government intends that the displays will be exciting and stimulating-they will not be a mere collection of inanimate objects. On opening it is expected that there will be six major exhibition themes, namely: Finding Australia; Travellers-the Long Sea Voyage; Commerce-the Working Sea; Navy-from Bluejackets to Battleships; Leisure-Sun, Surf, Sail; and Australia-USA-Linked by the Sea. The Australia-United States of America gallery will be a permanent gallery funded as a Bicentennial gift from the United States, to commemorate over two centuries of maritime contact between the two countries. Another gallery will be used for temporary and travelling exhibitions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The museum's fleet, which will be a major attraction, will be moored at the two finger-wharves alongside the museum and will complement the indoor exhibitions. Some of the most notable vessels in the fleet include the Akarana, an 1888 gaff-rigged racing cutter which was a Bicentennial gift from New Zealand; the Kathleen Gillett, a veteran of the first Sydney-Hobart yacht race and Norway's Bicentennial gift; the John Louis, a sturdy pearling lugger from Western Australia and three vessels representing the Navy. Some of these ships are on loan from our other national collecting institutions. One very important vessel that will not be at the wharves is Australia's best-known yacht Australia II. However, it will dominate the museum's tall gallery.
       </para>
       <para>
        In keeping with its primary role as an exhibition oriented institution, the museum will be a place of education, participation and enjoyment-in short, a dynamic institution. Indeed, one of the refreshing features of the museum will be its acknowledgment of children as an important part of the visiting public. A special discovery room will provide a unique attraction for the youngest visitors. In addition, there will be an education centre located within the museum complex for use by groups which visit the museum as part of the formal education programs offered by the museum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The museum will have an exciting calendar of indoor and outdoor entertainments throughout the year. One of the museum's biggest attractions will be the floating exhibits about which I spoke earlier. Visitors may expect to board some of the vessels to find costumed role players, cooking demonstrations in the galleys or demonstrations of mast climbing or sail furling.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the museum's management. A Museum Council is to be established by this Bill which will ensure the proper and efficient management of the museum and determine its policy, subject to ministerial direction. The Council will give directions to the director of the museum with regard to the management of the affairs of the museum. The Council will consist of a chairperson, a director and no fewer than seven nor more than 10 members appointed by the Governor-General. An appointed member will possess knowledge and experience relating to Australian maritime history or other areas of knowledge relevant to the affairs of the museum. The chairperson and other members are appointed on a part-time basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        The day-to-day management of the museum will be conducted by a director who shall be appointed for a period of up to seven years. The director shall have all the powers of a secretary to a department in relation to the staff of the museum who will be employed under the Public Service Act 1922.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the museum will be funded through the annual budgetary process, the Bill also provides for the establishment of a national maritime museum fund. Money paid into the fund will include gifts and bequests or money received from the disposal of property given to the museum, other than on trust. Money from the fund will be spent in accordance with the functions of the museum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The museum is being encouraged by the Government to adopt an entrepreneurial outlook in organising its activities. The Bill empowers the museum to develop sponsorship proposals and to carry out a broad range of commercial activities. Indeed, the museum has embarked already on an active program of seeking corporate support and raising the museum's public profile. Situated as it is on a prime site in Darling Harbour, the museum will not only benefit from this particular urban renewal development but will also attract substantial numbers of tourists in its own right.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is estimated that based on 1988-89 prices the annual ongoing running costs of the museum will be in the order of $6.823m and that the cost of preserving, documenting and building the collection will be of the order of $854,000 per annum. The increased costs associated with the museum becoming a statutory authority are expected to be offset by its ability to generate revenue through sponsorship and commercial activities, such as charging an admission fee. In addition, part of its building will be leased for use as a restaurant to serve its patrons and as a shop for those visitors who wish to purchase posters, books and a range of quality goods and souvenirs to remind them of their visit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The museum is required by this Bill to prepare annual estimates of expenditure. The Council shall be responsible for the preparation of strategic plans, on a three year cycle, as well as annual operational plans. The museum shall be subject to audit by the Auditor-General and will be obliged to prepare an annual report by virtue of being subject to certain provisions of the Audit Act 1901.
       </para>
       <para>
        The establishment of the Australian National Maritime Museum by this Bill is an example of the Government's commitment to the preservation and display of Australia's heritage. The museum will become one of our most important national cultural institutions as well as a centre of excellence in communicating our national maritime heritage. The museum will be recognised as a place where the richness and diversity of our past and present achievements as a maritime nation are documented and can be experienced. It will not restrict its displays to the past history of Australia as a maritime nation; it will also focus on our contemporary achievements. The spacious forecourt, which opens onto a dramatic view of the city skyline, has been named the Ben Lexcen Walk in honour of the man who made maritime history by designing the Australian winner of the America's Cup. Significant maritime achievements of all Australians will be well documented in the collection.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this new national museum will become a proud achievement with a strong commitment to educating and entertaining all of its visitors. I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

        This matter is indeed a matter or urgency and I do not move for the suspension of Standing Orders lightly. We are talking about the process of democracy, how it works and how we introduce our legislative systems. In particular we are talking about the legislative system introduced into this Parliament and used by the Australian capital Territory (ACT) in its recent election. I am moving for the suspension of Standing Orders because this matter must be regarded as urgent because, although the election took place on 4 March, we still do not have a result. The motion that I hope to be able to move tonight deals with that situation. If Standing Orders are suspended I will also be moving to amend my motion by deleting paragraph (b). That will leave paragraphs (a), (c) and (d). As the Senate needs to be convinced during this debate on the suspension of Standing Orders that the matter is urgent, I shall explain why each of those three paragraphs has a great deal of urgency as far as the system of democracy is concerned.

In order that the urgency of the situation may be appreciated by honourable senators present, I must allude to the content of the letters mentioned in my motion as they have not been tabled in the Senate. In referring to the letter written on 31 October 1988 by the Australian Electoral Commissioner for the attention of Mr Gary Whitley, who was the Associate Secretary of the central office of the ACT Administration, we find that the Commissioner expresses a broad concern which goes to the root of the electoral system then proposed for the ACT. This matter is urgent because this letter was written before we debated that system in the Senate. It is urgent and a matter of grave importance that honourable senators appreciate that this advice was available before we debated these matters in the Senate.

I think Senator Jenkins should explain why that is urgent. I cannot see any urgency about the Senate noting a matter that has already been dealt with.

I give an example. The Commissioner has written in his letter that the method of voting proposed under a consolidated d'Hondt system defies any simple and sensible explanation and that the instructions to voters to appear on the ballot paper be prescribed either in the Act, as is the case with the Commonwealth ballot paper, or in the regulations.

It is very important that the system voted in by this Parliament should be examined very closely by this Committee.

If that is not enough to convince honourable senators, another reason is that today, when this matter was under discussion, a proposition was put to the Australian Democrats that we debate Senator Jenkins's and Senator Hill's motions con-jointly tomorrow morning and make a decision. What better offer could there be than to have such a debate on radio day on Wednesday morning? Senator Jenkins wants to pre-empt Senator Hill's motion and says the matter is urgent. She gave notice of her motion on 11 April. What has happened between 11 April and 2 May to suddenly make it urgent? Senator Jenkins even said in her notice of motion that it would not be considered for several sitting days. How can she have the gall to argue that this matter is urgent?

The Australian Democrats would have more credibility if it got more than 1.6 per cent of the vote. Is the urgency here sitting two rows away? Is Senator Jenkins trying to bump up her party's vote from 1.6 per cent to 33 per cent so that Senator Norm Sanders can return to the ACT? No electoral system will get the Australian Democrats elected with 1.6 per cent of the vote. This matter is urgent now because two years ago the Democrats did everything they could to sabotage self-government in this country.

         —I take that point, Mr Deputy President, because I was stretching my credibility. This matter is supposed to be urgent tonight because two years ago the Democrats refused 17 single member electorates, nine single member electorates and eight with proportional representation, for the sole reason that they would not hold the balance of power. This comes down to basic, hard, opportunistic politics which the Democrats always deny they have and always exhibit in this chamber. What is being displayed here tonight is opportunism of the crudest order so that the Democrats can appear in the Canberra Times tomorrow as heroes and deprive Senator Hill of all his glory. Minister West was going to refer this general question to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, but when he heard that the august Senate was going to consider it he said, `Leave it to them, and let them send the reference off'. We will take great pleasure in dealing with Senator Hill's motion tomorrow and seeing Senator Jenkins's motion go to the bottom of the Notice Paper.

       <para>
        To make a serious point, there have been more suspensions of Standing Orders relating to notices of motion in the last year than in probably the last 50 years of this Senate. This is the new way for the Opposition to have the debates it wants. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats had better think about whether that is healthy in the long run. It is not as bad as the terrible prospect of having a matter of public importance every day and have 30 submitted. Some issues need to be looked at, but there is no urgency in this motion. It was placed on the Notice Paper on 11 April and has hung around until now. Why try to debate it at 9.30 at night? We have made the offer to allow it to be debated jointly with Senator Hill's motion tomorrow morning. The Australian Democrats have not accepted that offer, apparently because they want to embarrass the Government. Gee, we are embarrassed!

It does so not only for the reason that was mentioned in passing by my colleague Senator Puplick, which is that the next election is not due for four years-unless the Australian Democrats know something which we do not, and I hope that is not correct. There is also a problem which Senator Jenkins would recognise had she spoken to the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, as I have. When I said that we wished to refer the matter of the ACT election to him, he indicated to me that although his Committee would have no choice but to accept the reference, it already has three matters before it which it was given in 1988 and therefore it will be some time before it is able to address this question.

       <para>
        There are serious issues to be put to that Committee, and not only in the very limited form in which Senator Jenkins wishes to put them, solely related to the d'Hondt system. There are also very serious questions on the wider issues as to how this count took place, how the electoral process took place and ways in which the system can be improved to avoid-I hesitate to use this expression-the farcical situation which seems to have developed since the last election.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is certainly no urgency for this to be dealt with tonight. With great respect to Senator Jenkins, when it is debated in conjunction with our motion, which will allow the wider issues to be put before the Committee, it will be in better shape for the Committee to address the questions that it should address.

       <para>
        This Bill is an omnibus Bill for legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. Its introduction will facilitate the passage of amendments to existing legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill contains minor administrative amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 and the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Act 1964 and repeals the redundant Derby Jetty Agreement Act 1962, Oil Companies (Stock Loss Reimbursement) Act 1986, Pipeline Construction (Dalton to Canberra) Act 1980, Pipeline Construction (Young to Wagga Wagga) Act 1980, South Australia Grant (Fruit Canneries) Act 1971, States Grants (Fruit-growing Reconstruction) Acts of 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976, Victoria Grant (Shepparton Preserving Company Limited) Act 1971 and Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund (Disposal) Act 1962. These amendments will be self evident and are sufficiently explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill. I propose to confine my comments to addressing the more significant changes which will be made by the Bill.

        Plant Variety Rights Act 1987
       </para>
       <para>
        Sections 12 and 38 of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 will be amended to give the grantee of Plant Variety Rights the right to produce (or licence others to produce) plants or reproductive material of the protected variety for the commercial production of fruit, flowers or other products of the variety.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present Act does not recognise the practical difference between propagation from seed and the much more rapid process of asexual reproduction. It allows a person to buy a small number of protected plants from the breeder and in a short time asexually propagate a commercial planting. If only the product such as fruit and cut flowers are sold, and not the plants or reproductive material, the Act is not infringed and the grower rather than the breeder of the new variety receives the commercial gain.
       </para>
       <para>
        The objective of the Act is to stimulate plant breeding by giving sole rights to the breeder for a period of 20 years. This was not happening under the present provisions.

        Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation
       </para>
       <para>
        The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Exploration Permit Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Pipeline Licence Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Production Licence Fees) Act 1967, Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967, and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Retention Lease Fees) Act 1985 contain provisions for the charging of fees for applications and annual rentals for titles granted by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and for registration of dealings affecting, and transfers of, titles.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendments in this Bill will enable the determination of the level of application and rental fees, minimum registration fees and securities required under the legislation, by regulation rather than by amending the principal Act. This will enable the timely adjustment of these fees and securities so that they more closely reflect actual administrative costs. All fees collected in respect of the State and Northern Territory adjacent areas are paid to the States/Northern Territory in recognition of the costs incurred in administering day-to-day petroleum activities in these areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        An amendment will also abolish the provision for refunds of application fees to unsuccessful applicants for titles under the legislation. Experience with administering the legislation has shown that costs of assessing applications are the major costs involved in the application process and the abolition of refunds will enable application fees to reflect actual administrative costs incurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another amendment will enable a fee to be charged for an application for a special prospecting authority. Again this change will more closely align fees with administrative costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the existing legislation, renewals of titles can only be granted to the applicant for the renewal. In such cases it has been necessary to postpone approval and registration of a transfer until after the renewal has been granted. An amendment will enable the timely approval and registration of transfers which otherwise would be held up until a renewal of a title is granted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Seismic surveys and other types of surveys undertaken by holders of special prospecting authorities over vacant acreage are an important factor in stimulating interest in offshore petroleum exploration and competition in bidding for exploration acreage. An amendment will facilitate such activities by enabling holders of special prospecting authorities to apply for an access authority to adjoining title areas in order to link new surveys with existing surveys or wells. In such cases the Designated Authority will be expected to take account of the views of affected titleholders before granting an access authority. Holders of special prospecting authorities will be expected to comply with any special conditions applying to the area covered by the access authority and not interfere with the activities of titleholders. At present, holders of special prospecting authorities must rely on an existing titleholder to apply on their behalf for approval to undertake the survey in the title area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another amendment will facilitate the provision of access authorities to enable access to adjoining acreage which is administered by a different State or Territory. The amendment will enable a titleholder, or holder of a special prospecting authority, to apply to the relevant Designated Authority for an access authority in an adjoining adjacent area thus ensuring that a titleholder only has to seek approval from one Designated Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the amendment will ensure that the consent of the Designated Authority for the adjoining adjacent area is gained prior to the granting of the access authority. The holders of such authorities will be expected to comply with any special conditions applying to the area covered by the access authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The repeal of section 57 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act will remove the requirement to undertake a minimum amount of work or produce an equivalent value of petroleum, in production licence areas. This will enable production licence holders to determine their own investment priorities. However, the Government still has powers under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act to require a discovery to be developed at specific production rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments will have no net impact on the Commonwealth budgetary position as any increased revenue from fees will be offset by payments of those increased fees to the State/Northern Territory. Those payments will assist the States and the Northern Territory in recovering costs they incur on behalf of the Commonwealth in the administration of offshore petroleum activities in adjacent areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) legislation have been the subject of consultation with the States, the Northern Territory and the industry and have general support. They are essential to the effective and efficient administration of the Commonwealth's offshore petroleum legislation.

        Tobacco Marketing Act 1965
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal to change the name of the Australian Tobacco Board to the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee follows a review of the Board carried out in conjunction with Government consideration of the assistance arrangements to apply to the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation to give effect to the assistance arrangements announced by the Government on 19 November 1988 will be introduced separately. This Bill is proposed to give effect to the name change foreshadowed in that announcement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Tobacco Board, established by the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965, comprises representatives of tobacco growers, manufacturers, the Commonwealth and the three States in which tobacco is grown. The Board's principal task is to administer the tobacco industry stabilisation plan which is primarily directed at increasing the competitiveness of the tobacco leaf growing industry. The plan, which was recently extended to 1993, is the final in a series of five year plans which commenced in 1965.
       </para>
       <para>
        In pursuing stabilisation plan objectives, the Board makes recommendations to Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for agriculture on annual determinations of tobacco leaf prices and quotas. The Board acts largely as a negotiating forum and has no role in the receival, handling or sale of tobacco leaf. The latter functions are carried out by statutory leaf marketing boards in the tobacco growing States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The name change proposed reflects the Board's major function of advising Ministers on prices and quotas. It also recognises that its functions differ from those of the main body of statutory marketing authorities within the primary industry portfolio to which recent major policy and legislative reforms were directed. The Bill is confined therefore to giving effect to the name change and a minor operational amendment made necessary by the abolition of the Public Service Board.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Australian Tobacco Board is named in complementary State legislation, the name change will not take effect for six months so that States may legislate for a common date of effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        None of the proposed amendments have any significant financial impact.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to honourable Senators, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

        (iv) whether the proposal in proposed subsection 135zzs (3) of the Bill for a statutory declaration entitling the purchaser of a blank audio tape to a refund of the royalty paid on that tape is the most effective means of effecting a refund or waiver of the royalty when the tape is not used for recording copyright material; and

         —When the debate on the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 and the Circuit Layouts Bill 1988 was adjourned on 12 April 1989 I had made a number of comments about the copyright legislation. I do not want to go over all the ground that I covered on that occasion. I will briefly indicate the matters I raised at the time. Firstly, I was concerned about the exceptional complexity of this legislation. Secondly, I was concerned about the lack of precision in advice from the Attorney-General's Department on a range of issues. Thirdly, I indicated that a number of initiatives in the Bill were supported by the Opposition because they reflected views which the Opposition had expressed in its published arts policy, namely, support for the levy on blank tapes, support for adherence to certain sections of the Rome Convention securing protection for performers and support for changes to the copyright law to allow works of dance choreography to be accorded copyright protection if they are recorded on video.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I had made some comments about the blank tape levy. I now wish to return to that matter. This Bill proposes the introduction of a levy on blank audio tapes which will be the subject of some further remarks by my colleague Senator Michael Baume. The purpose of this measure is not only to reward performers in an indirect fashion for the loss which they might suffer as a result of home taping but also to provide a source of revenue to help the Government finance a non-profit organisation to support Australian contemporary music development. The 15 per cent or so levy is to go towards funding the Australian Contemporary Music Development Company (ACMDC) to contribute to the promotion of Australian contemporary music.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contemporary music is an important industry in Australia. Australian bands of note, such as INXS, the Little River Band, AC DC, Air Supply and Men At Work are a significant economic factor in the arts scene and the music industry in Australia. For example, INXS, which is one of the primary bands operating in Australia, has estimated record sales grossing more than $150m. One could add to the list of bands I have already mentioned Crowded House, Midnight Oil and a number of other bands which make a significant contribution to the economic and cultural life of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently I corresponded with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins), in whose portfolio area a great deal of the support operations for Australian contemporary music falls, to try to get some definition of what exactly constitutes contemporary music-whether contemporary music is to be taken as synonymous with rock music. Contemporary music is, after all, written for theatre, for dance and for operatic performances. Contemporary music should not necessarily be regarded as being synonymous with rock music. On 21 March this year, in reply to some of my correspondence, the Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In planning for the establishment of the ACMDC the Government has placed a broad interpretation on the word `contemporary'. It is recognised that in many aspects of the music industry, for example, training, promotion and production, there are elements which are common to the various styles of music.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that is a proper attitude for the Government to have taken to the definition of contemporary music. Because of time constraints, although there is much that could be said about contemporary music in Australia, I will raise a number of other issues, some of which I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to reply to when he concludes the second reading debate. However, before I raise those matters I want to refer to the question of the protection of performers and the operation of the Rome Convention as it applies through this copyright legislation. In April 1985 the Copyright Law Review Committee issued its discussion paper on performers' protection. It set out there the terms and arrangements of the Rome Convention and it presented some quite significant arguments in favour of legislation to give effect to that Convention. I think they are well enough known for me not to have to rehearse them. I simply say that one of the difficulties which have arisen with this piece of legislation is the proposal to give it some retrospective operation in terms of the protection of performers' rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        Representations were made to the Government on that matter and I understand that the Government is to introduce an amendment to the legislation which will make the operation of performer's protection legislation prospective rather than retrospective. In that endeavour it will have the support of the Opposition. That is an amendment which we would have moved if the Government had not moved in that direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there are still a number of matters which arise in relation to things such as the definition of the term `performance'. Mr Deputy President, I shall indicate to you, to the Minister and to the officers present that, apart from the amendments which we have already described in broad outline in terms of Senator Hill's previous speech on this matter, we will also be seeking one further amendment dealing with the definition of `performance'-that is, to ensure that the legislation provides that it shall not be taken to be a performance where the undertaking recorded is a participation in a performance by a person or persons acting as a member or members of an audience. We believe that some representations have adequately been made out on that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the issue that I want to spend a few moments on in relation to general copyright issues is the copyright protection of Aboriginal works of art. Again, this is an extraordinarily complicated issue to come to grips with, as are all copyright matters. I appreciate that difficulties are found all round in the adjustment of issues of copyright. None of them presents more difficulty at the moment than looking at the protection of Aboriginal works of art. Mr Deputy President, as you would know with your interest in art and in art matters, one of the matters which have come to attention in recent years has been the unauthorised copying of original Aboriginal works of art-whether they are reproduced in designs on tee-shirts, tea-towels or souvenirs essentially related to the tourist trade without any proper appreciation of the concept of copyright protection and ownership accruing to the Aboriginal artist or group of artists.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, if we look at an article which appeared in the March 1989 newsletter of the National Association for the Visual Arts entitled `Issues in Copyright: ``Aboriginal wear'' ', we see that that article has raised a number of significant issues. The issue which perhaps is most central to trying to sort out some way through this labyrinth is the question of group ownership of art and, consequently, group ownership of a copyright. The article very rightly points out that European law, upon which our own copyright protection is founded, does not recognise group ownership of art. Copyright legislation in European law has a long history. In terms of actual statute law I think it is legislation which goes back to the reign of Queen Anne.
       </para>
       <para>
        At no stage has copyright ever been thought to have been vested in anything other than individuals. Clearly, that is not appropriate within the Australian context. Clearly, in terms of Aboriginal art, ownership of original works of art is very often believed to be vested not in the individual artist, the individual painter, or the individual craftsman but in a group-either a tribal group, a linguistic group or a kinship group. Customary law in Aboriginal communities recognises that sort of nature of ownership which is totally incompatible with the basis upon which copyright law has been drawn in this legislation and throughout history as far as European legislation is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, we have no specific amendments to offer at this stage on this matter. But we seek from the Government some comment from the responsible Minister as to whether the Government is interested in actively pursuing a greater degree of protection to be accorded to Aboriginal works of art and whether it believes it is possible to vest copyright ownership not in an individual but in some group or in some association of individuals. The coalition parties have stated in our own Aboriginal affairs policy that we are committed:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . to the conservation and preservation of Aboriginal heritage, including sacred sites, artefacts, traditions and art. We believe that they should be preserved as an integral element of our national cultural life.
       </para>
       <para>
        We go on in our policy with respect to Aboriginal art to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        We will encourage Aboriginal artists to develop their skills and to help train other members of their communities.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are committed to achieving a higher profile of traditional Aboriginal art and culture in the mainstream of Australian society.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that one of the ways in which that can be positively encouraged is to look at the copyright arrangements as they relate to questions of Aboriginal art and to the protection of Aboriginal art and Aboriginal design in the way in which I have just indicated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, because of time constraints, I do not want to continue that line of argument at any greater length. However, I want to come back to a number of previous comments which I have raised in relation to this legislation. I believe that Senator Hill, in his excellent speech setting out our view on this matter when the question was being debated last month, has made it clear that there are a number of aspects of this legislation which we regard as unsatisfactory. We have a long schedule of amendments which we propose to move and, undoubtedly, the committee stage of this debate will be extremely technical. Mr Deputy President, because of your interest and expertise in copyright matters you have participated in many discussions in the Opposition parties. As I have said, I do not propose to go over all of Senator Hill's amendments this evening.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I want to conclude by making a number of remarks which come back to my areas of responsibility in my capacity as the shadow Minister for the arts. I believe that the amendments, which seek to entrench in the legislation the blank tape royalty, are entirely proper and they certainly have the support of the Opposition. I believe that the protection extended to performers by adhering to certain parts of the Rome Convention are entirely proper. They are supported by the Opposition and we commend the Government for having picked up our suggestions that those should not be given any retrospective operation but should be made entirely prospective as far as that protection is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        We indicate that amendments which will be made to the schedule in the principal Act in order to allow works of choreography primarily to be recorded on video and accorded copyright in that status rather than relying upon the traditional choreological techniques which have been used to record dance notation which, of course, is an extremely specialised form of activity-there is a great shortage of choreologists in this country; people who are trained and competent at writing down dance notation in a form which would normally attract copyright protection-are also an excellent initiative and the Government and its advisers are to be commended in that respect. I have indicated the additional amendment which my colleague Senator Hill will be offering to cover the position where a person appears in a recorded fashion as a member of an audience rather than as a primary performer to ensure that that person is not caught up in the provisions which define what constitutes a recording under this piece of legislation. I indicate the support which the Opposition has been happy to extend to the Government over a prolonged period for its initiatives in relation to the development of contemporary music in Australia. The Opposition, of course, is anxious to see this piece of legislation passed. We are anxious to press our amendments and I expect a quite vigorous and interesting committee debate to take place on this piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish simply to indicate the support we have for the general thrust of this legislation. I make one final appeal, however, to the Government, which I think it will eventually have to take on board-or we will when we are in government-namely, that this legislation is clearly in need of very substantial revision, clarification and elucidation. When a piece of legislation has a section, if my memory serves me correctly, 135zzzb, it is absolutely ridiculous to expect that anybody could follow it coherently.

         —I rise to support Senator Puplick in supporting the thrust of the Government's proposed amendments to the Copyright Act, a monumental Act which certainly needs fixing up, as Senator Puplick has said. The amendments are designed to put a royalty on blank recording tape used for home audio taping; to protect performers from unauthorised recording or broadcasting of their live performances; to enable educational institutions to videotape television programs; to streamline the existing licences to educational institutions to photocopy; to enable institutions assisting the handicapped to make talking books and other useful materials; to clarify protection for industrial articles; and to streamline the statutory licence for record manufacture. As Senator Puplick has said, the Opposition supports the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 and the Circuit Layouts Bill 1988, but will move several amendments apart from the general second reading amendment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am glad-and Senator Puplick has expressed similar pleasure-that the Government has amended elements of the copyright legislation as it affects performers' protection. What interested me was that the Government asserted, or at least the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) asserted in his second reading speech, that he and the Government had consulted a whole range of people involved with this matter. It is clear that not enough consultation went on. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations (FACTS), the Advertising Federation of Australia (AFA) and the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA), all made representations to the Government and to the Opposition concerning those parts of the Bill dealing with performers' protection. It was only as a result of those submissions, as I understand it, and of the threat of the Opposition moving appropriate amendments, that the Government belatedly agreed-I say belatedly because it is now May and this matter was debated in the lower House in November last-to ensure that there was no retrospective element in the performers' protection area. This is of some significance.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is disappointing, as was pointed out by the Opposition in the other place at the time, that this matter of great importance was gagged through the House of Representatives, not allowing enough time not only to consider these matters but also to place an effective argument in front of the people. It has been left to the Senate to have, for the first time, a detailed and proper examination of matters which were prevented from being properly discussed by the imposition of a gag last November. The legislation is only now before the Senate and the Government is now presenting its own amendments to it. The word `sloppy' is probably appropriate in this matter as far as the Government is concerned. While, as I said, we totally support the thrust of the legislation, this is once again another example of how it could have been done better.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem which the Government has belatedly agreed to fix is so self-evident that it is extraordinary that it failed to do so. The retrospective nature of this Bill meant that it would apply 20 years back from when the Bill became law. Over that 20-year period, up to the date the Bill became law, producers, television stations and others might quite lawfully have made recordings, with or without the authority of the performers, specifically for replay. The usual practice, I understand, has been to pay performers a fee, including payment for future use and re-recording of their performances, without having specific approval for specific replay and specific re-recording. If that were so, and I understand it was, clearly it would have been a massive burden on those television stations, radio stations and so on, or on anyone else who wanted to replay something, to have to get the approval of every participant in that production. In the case of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, for example, this law would have required the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), when replaying a concert, to have the subsequent approval of every individual player in that orchestra, in that concert.
       </para>
       <para>
        It astounds me that such a nonsense was allowed by this Government. Not only was it gagged through the House of Representatives, but its clear impossibility was not recognised until six months afterwards. FACTS, AFA, and ARIA say that, if the Government had not responded, if that provision had become law, they simply would not have been prepared to broadcast any performance recorded in the last 20 years, which is the protection period, because they would not have been able to obtain the authority of some performers and may have had to pay excessive amounts to obtain the authority of others.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill, as it was drafted, and as it was rammed through the House of Representatives, would have caused practical problems for television stations and other recorders of performances. They would have been severe problems. Apart from anything else, the stations would have been liable for damages if they had re-recorded or rebroadcast a performance and if they had not obtained the authority of the performers. This authority had to be obtained from every performer. In the case of an orchestral concert recorded 15 years ago, it would be clearly ludicrous for one to try to find the approval of the second bassoon, who may well have transferred to the Stockholm Symphony Orchestra. The Government, having gagged the legislation through the lower House, is now prepared to accept that the Opposition and the other organisations with which it was supposed to have consulted were right all the time. I welcome that amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall now deal with the question of the blank tape royalty scheme for home taping. As Senator Puplick said, this in its general thrust is a proposal that exists in the coalition's arts policy. Naturally, we find no difficulty with the principle. In fact, in 1982, when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, I was preparing a Cabinet submission on exactly this matter. The Fraser Government then wanted to examine how this matter should be properly handled. I am sorry that our defeat in early 1983 meant that it has taken this Government seven years to bring this matter forward from the point that it had reached in late 1982. In a sense it is still half-baked. There are many matters in this proposal which, frankly, need a lot more examination and consideration than appear to have been given by the Government, despite the fact that it says that it has had detailed consideration with relevant industry participants.
       </para>
       <para>
        As everybody knows, home taping is widespread in the community. Under the present law it is a breach of copyright to tape anything at home-that is, anything to which copyright applies, which is a great bulk of material broadcast by the radio stations and other bodies from which the copy is taken. Clearly, this law is honoured more in the breach than in the observance. I know of no prosecutions in recent times-possibly there may have been-for home taping. Indeed, recently industries have been developing which depend on the capacity and willingness of people to break the law. The law has not been effective. As we tried in 1982, so the present Government has been trying to find a solution, recognising that home taping does go on and yet ensuring that the copyright owners are compensated for the use of their material.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth stressing that when one talks about copyright owners, it does not arise from some hate of those who do not deserve to get some recompense. It refers to people who by their talent have made something that is sufficiently worthwhile for someone else to have possession of. Surely if one's income depends on one's ability to create music either by writing or playing it, or by any of the other things that are copied, if one's livelihood depends on that, one has every right to require someone who seeks to acquire the proceeds of one's work to have to pay for it. I do not think anyone in this chamber would resile from that. It is proper and right that people who seek to have a song written by somebody in their possession should have to pay for that right. Home taping means that people have avoided that obligation to pay for what they have. In many instances this relates to Australian artists, the bulk of whom one could never accuse of being in the lap of luxury. There is no doubt that there is a need for equity and justice to be introduced in this area where in the past people have not been getting a fair go. Probably the bulk of Australians have been bludging on artists, musicians and so on by copying their works without having to pay them any fee for so doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Government scheme, the thrust of which the Opposition supports, consumers will be able to home tape published recordings directly or off-air for their private and domestic use without any infringement of copyright. I stress that that is for their private and domestic use-not for pirating purposes and then selling to someone else. In return for that right to avoid infringing copyright by home taping, owners of copyright in recordings will receive some payment through a royalty which will be levied on blank recording tape. This was roughly the scheme which we were examining in 1982 and which is in the coalition's arts policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister in the second reading speech said that this royalty will apply to audio tapes with playing times in excess of 30 minutes and will be calculated by reference to the length of the playing time. The actual amount of the royalty, the Minister said, will be determined by the Copyright Tribunal having regard to relevant matters such as, for example, the extent of home taping of eligible copyright material and the value to copyright owners of the material so taped.
       </para>
       <para>
        Frankly, that leaves many questions unanswered. How much is the royalty to be? I understand that it is to be set by a tribunal, but are we looking at enormous amounts? I have seen suggestions from people that the figure could be 20c to 50c. I have seen other suggestions from performing rights organisations which say they want the figure to be a dollar. This could be a substantial amount of money or a little. I was interested to see at the end of the second reading speech that the Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Copyright Amendment Bill will have a minimal impact on Commonwealth revenue and expenditure. There may be some increase in revenue due to a slight expansion of the sales tax base resulting from introduction of the blank tape royalty.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am accustomed to the Government not knowing the consequences of its legislation, but I would have thought it reasonable to have some kind of ball park figure about what sort of money is likely to be raised when we are introducing this kind of legislation. It is one of the matters that I would much rather see dealt with much more thoroughly than the Government has done.
       </para>
       <para>
        This matter has been opposed by the audio and video manufacturers and importers, and naturally so because they are the people who will have to pay the royalty. As the Minister pointed out, in the interests of minimising administrative costs of royalty collection, the duty to pay the royalty will be imposed on the first seller, that is the importers and manufacturers of blank tapes in Australia. Copyright owners, the Minister pointed out, will only be able to receive royalties where they are members of a single authorised collecting society, the rules of which have been approved by the Attorney-General. The collecting society will operate along similar lines to existing copyright collecting societies and will be responsible for the collection and distribution of the royalties. The Government therefore will not be involved in the running of the scheme and will not ultimately receive any part of the royalties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has pointed out that copyright owners who will benefit from the scheme will include composers, lyricists, authors, music publishing companies and record producers. The recording companies have agreed that a substantial share of the royalty will be passed on to performers under their contracts, which ordinarily would amount to about a third of the royalties collected by the society. The Minister has rightly said that the Government would be concerned if this share were eroded, and the Government will be monitoring this aspect closely.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many others matters relating to this legislation that I should like to deal with, and perhaps I should quickly address the fact that Australia would be ahead of many comparable countries in proceeding down this track, even though quite a number of European countries have already introduced, or are proposing to introduce, a blank tape royalty scheme, but others such as the United States do not have such a scheme. This creates problems when we are collecting royalties that relate to overseas artists' work. I think we have to resolve this a little better than we have, and I will have something to say about that when I deal with the Opposition's amendment. There is also a question of whether or not, instead of introducing this kind of royalty, one might not be better off banning equipment that does not incorporate some sort of anti-copy or spoiler device to prevent people engaging in home recording. This could be done rather than imposing some kind of tax on blank tapes. But the Government does not favour that and, I must say, neither does the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the clear problem also emerges that many blank tapes are not used for copying copyright material. The Government's proposal, with which we have no objection, includes specific provisions to enable users such as schools, institutions for the blind and so on to purchase tapes that are free from any royalty while those people who buy tapes on which the royalty has been paid-in other words, people who are not capable of getting the exemption-but do not intend to use them for copying copyright material will, under the Government scheme, be able to obtain a refund of the royalty by filling out a statutory declaration. We think that is a fairly messy way of going about things and believe that that matter should be much more closely examined.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Minister has said, the Government has also been concerned to prevent the outflow of funds from Australia to foreign countries which do not reciprocate with similar benefits to Australian copyright owners. In years past this chamber may have thought that it was a waste of time worrying about any prospect of our outflow being offset by inflows from Australian works being played overseas. But it is very heartening these days, largely through the modern pop music industry, that Australia has the capacity to earn very large sums from overseas if such a scheme existed in those countries which at present do not have this arrangement. In any event, because the Government does not want this money to flow to countries that do not reciprocate with similar benefits for Australian copyright owners, the royalty will be collected for the benefit of only relevant copyright owners; that is, owners of Australian audio copyright materials and owners of audio copyright materials in those countries which have similar schemes and therefore provide comparable benefits to Australian owners. This will ensure that Australia adheres to the spirit of the relevant international copyright conventions without providing a windfall to foreign owners in countries which have not addressed the problem of home taping.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also noted in its legislation that 15 per cent of the royalty raised will be set aside by copyright owners for the benefit of those people in the Australian music industry most in need of assistance. The music industry has agreed to provide part of the royalty to the Australian Contemporary Music Development Co., recently established by the Government to foster Australian contemporary music.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problems that we have with the legislation are evident from the second reading amendment that has been moved on behalf of the Opposition. The amendment states:
       </para>
       <para>
        At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that:

       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me extraordinary that we have no idea, judging from the Minister's second reading speech and the lack of any information to the contrary from the Government, of what proportion of tapes are used in taping copyright material.

         —I guess that there should be some kind of survey. It seems to me extraordinary that we are taking action because we think that there is an amount of tape usage out there without, in fact, having any idea whatsoever what that use is. I find it ludicrous and impossible to believe that no-one has any idea of the extent to which blank tapes are used for the copying of copyright material. I think we ought to know the consequences of what we are doing and whether the volume of exemptions sought by statutory declaration is going to be so enormous that we will be submerged in a sea of paper, rather than have a practical system for the collecting of moneys which should be due to those people who have copyright.

       <para>
        (iii) whether the blank tape royalty scheme set out in Part Vc of the Bill is the most effective blank tape royalty scheme for providing compensation to Australian performers whose material is recorded domestically on audio tapes in breach of copyright;
       </para>
       <para>
        (iv) whether the proposal in proposed subsection 135zzs (3) of the Bill for a statutory declaration entitling the purchaser of a blank audio tape to a refund of the royalty paid on that tape is the most effective means of effecting a refund or waiver of the royalty when the tape is not used for recording copyright material; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (v) whether the proposal in proposed subsection 135zzu (3) for the rules of the collecting society to make provision for the distribution of amounts collected by it is adequate to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the amounts collected is passed on or distributed to those whose own work has contributed to the making of the eligible sound recording or eligible work; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) upon receipt of the report of the Copyright Tribunal on these matters, the Government should propose such amendments to the Copyright Act as may be necessary or desirable''.
       </para>
       <para>
        That seems to us to be an eminently sensible proposition because there is no doubt that the Government has presented some legislation which has, I believe-and the Opposition believes-the right thrust, which is setting out on the right path. But we certainly remain unconvinced of the method by which the Government is seeking to achieve its objective. It is for those reasons that I strongly support the second reading amendment that the Opposition has moved. Nonetheless, I commend to the Senate the thrust of the rest of the Bill which I think does make appropriate amendments to the Copyright Act. Nonetheless, I also support the amendment proposed by the Opposition.

         —I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate. My response is rather long and I certainly will not be finished by 10.30 p.m. So much was said in the second reading debate that took place prior to our two-week adjournment that I thought it would be useful if I had a comprehensive reply prepared in relation to those matters that were raised, particularly by Senators Hill, Puplick and Macklin. In passing, I will be answering some of the matters that were raised by Senator Michael Baume.

        Following introduction of the Copyright Amendment Bill and the Circuit Layouts Bill last November, there have been extensive discussions with affected interests, including educational institutions, broadcasters, the film industry, performers and copyright owners. As a result of these discussions, the Government will be moving amendments to the performers' protection provisions in the Copyright Amendment Bill to accommodate some of the concerns raised. In particular, concerns about the retrospective application of the provisions and the need for an `ephemeral synchronisation' exception will be dealt with.

        Performers' Protection
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendments of the performers' protection provisions beyond those proposed by the Government are not accepted on the basis that the regime in the Bill provides a workable framework for the exercise of performers' rights. Performers have not been granted a copyright. They have instead been granted real and effective rights enabling them to control the fixation of their performances and the subsequent use of their performances fixed on a sound-recording in the sound-track of a film. The Government does not wish to diminish in any way any of the rights granted under the Bill. To do so would effectively be to subsidise users of performances at the expense of performers.

        Educational Copying
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 53b of the Copyright Act allows educational institutions to copy copyright material if they keep copying records and pay royalties to copyright owners. Where copies are made by institutions for their correspondence students, other than as part of their lecture notes, no royalties are payable. Because of the acknowledged complexity of section 53b, the Bill will introduce a new, more streamlined educational copying scheme. It will not alter the extent of copying which can be done under section 53b but will afford institutions the opportunity to get right away from record-keeping by opting to pay copyright owners so much per student per annum for unlimited copying within the section 53b limits. It does not, however, continue the existing very limited right of institutions to royalty-free copying for correspondence students.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill does, however, recognise the different needs of particular students by expressly allowing the Copyright Tribunal to set different rates for different classes of students, thus enabling institutions to argue for a lesser rate for correspondence students because of their greater reliance on print material.
       </para>
       <para>
        The scheme in the Bill is the result of long and detailed consultations with educational and copyright interests and negotiations between those groups. The great majority of these interests, including schools, welcome the scheme on the basis that it will streamline and facilitate educational copying.
       </para>
       <para>
        While recognising the special needs of institutions teaching correspondence students, the Government needs to consider the interests of both copyright owners and users in framing any exceptions to copyright owners' exclusive rights to exploit their works. It believes that the introduction of the optional new per-student royalty scheme represents a reasonable compromise between those competing interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's proposal that the blank tape royalty scheme be referred to the Copyright Tribunal for consideration should be rejected. The scheme results from extensive, some might even say drawn out, consultations with industry and consumers undertaken over a number of years. Indeed, the possibility of a scheme was first canvassed in 1981 when the Attorney-General's Department undertook a review of audiovisual copyright law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several surveys have been undertaken, both here and overseas, to establish the extent of home-taping of recorded material. I believe that in Australia Reark Research Pty Ltd and Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd, commissioned by the Australian Record Industry Association, have undertaken such surveys. I think that answers, in part, the matter raised by Senator Michael Baume. These surveys show that between 80 per cent and 85 per cent of blank tapes sold are used to copy copyright material. For this reason, a number of countries, including France and Germany, have royalty schemes. Since the decision to implement the scheme was announced, the Government has had discussions with blank tape suppliers, who will be required to pay the royalty, in an effort to ensure that the mechanics of collection are as simple and cheap as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, details of the scheme's operation as first devised have been revised so as to significantly reduce compliance costs: there will be no requirement for special labelling of tapes on which the royalty has been paid; the royalty will be collected at the point of first sale in Australia-thus relatively few suppliers will be involved; and paperwork can be done once in respect of fairly large batches of tape. All costs of distributing the royalty to copyright owners will be borne by the collecting society, not the Government. Net proceeds of the royalty will go only to Australian copyright owners and those from the few foreign countries which operate an equivalent scheme under which Australian copyright owners are entitled to benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Categories of beneficiary will include the owners of copyright in the music-that is, composers and lyricists; and the sound recording-that is, record and pre-recorded tape producers. Performers, while not copyright owners, will benefit indirectly under existing contracts which entitle them to at least 50 per cent of royalties received by record companies. The recording industry has undertaken that new contracts will provide-and those existing contracts which do not provide for the distribution of additional income under which the royalty would fall will be revised to provide-flow-on of the royalty to performers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The collecting society and its rules require the approval of the Attorney-General. Provision is also made in the Bill to enable the making of regulations requiring the rules to contain specified provisions concerning distribution of amounts collected. The mechanism in the Bill enabling refunds of royalty to individuals is the most appropriate. The requirement to complete a statutory declaration deters abuse of the system while at the same time does not make it excessively difficult for genuine users to obtain refunds. In any case, it must be remembered in this context that institutions and other bodies using blank tapes for purposes which do not infringe copyright, for example, institutes for the blind, or which are licensed under separate arrangements with copyright owners, will be able to purchase tapes free of the royalty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Any inquiry into the blank tape royalty scheme would be unlikely to raise issues not already canvassed and would seem inappropriate and certainly premature until the scheme has had a chance to operate for a period. In any event, conduct of such an inquiry is a totally inappropriate task to be assigned to the Copyright Tribunal whose function is to set royalty rates under various statutory licences in the Copyright Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        In response to Senator Macklin's query about why the Government is not including videotapes in the blank tape royalty scheme, I make the point that the audio and video markets have different characteristics. The establishment of an audio royalty would not therefore necessarily constitute a precedent for a video royalty. In addition, video copying is generally done off-air for `time-shift' purposes. The material is usually viewed once only, at a more convenient time, fairly soon after the broadcast; copies are usually not kept and do not generally substitute for purchase. Furthermore, the video industry has not provided evidence or survey material of adverse impact on video sales of domestic video copying comparable to that provided by the recording industry in respect of audio material.

        Media Monitoring
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have foreshadowed amendments in relation to media-monitoring. The Government believes that the service provided by media monitors is certainly useful and worthwhile and should, as far as possible, be allowed to continue to operate. However, it does not believe that it is appropriate to legislate in this area at this time. This is a complex area where the relevant parties have for some time been endeavouring to negotiate voluntary licences. It seems that some headway is now being made, albeit through the pressure of litigation. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to pre-empt a solution in this matter by legislating prematurely. In any case, the Government is not yet convinced that a free right in favour of media-monitors is the correct solution as such a right diminishes the interests of copyright owners whose material is being used. There are other possible solutions, such as a statutory licence, which should be explored should voluntarily licensing prove to be a failure.

        Copyright-Design Interaction
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the House of Representatives debate on the Bill the Government has received a number of submissions concerning clauses 9 and 10 which deal with the copyright-designs interaction. Having considered these submissions and the wide range of interests affected by the provisions, the Government is satisfied that the long overdue reforms introduced by clauses 9 and 10 represent the most appropriate balance achievable in this difficult area. The Government is confident that the principal objective of the provision, which is to remove existing uncertainties and inequities and to enhance copyright protection for artists and craftspeople, has been met. Moreover, an important Australian creator group is guaranteed copyright protection which previously has not always been available to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government welcomes the support by the Australian Democrats for clauses 9 and 10 in their present form. On the other hand, the Government rejects the Opposition's proposal to defer passage of clause 10 pending amendment of the designs legislation to cover designs which are presently unregistrable under that legislation. I indicate that the Government will accept the Australian Democrats' second reading amendment in a lightly modified form, not as to its substance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The designs registration system under the Designs Act is one of the broadest in the world. Amendments of the Designs Act in 1981 had the effect of widening the potential operation of that Act and expanding the range of designs capable of registration. If a particular design for an industrial product does not meet the specified criteria for registration under that system, it is arguable that it is not appropriate that the product receive intellectual property protection at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's proposal presupposes that amendments of the Designs Act to cover unregistrable designs will, in fact, be made. It is inappropriate to defer the operation of the Government's important and long overdue reforms of copyright law affecting designs, when the proposed Designs Act amendments may be found, upon closer examination, to be inappropriate. The Bill before the Senate deals with copyright-style protection which differs fundamentally from Designs Act protection. The copyright designs reforms stand alone and should not be prejudiced by any decisions the Government might make in relation to the Designs Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also rejects the implication that the copyright-designs amendments will act as a disincentive to research and development. On the contrary, the removal of copyright protection for three-dimensional industrial articles will mean that manufacturers will be free to manufacture an article if, upon searching the appropriate industrial property register, the article is not covered by, for example, patents or designs protection. This will greatly benefit research and development of products in the manufacturing sector as a manufacturer will be free to manufacture an article without the risk that there may be in existence a design in which copyright subsists. This was an argument strongly supported by the 1973 Franki Committee which reported on the copyright-designs question. I should also make it clear at this time that the amendments being effected by clause 10 will only apply to the industrial application of designs which takes place on or after the commencement of the new section. The new section has no retrospective operation.

         —I want to take a few moments of the time of the Senate to pay tribute to Frank O'Keefe, the former member for Paterson, who passed away on 21 April, a few weeks ago. Frank was born in approximately 1912. In his time on this earth he gave great service to his country and to the people of Gunnedah.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I first got to know Frank in 1972 when I worked for him during an election campaign. I worked again for him in 1974, doorknocking in places such as Beresfield which is near Maitland at the southern end of the Paterson electorate. That was a very tough area for the National Party but an area in which Frank O'Keefe was very well respected. I was then campaign director for Frank O'Keefe in 1975, 1977, 1980 and 1983. In that period I worked for him for a total of six or seven months.
       </para>
       <para>
        Frank was an outstanding politician in every sense of the word. He did what all politicians are supposed to do. He represented the voters without fear or favour and he considered all levels of people in his electorate. No matter who came into his office, he was always a perfect servant of the people. He was one of the most humble men I have ever met. His humbleness created an aura about him, but by no stretch of the imagination was he always humble. His character was very strong.
       </para>
       <para>
        I always remember getting very concerned during campaigns because, at 9 o'clock of a morning, he would ring up his electorate office. I would say, `Frank, I want to get you on the road so that we can do some more doorknocking or visit some different people'. He would say, `David, just sit down there and wait for a short time while I make a few phone calls'. At 9 o'clock every morning he would ring up Paula Carlton, who is now electorate secretary for Eric Fitzgibbon, the honourable member for Hunter, and they would go through all the mail that had arrived that morning. I would say to him, `Frank, we should be out seeing a few people and doing a little electioneering'. He would say, `I must get all of those letters out to those people by lunch time today because if I do all those jobs for them they will tell everybody over the fence what a good job I am doing for them'. As I said, he was a consummate politician. He realised that, if he did a service for the people in the community, he would win their votes, and he did. In the first election, he scraped in with only a very small victory over the mayor of Maitland, and in later elections Frank increased his majority.
       </para>
       <para>
        One interesting quirk about Frank was that always on the night before polling day he would find the person he was standing against and have a beer with him. That was quite an unusual thing for any politician to do, particularly after he had only just scraped in in his previous victory, whether it was over Noel Unicomb, Frank Murray or one of his other opponents. Frank was a man of great integrity and had a great feeling for the people he fought against in election campaigns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Something else that comes to my mind when I think about Frank O'Keefe is his car driving. He had a little trouble with his eyesight in the early 1970s. He used to wonder why I would not drive with him to some of the meetings he had to go to. One of the reasons was that, because of his poor eyesight, he would line up an oncoming car and, at the last minute, swerve away. He always-or should I say in most cases-missed them, but he did have a little trouble with his eyesight when driving. He had his eyesight attended to and as I said, did not do any great disservice with his car driving.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was a tireless worker for the Gunnedah district. He gave great service to local government. He was the mayor in 1948-49 and again from 1953 to 1969, a total of 17 years. He was an alderman from about 1944 to 1981. He was instrumental in setting up the Gunnedah abattoir and was its chairman from 1954 to 1969. He was appointed a member of the Order of Australia in 1979.
       </para>
       <para>
        He had many great sporting achievements. He was always proud of the fact that in 1926 he won the 14 years 220 yards State championship in the Domain baths in Sydney. At 17 years of age he was playing first grade water polo and was a member of the North Bondi Surf Club. He was very proud of his swimming achievements and used to talk more of them than of his cricketing achievements, although if one got close to him at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a cricket test one would find he could probably bat as well as Bradman and bowl as well as O'Reilly. He was a solid middle order batsman-I am told a rather stodgy batsman-and a leg spin bowler. He was a member of the Gunnedah team of the present member for Castlereagh, Roger Wotton, which was regarded as king team of the north west. It was one of the best cricket teams ever to play in the north west. He was also manager of the Emu cricket team which went to Malaya. He put a lot of effort into cricket, especially as a member of the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust, of which he was a member for about 12 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was only a few weeks ago that I was with Frank O'Keefe during a street walk in Gunnedah with Mr John Anderson. He was his usual self when I greeted him in his shop. I said, `How are you, Frank?'. He said, `All the better for seeing you'. It was always Frank's trait in life that he always made one feel very welcome wherever he was. He was in good spirits although he was not quite his usual self. However, he still displayed the Frank O'Keefe robustness and talked about politics and the good young man who would represent the area, and who spoke to the condolence motion in the other place this afternoon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another thing I would like to say about him is that he was a unstinting man. He had no family of his own but he had two nephews, Graham Curtis at Rowena and Don Pascoe, who ran the business in Gunnedah. Don played rugby league for New South Wales Country for four years. Honourable senators will probably remember his playing on the wing for Country. He also played for New South Wales for two years. Every morning during an election campaign Frank would ring Don to check how the business was going. That was the second phone call he always made before we went out on the campaign trail. I extend sympathy to Don and Graham and their families. To Frank's wonderful wife Nan, who gave him great support over the years, and her family, on behalf of the Senate and my family I extend the deepest sympathy and love. I know she will miss Frank as much as we will.

         —I wish to speak very briefly to support the comments made by Senator Brownhill about the late Frank O'Keefe. I did not enjoy quite as long an association with Frank O'Keefe as was enjoyed by David Brownhill. I simply acknowledge all of the very positive qualities that Senator Brownhill has just put into the record. But I wish to speak because, on behalf of the Opposition I say to his widow, in particular, how highly Frank O'Keefe was valued in this Parliament. He was the antithesis of the caricature of a politician. All of the negative implications that there are in that word he lacked. He was a tremendously gentlemanly person and a very kind person. I know from my own visit to his electorate when I spent time with him when I was opening a nursing home at the time that I was Minister for Social Security, it was an absolute delight to be with him. Senator David Brownhill has very admirably sketched out why that would be so. That was the sort of man that he was. I can safely say on behalf of all Opposition senators that I extend to his widow our very great sorrow at his death and record the fact that we are very grateful for the contribution that he made in this place. He was in every sense a gentleman and he brought great credit to his profession of a politician. I am very sad that he has died. I am pleased that we have had this opportunity tonight to acknowledge his contribution both to this Parliament and to his immediate community.

         —I join Senator Brownhill and Senator Chaney in a very brief tribute to Frank O'Keefe with whom I served for eight years in the House of Representatives. Frank was as straight as a die, a totally honest, decent, honourable Australian who served his country not only in the Federal Parliament but also in the State Parliament of New South Wales, in local government and in other ventures, particularly the Gunnedah meatworks, run by his local council. In fact he served eight years in the New South Wales State Parliament, 15 years in Federal Parliament, 43 years in local government, 18 years as mayor and seven years as deputy mayor of Gunnedah. He went to Gunnedah in 1934-that is 55 years ago-with an oil company and then became certainly one of Gunnedah's greatest locals.

        I first came across Frank O'Keefe when he was chairman of the Gunnedah abattoir which he had been a driving force in establishing in 1957. In those days, the Government created four country meatworks under the control of local government and, to my knowledge, Gunnedah is the only abattoir that remains under the control of a local body. Gunnedah meatworks was regarded certainly by far as the most efficient and best run country meatworks in New South Wales. This was in large part due to the chairmanship of that organisation by Frank O'Keefe. I was aware of that because I was a director of another meat company which used the Gunnedah meatworks as a processing point because it was unlike so many other council works in those days; it was efficient, well run and highly competent under his leadership.

        I also came to know Frank O'Keefe very well when he was chairman of the Government's trade and resources committee during the Fraser Government and I was its secretary. We were together on some visits to remote parts of Australia. In particular, I fondly remember a visit to the north-western parts of Western Australia with Frank in, I think, 1979 when we all had the opportunity to enjoy his sense of humour and his great companionship.

        In conclusion, I am glad that his contribution to Australia was recognised by his being made a member of the Order of Australia in 1979. He was Australian in every sense, a sportsman, a decent chap, a good bloke, a mate and, certainly, as a parliamentarian, I was very glad to have him both as a colleague and as a friend.

         —I, too, join my colleagues in their expressions of sympathy to the late Frank O'Keefe's widow. When I first entered politics in 1983, Frank O'Keefe was serving his last term in the House of Representatives. I knew him there as a tremendous man who had a great personal following in his electorate. He was a man who was known far and wide. In common with a number of country politicians there were numerous Frank O'Keefe stories that went around the electorate, and some of these were, of course, quite humorous.

        We have already heard that he was chairman of Gunnedah Municipal Council Abattoirs. I believe he used to go through those abattoirs and talk to the young footballers who were playing for the local club and say to them, `By gee, you played a good game last week, son, but not as good as your father. He was a great little half-back, but your grandfather was even better'. There were also the stories that went around the Gunnedah meatworks that people would say to him, `For goodness sake, Frank, when are you going to retire; we want to vote Labor and we just can't do it while you're the member'. He had such a great personal following that meatworkers, graziers and small business people voted for the man rather than the party that they normally supported. When a politician can have that type of following, he is a great success because he represents all people from all spectrums of life-and that was Frank O'Keefe. He made me welcome when I was the new boy in 1983. It was sad to see him leave politics. He left after my first term here.

         —On behalf of the Government in replying to the debate tonight, I join the Government in the sentiments expressed by Senator David Brownhill, Senator Fred Chaney, Senator Michael Baume and Senator Ron Boswell in paying tribute to Frank O'Keefe. I did not have the privilege or the honour of knowing Frank O'Keefe. But from what has been said in this debate he had eight years of service to the New South Wales State Parliament, 15 years of service to the Federal Parliament and 43 years of service to local government, making a cumulative total of 66 years of public service. What I think needs to be recognised in politics, away from the heat and battle of political exchange, is that people when they play those roles and take on the responsibilities of representing constituents give of themselves a tremendous amount and usually of their families as well. Sixty-six cumulative years of public service is an enviable record by any standard. It is a record to which it is appropriate we pay tribute tonight. I wish, therefore, to associate the Government with the remarks of my Senate colleagues, pay our condolences to the widow of Frank O'Keefe, appreciate the service that he has given to the Parliament and to the people of Australia and to express sadness at his passing.
