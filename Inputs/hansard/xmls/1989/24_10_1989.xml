       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued availability of abortion on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to remove abortion and abortion-related items from the Medicare schedule.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to remove item 6469 from the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to remove abortion or any abortion-related items from the Medicare schedule.

       </para>
       <para>
        During 1889 Sir Henry Parkes, then premier of New South Wales for the fifth and last time, added greatly to his stature in the public estimation as the `Apostle of Federation'. Early in January, while holidaying in Melbourne, he often spoke on the question, and predicted that before federation was accomplished there would be a further division of South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia so as to make ten colonies instead of six. As the year passed, he frequently referred in public speeches to the pressing need for federation, and in May 1889 he made a strong speech on the subject on the occasion of the completion of the Brisbane-Sydney railway. In October 1889 he spoke at Tenterfield in northern New South Wales, after a visit to Brisbane; this speech was widely taken to be a direct appeal to the people to prepare for a federal constitution-making convention. He had kept New South Wales out of the Federal Council, believing that it did not represent colonial opinion, and because it had no real power to deal with such questions as federal defence. However, he was convinced that the time was now appropriate to replace the Council with a proper federal legislature and executive. Speaking at the official banquet, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Imperial General who had inspected the forces of the colony had recommended that the whole of the forces of Australia should be united into one army. It would have pleased him greatly if they could rely on being safe without taking warlike measures, but as this was impossible, they must take measures to defend themselves, and the knowledge of this fact would be spread all over the world and make them additionally secure. There were two very important questions towards which their intention ought to be directed. They must have heard something of the Federal Council, on which New South Wales had not yet taken a place, and which sat in Tasmania, and held sessions which never appeared to interest anyone; but if they were to carry out these recommendations of General Edwards, it would be absolutely necessary for them to have one central authority, which could bring all the forces of the different colonies into one army. Some colonial statesman had said that this might be done by means of the Federal Council; but this Federal Council had no power to do anything of the sort, as it was not an elective body, but merely a body appointed by the Governments of the various colonies. It was therefore necessarily weak, and under the Imperial Act which appointed it no such tremendous power was given as that of originating and controlling a great Australian army. The Federal Council, also, had no executive power. It could propose, but could not execute. He would like to know what was to become of an army without a central executive power to guide its movements. One way which had been suggested out of the difficulty was that the Imperial Parliament should be asked to pass a measure authorising the troops of the colonies to unite in one federal army, but still, even if this were done, there would be an absence of the necessary central executive government. The colonies would object to the army being under the control of the Imperial Government, and none of the other colonies could direct it. The great question which they had to consider was, whether the time had not now arisen for the creation on this Australian continent of an Australian Government, as distinct from a local Government and an Australian Parliament. (Applause.) In other words, to make himself as plain as possible, Australia had now a population of three and a half millions, and the American people numbered only between three and four millions when they formed the great commonwealth of the United States. The numbers were about the same, and surely what the Americans had done by war, the Australians could bring about in peace. (Cheers.) Believing as he did that it was essential to preserve the security and integrity of these colonies that the whole of their forces should be amalgamated into one great federal army, feeling this, and seeing no other means of attaining the end, it seemed to him that the time was close at hand when they ought to set about creating this great national government for all Australia. This subject brought them face to face with another subject. They had now, from South Australia to Queensland, a stretch of about 2000 miles of railway, and if the four colonies could only combine to adopt a uniform gauge, it would be an immense advantage in the movement of troops. These were the two great national questions which he wished to lay before them. He had just returned from Brisbane, and the object of his visit had been not to force his advice on the authorities there but to discuss with them these matters. Unfortunately, owing to the illness of the head of the Ministry, his communications were rather more of a private character than otherwise; but, without disclosing any confidences, he thought he must state that he understood both sides in politics sympathised warmly and closely with the views which had been expressed by him. As to the steps which should be taken to bring this about, a conference of the authorities had been pointed to, but they must take broader and more powerful action in the initiation of this great Council; they must appoint a convention of leading men from all the colonies, delegates appointed by the authority of Parliament, who would fully represent the opinion of the different Parliaments of the colonies. This convention would have to devise the constitution which would be necessary for bringing into existence a federal government with a federal parliament for the conduct of this great national undertaking. (Applause.) The only argument which could be advanced in opposition to the views he had put forward was that the time had not come, and they must remain isolated colonies just in the same way as they were now. He believed, however, that the time had come; and, in the words of Brunton Stephens, the Queensland poet: -
       </para>
       <para>
        ``Not yet her day! How long? Not yet!
       </para>
       <para>
        There comes her flush of violet, and, heavenward faces all aflame
       </para>
       <para>
        With sanguine imminence of morn wait but the sun-kiss to proclaim
       </para>
       <para>
        The day of the Dominion born.''
       </para>
       <para>
        (Applause.) He believed that the time had come, and if two Governments set an example, the others must soon of necessity follow, and they would have an uprising in this fair land of a goodly fabric of free Government, and all great national questions of magnitude affecting the welfare of the colonies would be disposed of by a fully authorised constitutional authority, which would be the only one which could give satisfaction to the people represented. This meant a distinct executive and a distinct parliamentary power, a government for the whole of Australia, and it meant a parliament of two houses, a house of commons and a senate, which would legislate on these great subjects. The Government and Parliament of New South Wales would be just as effective as now in all local matters, and so would the Parliament of Queensland. All great questions would be dealt with in a broad manner, just as Congress dealt with the national affairs of the United States, and as the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada dealt with similar questions. He, therefore, took advantage of the opportunity which had arisen for the consideration of this great subject, for he believed that the time was at hand when this should be done. One great thing to be accomplished was the massing together of their military forces, and this could not be controlled by any other power than one representing all the colonies. In conclusion, he thanked them for the kindness which they had shown him, and said that he had no fear but the Federal Parliament would rise to a just conception of the necessities of the case. The thing would have to be done, and to put it off would only tend to make the difficulties which stood in the way greater. In the meantime, there was this substantial work which they could not do by any other means to be carried out, and it could not be done by any existing machinery.

        —The Christmas Island Lotteries Ordinance confers a discretion on the Minister to approve, with conditions, commercially valuable public lotteries and betting schemes. There is no external right of review for a refusal or inappropriate approval, no criteria to control the exercise of the discretion and the Minister may apparently delegate the approval power to any person. The Ordinance also contains provisions empowering a somewhat unqualified access to information and property. The Committee has expressed its concern about these matters to the Minister and is awaiting his response.

      <para>
       The Determination of Motor Vehicles Standards confers a wide discretion on the Minister to deem that vehicles or components have complied with national standards even though those requirements have been met by a means other than those set out in the determination. This discretion is not limited by criteria and appears not to be subject to external review on the merits. The Committee is concerned that the exercise of an unreviewable discretion could have important commercial implications. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short description of the Committee's concerns about each instrument.

       This Ordinance legalises approved public lotteries and approved betting schemes in the Territory of Christmas Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       The core of the new arrangements is that the Minister may grant or refuse approval of lotteries and betting schemes subject to any conditions or requirements to ensure fairness and the interests of subscribers. There are no detailed criteria for the exercise of this power, nor any right of external review of the merits of a decision granting or refusing approval or imposing conditions. In addition, the Ordinance provides that the Minister may delegate any of his or her powers, apparently to any person.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee is always concerned at provisions in delegated legislation which grant to the executive wide unreviewable and unstructured discretions in respect of any particular schemes that could have livelihood implications. In this case, the discretion relates to matters which the Committee believes could be of major commercial importance. The Committee believes that in such cases the question of creating a right of external review should always be examined. The Committee therefore raises the question and seeks the advice of the Minister. Where there are no objective criteria set out to guide the exercise of a discretion the need for external review of a decision will be stronger. In the present Ordinance, there are no objective criteria and there is a further provision for the Minister's power to be extensively delegated.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Ordinance is also defective in that it provides for persons, authorised to audit material which may be demanded by a public official, to demand information themselves and to require the answers to questions. Although related provisions in the Ordinance only apply to ``reasonable'' requests, there is no such limit in this case.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is also provision for a person authorised to supervise the conduct of a lottery to enter any place where the lottery is to be drawn. There appears to be no restriction on this power of entry, either on the basis of consent, a judicial warrant or at a reasonable time.

       DETERMINATION OF AUSTRALIAN DESIGN RULES AS NATIONAL STANDARDS ORDER
      </para>
      <para>
       Determination of Motor Vehicles Standards-Order No. 1 of 1989 made under section 7 of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989
      </para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       This Order, although only two pages long, effectively incorporates into Australian federal law the 2,900 (sic) pages of the ``Australian Design Rules for Motor Vehicles and Trailers-3rd Edition'', issued by the Department of Transport and Communications, as at 31 July 1989. These Rules created the motor vehicle standards for the purposes of the Motor Vehicles Standards Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has no difficulty as such with the length of the incorporation, as it is not concerned with the policy of a particular instrument. In this instance, however, the Order itself provides that where this national standard imposes a requirement for the performance of a vehicle or component, and a particular vehicle or component meets that requirement but does so by a means other than that specified in the Australian Design Rules, the Minister may deem the vehicle or component to comply with the national standard.
      </para>
      <para>
       This wide discretion does not appear to be limited by criteria or to be subject to an external review of its merits. An adverse exercise of the discretion by the Minister could have important commercial implications, as the general legislation applies to ``all road vehicles'' supplied to the market for the first time, whether manufactured in Australia, imported new or imported second hand. Such vehicles are required to conform, and continue to conform, with the applicable national standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       It may be that this discretion is covered by appeal provisions in the parent Act, although this is not immediately apparent and it is certainly not mentioned in the Explanatory Statement.

         —Some of us welcome him back and some of us do not. I ask: Is it a fact that he has reprimanded the Australian Ambassador to Thailand, Richard Butler, over comments the Ambassador made in Bangkok over the weekend-specifically, that Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) proposals for a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia were a `sham' and `an excuse to avoid a settlement', that partial settlement should be a first step, and that the idea of a comprehensive settlement should be `taken off the table'? If the Minister has reprimanded Ambassador Butler, why has he done so when the Minister himself, in Brunei on 6 July at the post-ASEAN ministerial and in Paris on 28 August, argued that there was value in a partial settlement? What action has the Government now taken to minimise damage within ASEAN as a result of the Ambassador's comments? Is this another example of Australia conducting its diplomacy on the level of Sir Les Patterson?

         —I have seen Ambassador Butler's reported comments on Cambodia as they were originally published in the Bangkok Post on 21 October and as they were subsequently reported in the Australian media. As reported, those comments on the difficulties confronting the achievement of a comprehensive settlement to the Cambodian conflict were capable of being construed as a stepping away by Australia from our policy commitment to a comprehensive settlement. It is a policy commitment which we have always had and which I have certainly never resiled from. I do not know what Senator Hill is talking about in respect of either Brunei or Paris. I know that there was some misconstruction of something I said at the airport at Brunei in that respect, but there was no report at all which could possibly have lent credence to that coming out of Paris.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        So far as Ambassador Butler's comments were concerned, he has subsequently assured me that his remarks were taken out of context; he had not suggested that there had been any change in Australian policy. In particular, he had emphasised in his interview something not reported at all in the media accounts; namely, that Australia had decided once again to co-sponsor the ASEAN resolution at the United Nations General Assembly this year, which decision makes very clear our support for ASEAN's commitment to a comprehensive settlement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say again for the record that Australia believes, on all the presently available information about the attitudes of those capable of influencing events in Cambodia, be they internal parties or external players, that the only way of securing a durable settlement and stopping the killing in that tragic country is for there to be a comprehensive settlement in which all sides make compromises and concessions and demonstrate a preparedness to contribute to a process of national reconciliation and reconstruction. I made that very clear in the Senate on 27 September, the last time I think I addressed this question here, and I do so again now. I said on that occasion that we support all efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement. I referred then particularly to Prime Minister Chatichai's efforts. Since then I have had an extensive round of discussions with other colleagues at the United Nations and am aware of other efforts being made by the co-chairmen of the Paris Conference, France and Indonesia, and by some of the five permanent members of the Security Council to find a comprehensive and durable way through the present impasse. I repeat that we will support all such efforts.

If the Australian Government does not accept that all the Vietnamese troops have been withdrawn, can the Minister indicate upon what basis the Australian Government reached such a conclusion?

         —So far as formed military units are concerned, it is Australia's assessment that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops has been completed as scheduled. But there are still claims and counter claims, which we have found very difficult to verify, about residual Vietnamese military advisers and some claims as to Vietnamese troops now wearing the uniform of soldiers of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. It has to be recognised that, without an appropriate international control mechanism to verify the withdrawal issue, it is very difficult to be categorical and to confidently accept Vietnamese withdrawal as being now complete. Full Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia remains, as we have constantly said, one of the necessary pre-conditions for a resolution of the Cambodian conflict and it is one of the key elements in the comprehensive settlement to which we remain committed and which I have just made the subject of a reply to Senator Hill.

That idea has been further fleshed out and was fully explained by the Prime Minister in his speech to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It is a relatively small-scale concept involving the location within a respected existing research institution in an international financial capital, possibly London, possibly somewhere in Europe, possibly in New York--

         —I will get to the issues one by one in due course. I thought the honourable senator was still in New York. Why could he not have done us the benefit of staying there? The idea is to create a small unit in a respected and recognised international research institution in an international financial capital, as I indicated-small in the sense of probably involving one professional, perhaps one post-doctoral or graduate student and a secretary. They will be people with expertise in the operation of the South African economy but, more particularly, in the operation of international financial markets, capable of understanding and effectively analysing the very complex transactional flows that are involved in that international financial market as it affects South Africa these days and reporting effectively on just what is going on and the implications of the operation of restriction of financial flows to South Africa on the South African economy. All of those matters are obviously of very real significance and have a very real impact on the way in which the rest of the world views what is appropriate to apply by way of pressure on South Africa. The cost of this exercise as I have described it we assess to be about $200,000 to $225,000 a year in the first two years. Australia has pledged substantial initial support for that. It is not yet clear what will be forthcoming by way of financial contributions from the other countries, but the idea of establishing such an agency was warmly endorsed by 46 of the 47 members of the countries present in Kuala Lumpur. There, as elsewhere, Mrs Thatcher demonstrated her membership, as Neil Kinnock once very nicely put it, of the Greta Garbo school of diplomacy: `I want to be alone'.

         —On a visit to the area a couple of months ago-probably in July or August-I met with some representatives of community groups in the area who are concerned about the transfer of public land to private enterprise and, more particularly, in so far as my area of interest is concerned, about the potential destruction of the habitat of migratory birds. Australia has a number of agreements with other countries-Japan and China being those in point here-which oblige us to protect the habitat of migratory birds. The peninsula in question supports one endangered and 20 rare species of birds and 35 birds listed under the migratory birds agreements. I have already taken some action to consider the impact of the proposals on migratory birds. Australia's obligations under these agreements are administered through legislation and administrative arrangements in the States and Territories, and I would have thought that that would be the appropriate way for it to continue. CONCOM is the Council of Ministers under which this system works.

       <para>
        In August of this year, as a result of the representations I had received, I wrote to the Wyong Council and to the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Causley, seeking their assurances that there would be no destruction of the habitat of those migratory birds were this development to proceed. It is not surprising that I have not received any response from the New South Wales Government on this question. Its record on coastal development, which is fast becoming a scandal to rival that of Queensland's, would suggest that it will take no action. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has an overall coordinating role to coordinate our action under these treaties. It also convenes a working group set up amongst the States with the Commonwealth to assist in the legislation and administrative arrangements to which I referred earlier. If there is a prospect of the development proceeding and a prospect that the habitat of these birds would be endangered one would imagine that the New South Wales Government would have raised this question at the relevant CONCOM committee. It is my understanding that it has never raised it. Given that I have not received any reply to my inquiries, I certainly intend to have it placed on the agenda for that committee to consider.
       </para>
       <para>
        The limited amount of information I have available suggests that the North Entrance peninsula may well be of national significance. If I can firm up that information I will look at what powers the Commonwealth has under those treaties to make sure that the habitat of those migratory birds is not destroyed.

Is the Minister aware that this is claimed to be the result of the failure of the Queensland Government to enact legislation to guarantee the protection of endangered species? Can the Minister indicate whether there has been a lack of cooperation by the Queensland Government in assisting with the implementation of the Federal Government's new program for endangered species?

         —I am aware of the statements made by the Queensland Conservation Council. If anything, it may well understate the situation in Queensland. Certainly at the present time there are at least 28 endangered species of vertebrate animals in Queensland but, according to the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, a source that one would imagine not too many honourable senators-at least those on the other side of the chamber-would be willing to dispute, there may be 1,115 vascular plants endangered at present. That is a very serious situation indeed.

       <para>
        The second part of the question sought to know whether I was aware that the situation is claimed to exist because of the failure of the Queensland Government to enact legislation. The reality is that the record of the Queensland Government on this and other environmental issues is by far the worst of any State in Australia. No other State could come close. The Queensland response, so far, has been that there are no endangered species in Queensland: that is, apart from the Ministers in the Cooper Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        In contrast, Victoria recently passed flora and fauna legislation which incorporates not only protection of individual animals or plants but also strategies for the protection of habitat. Victoria has been prepared to go out and discover the problems; Queensland would simply prefer not to know.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is too early to gauge the attitude of the Queensland Government to the Federal Government's endangered species program. I put out the strategy on, I think, 4 October and public comment is invited up till December, so it will be some time before we find out what Queensland thinks. Given that the date is 29 December, no doubt the response will come from the Goss Labor Government, and its response on endangered species will be a damned sight better than anything that has come before it. I would hope that, when we see that response, we will have a cooperative arrangement to ensure that endangered species of both flora and fauna in Queensland are protected. It is an area of immense national and international importance and one that has been very sadly ignored. This Government, and the incoming Goss Labor Government in Queensland, will make sure that the problem is rectified.

The honourable senator asked about the cut-off point for any payments to the airlines in respect of the staff who are retained in employment when they might otherwise have been laid off.

        The honourable senator made his question slightly more specific this week by asking whether 80 per cent capacity by Australian Airlines would be a return to normalcy. I do not think that that judgment can be made first of all as to 80 per cent capacity and secondly as to whether that would be regarded as normalcy at this time. As the honourable senator knows, this dispute has been much more protracted than the Government or anybody else would have wished. It has been difficult to estimate from time to time how long it will go.

         —It just so happens, Mr President, that the Snowy Mountains scheme is a major scheme for Australia and its fortieth anniversary ought to be properly recognised in this chamber. The scheme provides peak load electricity for New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory as well as irrigation waters for the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers. The fortieth anniversary recognised the role of Nelson Lemmon, the Western Australian wheat cocky who was a Minister in the Chifley Government and who steered through the Parliament the legislation to set up the scheme, the role of Sir William Hudson, the first commissioner of the scheme, and the role of Major Clews, the person who surveyed the scheme. During the construction of the Snowy scheme, which concluded in 1974, 100,000 workers from 30 different countries participated in the construction of the scheme. Unfortunately, 121 of them were killed during the construction phase as they rushed to complete their project. The scheme cost about $400m. In today's money it would cost about $4 billion to replace. Those are some of the observations that I think it proper to make in recognition of one of the world's most significant hydro-electric schemes ever constructed.

        I have seen the article in the Financial Review referred to by Senator Black which appeared at about the time the anniversary occurred. It made two points which I think, in the context of all the events, are a little unfortunate. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, with the assistance of Victoria and New South Wales, has conducted a strategic maintenance review of the scheme. The scheme is mainly a civil engineering works but the moving parts of the scheme, the turbines and generators, have, over 30 years of operation, run down. A major refurbishment program is now necessary. It is suggested that the cost of replacing those moving parts will be about $400m spread over about 20 years. There is no conflict between the Commonwealth and the States about that. Indeed, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of the two States and the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory recently, saying, `We are now in a position of scheduling negotiations to work out how we refurbish Snowy Mark II'.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of low rainfalls, it is true that there has been something of a drought in the Snowy Mountains in recent years. The dams are now about 60 per cent full; a year ago they were 45 per cent full. If there is low rainfall for a few more years yet there will indeed be a problem for the scheme, but there is not one in the present circumstances. If there was a continued drought there would need to be an examination of options such as cloud seeding, which of course, could proceed only if a decision was made to go ahead with it on the basis of a full environmental impact statement.

The awards regulate the meat industry in all States other than Western Australia and Tasmania and apply to all employees engaged in domestic abattoirs. The meat industry employers subsequently appealed against aspects of that decision. On 14 September the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission handed down its decision in relation to the appeal. That decision set aside Deputy President Riordan's earlier decision. It amended the date of the effect of the 4 per cent second tier increase and the 10 per cent March 1989 increase to 14 September 1989, which represented a loss of 10 months retrospectivity compared with the decision of Deputy President Riordan. There has been a reaction to the decision of the Full Bench, and that is probably the principal concern in Victoria.

There was also agreement on a framework for the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon.

        The Australian Government, as I said, welcomes this as a major breakthrough. But we appeal to all parties involved in Lebanon to take advantage of it. In this context I am disturbed, as we all are, at reports that General Aoun on the Christian side has already rejected the Taif agreement. It is absolutely crucial that he and all other leaders in Lebanon act responsibly in the current situation. We urge him to do so.

        Despite the progress that has been achieved so far, major obstacles remain. We certainly continue to urge all parties to respect the cease-fire in Beirut and to cooperate with all efforts to secure a peaceful and negotiated settlement and an end to the violence. As the Prime Minister emphasised when he last addressed this matter in a major way on 15 August, the Government is convinced that after 14 years of fighting it must be clear that no settlement in Lebanon can be imposed by force. Only compromise and accommodation by all parties can now bring the fighting there to an end.

Senator Jenkins's second question described the mission as a `so-called' high level mission. That may be a reflection on the officers concerned. They are senior officers of the Department. Mr Gardner Murray, for example, is the Director of the Bureau of Rural Resources, a former Director of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and a world ranking veterinarian in his own right, so I do not think `so-called' is a slur that I should allow to pass. Those officers were joined in the delegation by a Mr Charles Jamieson, the Minister Commercial of the Australian Embassy at Riyadh, and had discussions in Saudi Arabia.

        Senator Jenkins asked two questions about tabling reports. I have replied to those questions previously by saying that we will not at this stage table any reports. The reports made by the high level mission were made by cablegram and orally to the Minister when the reporters returned from their mission. At this stage we do not think it is appropriate to table the reports, as the matters are of some sensitivity. Finally, Senator Jenkins asked why we do not appoint a veterinarian skilled in Arabic or things Saudi Arabian to operate in that country. We do have a veterinarian accredited to our Embassy in Riyadh as an officer of the Embassy, and he specialises in these matters.

         —Let me deal with the last part of that question first. We, of course, authorise exports out of Australia. I do that in the case of iron ore. But at this point there appears to me to be absolutely no reason why the Australian Government would interfere with the commercial workings of the international iron ore market. However, I can say in respect of the first part of Senator McKiernan's question that the annual Australian-Japan iron ore conference commenced yesterday in Japan. A number of newspaper articles have speculated about the price that might be settled on for iron ore for the year 1990. That is not surprising because obviously this central issue is being discussed at the conference.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We, as a matter of course, monitor the international market. We, as a matter of course, talk with our Australian producers. We are aware of what is being discussed by other iron ore producers who compete with our companies on the main international markets. There is a view that it may be possible to negotiate a 30 per cent increase in prices in the market for the 1990 supply year. I certainly believe that there is cause for expectations that there will be a substantial increase in iron ore pricing for the next round. I base that on some of the indications that I have had from yesterday's meeting of the Australian-Japan iron ore conference. I also base it on the fact that world steel production is projected to remain high in 1990-91 and that in Japan production will be at least 100 million tonnes. I also base it on the fact that the world iron ore supply at the present time is very tight. Last year there was a 15 per cent price increase but that followed seven successive years of low prices and, indeed, still left us 14 per cent below the prices that were achieved in 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen a major increase in productivity in Australian iron ore mines. We have seen the writing of long term contracts between the three major producers with Japanese steel companies involving between five and seven years for supply. We expect that this year Australia will attain 46 per cent penetration of the Japanese market and probably next year 48 per cent if the trend line continues. This is happening at a time when alternative markets away from Japan constitute about 52 per cent of the total overseas supply of Australian iron ore. We have seen Australia emerge in the eyes of the world as a reliable supplier. I think that is something for which workers in the industry need to be recognised.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian-Japan iron ore conference which, as I said, commenced yesterday, is the scene setter for negotiations. The negotiations for price will be carried out later this year and will probably be settled early next year. But I think a very substantial rise-maybe at a level of 30 per cent-is obtainable.

The Prime Minister said that the agreement means that the Canadian tariff on Australian canned fruit can be phased down, in the context of the Uruguay Round, to a level which leaves the Australian industry competitive with other exporters. The Australian industry can now have the confidence that the tariff rate it faces will permit it to remain both viable and competitive. The precise rate of reductions in tariffs will be settled by our negotiators in the Uruguay Round. Negotiations are to commence forthwith and are to be completed within a year. We do not have to await the completion of the round to finalise this particular issue.

        This is a very satisfying result, certainly for the Australian fruit growing and canning industry. It is yet another example of the very close cooperation that Australia and Canada have been able to enjoy on issues of mutual concern and interest-there have been some other topics of cooperation in the last few days as well-and it represents the commitment of both our countries to trade liberalisation, an important commitment to put on the record yet again in the context of the forthcoming regional economic cooperation meeting in Canberra in a couple of weeks time, quite apart from more generally.

The point that was being sought to be understood at the Senate Estimates Committee originally was whether there was a necessity for the Chairperson always to be in Sydney and the Deputy Chairperson in Melbourne. We were trying at that stage to indicate that that was not the arrangement; the arrangement would be that the successor to Mr Hartnell would take up his or her position in, obviously, one of the major commercial centres-Sydney or Melbourne. There was an indication that the other major commercial centre would be the natural place for the Deputy Chairperson to take up office.

        As to the proper description of the Deputy Chairperson-whether the office holder should be a Victorian or whatever-I think the preceding part to clause 4 of the Victorian agreement that was tabled indicated that the first duty was to look for a suitable possible appointee. It may well be that that canvassing of possible appointees could lead us to say that there was not a suitable Victorian and possibly that somebody from Perth, Launceston, or wherever was suitable. That is a preliminary hurdle that has to be jumped in terms of clause 4 of the agreement that was tabled. If any further clarification is required in regard to the matters put to the Estimates Committee, I will certainly have a look at the transcripts and provide that clarification for Senator Durack.

         —Yes, I have seen that article. In fact, it follows a report of last Friday's meeting of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council which occurred in the South Australian Riverland under the aegis of the host State, South Australia. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, a body comprising government representatives from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth, is the intergovernmental agency through which we have developed an integrated plan for the management of the Murray-Darling Basin from an agricultural production, residential, social and environmental point of view. The article in the Weekend Australian identifies what we all know-that the significant problem in the Murray-Darling Basin is the high level of salinity that comes down the Murray River. The significant outcome of the Ministerial Council meeting last Friday was that all of those three States and the Commonwealth agreed on a $7.7m natural resource management strategy which will mean that all of the three States and the Commonwealth are coordinated in their activities around that strategy to cause a reduction in the significant problems of salinity, as well as waterlogging in parts of the catchment and on irrigation plots, and to improve the natural resources of the basin so that the agricultural, social and environmental values can be protected.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In addition to that natural resource management strategy, the Council endorsed a community of common concern approach, to set up a series of community groups along the river systems which will take the task of managing the region in which they operate into their own hands and effect, hopefully, attitudinal change among land-holders about how to manage those land systems in concert with the natural resource management strategy that we have talked about. The major projects under that strategy are an acceleration of further ground water studies, the management of special projects on the environment concerning wetlands, fishing and forest management and the promotion and development of community land care groups on the land degradation front. The Council also agreed last Friday that it would commission a major report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics into the cost of water as supplied to irrigation farmers along the river. It took that view because it felt that, in addition to these remedial programs that the strategy puts in place, there is a need to look at the economic costs of the development that goes on along the river. Water being the most cost sensitive input, that is an area for particular study. The Council will meet again in March and consider the activities that it should engage in from there.

         —On 3 October Senator Tambling asked me a question about pilots from Skywest Airlines Pty Ltd being transferred to an Ansett company. The answer is that it is true that four pilots were recently transferred from Skywest to Ansett in Western Australia. Only one of these pilots was drawn from the Coastwatch program. The BAe146 endorsement course includes a pilot engineering or ground training segment of some 12 working days followed by flying training. The course undertaken by the four pilots in question had been previously approved by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The ground training was conducted from 15 to 29 September 1989 inclusive. The ground training segment has been conducted in accordance with the CAA approved syllabus. The CAA is satisfied that the training course undertaken by the pilots in question has been consistent with the maintenance of normal safety standards. There is no evidence that the safety of the Coastwatch program has been put at risk. However, the CAA will continue to monitor Coastwatch operations.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I understand that the airlines are recruiting and training pilots as quickly as possible. Obviously there are a number of factors which may impede this process, and a shortage of check and training captains would be one.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the specific point raised by Senator Tambling. The Minister continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the number of check and training captains employed by the airlines is adequate for the present number of pilots and level of activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Senate that the airlines are maintaining their commitment to safety. This commitment has always been a significant factor in Australia's enviable safety record. The CAA is continuing its role in oversighting the observance of safety requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major impediment is not the alleged lack of a check and training organisation but rather the AFAP's active discouragement of its members from offering themselves for employment with the airlines. The Industrial Relations Commission on 10 October clearly indicated that the AFAP's whole attitude to the dispute had been one of inflexible confrontation with a rejection of the principles of the Industrial Relations Commission and the processes of conciliation and arbitration.

In Senator Chaney's question he referred to the Liberian World Airways Boeing 707 aircraft which was brought to Australia and for which an air operator's certificate (AOC) had been sought. In assessing such an application the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) seeks to ensure that there are adequate arrangements for the management of the necessary safety requirements. In the case of most international airlines these arrangements are very clearly in place and subject to scrutiny by the regulatory authority in the country of registration. However, the CAA has been unable to satisfy itself that such arrangements are in place with this particular aircraft and consequently it has refused to issue an AOC at this stage. The aircraft, therefore, cannot undertake commercial operations in Australia.

         —On 17 October Senator Hill asked Senator Button a question about exported live sheep in Saudi Arabia. I am now in a position to give him a more detailed answer. The Government has made known its concerns to the Saudi Arabian authorities on a number of occasions. A high level delegation visited Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates in August. Mr Duffy wrote to the Saudi Arabian Commerce Minister on 23 August noting that Australia regarded the dispute as a major trade policy matter with potentially serious adverse implications for the bilateral trade relationship.

       <para>
        I took the opportunity of my presence at the Foreign Ministers meeting in Belgrade to clearly highlight the concerns of the Australian Government at the situation. I did this in a discussion with the Saudi Arabian Deputy Foreign Minister on 4 September. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has written twice to the Saudi Arabian Minister for Agriculture and Water, most recently on 7 September, when he proposed a range of cooperative technical measures to resolve Saudi concerns about the health of our live sheep exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government certainly welcomes the offers by the Australian-Saudi Arabia Business Council and the Australia-Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry to use their good offices with the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Riyadh to help resolve the dispute, an offer which was in effect supplemented in a very helpful discussion that I had in New York a couple of weeks ago with the Arab League Ambassador, Clovis Mahsoud, on the same subject.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, in determining its overall approach to the dispute, accepted the offer of the Business Council to contact its Saudi counterpart and enlist its support. A further suggestion to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Australian Saudi Arabia Joint Commission is one of a range of options still under consideration should further measures be required. My Department has been in contact with the Australia-Saudi Arabian Business Council since the dispute began. I have also responded formally to the 12 October letter from the Australia-Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry and thanked the Chamber for its offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's current strategy in handling the dispute has been to develop a dialogue with the Saudi Arabian Minister for Agriculture and Water, Dr Al Shaikh. The Minister, who has only recently returned to Riyadh, met the Australian Ambassador on 18 October for what were, I understand, friendly and open discussions. The dialogue is clearly going to continue. We consider that it would not be productive to disclose details of the discussions at this stage. The Government's principal concern, obviously, is to resolve this matter as fast as possible and in the process continue the sound commercial relations that Australia and Saudi Arabia have enjoyed.

The Minister seems to be trying to give the impression that I have not time for women in sport or the portrayal of women in advertising, when in fact that had nothing to do with the interview in question. I was directing attention to the concerns of women in Australia today and, as I said, they relate very much to economic problems. In times of economic hardship, the priorities of women are those of the community generally, I said, and at a time when our trade figures are so poor and interest rates are going through the roof, the Government should not be worrying about female participation in sport or how women are portrayed in advertisements. These matters are very much on the periphery. At present, women's priorities are economic and that is why a Liberal-National coalition government will concentrate on getting the economy right and that is why the coalition put out its Economic Action Plan last week.

        Let me start with some praise, by approving the fact that the nineteenth annual report of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is already in the Parliament. Let me also congratulate Mr Barry Ireland, who is the new managing director of this Corporation. Let me wish him well. I congratulate the retiring chief executive officer, Mr Doug Price, who has been associated with the Snowy scheme since January 1950 and with the Corporation since its formation in 1970. For the last 13 years he was its chief executive. I quote from the Chairman's foreword which says of Mr Doug Price:

       </para>
       <para>
        One would have to be somewhat tongue in cheek to talk of the `financial viability' of this organisation. I wish Mr Barry Ireland well because he has before him a massive task to restore the financial viability of this organisation. Let me give you an example, Mr President. During this year under review, the Government's contribution to this organisation of over $16m was converted into a share capital of $4m with reserves of $1.2m and retained profits, making the current shareholders' equity $5.345m. So in future when we read these reports it will appear as if the Government's contribution to this organisation was only $4m, whereas in fact it has been over $16m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation
       </para>
       <para>
        When we turn to the operating profit for the year we see that the organisation made the massive profit of $218,000. It is much more interesting to look at how that $218,000 is made up. It received income from short term deposits of $508,000. That would immediately indicate that its true position was a loss. Let me go a step further and say that the report also shows other revenue of $827,000. I have had this report since only 2 o'clock; so I have been unable to ascertain what that $827,000 of other revenue is made up of, but I presume that some of it is from the sale of assets and the so-called operating profit arising from those things. The director's statement says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The net profit for 1988-89 was $218,000. the net profit after extraordinary items was $274,000, after having met incorporation costs of $66,000 and earned-
       </para>
       <para>
        I would put that word in quotation marks-
       </para>
       <para>
        $122,000 from the sale of assets.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, its actual operating profit was $218,000, of which we have income from short term deposits. So if it had just closed down the operation and left the money in the bank, it would have made a profit of close on $508,000, which was its income from short term deposits. This other revenue took up what one might call extraordinary items of $1.335m. Yet notwithstanding that, it ended up with an operating profit of only $218,000. Clearly, this organisation continues to lose money. One wonders what the Government sees in this organisation and why it retains it. I urge the Government to adopt our policy and sell this organisation as soon as it can find a buyer. Mr Barry Ireland, the new managing director, the new chief executive officer, might find himself very fortunate because as soon as we get into government we intend offering this organisation for sale. We will start by offering it to the officers of the organisation. So Mr Barry Ireland might ultimately come to own an organisation which, on the basis of the report, has returned to financial viability.

         —I think the Senate is aware that at the time the Education for Active Citizenship in Australian Schools and Youth Organisations report was brought down, several months ago, it was acknowledged generally as being an extremely important report. Indeed, it was my privilege to raise the question of the need for an inquiry into active citizenship, and to place the matter before the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The reference was received most enthusiastically. It was a pleasure and a privilege to work on the reference over the months that we did and then to be a party to the report. I welcome the Government's response to the report although, in some respects, I am a little disappointed with that response. In essence it is a positive response, and for that we can be grateful.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Most of the public comments, and the comments made within this chamber, in relation to the report have acknowledged the fact that it focused on an aspect of Australian society which was absolutely vital to the survival of democracy as we know it. Democracy is about people participation. In other words, it is about active citizenship. The inquiry revealed that Australians are not well equipped, or well motivated to be active and effective citizens. In that respect, therefore, a true democratic process is denied us. There can be no true democracy without truly intelligent, active and informed citizenship. The Government, in its response to the report, acknowledges the essential validity of that observation. It commits itself to the recommendations of the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The one aspect of the Government's response which is probably a little disappointing is that the Government commits itself only indirectly. It commits itself by acknowledging the significance of this report, supporting the recommendations verbally and making suggestions and recommendations to States that certain actions should be undertaken, but abstains from committing itself in any truly effective way. In the final analysis, if this report is to be successfully implemented it is important that the Federal Government undertake the direct, active promotion of the type of citizenship which will maintain a vital democracy for us. It is important that the Federal Government be directly involved with and committed to the process. It is important that the Federal Government commit funds to the process. All that is contained within this Government response to the report is a commitment in principle. I believe that the Senate should press the Government for a commitment through action.

       <para>
        I wish to make a few brief remarks concerning aspects of the reform of Commonwealth superannuation and, in doing so, draw attention to the fact that I am hopeful that this will go some way towards restoring morale in the Public Service, which under this Government has reached an all time low. The superannuation scheme as it has existed has been known for some time not to satisfy the needs of people who are genuinely in the scheme in that about only one-third of people actually receive benefits under it in a legitimate way. It was subject to great abuses by way of people retiring from the Service due to invalidity at a rate that is at least 10 times higher than that of the private sector. Following the creation of the new superannuation scheme, offers will be made to existing members to leave the existing scheme and to enter the new scheme; and additional benefits will make it attractive for them to so do. But the important question of the ability to leave the scheme due to being an invalid still will remain a problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        An interesting statement appears at page 161 of Reform of Commonwealth Superannuation:
       </para>
       <para>
        Invalidity rates for the CSS as a whole have in the past been up to 10 times higher than in the private sector. However, in 1987-88 data show considerable improvement, and when Telecom and Australia Post (which have higher invalidity rates) are excluded from the data, the rates are about 5 times the private sector average.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very simply that means that the abuse by Telecom Australia and Australia Post has been in excess of 10 per cent and, indeed, the plan is for both Telecom and Australia Post to create their own schemes and funds and for employees to be offered membership of those funds. It is to be hoped that the terms of those funds will be such that the rate-and that rort, if you like-will be cut back. It is of concern that the Government has known of these statistics for so long and yet has not addressed them until now. The document goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The costings assume that these improvements will be sustained in the current CSS, and that invalidity rates will be further reduced by about 40 per cent (to about three times the private sector average) in the new scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        That remains a matter of some concern. Why should the invalidity rate be three times the rate of the private sector? I cannot really believe that people in the public sector will remain three times as ill or infirm as those in the private sector just as it was untenable to say that they were likely to be 10 times as ill or infirm under the previous scheme. The major mechanism which the Government is using to curtail these rorts is that no longer will it be the employer who will make the decision about whether someone can be invalided out; it will be the trustee. So the criterion will be much stricter. I hope that one would aim to have the rate of people retiring due to illness being on a par with the private sector and not three times that rate, as the reform document predicates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several other initiatives which are part and parcel of this new scheme are to be commended including the introduction of competitive attitudes. The fact that the fund, however, is still not to be fully funded is to be deplored and, indeed, is disappointing. Whereas various State superannuation funds were moving to become fully funded until the last superannuation changes when various State funds decided they could not afford the additional 15 per cent tax that would be imposed on them, nonetheless, one State, New South Wales, has still decided--

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As Senator Bishop has already commented on those statistics, I will not weary the Senate by repeating them. But I draw attention to them again because, as the Senate will recall, in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, issued by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) on 12 October, invalid pensions was one area where some relatively minor savings were predicated. We were not saying that any person genuinely in need of an invalid pension would be deprived of it; rather, we were of the view that there is a degree of abuse and fraud of welfare provisions which we propose not to tolerate any longer.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have estimated that the degree of such fraud is relatively minor-some 7.5 per cent. But if we take the Commonwealth Public Service as being in any way typical of the community as a whole-Senator Bishop has pointed out that it is far from typical in that regard, and I concede that-if anything, our estimates have been understated. The Minister is pointing out a gigantic abuse of the invalidity provisions in this area under his control, and that speaks volumes about the manner in which the Government has been administering the invalidity areas of the welfare provisions.

        I have pleasure in moving that the Senate take note of the first annual report of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission; and I wish to refer to the Commission's role. The document says that the role is one of coordination rather than direct management. The Commission works in conjunction with four governments, which is in itself a great achievement. All governments involved in this cooperative approach to the problems of the Murray-Darling should be congratulated, because it is vital that the four States involved work in unison.
       </para>
       <para>
        A council has been established to develop and implement an integrated management plan for long term sustainable development of the basin's resources. The Murray-Darling basin encompasses most of New South Wales, a portion of Queensland, all of northern Victoria, and some areas east of Adelaide in South Australia; a total of 1.06 million square kilometres, or 14 per cent of Australia's land mass. We are talking about an area that is very large and that produces the bulk of Australia's agricultural and horticultural products. It supports one-half of the country's sheep and crop lands and a quarter of its dairy farms and cattle. Of the 1.6 million hectares of land irrigated in Australia, 1.2 million hectares are located in this basin. The Commission's activities, therefore, are wide reaching.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most critical problem to which a solution must be found is the salinity management of the two rivers. It is tackling this problem on a number of fronts: through salinity and drainage strategy, a natural resources management strategy, a Murray-Darling basin hydrology study and various conferences that provide a forum for an exchange of ideas and publicity for the Commission's work.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is pleasing to read that salinity mitigation schemes kept 191,000 tonnes of salt from entering the Murray in 1987-88. The Commission's objectives are to improve water quality in the river for all uses: agricultural, environmental, urban, industrial and recreational. It also aims to control land degradation and to rehabilitate existing degraded lands to ensure sustainable utilisation of the lands in the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report will provide a useful resource document on issues such as salinity levels and water flow levels at various points along the river system. It also lists fauna and flora in the region and various land degradation problems found in the region.

        I pay tribute to the work of Professor John Burton, who was the first person appointed to the community advisory committee of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. I commend the report and congratulate the Commission on the job it has done so far.

         —I should also like to speak to the first report of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. I welcome the initiative of the governments concerned to come together and consider more than the old River Murray Commission, which simply determined the distribution of water between the States but was not able to determine the quality of water. This Commission goes a great deal further than that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I cannot help but note that many of us in the conservation movement worked for many years before governments in various States responded and created this Commission. It has been clear for a very long time that the Murray-Darling basin was being degraded, particularly with the rising salt levels in much of the soil. The report points out that much of the area has been under the sea in times past, and there is an extremely saline aquifer underlying the area. The combination of irrigation and clearance along the Murray has led to very serious problems of salinisation and rising salt water tables.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned that, until quite recently, in South Australia the clearing of much of the Murray Mallee lands was continuing. Colleagues of mine who work in the Engineering and Water Supply Department in South Australia have drawn my attention to the fact that much of the fairly recently cleared land is underlain with salt and that the salt table has risen. It has created a large salt wedge which in some places runs back from the Murray River as much as 50 kilometres, and that wedge is slowly moving towards the river. Virtually irrespective of what is done now, the levels of salt are likely to rise as a consequence of that. The problem is one of very long term management.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been slow in instituting proper management. In recent years we have seen some rather undesirable plans for managing this problem by engineering. In the early 1970s I remember that a report by engineers Gutteridge Haskins and Davey Pty Ltd suggested that the solution to the problem of salinity was to dig a drain parallel with the river, to send the fresh water down the drain, put all the salt water drainage back into what remained of the river, and essentially turn the river into a drain. We have moved on from that, but I am concerned when I read that the salt interception schemes are not designed to remove the salt from the area, but only to move it away from the direct areas of irrigation. I wonder about the long term consequences of leaving the salt in the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must also reflect on the fact that much of the irrigated area, particularly in South Australia, is used for the growing of citrus. At present we have a system in which the importation of orange juice is severely undercutting the production of orange juice from that indigenous source. It seems that on the one hand we may well have severely compromised an environment, and on the other hand we are adopting economic and trade policies which are likely to destroy the very industry that we have established as a consequence of this irrigation program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The work that has gone on in the Murray has severely interfered with a number of native species. The Murray cod is in dire straits. I noted also, rather surprisingly, a press report the other day which said that the Queensland Department of Primary Industries has gone so far as to introduce the Murray cod into the Cooper River. I would have thought, at a time when we know a lot about the transfer of species into alien environments, that that should have been given a great deal more thought. The Murray-Darling basin is clearly an important catchment. It is being managed now as a total catchment and that is desirable. But the Murray-Darling basin will require very careful and long term management and I hope it gets it.

        Aboriginal people are concerned that, although we are told in reports such as this one that the death is a consequence of official neglect, no charges are being laid and everything seems to be proceeding as usual. Only in yesterday's edition of the Canberra Times an article stated:

        Dermot Pidgeon was found hanging by a sheet from the bars of his cell door when cells were being opened at 7.15 a.m. . . . the time of death was estimated to be around 9 p.m. on Saturday night.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that yesterday the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody began an inquiry at Wiluna in Western Australia into the death of Robert Anderson who died in the Wiluna police lock-up somewhere between 12 noon on 27 February and 7 a.m. on 28 February 1983. There was no report in the newspapers and there was no State inquest into that death in custody. No cause of death was recorded and an attempt was not made to explain it.
       </para>
       <para>
        It we look at the report on John Raymond Pilot we find that Commissioner Wyvill describes Pilot as an Aboriginal who had died alone-a 33-year-old unemployed homeless Aboriginal man with a serious history of alcohol abuse. He describes the cause of death as `asphyxia brought about by a fit following a complete withdrawal of alcohol'. Commissioner Wyvill states that Pilot died in the Brisbane watch-house, which is run by the Queensland Police Force, as a consequence of official neglect. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The place where he was incarcerated, the system of purported checks on prisoners and the neglect by senior watchhouse staff all contributed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The five recommendations of Commissioner Wyvill are in keeping with recommendations made in previous reports. First, he recommends that a log or record should be completed by an officer before he finishes his period of duty. Secondly, he recommends that where, in the course of an investigation, an explanation is required of a police officer's conduct, that officer should immediately provide such an explanation in the form of a signed statement. Thirdly, he recommends that a police investigation of a death in custody should be conducted by a commissioned officer who should make a full inquiry. Fourthly, he recommends that a police officer whose conduct is likely to be the subject of inquiry should not under any circumstances take an active part in the investigation. Fifthly, he recommends that no prisoner should be so isolated from his gaolers that neither he nor those nearby can summon their assistance.

        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate the thrust of the report of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. Once again, there has been an unsatisfactory resolution between the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, appointed by this chamber, and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) in respect of the appropriations for the funding of the Department of the Senate for the forthcoming financial year. The President says in the report:
       </para>
       <para>
        In its Eleventh Report to the Senate, presented on 1 September 1988, the Appropriations and Staffing Committee reported that the procedures laid down by the Senate in its resolution of 2 December 1985 for the determination of appropriations for the Senate had not been followed, in that appropriations determined by the Committee had been reduced by the Minister for Finance without the required consultation shortly before the introduction of the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1988-89.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Appropriations and Staffing Committee met and, within the terms of the resolution, determined the funding requirements that it judged would be required for the efficient administration and the discharge of duties and responsibilities of the Department of the Senate. The Minister for Finance responded arbitrarily at the eleventh hour-dare I say he responded capriciously to the President, as Chairman of the Committee-to say that he had unilaterally taken it upon himself to determine that the funding would be decidedly less that what was determined by the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 2 December 1985, Estimates Committee A, which at that time was chaired by Senator Richardson, agreed to a resolution which was adopted unanimously by the Senate. That resolution provided that the level of funding for the appropriation for the Department of the Senate shall be determined by the Senate on the advice of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. That was a sensible resolution in terms of arriving at a solution to the funding requirements of parliamentary departments. Quite obviously, if it is left exclusively in the hands of the government there is no separation between the Executive and the Parliament and the Parliament has, in an obsequious way, to go to the government cap in hand, begging for adequate funds to allow it to fulfil its obligations, which include proper examination and scrutiny of the conduct of the government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Walsh himself voted for that resolution, the motion having been carried more than once. Last year when I asked Senator Walsh why he had not chosen to raise his hand or signal his dissenting voice in the face of an affirmative vote by his own Party and the Government, he said that he treated the resolution with the same contempt then as he did at the time I asked him the question. In more recent times, on 26 October 1988, Senator Walsh tells us, he wrote to the President as Minister for Finance, stating:
       </para>
       <para>
        As you would be aware it is the Government's prerogative to advise the Governor-General with respect to his recommendations concerning Appropriation Bills, pursuant to Section 56 of the Constitution. And, of course, it is the Government's responsibility also to raise the associated revenue. Given these responsibilities of the Executive, as Minister for Finance, I could not agree to a process whereby the Parliament was able to determine aggregate funding for its own purposes, particularly in the absence of adequate external consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, Senator Walsh was saying, `I have total and absolute disregard and disrespect for the resolution and for the proposition that the Parliament appropriate its own funding'. Senator Walsh seems to ignore the fact that the appropriations are passed by the Parliament, not by the Executive. They may be brought into the Parliament by way of legislation, but they can be passed only with the approval and the vote of the Senate. Senator Walsh telling us that it is the responsibility of the Executive demonstrates or highlights in a subliminal way the attitude of the Executive, particularly Senator Walsh, towards the functioning and the processes of our system of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the President was obliged to report to the Senate last year that the due processes as set out in the resolution had failed. They covered a number of steps. In the event that the Minister for Finance did not agree with the Appropriations and Staffing Committee there were to be mechanisms to overcome those problems. There were solutions by way of meetings, arrangements, discussions and negotiations and it is set out very clearly how the problems would be overcome. Senator Walsh put that all aside, as did the Government, and chose at the very last minute-notwithstanding the belief of officers of the Department of the Senate that they had had meaningful and realistic discussions with officers of the Department of Finance; they believed that they had an understanding as to what the level of funding ought to be-to send a letter in the mail to departmental officers which said, `All bets are off. This is what I have decided you can have for the functioning of the Department of the Senate'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps I would have slightly less pain if I had not heard Senator Walsh say in this Parliament on one occasion, when there was a suggestion of a new select committee to inquire into a certain matter-as I recall it was a matter which arose as a result of legislation-that he would make sure there was not sufficient funding to allow the committee to function. Senator Walsh was taking us back to the days of the Stuart kings whereby he would decide on the capacity of the Parliament to function in the appropriate way.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having gone through all those painful steps, the President reporting to the Parliament and his report being unanimously adopted, we faced the prospect of the same thing happening this year. The President, anticipating some problems, wrote to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, on 9 July this year. He asked that a well-briefed, informed Minister of the Crown from the Senate, representing the Government, attend the meetings and the deliberations of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee so that he could express the views of the Government-whether it be in detail or in general policy-and understand the reasons for determinations and deliberations of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee. Senator Button appointed Senator Bolkus, who came along for his sins and who gave me the impression-I hope that I was not hoodwinked-that he was across the broad issues that were confronting the Committee. He raised a number of matters which were discussed in an amicable, sensible and appropriate way and the resolution for the level of funding came to pass without any acrimony or disagreement from Senator Bolkus or various members of the Committee. Those meetings took place on 5 and 7 June. Against my better judgment, the Committee cut $800,000 from the first bid. That shows the naivety, or perhaps the decency-or perhaps a combination of both-of members of that Committee. As I recall it, that $800,000 came from the creation of positions that had not been filled. We resolved that we would seek appropriations only at levels at which we were certain they would be expended and the outlays absorbed in a very tangible way.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 16 June, just a week or so later, about two months before the Budget was to be introduced, the President wrote to the Minister for Finance setting out the resolution of the Committee and giving him very considerable detail as to the determination of the appropriations. On 2 August, some six weeks after the President had written to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Finance wrote back-it was his first direct, or, I suspect, indirect, communication with the Committee-simply saying that he did not agree with the determination of the Committee and was lopping off a hulking $1.8m. This was on 2 August, the very eve of the introduction of the Budget-at the eleventh hour. At that stage it was totally impossible for the Committee to have any meaningful discussions or consultations with the Minister or his Department. It was a fait accompli; we were being told by the Minister that that was it.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the whole mechanism, the whole pro- cess, failed again, notwithstanding the fact that voluminous correspondence had been entered into between the President, the Minister for Finance and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button. It was as if the whole process had not taken place. Senator Walsh simply wrote back six weeks later saying, `$1.8m is coming off', for all sorts of obscure reasons. The President, with indeterminable patience, responded by writing to the Minister for Finance, reminding him of the resolution of the Senate. We got no proper response to the resolution of the Senate of 2 December 1985 because the Minister for Finance had already expressed his attitude, which was one of contempt and total disregard. Presumably he was representing the views of the Government. Nothing further happened.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in an almost farcical sense of goodwill, spirit of cooperation and absurd naivety the Committee determined to meet the Minister for Finance and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button. A number of members of the Committee sought to go along and the Secretary of the Committee, Mr Terry Brown, was given the responsibility of arranging a date on which the Committee could meet with the Minister for Finance. Notwithstanding numerous phone calls and, as I recall it, numerous letters, the Minister for Finance refused-there is no other way of putting it-to meet the Committee. He was just unavailable. The lights were on but nobody was home. He was just not interested in meeting the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think Senator Button then prevailed in some way or another. I wrote to the Secretary of the Committee and said, `On my behalf please withdraw any further communications as I do not propose to be a member of a committee that is treated with the contempt that we are or a committee that has to seek, in this absurd and benign fashion, to make communications with the Minister for Finance, only to be treated with contempt'. The same day as I delivered my letter to the Secretary he told me that the Minister for Finance had agreed to a meeting. That was between six weeks and two months after the Committee had first sought to have a meeting with the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose it could be said that that meeting was of some benefit because at least it seemed to settle the Department of Finance, which clearly did not understand how part of the calculations had been done. I think one of the matters raised by the Minister for Finance was the question of inflation. We had accommodated inflation in a different way. But at the end of the day there was no satisfactory resolution as to the bottom line figure. The Minister for Finance persisted with the view that his chosen level of funding was appropriate for the Department of the Senate. I, for my part, at least will be watching the Supplementary Estimates with a great deal of care to see whether they take up the difference, in small or large part, or totally, between the determination of the Minister for Finance and that of the Committee. The Minister has proposed a new mechanism for establishing funding which includes setting a baseline figure. I know of no reason why it has taken all this time-except for the contempt the Minister has for the Committee-to come up with that determination.
       </para>
       <para>
        There appears to be a lack of understanding by the Minister or his departmental officers as to how the Department of the Senate can arrive at a real, practical, permanent and ongoing baseline figure, given that the Department has only recently moved into a new building. There is simply no point in setting last year's figure as the base figure if it bears no relationship to the additional encumbrances and added costs associated with this building, or if last year's figure-as it was-was simply an arbitrary figure chosen by the Minister for Finance in respect of certain items. For instance, it was judged by the Appropriations and Staffing Committee that it was not unreasonable that each senator of the Commonwealth Parliament ought to have a facsimile machine in his office-a simple, normal piece of equipment for communications that middle management in private enterprise would have. We were advised by the Minister for Finance that machines had not been requested by the House of Representatives; therefore, they were inappropriate and unnecessary for senators.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I inquired as to how the funding levels were arrived at by the House of Representatives I discovered that it does not have an appropriations and staffing committee; it has consultations between the Speaker and the Minister for Finance. If the Minister for Finance tells the Speaker that members of the House of Representatives are not to have facsimile machines, they are not included in the Budget. The base figure for the House of Representatives is arrived at by the Minister for Finance; so it is absolutely absurd for him to say that, because the House of Representatives does not need facsimile machines, they are inappropriate for the Senate. It has been the arbitrary decision of the Minister for Finance, not the decision of members of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        More particularly, in terms of our problems, the real difficulty is to establish a baseline figure which is real and relevant to the functioning of the Department of the Senate in this building-a figure which is at appropriate, proper and reasonable levels, certainly levels that do not bear a relationship to past circumstances. In the eight or nine years that I have been in this Parliament it has been my view that the Department of the Senate has always struggled on a budget decidedly less than necessary for ordinary and reasonable functioning of the Department, and not least the functioning of the chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know where this will lead us next year. It might simply be that more than half of the senators will amend the Appropriation Bill-which they are entitled to do-and Senator Walsh will find out who ultimately determines the level of funding. But let us hope that, for once, commonsense will override arrogance and we will get a level of funding which is not only appropriate but also highly desirable for the Senate.

        The report deals with the proceedings of the Second Conference of Australian Delegated Legislation Committees, held in Parliament House from 26 to 28 April this year. Honourable senators will recall that, at its conclusion, Senator Patterson and I reported to the Senate on the conference, which was opened by His Excellency the Governor-General, who was introduced to delegates by the President. This was the first time that the Governor-General, in his capacity as Governor-General, conducted a function in this Parliament House. I also reported on the conference in the usual statement to the Senate at the end of the previous sittings.
       </para>
       <para>
        My clearest memory of the conference was the intensity of activity required by members of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. This involved looking after some 50 delegates from the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory and all States, except Tasmania-whose delegates had to withdraw due to the State election-and three overseas countries. As well as the speech by the Governor-General, major speeches were delivered by speakers of the calibre of the Legal Adviser to the Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan; the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor Dennis Pearce; the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, His Honour Justice Trevor Hartigan; the chairmen of two State delegated legislation committees, Ken Jasper, member of the Legislative Assembly, from Victoria and Bob Hetherington, member of the Legislative Council, from Western Australia; and a former Chairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Austin Lewis. Each speech was followed by lively discussion. Both the Deputy Chairman, Senator Bronwyn Bishop, and I conducted several working sessions. Other members of the Committee-Senators Giles, McMullan, Patterson and Stone-conducted working sessions, led discussions, introduced speakers and hosted functions. The report includes a transcript of the entire proceedings of the conference and the text of papers received. It also distils the main issues and questions which emerged. I commend the report to honourable senators as an affirmation of bipartisan commitment to the parliamentary process. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a tabling statement.

       The First Conference of Australian Delegated legislation Committees, held in Brisbane in 1986, provided Australian parliamentarians who scrutinise delegated legislation with an opportunity to exchange ideas and opinions, and renew their support for each other in the task of bipartisan, technical, legislative scrutiny. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances wished to continue this desirable practice and in December 1988 offered to host the Second Conference in Canberra in April 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee invited the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and all Australian state and territory parliamentary committees involved in scrutiny of delegated legislation to participate in the Conference. The Committee also sent invitations to all Commonwealth Parliamentary Association branches to participate at the Conference as active observers. As a result of these invitations, delegations attended from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. (A delegation from Tasmania was unable to attend due to the holding of a State election). Observer delegations attended from the Parliaments of Botswana, the British Virgin Islands and New Zealand. In all 10 Parliaments were represented by a total of 49 delegates.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Conference was held in the Main Committee Room of Parliament House, Canberra. By the courtesy of the President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, the full facilities of the Commonwealth Parliament were available for the Conference and the delegates.
      </para>
      <para>
       The President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, welcomed the delegates and introduced the Governor-General, His Excellency the Hon. Bill Hayden. The President emphasised the significance of legislative scrutiny committees given the complexity of executive government and increasing demands on parliamentary time.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Governor-General, His Excellency the Hon. Bill Hayden, formally opened the Conference. This was, in fact, the first official duty of the recently appointed Governor-General in the new Parliament House since his swearing-in. In his speech to delegates, Mr Hayden stated that, despite fears about the decline of Parliament, the parliamentary institution retained its vigour in the work of its committees. Delegated legislation was an extremely important tool of modern governmental administration and parliamentary scrutiny of it assumed great importance because it helped to ensure that the government and its administration did not exceed the powers given to them by Parliament. Mr Hayden also emphasised that, although delegated legislation did not have to pass the scrutiny of Parliament prior to it coming into force, legislative scrutiny committees remained an effective control because their avoidance of party political issues enabled them to work effectively in a spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship against any misuse of power and authority by government.

      <para>
       The Conference passed three resolutions. The first two dealt with the holding of the Third Conference in Perth in 1991. The third resolution was that Committees would report at the Third Conference on:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the nature, the extent and the implications for Delegated Legislation Committees of the proliferation, within the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, of legislative and quasi-legislative instruments which either:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny and control, or
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) whether so subject or not, represent a developing trend in delegated law-making by virtue of their origins, content, presentation or otherwise;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) the extent to which the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories have been able to monitor and scrutinise and where necessary improve by amendment provisions in Bills which confer delegated law-making powers; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) the progress of staged repeal of delegated legislation (where this occurs) and the problems this may have produced for scrutiny committees, and their responses to it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Several major themes emerged during the Conference. Perhaps the most important of these was the role of parliamentarianism in legislative scrutiny. This topic also influenced discussion of other themes which developed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Several delegates mentioned the wide bipartisan support that existed in Parliaments for their Regulations and Ordinances Committees. Committees contribute to the parliamentary institution, with an effectiveness that arises from their avoidance of party political issues. The non-partisan approach of committees provides a truly parliamentary perspective and the committees are, therefore, crucial to the preservation of the parliamentary system.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Conference particularly affirmed the bipartisan nature of relations with ministers and the public service. This was contrasted with the executive and party political threat to parliamentarianism and all that that expression stood for. Senator Austin Lewis concluded that legislative scrutiny committees were the last hope of parliamentarianism because they were possibly the only places where it was still practised. Parliament should be constantly vigilant to protect itself against executive encroachment and executive erosion of parliamentary supremacy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Delegates agreed that terms of reference of delegated legislation committees which provided for scrutiny on the ground that an instrument may trespass on rights and liberties clearly asserted the authority of Parliament over the executive; Parliament was supreme and it was up to Parliament, not governments, to balance conflicting individual and collective rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the Conference resolution indicated, Australian committees were also concerned about the growth and effect of quasi-legislation. One delegate noted a move away from more formal regulatory instruments and commented on the frequently poor drafting and presentation of less formal instruments. Some kinds of ministerial orders were not subject to parliamentary control. One question raised here was the extent to which delegated legislation committees should recommend changes to enabling Acts. Although purely administrative instruments need not come before committees, statutes should not be undone by administrative guidelines. A decline in parliamentarianism could be illustrated by less substance in Acts, the necessary detail being supplied later in the form of binding guidelines or directions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Conference expressed misgivings about the increased use of regulations for policy purposes and the use of non-reviewable, but nevertheless binding, general directions. Whereas previously an Act may have set up broad parameters for regulation, now the regulations were setting up broad parameters for administrative instructions. Provisions should be made for such instructions to come before a committee if it was suspected that the executive was using them to avoid scrutiny. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal looks at instruments which fall short of binding delegated legislative enactments, including departmental practice manuals issued for the guidance of relatively junior officers. The final contributions to the Conference noted a trend to `hollow legislation', where real legislative power was in the regulations and other instruments provided for by an enabling Act (for example the Commonwealth Export Control Act 1982). There was general agreement that effective scrutiny should be expanded over the whole range of quasi-legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Conference devoted considerable attention to the question of scrutiny both of bills and also of Acts. This problem was often seen as related to that of quasi-legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Discussion emphasised the importance of scrutiny of bills, particularly in relation to legislative delegations that might by-pass delegated legislation committees. In this context, principle (d) of the Senate Committee (that delegated instruments should not contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment) was the most subjective of that Committee's principles and, therefore, very difficult to apply ex post facto. The problem could be avoided by more effective limitations on the scope of provisions in bills providing for delegated legislative powers.
      </para>
      <para>
       There was a co-operative partnership between the two Senate legislative scrutiny committees, one dealing with bills and the other addressing the delegated legislation eventually arising from those bills.
      </para>
      <para>
       Scrutiny of bills and delegated legislative scrutiny were seen as inter-dependent and not mutually exclusive, although Senator Lewis commented that ``the jury is still out'' on the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, largely because there was still no practice of the Chairman or other committee members moving and supporting amendments on behalf of that Committee or of the Senate supporting the Committee by always agreeing to proposals arising from the Committee's recommendations on matters of civil liberty or parliamentary propriety. It may be desirable to have a separate committee to deal with scrutiny of bills, rather than for this difficult function to be given to a delegated legislation committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       A deplorable aspect of the preparation and passage of bills was the developing trend towards legislation by `press release' or `legislation by policy statement'. Another problem recurring too frequently was provision in bills for regulations to amend their parent Acts.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was suggested that the regulation provision of an Act should be so drafted as to limit the scope of delegated legislative powers to stated purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is usual to state that delegated legislation committees avoid policy issues as part of their bipartisan role, although this obligation does not prevent the Committee challenging a so-called policy that is obviously and directly an infringement of the Committee's principles. The Committee must pursue its primary responsibility to parliamentary propriety and personal rights and liberties. Scrutiny of legislative policy is, for example, central to the operations of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The Committee does not accept as an excluded matter of policy a ministerial policy to legislate in a way that infringes the Committee's terms of reference.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although it was sometimes difficult to see where policy ended and administration began, the members of the Senate Committee have always avoided party political dispute. The Committee had, however, made important contributions to legislative policy. Some delegates felt that issues of political or paltry policy did not arise when a Committee examined or expressed concern about the regulation-making powers of an enabling Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       The bipartisan success of the Senate Committee was attributed to avoiding scrutiny of the merits of the instruments before it. Ministers had accepted that the Committee was not a threat to policy. Discussion followed on the various attitudes taken by different Committees towards what may be regarded as a policy matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Regulations and Ordinances Committee endeavours to persuade all Ministers that Explanatory Statements should accompany each legislative instrument laid before Parliament. These should explain the background to, and justifications for, the legislation, summarise its provisions and give some indication of the impact of the instrument on those likely to be affected by it. Several of the States, however, have legislative requirements for highly detailed regulatory impact statements and discussion of these was an important topic at the Conference.
      </para>
      <para>
       The desirability of public impact statements was identified as a `major trend' for the next decade. In particular, there was a need to scrutinise the impact of regulatory laws upon the business community. It was suggested that committees retain the services of economic advisers, as well as legal advisers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Statutory requirements for regulatory impact statements and associated mechanisms for public consultation led to discussion of exemption procedures for impact statements, the reaction of ministers and executive procedures for impact statements, the reaction of ministers and executive departments to the new requirements and the relation of impact statements to policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The closing statements included comments on the costs of producing impact statements, their content and drafting requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sunset and sunrise provisions and staged review were of major interest throughout the Conference. As with regulatory impact statements, this was an area in which the States have been notably active and innovative.
      </para>
      <para>
       This general topic, including the concept of total regulatory review, was another identified as a `major trend' for the next decade. Delegates commented on the special unit in New South Wales, separate from the legislative scrutiny committee, which was established to review the number and volume of regulations. The similar Commonwealth Business Regulation Review Unit was also mentioned. The discussion included the reaction of executive departments to sunset provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final statements included several references to the need for review of outdated delegated legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The role of the media also emerged as a theme at the Conference. A related topic was publicity and education about the operations of delegated legislation committees.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was suggested that the media were devoting less time to reporting Parliament, the public service and the relationships between them. Parliamentary committees were now a safeguard in areas where the media were formerly more active. Examples were given of the lack of interest from the media.
      </para>
      <para>
       Seminars to publicise the activities of Committees could be useful in this context. Another proposition was that there should be more educational activity on the role of committees; it was felt that the decline of Parliament would accelerate if the media and the public were uninformed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other issues relating to technical scrutiny by delegated legislation committees arose in the speeches and in discussion. The Conference Report expressly mentions a score of additional questions which were raised by delegates.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Second Conference focused the attention of Australian and visiting Committees on common challenges and problems, particularly the increasing use of quasi-legislation and the need for vigilance in meeting executive encroachments on parliamentary primacy. At the same time, bipartisanship and parliamentarianism were emphasised and confirmed. This emphasis on common threats, common principles and common responses was specially productive and because of the diversity of structures, powers and functions of the different committees whose members met in Canberra to participate at the Second Conference of Australian Delegated Legislation Committees.

       I had the honour to be deputy leader of this delegation. It was a most congenial delegation and we were all surprised to find out that it was the very first parliamentary delegation to go from Australia to England. There have been ministerial visits in the past, but this was the first parliamentary delegation. It was historic in the sense that it took place in our bicentennial year. It was also the year of the international Expo 88 held in Australia; so visits were exchanged, with the Queen of England and the Prime Minister of England coming here for reciprocal functions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Leo McLeay, now Speaker of the House of Representatives, who was then Deputy Speaker, led the delegation in the absence of the Speaker because she was involved in functions dealing with our Bicentennial. We were looked after very well by our Australian High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, the Hon. Doug McClelland, who occupied the chair of the Senate with great distinction for several years. We were all impressed with the relationships he had built up over there. He was given the honour of meeting the teams and kicking off at the football final at Wembley-an honour usually reserved for the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh, which was also congenial as they happened to be in Australia. He was invited to that function and he performed his duties very well. We can all understand that, seeing as he is the No. 1 ticket holder for St. George here in Australia-although he might not want that published too widely at the moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       We met the Foreign Minister of Great Britain which was of interest because honourable senators will remember that the Fijian crisis was at its height at that time. We met the Prime Minister and had discussions with her at No. 10 Downing Street. I must say the setting for Yes, Prime Minister is a very accurate reproduction of the Cabinet room at No. 10 Downing Street. We dealt with important subjects, particularly the detente in eastern Europe and the move towards the Economic Community in 1992 and Australia's position with regard to that. We had discussions with business groups, not only in England but also in Scotland and Ireland, with a view to easing the way for Australian companies to have access to that European Community. It will be an enormous market. There will be 320 million people in a single market by 1992 and it will have enormous effects on world trading.
      </para>
      <para>
       Highlights of the trip included visits to places such as Sellafield. I am sure honourable senators will be interested to read in the report of the plans that Great Britain has, which are well under way, for the disposal of nuclear waste. Great Britain buys a lot of the nuclear waste from around the world, not only its own. It seals it away for future use, and I am sure it will have the corner on the market when it come to recycling nuclear fuel. I am sure that will be an area of interest to honourable senators. Another area of interest was the development of the City of London on the Isle of Dogs. They call it the London port development. It is like a whole new City of London; it is almost as though the centre of London has been moved eight kilometres east. There is an airport right in the middle of it with silent jets taking off every minute for the capitals of Europe. It is gearing up for the cross-Channel tunnel commuter trade with Europe. There is a move towards a high-tech city full of industries dealing with education, banking and communications. I am sure that that is a development that honourable senators would all be interested to see, but they can read about it in the report.
      </para>
      <para>
       We went to Ireland, and I must say it is a beautiful country. We had two Irishmen in the delegation-Senator McKiernan, who comes from Cavan, and Mr Ted Grace from the other House. He is not really Irish; he said he was conceived in Wales and born in Ireland. He enjoyed going home. We saw the beauties of Ireland and also some of the horrors of it. We went up to the border areas which were sad to see. We have reported on that. Any honourable senators who want the details of all of that can get them from the Parliamentary Library. I recommend the report because of the information it contains. We went to see why Ireland is famous for its racehorses. That was an eye-opener. The security on those racehorse studs is like that at Fort Knox. Honourable senators will remember the racehorse Shurgar which was stolen. We went to one of those studs that are now under enormous security. I think there were 67 horses on it and not one of them worth less than $10m. It had its own jet strip so that the horses did not get jet lag when they were taking off to the various major racecourses in Europe. It also had simulated straights of all the main racecourses in the world that these horses were being trained to race on. The horses are apparently bred for the races. They never run the distance that they will have to race over; that is supposed to be bred into them. It seems to be the exact opposite of everything we do in Australia. Perhaps, if we want to learn something about racehorses, we should go to Ireland and see how they do their breeding and training.

       Finally, I would like to express my thanks for the trip not only to the delegation but also to the staff, Michael Talberg and John Porter. They looked after our every want over there. We made the trip as easy as we could for them, but I would like to pay tribute to them for looking after the delegation. I commend the report to the Senate.

        —I had the honour to be part of the parliamentary delegation to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Perhaps the very first thing I should do in speaking to this report is to immediately refute the words of the previous speaker and deputy leader of the delegation, Senator Sheil, who remarked that there were actually two Irishmen on the trip. In actual fact we were all Australians. I think most of us have documentation to prove that we were certainly travelling on Australian passports on behalf of the Australian Parliament. That is not to say that some of us did not have links with Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain.

       It was an historic delegation. I find it particularly surprising that it was the first official parliamentary delegation from this Parliament to the Republic of Ireland. When one considers the links between Ireland and Australia this is an amazing feat. The first reciprocal delegation from Ireland to Australia occurred just a few years ago when a delegation of Irish parliamentarians, led by the then Speaker of the Dail Eireann, Tom Fitzpatrick, arrived in Australia. Mr Fitzpatrick, incidentally, was actually a member of the Irish Parliament representing the town where I was born. It was a very well received delegation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Looking back some 18 months now to when the visit to both countries occurred, one tends to remember the warmest things in the first instance-the enjoyable events. This is not to say that the delegation did not do a considerable amount of work while it was in both countries. An examination of pages 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the report will give those interested an idea and an indication of the level of discussion and dialogue that took place between the delegation and the various representatives of governments, industry and the communities in both countries. We were grateful that each of the parliaments arranged for us to meet people at the highest levels in government. They included the Prime Minister of Britain, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Secretary of Trade and Industry, Lord Young, and so on down the list. To save the time of the Senate I will not go through the complete list.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Ireland we were hosted by and met the Speaker of the Irish Parliament, Mr Sean Treacy, who actually visited Australia for the first time in the second Irish parliamentary delegation last year. We met the President of the Irish Senate. We also met the President of Ireland in his residence in Phoenix Park. We also met the Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr Charles Haughey, who had the honour of being the guest at the first dinner to be held in this new Parliament House. We also met all leaders of the major political parties in Ireland. Part of the delegation broke up and met with representatives of the various political parties in Britain while we were there.
      </para>
      <para>
       We found a tremendously warm feeling for Australia in our travels throughout Great Britain and Ireland that resulted from a very high degree of publicity about Australia in both countries. The television program Neighbours-I will not give a personal opinion on this-was constantly brought to our attention. I was lucky enough to be able to say that I did not get time to watch television and that, even if I did, I would not watch a program of that nature anyway. I was able to evade questions on that program. It is certainly a very popular program in the United Kingdom and in Ireland.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was also the occasion of the Australian bicentennial celebrations, which resulted in a vast degree of interest in Australia and Australian life. Everywhere we went we met people who had relatives here and who were inquiring about them. On some lucky occasions various members of the delegation actually knew relatives of the people who are now resident in Australia. On certain occasions we were lobbied to assist with migration applications from people in both Britain and Ireland wishing to come to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will not go through each and every matter that is raised in the report, but there are a number I do want to refer to. We had a considerable amount of discussion and dialogue in both countries about the agricultural marketing practices of the European Community. The delegation stressed on a number of occasions whenever possible the damage and harm that those policies were doing to Australian agriculture. We said that we had a very productive culture and industry in Australia, yet were being harmed by the policies of a number of countries in Europe. We were listened to. We did not come away from all our discussions with any real hope that these policies would change in the short term. Nonetheless, the views that we expressed were heard and, I am sure, will be taken into consideration when future policies are being developed and when the present policies are being amended from time to time.
      </para>
      <para>
       One interesting discussion we had with the British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, related to the question of Australia obtaining the original of the British Act of Parliament which embodies the Australian Constitution. Our request was not received with any great acceptance by the Prime Minister. She indicated that she would be scared of setting a precedent for other such documents held in Westminster or Britain and would be reluctant to accede to our request. We are following that request through in another manner.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Sheil mentioned our visit to Sellafield, the nuclear power generation plant not far from Carlisle in the north-west of England. For me that was a scary experience, probably matched only by the time when we actually went through a border post going from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland and again when we flew in a light aircraft between the City of Derry and Belfast. We were not scared of being shot out of the air, but were scared of a rapidly approaching storm which was buffeting the aircraft around considerably. The pollution that flowed from that Sellafield power plant into the Irish Sea was a matter that we addressed in Britain and when we were in the Republic of Ireland meeting some Ministers of that Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       A matter that also received quite a deal of attention in London, Dublin, Belfast and Derry was the question of Northern Ireland. The delegation conveyed to both governments the Australian Government's support for the Anglo-Irish accord and the hope that the violence that is on going in that tiny province of Ireland would soon be brought to a conclusion, either by this piece of dialogue or by some other means. It certainly received a great deal of attention. A number of Amnesty International reports on the Northern Ireland situation were brought to the attention of Mrs Thatcher and some of her Ministers. Mrs Thatcher was fairly forceful in her condemnation of what she called terrorist activities within Northern Ireland. Those activities cause sadness to anybody who has a regard for human life. Mr Howe, the Foreign Secretary, called it a crazy conflict between people of the same heritage. At this stage I should like to make a personal observation. It seems crazy but, according to the headlines last week, four prisoners who had been wrongfully gaoled for 15 years were released. Perhaps that is some excuse, but not a total excuse, for the violent activities over there.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are two other matters that I wish to raise in conclusion. Had we been speaking to this report earlier than 18 months since the conclusion of the delegation, I might seek to speak for much longer but, as I say, there are two further matters that I wish to put into the record. The first is the meeting that we had with Mr John Hume, MP, the Leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland. He is a member of both the Westminster Parliament and the European Parliament. I believe personally that he was the most impressive individual whom I met during the whole of the three-week trip. I know that Mr Hume and his policies and attitudes certainly impressed other members of the delegation, irrespective of their political beliefs.

      <para>
       Mr Hume rose to prominence during the civil rights campaigning in the 1960s and, as I said, is a member of both the Westminster Parliament and the European Parliament. He is the only Northern Ireland member of parliament who actually goes around unarmed or without an armed guard to protect him. As we stood on the spot in the City of Derry where, I think, 16 citizens were killed by British troops in 1971, he told us that the reason for his not needing protection was that he was a man of peace and that he could not be a man of peace if he went around carrying an instrument of death. Some members of the delegation, including me, have approached our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to bring Mr Hume to Australia under the distinguished visitors program so that he can speak with the Australian population on the scene in Northern Ireland and perhaps offer some ideas on the resolution of the conflict over there.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Hume stressed to us that the great perception in the community not only in Australia, which is far distant from the British Isles, but also in the British Isles, that it is actually a religious conflict that is occurring in Northern Ireland is not correct. He refuted that suggestion, saying that it is more of a social problem. He pointed out that part of the social problem as it existed in his home city of Derry was that male unemployment was about 50 per cent while the average unemployment level in Northern Ireland, as a total, was 18 per cent. In the hotel in Belfast the delegation discussed with a number of community leaders matters relating to Northern Ireland. We were shown over the western suburbs of that city and shown areas in which 70 per cent of the population is unemployed. It is no wonder there are conflict and concern in that city.

       Senator Sheil mentioned that I originated from Ireland, and it was thanks to the good offices of the Speaker of the Irish Parliament, Mr Sean Treacy, that the delegation visited the town in which I was born. We were very warmly received, despite my initial fright when I saw a policeman waiting at the door of the Town Hall and thought some of the misdeeds of my youth had finally caught up with me, but that was not the case. As I said, we were warmly received by the chairman and members of the Cavan Urban District Council and it was indeed an honour for me to return to the town of my birth as a representative of the Australian Parliament. I thank the representatives of the Australian Parliament for the opportunity to do that. I also thank the Parliament on behalf of those members of my family who remain in Ireland. I have four sisters and a brother, together with their respective spouses and children, still living in Ireland. It was indeed an honour for my family and me that such a reception could be held and that the delegation could be received in such a manner.

       Thanks again to the good offices of Mr Treacy, my family members were allowed to join a dinner given for the delegation by one of the Ministers of the Irish Parliament later that night in my home town. Members of my family were allowed to be part of that celebration. Mr McLeay, the leader of our delegation, afforded me the honour of responding to the speech by Mr John Wilson, Minister for Tourism. While we were in Cavan, each member of the delegation was presented with an illuminated scroll, of which I have a copy in my hand, commemorating the visit by us. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table the scroll and incorporate in Hansard the text of the document given to me by the Cavan Urban District Council.

        —As I was part of the delegation, along with Senator Sheil and Senator McKiernan, I would like to make a few remarks on the visit of that delegation to the United Kingdom and Ireland. As has been said, it was a historic delegation. It was the first time for some 17 years that a delegation from this Parliament had visited Britain and it was the first time ever that a delegation from this Parliament had visited the Republic of Ireland. It is important that contact and links are kept with those two countries, or any country for that matter, especially in view of the number of people who migrate to our country.

We also met Doug McClelland, who is well known to us all in the Senate and who is our High Commissioner in Britain, and he arranged very high level contact between the delegation and people in Britain. In conclusion, I believe that the delegation had a very enjoy- able and harmonious visit, and I commend the report to the Senate.

         —The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 seeks to make a number of significant revisions to the Banking Act. The first main provision of the Bill is to remove all reference in the Act to trading banks and savings banks, a long maintained distinction in the banking sector of this country but one which has become redundant with the passage of time. The Bill replaces those references with general references to banks. Secondly, the Bill seeks to remove division 3 of the Banking Act, the division which concerns the statutory reserve deposit mechanism, and to replace it with a new division 3 concerning what are called non-callable deposits, a term which we have become rather more familiar with in the past couple of weeks because of other matters which I will come to later in my remarks concerning the actions of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). That legislative change will facilitate the phasing down and replacement of the statutory reserve deposits by non-callable deposits.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the Bill provides specific powers for the establishment of prudential requirements concerning the manner in which banks conduct their businesses. The Reserve Bank of Australia has, throughout its existence I suppose, but particularly in recent years since the deregulation of the financial system and in particular the banking system, exercised a considerable degree of prudential supervision over the banking system. But it has done so basically by way of informal contacts and discussions with the banks. This Bill will, in effect, formalise those existing arrangements and give the Reserve Bank powers which it will probably choose not to exercise unless it is called upon to do so but which at least it can fall back upon if necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourthly, the Bill provides the Reserve Bank with powers of investigation into the books, accounts and transactions of banks, including, I should add-and it is an important addition-the ability to obtain information from a bank concerning individual customers. I will come to that point later in my remarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition parties do not oppose the Bill. We will give it a second reading. Basically, it seeks to formalise what is already well established practice for prudential supervision of the banking industry. It also makes some other changes which basically pick up recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System. It is important, however, to note that the Opposition will propose amendments when we come to the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that the Opposition has reservations about those provisions of the Bill, principally clause 16, which provide the Reserve Bank with powers of investigation into the books, accounts and transactions of banks, particularly its proposed ability to obtain information from a bank concerning individual customers where that is required for prudential supervisory reasons. In that respect the Opposition maintains its concern that there are not adequate safeguards in the Bill to prevent the Reserve Bank or its officers from indiscriminately seeking or using information about individual banks or their clients. I will debate that matter at more length when we come to the committee stage. But as I have already foreshadowed, we will move amendments that address that privacy issue. More immediately, we propose to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill which has been circulated. I will mention now the terms of that amendment. We seek to move:

       <para>
        (1) That the Hawke-Keating Government's deal with the four major banks to manipulate the interest rates paid on the new non-callable deposits introduced in this legislation so that home mortgage interest rates would not rise higher than the already record high level, is:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) another desperate deal by a tired and dying Government; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) does nothing to address Australia's fundamental economic problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) That, to reduce Australia's high level of interest rates, the Government must depart from its one-dimensional, tight monetary policy and adopt an integrated policy framework as set out in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        In last year's Budget it was announced that there would be a phasing down of the statutory reserve deposit requirement over three years and the replacement of that system with a system of non-callable deposits. Recently, in a populist move typical of a tired and dying government, the Treasurer jeopardised the integrity of these reforms when he used them as a cover for a $230m per annum deal principally with, almost entirely with, the four major banks-the deal was certainly conducted with those banks, although the $230m will not quite all accrue to those four banks-so that in return the banks would not raise home mortgage interest rates from their already record levels to which the Treasurer's monetary policies have forced them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make it quite plain that, so far as the decision to increase the rate of interest payable to banks on the non-callable deposits from their previous rate of 5 per cent to a level equal to 5 per cent below the treasury note rate is concerned, the Opposition does not question the propriety of that policy decision. What it does question is the egregious deal which the Treasurer entered into at the time, with the arms of the four bank chief executives twisted behind their backs, to require them to give a political quid pro quo for a financial policy decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        That decision, that quite blatant injection of a political consideration into an otherwise purely financial or market operation, has probably done more to damage this Treasurer's reputation and, through him, this Government's reputation in the financial markets not only of Australia but throughout the world than the Treasurer had the slightest concept of at the time he made the deal. He has, of course, obtained a political quid pro quo for it, which I am sure has caused Government members and senators to breathe a sigh of relief because it has assisted in putting off the evil day when, under this Government's policies, this Treasurer's policies, housing loan mortgage rates would otherwise have to be raised even higher than their present 17 per cent. But, in the process, the Treasurer has unsettled conceptions in the markets as to the fiscal or financial integrity of the Government and its policies, and it will pay for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that none of us should have been entirely surprised by the desperation of this move by Mr Keating. After all, it followed similar deals that we have seen from this Government in recent months. We have seen the $60m hand-out to Kodak Inter- national, which has a factory located in the Coburg area of Melbourne. It was previously within the electorate of Wills, but I understand that as a result of the redistribution it is now actually located just outside the electorate of Wills, the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and is in the electorate of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). We have seen that $60 hand-out-without any basis of investigation, review, report or recommendation from the Industries Assistance Commission-to that multinational company, which is competing quite rapaciously with a number of much smaller Australian photographic processing companies, including one within my own area of the Sunshine Coast of Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before that, we saw the Prime Minister's gladhanding approach to his friend and long-time associate, Sir Peter Abeles, through the deal done with the airlines. Through that deal the Government is now, in effect, providing taxpayers' money in order that the airlines will forgo standing down employees who, because of the pilots dispute, could not otherwise be offered gainful employment by the airlines. At the time that deal was done, its cost to the Australian taxpayer was estimated at $100m. That was at a time when the Government was assuring the Australian public that the airline dispute would be over within a relatively short time. I do not know that the Government specifically named a final date, but one would be pardoned for thinking it would have been over a month ago, at least. In fact, it is continuing and there seems to be no end in sight. I can only assume that the cost of that deal is continuing to balloon in line with the length of the dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        During this period we have also seen the flagrant breaking of the word of the Australian Prime Minister given to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in relation to the right to mine for gold, platinum and palladium at the Coronation Hill deposit in the Northern Territory. Not only will that decision bring great discredit to this Government, but it also puts the whole economic future of Australia in jeopardy. I think it was Sir Arvi Parbo who initially stated-and certainly Mr Hugh Morgan of Western Mining Corporation subsequently repeated it-the obvious truism that in the light of the Coronation Hill decision nobody can trust this Government. So true is that assertion that even a senior Cabinet Minister in the present Government, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), was moved to say, on his recent return from overseas-he was not present at the time the Coronation Hill decision was made, although his views were well known-that we cannot go on scaring away capital all the time like this. That was a total breach of Cabinet solidarity for which, we understand, he was reprimanded by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) but for which, nevertheless, he has not felt it necessary to resign from the Cabinet.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding the magnitude and increasing frequency of these totally ad hoc deals done by the Government, they are deals which merely seek to treat the symptoms. They ignore, and continue to ignore, the fundamental problems. For example, the deal that I referred to initially on non-callable deposits, which is one of the subjects of this Banking Legislation Amendment Bill, sought a respite from higher home mortgage interest rates. But that respite is no cure for the problem of which the increasing pressure of mortgage interest rates is but a symptom. The fact is that the record high interest rates are a direct result of the one-dimensional monetary policy of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although we hear a great deal about the level of home mortgage interest rates, and undoubtedly we should continue to hear a great deal about that because it affects a great many people, it should never be forgotten that those interest rates of 17 per cent-I am talking about bank interest rates-are as nothing compared with the height of the interest rates being paid by the 750,000 to 800,000 small businesses in this country. In most cases they are working on overdrafts at anything from 21 per cent to 25 per cent, and they include, but are by no means confined to, many members of the farming community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those interest rates are a direct result of the winding up of the ratchet of high interest rates by this Government, which began as long ago as April of last year and still continues, although the Treasurer assured us last week, or the week before, that there will be no further increase in interest rates. How does he know? How can he give such an assurance if, at the same time, he claims that the Reserve Bank of Australia is independent of the Government, which sometimes he does claim and at other times he denies? We will see tomorrow, when we receive the balance of payments figures for the month of September. Of course, I have no idea what those figures will be, but if they are very bad-the figures for the previous month, August, were disastrous-it is by no means out of the question that we will see higher interest rates, despite what the Treasurer says. In the end, if the foreign creditors who are financing this Government with hot money lose confidence in the Government of this country and its administration, no amount of words from this Treasurer will prevent interest rates from rising higher as those funds flee this country, with effects upon the exchange rate upon which I do not wish to dwell.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer himself has spoken about these matters from time to time. In April this year an article in the Sydney Morning Herald reported him as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Because we cannot risk demand continuing to run ahead at an unsustainable rate we have targeted it with the most effective instrument we have, monetary policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is, as month after month has gone by, we have seen that that instrument is not perhaps as effective as the Treasurer thought it was in restraining demand. That is not altogether surprising because the Treasurer has been speaking on this matter with both forks of his tongue. On the one hand, he has been saying that he has been pushing up interest rates in order to restrain demand. On the other hand, he has been telling people not to be too concerned whether interest rates will go any higher or whether there will be any sort of recession or hard landing. On the contrary, we will get a soft landing and almost nobody will get hurt, according to the Treasurer. Not surprisingly in the light of that, if people believe it, they continue to enter into the same financial arrangements which, with the other fork of his tongue, the Treasurer is seeking to dissuade them from entering into. In any case, four months after the Treasurer made that statement, the Reserve Bank of Australia went on record publicly to disagree with him. In its annual report it is stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond a point, it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types.
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 13 of the annual report the bank goes on to state:
       </para>
       <para>
        Retention of the present stance of policy should produce more significant restraint of spending as 1989-90 progresses.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should do that. However the bank says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether this will also be sufficient to lay the groundwork for winding back the current account deficit-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, of the balance of payments-
       </para>
       <para>
        is uncertain; there are risks that it may not.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Reserve Bank is effectively saying in those passages of its annual report that the current stance of policy with its punishing high interest rates may not even work. But what if it does work? What if, in effect, it brings down total demand within the economy and through that brings down demand for imports and through that brings the balance of payments back-temporarily at any rate-into some better degree of equilibrium than it is displaying at the moment? I remind the Senate that the Treasurer has forecast a balance of payments deficit on current account this year of $18.5 billion. The figures for the first two months-again, I do not know what tomorrow's figures will bring-if one were to take them as any guide to the year, would indicate that that $18.5 billion figure is a serious underestimate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, if monetary policy is at some time during 1990 successful in bringing about some type of recession-which is what the Budget between the lines predicts because of the forecasts in the Budget on a year-on-year basis which implicitly mean that the level of activity over the year will have to drop back very sharply, particularly in the second half of the financial year-what will the situation be? We will be left with a recessed economy, an economy in which activity has been ground down and as a consequence of that-and only as a consequence of that-imports have fallen off sufficiently to make the balance of payments look momentarily somewhat more respectable. But we will have none of the fundamentals dealt with. So that, beyond that point on the basis of the policies of this tired and dying Government, there is nowhere to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the event that one begins to start up the economy again, back will come the flood of imports, back will come the balance of payments to an ever deeper sea of red ink. We will be back to square one. That is what is in store for this country by, roughly speaking-I do not want to be held to be too precise on the exact time-the middle of next year on the basis of present policies. I suppose that will be the inheritance which the present coalition parties will receive when they win the Federal election. The present Hawke-Keating Government has made the economy extremely vulnerable to the harsh winds of the international economy. Again, I quote from the annual report of the Reserve Bank when it talked about those risks that this vulnerability creates. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        These risks will be much greater if there is a substantial slowing of world growth and a decline in commodity prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far we have not seen either of those developments. There are some people who think they discern some slight slowing in the rate of world growth but that is a matter for debate. So far commodity prices have shown some weakening but I would not describe that, as yet, as being a decline. Nevertheless those risks exist. They are out there. None of this Government's policies has taken the slightest heed of them. The fact of the matter is that fundamental structural change of this economy is required. Again, the Reserve Bank pointed to that on page 8 of its report when it stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia needs a major shift of resources into the traded goods sector to stimulate increased exports and, more importantly, to replace imports. This cannot be achieved if domestic demand is growing faster than productive capacity; but simply slowing demand is not enough either. There is also a need for greater productive capacity, improved productivity and a better overall price performance, at least as good as our competitors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The truth is that the Labor Government simply cannot deliver policies of this type because of its close association with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the trade union bosses. Micro-economic reforms, accordingly, under this Government have totally stalled. We have a fiasco on our waterfront. The policies announced recently in that respect by Minister Willis are simply a retreat from reality. We have had some attempt by the Government to look at the disgraceful situation obtaining in our coastal shipping area. Nothing effective has been done.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might say in the concluding minutes I have available to me that the Opposition has, by contrast in its Economic Action Plan unveiled almost a fortnight ago, clearly stated that these are the areas which will be addressed by the Opposition. We made it quite plain that we will not accept, as this Government has, handing out $150m of taxpayers' money in order to get 3,000 members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to retire with golden handshakes averaging $100,000 each in recompense for a life of idleness on the wharves. We will not be content with doing nothing about the situation of cabotage on our coastal shipping. We have given an undertaking that we will phase that out over five years. Some people have criticised us for intending to take five years to do so. I do not back away from that. The Government is doing nothing about it. We have pointed in this area generally not to micro-economic reforms specifically but to the whole area of industrial relations policy-the area which this Government is incapable of tackling because of its incestuous relationship with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        What better illustration of that could there be than the disastrous situation that this country has been subjected to by the pilots dispute? The Government appears to say that it has not even attempted to make any assessment of the economic cost to this country of that now long drawn out dispute which is bidding fair to become the most serious, disastrous industrial dispute in this country's history. We have seen that this Prime Minister's manic determination to smash a particular union-the Australian Federation of Air Pilots-has produced a situation where it is impossible for the employers to talk with the only people who can put the airlines back into the air: namely, their ex-employees, the pilots.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 12 October when we released our economic plan we have had from this Treasurer no responses-or none worth noting. First of all we had a week of silence; then we had a conjured up press conference at which the Treasurer released some scrappy papers purporting to show a hole in the Opposition's costing of $835m. Nobody believes that stuff. I do not want to spend time dignifying it by commenting upon it. The latest element-I will close on this note-in our increasingly desperate Treasurer's attempts to denigrate the Opposition's policy in this area is his suggestion that somehow our decision to abolish the capital gains tax will cost the future governments of this country $25 billion. I can only say that we should be grateful to the Treasurer for telling the Australian taxpayers that he proposes to tax them $25 billion by way of capital gains tax. They will be interested to hear that in the days and months ahead leading up to the election campaign. I do not think that it is a big gesture for the Treasurer to be making that point but, whether it is or it is not, we propose to go ahead and put that particular policy into place as we shall our other policies designed to put Australia back to right.

         —The Bill before the Senate puts in place a number of matters finalising the Government's deregulated bank policy. The Australian Democrats oppose the deregulated model. It has failed, it has played into the hands of banks and it has given rise to the desperate plight of many ordinary Australians at the hands of the banks of this country in their unfettered greed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats will oppose the Bill at the second reading stage but the Bill will pass with the Government and the Opposition acting together in the interests of greedy banks and contrary to the interests of ordinary Australians on this issue. They have done this previously. We will propose a significant second reading amendment, which will be moved by Senator Coulter, and a series of vitally important amendments in the committee stage, which will be moved by Senator Powell.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides a timely and most welcome opportunity to address on behalf of Australians the question of the state of Australian banking since deregulation in 1984-85. In principle, it would seem obvious that deregulation was about increasing competition between Australian banks and opening up the banking industry to competition from overseas banks that would come on-shore and take their place in this newly deregulated, more competitive market. Instead of that, we have seen the very opposite. We have seen the arrival of relatively few overseas banks into our newly deregulated market. We have seen the situation where the established banking giants in this country have behaved like a cartel, which is in contravention of the Trade Practices Act. Instead of having a more competitive, open market, ordinary Australians are being ripped off unmercifully and bled white by powerful, profit-hungry banks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The deregulation of the financial system and the admission of foreign banks was supposed to provide, through competition, a better service to bank customers. While it is possible to argue that corporate customers have benefited from being able to borrow overseas via their Australian banks and customers with large amounts of money to invest now have a bigger variety of investments to choose from, the average customer, the ordinary Australian, and those with relatively small amounts in their savings accounts, are dramatically worse off in a deregulated banking situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the name of efficiency or user pays, banks are charging fees on small accounts, while people with lots of money can still get free services. Mortgage interest rates are crippling many home owners, yet the banks complain that these rates are too low compared with the rates paid by corporate borrowers. The banks are also encouraging the Government to drop the 13.5 per cent ceiling for those who borrowed to buy a home under their control. Somehow this is supposed to benefit the home buyer-so it is argued by the greedy banks in the contemporary Australian banking industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the area of home loan interest rates the Government has at least recognised that deregulation does not work. In 1986 a ceiling was put on interest rates paid by those who had already borrowed. In other words, the Government began to intervene and contravene its philosophy of deregulation-rightly so, we believe. We cite as a contradiction the Government's action this year when it bought off the banks with some $200m of taxpayers' money, from people who are already being bled dry as borrowers from banks but who are also taxpayers who are footing the $200m subsidy to banks, to allow them to keep down their mortgage interest rates and to look better, to further con those whom they are already bleeding dry.
       </para>
       <para>
        This allowed the Government to put a 17 per cent ceiling on the home loan interest rates charged by the four big banks. This is all very well for those who have borrowed from these banks, but it does nothing for people who have borrowed from building societies, credit unions and State banks. I believe that there are more people in the latter category than in the former. However, at least we have an admission from the Government, in the form of this deal with the banks, that financial deregulation is not benefiting the hundreds of thousands of Australians who recently bought a home or cannot afford to buy one.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surprisingly, given that people have been deregulated out of home ownership, neither the Liberal and National parties nor the Australian Labor Party have been prepared to modify their deregulatory obsessions. Neither the Government's last Budget nor the Peacock alternative addresses this problem. The parties have entered into a competition to produce even bigger Budget surpluses but have produced no policies to help people buy a home. We are told that bigger surpluses are good for the economy, but there is little evidence to support this. Certainly, the Tweedledum and Tweedledee economics of Liberal versus Labor is of benefit primarily to the banks; there is no disputing that reality.
       </para>
       <para>
        People complain about the bad services provided by these deregulated banks. With plenty of new services-ATMs, EFTs and credit at the drop of a hat-we are being induced to accept what they call credit. Credit is actually debt. We are being conned into a mounting debt, which we then have to service month after month, year after year, decade after decade, which drains the economy and drains the community of the very resources that would otherwise have been used to stimulate growth and remain competitive in the world markets. And we wonder why we are not competitive and why we have our international balance of payments problems!
       </para>
       <para>
        We are conned into quick fix credit solutions to our monetary problems. What has happened to the concept of saving and the positive aspect of banking? Why over the past two or three decades have we been conned into believing that banks are all about credit-namely, all about debt-and no longer about the positive aspects of banking, the creation of real wealth, namely, saving? What happens when customers complain that they have been billed for something they did not get, that the automatic teller machine has made a mistake, that they do not understand why they have incurred a particular bank charge, or that they have been misled about the rate of interest their savings will earn? People in that position are up against a monolith that has massive legal resources on top and staff who do not understand what services the banks are providing or charging for today. People are confused, bewildered and disillusioned about banking as it exists in the deregulated situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Banks are about profit in the deregulated situation, and they are doing it extremely well. They are the great profit makers, in an economic climate which, we are constantly told by governments and oppositions, requires restraint; in an economic climate in which any small business person in Australia will tell us it is virtually impossible to survive. But the banks survive. Under the new ethos of profitability, let us look at how well the banks survive. They describe their profits as super profits; that is their term. It was used by Mr Argus, the manager of finance at the National Australia Bank, in a confidential memo that I tabled in this Senate in April. He used the expression `super profits'. He emphasised the importance of disguising from the public the magnitude of these super profits. But the banks cannot disguise the magnitude of them. They have to declare their profits. For instance, Westpac Banking Corporation had to declare its profit of $594m in 1988. The National Australia Bank Ltd had a profit of $531m and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd a profit of $535m.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1988 the Commonwealth Bank had a profit of $365m. This bank-the people's bank-has just announced a 74 per cent increase on that profit of 1988. It obscenely announced that increase in profit in the same week as it accepted its portion of the $200m taxpayers' handouts which it has used to subsidise its mortgage interest rates at a level that made it appear constrained and reasonable. It announced that 74 per cent increase in profit in the same month as it reappointed its Managing Director on a 100 per cent increase in salary-a salary of $250,000 a year. Yet we are whistling through our teeth about pressure from pilots for a 30 per cent increase in salary. Parliamentarians are asked by the same Prime Minister who prevails over this farce to forgo for the sixth time in three years increases in salaries. Mr Don Sanders could give himself a 100 per cent increase in salary from this 74 per cent increase in profits of the people's bank and be paid $250,000 a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is happening at exactly the same time as these banks are arguing that they cannot function on margins between borrowing and lending of 3 to 7 per cent. Yet it has been found that those profit margins are twice those which sufficiently satisfy the needs of international banks overseas. The three major international Swiss banks operate on profit margins which are half of what these greedy, money profit grabbing banks demand in Australia in the so-called competitive deregulated situation into which this Government has put us and which this Opposition would be quite happy to maintain. The banks are running riot in this deregulated Australian bank industry that we have today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Banks have a three-way privilege. It has been known for a long time, of course, that banks have the greatest power on earth-the power to create money. The first privilege that banks have is the power to create what they call credit. But this is actually a debit entry in the borrower's book in the bank. It is a debt. By the process of creating credit-money-banks entice us into debt. Then they bleed us by servicing those debts. If we happen to have a mortgage, we are bled at the rate of 17 to 18 per cent. If we happen to have an overdraft-and we know the rate at which we are bled in this respect-the rate is somewhere between 21 per cent and as high as 30 per cent. The confidential Argus memo which I tabled in this chamber in April revealed that to be the case. In fact, it revealed that the National Australia Bank did not even know the rate at which we were being bled in terms of overdrafts. It was embarrassed by what it found. But we are being bled white by this second privilege that banks have.
       </para>
       <para>
        But then comes the crunch. If one cannot service this debt-and hundreds of thousands of Australians cannot now service their interest-if one cannot give any more blood, the bank can move in and foreclose. It can take one's home, farm or business. Having created the debt in the first place, the bank can bleed its customers by servicing that debt and finally it can deliver the ultimate insult by taking the asset away if the debt cannot be serviced. That is power; that is banking. That is the power that gives rise to the obscene profits with which average Australians are confronted in this country today.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have not even talked about the fact that we do not know what we are being charged by the banks. Let me cite the example of the businessman in Tasmania who operates three bank accounts and has challenged his last 35 miscellaneous bank charges. All of these charges have been withdrawn. Let me cite the case of a large corporate bank account holder which queried an entry of $28,000 for miscellaneous bank charges against its enormous account. The bank said that it had made a mistake-forget it. Let me cite the case of a woman in Tasmania who thought she had made arrangements by phone for an account to be transferred from a Melbourne account to a Hobart account. She actually wrote eight cheques against that account, none of which were more than $40. All of the cheques were bounced by her bank and she was charged $25 on each of them. She was not allowed to enter into a dispute. She had no right of reply. Let me cite the case of a pensioner in Tasmania who was charged $15 because he failed to sign a cheque. He forgot to do so. The cost to the bank was a phone call or a stamp; the cost to the pensioner was $15. Such examples are endless. Bank charges are another way of bleeding us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me cite the case of a woman in Nowra who queried a miscellaneous charge of $174 on a bank account. She was told that it was the premium for the insurance on her mortgaged home. She drew the bank's attention to the fact that she had sold the home three years previously. After further observation she drew the bank's attention to the fact that it had been charging her quarterly for the last three years. She had not noticed what was happening until, all of a sudden, the bank had started to charge annually. People do not know the number of bank charges that are being imposed on them. One Australian persisted for two years to try to find out what bank charges were being levied. Do honourable senators know what happened after two years? He received a letter from his bank, which I have tabled in the Senate, which said that if he kept asking it about the bank charges his letters and queries would be sent to its lawyer. He was told that the legal fee would be put on his bank account and that he would have no right of reply. So it goes on and on.
       </para>
       <para>
        What does all this indicate? It indicates that we have a banking system that could not care less as long as it is maximising its profits; that we have a Government that has created an environment in which banks flourish; and that we have an Opposition which will vote with the Government to sustain that environment. The message to the average Australian is that we have to blow up a huge storm about banking in Australia today. Some members of the Government actually tried to blow up a storm over the last three or four weeks. In April I proposed a Senate inquiry which was defeated by the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government. I was told, `We don't need a Senate inquiry into banking in this country'. Honourable senators should ask people in the street whether we need such an inquiry. Some prominent Labor backbenchers-indeed, a chairman of a House of Representatives committee-recommended to their Caucus and Treasurer (Mr Keating) that there should be an inquiry. The Treasurer's reaction was, `Sure we will think about it. It sounds like a good idea-as long as it is not bank bashing, as long as it does not harm the banks'. In the last two or three days he has backed off that inquiry. Do honourable senators know why? The reason is that he does not want the question of a bank inquiry being discussed in Caucus. If he took the matter in there, his backbenchers would have to scream for an inquiry because they know what the reality is in the community. The main reason he does not want an inquiry is that it would reveal the inadequacies of this extraordinary system that he has created. He was actually the architect of this deregulated banking system, the one that is being propped up by the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before the Senate at the moment. The outcome of a bank inquiry would be a castigating analysis of deregulated banking.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have not even mentioned the serious allegations of malpractice and corruption, examples of which I have been tabling in this Senate for nearly a year now. That is another dimension yet again. That is the seamy side, should it be investigated and proved, of what is otherwise a squeaky clean image of banking in this country: if a person gets into a four-wheel drive vehicle and confidently drives off into a desert, provided he has his Bankcard with him, all is well. That sort of garbage image is financed in the advertisements which we fund through the super profits of banks.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill provides an opportunity for us to focus upon the extraordinarily negative implications of deregulated banking. There are those within Labor ranks who have quite serious reservations about deregulated banking. I imagine that we would accept that Mr Halfpenny is on the Left of Labor. Recently in an article in the Australian Financial Review entitled `Banking in the `90s' Mr Halfpenny stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality is that financial institutions and the people who also control them are not capable of socially responsible management in a deregulated environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, he is saying that they are socially irresponsible-and I would agree with him. John Cain, who is not on the Left but on the Right, proposes that the banks should discriminate actively against customers who seek loans to buy imported goods, especially imported cars and consumer goods, and that discrimination should be in the form of higher interest rates for the purchasers of imports than for buyers of local products. He states:
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to see rates that reflect what this society's philosophy ought to be about-the relative importance of purchases that are made across the society . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        What I am saying is that there is money abundant to buy those sorts of goods such as imported cars and electrical goods and computers . . . I believe there ought to be a different rate applicable . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        He is trying to suggest that deregulation has induced irresponsibility and that there needs to be intervention in such a manner that it will give rise to responsibility within deregulated banking. I do not believe that that is possible. I agree with Halfpenny that deregulated banking is, by nature, finally and inherently socially irresponsible. They are contradictions in terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most important things this debate provides is the opportunity to cite the impotence and the ineffectiveness of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Somehow or other we have an image that, if we deliver the banking system into the hands of the Reserve Bank of Australia and its Board of very heavy, very sophisticated, very experienced and very responsible people, all will be well. After all, they are charged with quite specific responsibilities on our behalf. What are the duties of the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia? It has three duties. Clause 10 (2) of the Reserve Bank Act states:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its powers-
       </para>
       <para>
        oh boy, is that an escape clause!-
       </para>
       <para>
        to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank under this Act, the Banking Act 1959 and the regulations under that Act are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to-
       </para>
       <para>
        referring to those who control the banking system, the board of management of the Reserve Bank that controls the banking system-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) the stability of the currency of Australia;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is all motherhood stuff, but I do not believe that there is one skerrick of doubt that the banking system today is not fulfilling those three duties of its controlling body. The board of management of the Reserve Bank of Australia is failing us. It is allowing to prevail a system which simply services the needs of the greediest banks in the world. We know that they are the greediest banks in the world because we are able to measure how much more greedy they are than, say, the three top international Swiss banks. We can actually measure the margins by which they operate against those of other world banks-and they are the greediest banks in the world. Do honourable senators know what the Australian Bankers Association responded yesterday when this sort of criticism was offered? The best it could say was that banks were not making such good profits in a deregulated market as they were in the regulated market. The banks are really saying, `If you think you are being ripped off now'-and I have cited the figures to elaborate the extent to which we are being ripped off-`this is nothing in comparison with the way we were ripping you off'. This is the ethos of banking in Australia in 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I move a motion in this chamber on Friday to investigate the matter it will, for the second time, be defeated by the combined vote of the Opposition with the Government. It will happen because we have not yet blown up a big enough storm about banking. But, by jove, the storm has built up dramatically since April, when I first proposed that the whole question of banking be referred to a Senate standing committee. We will continue to whip up the storm at public meeting after public meeting because there is a determination on the part of the Australian Democrats that banking be an election issue. There are all sorts of distractions being put in our way, such as the creation of an Australian bank council and the appointment by the banks of an ombudsman to investigate the banks, paid by the banks, and responsible to the banks. I do not suppose that is a bad thing if one believes and has confidence in self-regulation. As Senator Stone enunciated here a moment ago, if one has confidence in that model that is all right. We do not have confidence in that model. We say that that is the model that has allowed the rape by a banking industry of ordinary Australians attending to their everyday needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats are opposed to this Bill because it represents a continuation of a model which is not serving the best interests of Australia or of Australians. We will be proposing observations about it as second reading amendments and we will be proposing constructive changes in the form of committee stage amendments. Banks are running riot in this country, and the riot squad has to be called out to bring them under control.

         —The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 seeks to make some quite significant revisions to the Banking Act, some ancillary changes to other Acts and some amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act and the Reserve Bank Act. As a result, it strikes at the very heart of one of the major issues in front of the Australian people at the moment-that is, the massive interest rate policies deliberately being pursued by the Federal Government. Basically, the Reserve Bank of Australia is in charge of monetary policy. As a result of the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Reserve Bank is now seen to be more and more under his direct personal control. The appointment of the head of the Treasury to be the Governor of the Reserve Bank rather than someone who has a background in the Reserve Bank itself has been seen by the business community as evidence of bureaucratising the bank and its functions, no matter how outstanding and effective a public servant the Secretary to the Treasury has been.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The task of the Reserve Bank is to provide an independent economic analysis and independent advice to the Government-advice coming not from the bureaucratic centre of Australia, Canberra, but from an organisation which exists in the business heart of this nation, Sydney, with some input from Melbourne. The fact that the Government has chosen to appoint someone who is much closer to the bureaucratic structure of Canberra to be Governor of the Reserve Bank, the fact that the Treasurer has chosen to state-as he did earlier this year-that the bank does what he tells it, and the fact that the latest annual report of the Reserve Bank indicates a refreshing independence of spirit, by inference clearly attacking the Government's lack of action in the key areas of economic need, demonstrate that there is now to be a change in the manner in which the Reserve Bank conducts itself. I believe that that change will be a change for the worse.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we are discussing this legislation it is important for us to look at what is happening to monetary policy in this nation at the moment. It is particularly appropriate that we should be discussing that at a time when, in many instances, some of the high-fliers in Australian business-the people who have borrowed heavily, particularly from overseas; the people who, in some cases, appear to have been encouraged by this Government, some of whom certainly appear to be close mates of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), if being jointly showered in champagne is an indication of mateship-have been seen to be in major difficulties. Ironically enough, those difficulties are now being worsened by the Government's continuing to rely so heavily on high interest rates. There is no doubt that there are problems facing many Australian companies-not simply those that have become so heavily indebted but also the many corporations that are now facing enormous interest bills-just as home buyers are facing enormous interest bills under this Government's policy. Many employees are dependent on the survival of those businesses. I fear that a continuation of this Government's policies, of massive over-reliance on monetary policy and huge interest rates, will bring about a substantial increase in unemployment in the new year. In fact, there is a real risk of recession.

       <para>
        Earlier today the shadow Treasurer, Dr John Hewson, said in the other place that what is happening in Australia at the moment underlines the fact that we desperately need strong leadership. In particular-and I stress this-we need a Treasurer like Dr Hewson who knows what he is doing, who can identify what needs to be done and who can act quickly and decisively to put things right. That is certainly in contrast with the extraordinary behaviour of the Treasurer in recent times. A week after the Opposition's economic policy statement he has been floundering around trying to find some way in which to attack it while refusing to come up with any method his Government can find to resolve these crises, which continue to get worse and have certainly worsened since the Budget came down in August-a Budget which was supposed to help resolve these problems but which, as the Reserve Bank pointed out, did not address any one of the major issues of economic policy facing Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the annual report of the Reserve Bank is required reading for anyone who wants to find out what this Government is failing to do and what it ought to be doing. I remind the Senate that the Reserve Bank in its annual report used such phrases as:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it is imperative that there be a return to progress on reducing both the rate of inflation and the current account deficit . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, this Government's Budget will not achieve that. The Reserve Bank continues to use strong decisive words in its report. When talking about micro-economic reform it says, `Changes there are essential'. It then goes on to say that we are unlikely to get that kind of reform if we have high interest rates. In fact, it says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Restructuring is much more difficult, even impossible, in a high inflation environment . . . Altering this situation must have top priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has totally ignored all these imperative words. The Treasurer, having established his lack of credentials in this area, having failed abysmally in this regard, has been saying that under a Peacock government interest rates would be higher. That is absolute nonsense. As I have said, the Treasurer's credibility in this area has been destroyed, and destroyed by the Reserve Bank itself. This kind of nonsensical attack has been shown to be total hypocrisy. He is the man who is responsible for the present record mortgage rates and the huge commercial lending rates which are hitting the level of business investment and, therefore, our prospects of ever getting out of the disastrous balance of payments problems that we are now in. It is incredible that the man who is responsible for record interest rates is the same man who went round trying to blame everyone else, particularly the banks. Of course, as we heard from Senator McLean, the banks are the fall guys for anyone who has an axe to grind, but Mr Keating said that the banks were to blame for high interest rates. This is absolute bunkum, as we can see when we look at what is actually happening to interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Strangely enough, I must say that, even though these interest rates are huge, at the moment there is still no evidence of demand slowing. Of course, it is that excessive demand in relation to our inadequate volume of export earnings that is causing the balance of payments crisis that will dominate Australia's economic situation and politics at least until the mid-1990s. It is not just me, but other respected people who are saying that. Even the Economic Planning Advisory Council, the Government's own body, has pointed to the length of time for which this massive balance of payments problem will remain.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen retail sales continue at a fairly healthy rate. Credit aggregates are still very high and imports and employment are showing no sign of slowing. The Treasurer has tried to pretend that the surge in imports and the high balance of payments deficit are due to increased purchasing in investment goods. That is nonsense. The Business Council of Australia recently pointed out that capital goods imports rose by $2 billion in 1988-89. But this was at a time when the current account deficit deteriorated by $5.5 billion-almost three times as much. So, even if capital goods had remained unchanged, the current account deficit would have deteriorated substantially due to increased consumption and intermediate goods imports. That is what the Business Council said.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one looks at the capital goods imports category, one sees that very little is going into the traded goods category. There has been a large surge in imports of computer equipment, motor vehicles and odd items such as video cassette recorders, record players and medical equipment. But it is very hard to pin down equipment going into the import replacement or export industries. That is where we need investment. That is where we would be prepared to wear a fairly high level of imports if it would lead to some correction, ultimately, of the inadequate level of exports and the excessive level of imports presently plaguing Australia and presenting us with the problem that the Government probably has little alternative, in view of its other policy failures, to maintaining a disastrously and destructively high level of interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Things are clearly getting worse on the monetary policy front. That seems clear from the hint that the Treasurer gave last week, I think, on 2GB on the John Laws program when he said that he could not guarantee that interest rates would not rise. The world's greatest Treasurer, who supposedly has all the answers, has led Australia into a massive interest rate regime and is now saying that he cannot guarantee that interest rates will not rise even further. I understand why he cannot guarantee that; it is because his policies have failed. It is clear that we are heading for an even worse economic situation in Australia. Last week the treasury note rediscount rate was lifted to 17.7 per cent and the Reserve Bank of Australia acted to tighten up the cash market last Friday. Yesterday treasury notes traded at 17.8 per cent. That is well above the last tender. The market is pretty widely of the view that the $1 billion note tender will go off at close to 18 per cent, which could mean another lift in the rediscount rate. Is that not incredible? The Government talks about 18 per cent for its own paper yet criticises the banks for daring to raise interest rates to 17 per cent-one per cent less than the Government pays for its money. The level of hypocrisy involved in the Treasurer making that sort of attack on the banks in this situation is self-evident.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has sought to soften the impact of his policies by doing a deal with the banks to hold down some mortgage rates to 17 per cent for some lucky borrowers. Just as the Government apparently believes that some uranium is acceptable and can be mined but some is not and cannot be mined, so some home borrowers have to be protected--

Some are to be thrown to the wolves. We saw that happen with the pegged 13 1/2 per cent mortgage rate. We now see it with those people who have borrowed from building societies. They are to receive no benefit from the deal that has been done-at public expense-with the banks. I remind the Senate that the public expense involved in doing a deal on interest rates-something which at the right time in the right way I would totally favour-that is, getting rid of the discriminatory rate at which the Government required the banks to have deposits with the central bank, will be $200m a year. But I remind honourable senators that the change already in the legislation we are looking at today, requiring that instead of having a statutory reserve deposit one would have a non-callable deposit, will involve a cost to revenue of about $20m in the current financial year and $200m annually.

        Public money is being required to try to soften the blow of the Government's high interest rate policy which has emerged because of its inadequate and incompetent running of fiscal policy. What the Government is doing in a sense is basically easing fiscal policy and at the same time making the monetary impact and the need for higher interest rates in other areas even greater. The massive high commercial interest rates from the Government of 18 per cent in the marketplace are threatening the existence of many Australian businesses, particularly small businesses, at a time when the Government is hitting their cash flows by this extraordinary requirement that 85 per cent of a company's corporate tax be paid by 15 July, in other words, two weeks into the new financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        What does the Government do for businesses? It brings forward the date on which they have to pay their tax. In the majority of instances it is long before the company has earned its full profits for that year, before it has actually got the money. Most businesses operate on at least 30 days payment. In the Senate Estimates Committee the other day we heard that an enormous proportion of the creditors of the Australian Government Publishing Service have to wait longer than 30 days before they get paid by the Government. So, the Government does not pay on time, yet it requires companies, which have not received the cash on which they have allegedly earned profits, to pay their tax before they have even got the money.

        This Government is bringing about major problems for the business community and, I believe, a significant risk of a recession in the new year.

         —This table shows what has happened to the broad money supply since June 1988. In just 14 months it has gone up from 12 per cent to 19.4 per cent, for the 12 months to August. There are all sorts of reasons and justifications for this. The Government used continually to fail to meet its target, when it set a target, for greater money supply. It said, `This is because deregulation has so altered the game that in fact the components of money supply now are involved in some double counting because of flows in and out of Australia'. When Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, was last attacking Senator Short in this place because he dared to mention this blow-out in money supply Senator Walsh said that it was now irrelevant and did not count. We have yet to see or hear Senator Walsh or any other Government Minister quantify just how wrong-if they are wrong-these money aggregates are. Are they 50 per cent wrong? If the Government does not know it should. How wrong are they if we can no longer, as Senator Walsh says, take any notice of them whatsoever?

       <para>
        The Reserve Bank is staffed with people of great competence. I refuse to believe that there is available no indication as to how we should interpret broad money supply figures that are now available. It is not good enough for this Government to duck behind the excuse that they are no longer relevant because they include some figures that do not suit the Government. The fact is that we are seeing a massive blow-out in broad money. That is bringing exactly the sorts of consequences that are almost classic in every economy where the money supply blows out because of incompetent governmental management of the economy. This is one essential point that seems to have been totally ignored in the economic debate in recent times: this huge blow-out from 12 per cent in the year to June 1988 to 19.4 per cent now.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fascinating to look at what has happened not just coincidentally but as a natural consequence. In June 1988, when the broad money growth was 12 per cent, savings bank interest rates were 13.5 per cent. When broad money had grown to about 15.9 per cent by December savings bank interest rates had gone up from 13.5 per cent to 15 per cent. I can go further down the list. By March 1989 broad money had risen from 12 per cent to 18.3 per cent. Savings bank interest rates had gone up a further 1 per cent to 16 per cent. In August 1989 broad money increased to 19.4 per cent, and savings bank interest rates went up to 17 per cent and would have been higher but for the deal done by the Government, at public taxpayers' expense basically, in order to hold home loan interest rates down. We have had this parallel: the money supply has got bigger and bigger, interest rates have got bigger and bigger and this Government is doing nothing-apart from doing a one-stop deal with the banks which involves no guarantees and cannot be held together-to stop that inevitable course which will lead to a recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has happened to inflation while this has been going on? Here again we have a classic link. In June 1988, when we had broad money at 12 per cent and savings bank interest rates at 13.5 per cent, the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator was showing inflation at 8.1 per cent. Naturally, inflation has risen since that time. By June this year it was 9.6 per cent-far higher than the Treasurer had forecast, far higher than the Budget had indicated, far higher than this Government thought and certainly far higher than the health of this country can sustain. This nation cannot live with an inflation rate so much higher than its trading partners. As has been pointed out by the Reserve Bank, the prospect of any kind of effective restructuring of our economy to cope with the problems we face internationally, and particularly with our disastrous balance of payments figure, is made far worse. We cannot effectively restructure, according to the Reserve Bank, while we have these massive inflation rates. What has brought this about is this Government's reckless approach to economic growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once again we can look at almost classic figures. In September 1988, when broad money was around 11.2 per cent and savings bank interest rates were 14.5 per cent and inflation was 8.9 per cent, we had a GDP growth of about 2.7 per cent. It is now up to 3.9 per cent, far higher than the economic indicators can sustain. The reason for that is that the Government has placed far more emphasis on creating jobs at any price. I am all in favour of creating jobs. The question is: Do we create jobs at any price? The price of this Government's economic policies-we keep hearing that it has created so many jobs-has been a huge rise in the money supply, massive increases in interest rates, a huge rise in inflation and, above all, sitting like an albatross around the neck of this economy, a huge international debt which is still going up and which this Government has done nothing to stop.

         —As has been said during the debate, particularly by my colleague Senator McLean, the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 comes before us at a time when the banking sector is recording record profits due at least in part to the increases in interest rates and banking charges in recent years. In this environment, bank consumers, the ordinary people in the street, have come to view those profits with less than favourable eyes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        My colleague Senator McLean has outlined the situation with bank profits. Only the Commonwealth Bank of Australia has so far released its annual report up to June 1989, showing that its profit increase is 74 per cent. The figures up to the end of March 1989 show that the profits of the National Australia Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corporation increased by 52 per cent and those of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd by 60 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The basic problem is the Hawke Government's deregulation approach to the financial system in general and banks in particular. This Bill takes that process a step further and, as Senator McLean said, is opposed by the Australian Democrats on the basis of that deregulation which has been damaging to the community and to the economy, in the same way that the Australian Democrats so often have opposed other deregulation and privatisation measures introduced by this Government, encouraged from the sidelines by the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Labor Government promised results from deregulation. It promised the magic of the marketplace, and the same promise has been made by the alternative Peacock coalition government. It is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee or, as David Potts said in the Australian last week at the end of his analysis of the Peacock package-and I did not think I would be quoting David Potts-`Well done, Tweedle brothers'.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were promised the magic of the marketplace-more competition; better service; a better deal for the people in the street, for the users of banking services, basically for all Australians. And what did we get? We got higher charges and higher interest rates. As for increased competition, we got amalgamations of banks resulting in gigantic institutions with which the little people have to deal and which offer a lesser level of service-do it yourself banking; a proliferation of plastic; promotion of credit which, in effect, as Senator McLean said, is debt; an increase in bankruptcies; particularly promotion of credit debt to our young people; and easier access to overseas money, aided and abetted of course by the continuing policy of allowing negative gearing for foreign borrowings and a policy not opposed by the potential alternative government. That increased access to and increased use of overseas money by the rich and the entrepreneurs has had its damaging, disrupting impact on our community in the form of pressure on the balance of payments, which has found its way down to pressure on the individual families trying to put a roof over their head.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consumer movement in Australia is among the most strident critics of banking deregulation. As I said, the Opposition is green with envy over what this Government has done. As Treasurer, John Howard wanted to do it but he could not push the coalition far enough down that track. The Opposition is consistent in knocking the consumer movement when it complains, as it knocks the Australian Democrats when we complain.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consumer unrest has grown. We have shared the concerns and we have voiced those concerns in this place and in the community. As social security spokesperson for the Australian Democrats, I have had cause to be concerned about a constituency that has been damaged by the approach taken: a constituency of low income people, pensioners and beneficiaries, including the unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was outrage in the community when the people's bank, the Commonwealth Bank, was placing charges on unemployment beneficiaries in particular. The result of that pressure was that, finally, the Commonwealth Bank exempted them along with other pensioners and beneficiaries. But it took community pressure to get that change. It is the low income people who have had to suffer considerably from the bank charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        A report partly funded by the Victorian Government and issued last week headed, `Bank deregulation. Is the consumer clearly winning?' pointed that out. It outlined that the charges on many bank accounts were higher than the interest earned, which meant that consumers were finding less in their accounts as a result of those charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        An article in the Age of 17 October outlines that 37 deposit accounts in nine banks were surveyed in the report. In 19 cases, people who made 25 withdrawals a quarter from an account with an average balance of $1,000 and a minimum balance of $200 would have to pay the bank; 13 accounts paid between 0 and 2 per cent under the same conditions; and only one account paid more than 10 per cent interest. For some people, the gain was less than zero.
       </para>
       <para>
        The banks defended themselves by saying that many of the accounts were service accounts, not savings accounts. I do not know how the banks could determine that that was the case. They might have assumed it, but they offered no evidence at all that that was the case. They argue that this is all very reasonable and, in a nice, deregulated user pays system, nobody should be worried about it. Consumers are worried about this sort of situation. It is the people with the small accounts, the low income people, who are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, as social security spokesperson for the Australian Democrats, I point to our concern for the way in which the Government and the banks, in their cosy relationship, have operated in relation to pension payments. Two or three years ago, the Government determined that pension payments should be made directly to banks. Following that, the banks took it upon themselves to directly confiscate parts of those payments wherever they could claim that the customer owed money from another account or had overdrawn an account.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have all been very concerned about this, some of us believing that, under the Social Security Act, those social security payments are absolutely inalienable. We have been concerned that the banks should confiscate this money without having to prove the debt in the first place. Along with other community bodies, we have called upon the Government to redress this situation in relation to which the Department of Social Security actually sought advice from the Attorney-General's Department. In yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, it was revealed in an article by Margo Kingston that, in fact, the Government has been told by the Attorney-General that it is acting illegally in forcing pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries to have their cheques paid directly into bank accounts.
       </para>
       <para>
        That opinion states that payment by the Commonwealth into a bank account is unauthorised unless made in response to a voluntary request by the client. That is far from what has been operating for these few years. The Attorney-General's opinion was that the Social Security Act does not permit the Department to make direct deposits except voluntarily.

        <para in-line="1">
         —Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was referring to one of the several disturbing aspects-disturbing, at least, to the Australian Democrats and to others in the community-of the Government's obvious and lucrative cosy relationship with the banks, that is, the fact that the Department of Social Security has been making direct deposits of social security payments into banks. The Attorney-General's Department has now offered an opinion that that has been an illegal action, this at a time when it has been proposed that an agreement be forged between the Department and the banks which would set a limited proportion which the banks could take from welfare recipients by way of confiscation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The opinion raises, as Margo Kingston said in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, the prospect that clients whose benefits have been confiscated in the past may be able to sue the Department for illegally depositing their money. It must be the case, given that we have legislation coming to us which is currently in the House of Representatives-social security amendment legislation-which attempts to legitimise that currently illegal system. I would imagine that the Government is somewhat scratching its head at this point. Certainly that legislation will be opposed by the Democrats. We have always said that pensioners and beneficiaries ought to have choice in that situation and that the Government should not be forcing people to have their payments made directly to banks, particularly not when banks are going ahead and confiscating what, according to the Act, are inalienable payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said throughout, the consumer's voice against the activities of the banks in this highly deregulated environment has been strong. To overcome some of the consumer unrest, the Australian Bankers Association announced its intention to establish a banking ombudsman scheme, which we certainly hope will result in some level of internal regulation of banking activities. It was launched yesterday by Senator Bolkus and received some media publicity today. It is a scheme which the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations has welcomed, recognising it as arising from the general level of dissatisfaction in the community with the financial sector's complaints handling mechanisms and the difficulties faced by the ordinary consumer in resolving such problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is to be a board comprising members of the banking organisations which will then appoint a council which brings in representatives both from banking and from public interest and consumer groups. That council will appoint an ombudsman. We expect that appointment by the end of the year, according to Senator Bolkus yesterday. The scheme is based on one developed in the United Kingdom. My colleague Senator McLean has expressed our strong reservations about it. We have no option, of course, not having the numbers in this place, on re-regulation. A recent report by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British Parliament, known as the Jack report, contained quite serious criticisms of the British banking ombudsman scheme. We-and, I am sure, the consumer organisations in this country-will be working to ensure that those problems do not arise in the system here in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of this legislation we have decided to begin that work. As a result I will be moving in the committee stage to establish a bank consumers' assistance fund. We want to make sure that within this banking ombudsman scheme the consumer's voice is strong and that it is able to be independent and autonomous. So I shall move amendments which will establish a fund by virtue of a levy on banks so that consumer groups can indeed be independent in this exercise. We are listing several organisations-well established and well regarded community organisations-which would be eligible to receive funds from that fund: The Australian Financial Counsellors, the Credit Reform Association, the Australian Consumers Association, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, the National Council of Women of Australia, the Australian Pensioners Federation, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia and the Australian Council of Social Service. We also have provision for other bodies to be prescribed under this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that this will help the banking ombudsman scheme to be seen to be above reproach. I do not believe that the banks, the Government or the Opposition should oppose the credentials of these organisations, although I am sure that the Opposition will. I believe that, if we are to have a credible, self-regulatory system established, then the voice of the community must be very strong. I say that I am sure that the Opposition will call into question the credentials of at least some of those organisations listed because in previous debates in this place it has done just that, most notably, Senator Short, in a debate on 5 May of this year. He made some considerable criticisms of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and the Australian Consumers Association. The major part of his complaints seemed to be that too much government funding was going to those organisations. I commend these amendments to the Opposition, particularly on the basis of Senator Short's remarks, because, clearly, what we are doing is attempting to get some money to these consumer organisations that is not government money.
       </para>
       <para>
        By the establishment of the banking ombudsman scheme we are putting an extra burden on organisations in this community whose burdens are increasing daily as deregulation runs rampant and which will be critical to the interests of ordinary people in the community should we have a change of government and should deregulation become privatisation. The Opposition should welcome an opportunity to provide some funds other than out of the public purse unless, of course, it is more concerned to keep on side with the banks in much the same way as the Government has done in recent times, with a $400m windfall in 1985 to keep interest rates for current home loans at 13 per cent and then the recent $200m windfall in an attempt-it is yet to be seen whether it is effective-to keep interest rates at 17 per cent. So we commend these amendments to the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The levy that we will be proposing will be made up of 2 per cent of the banking sector's expenditure on advertising for the preceding financial year. That is the formula. It will mean that consumers will have, at least in the next year, some $800,000 with which to support banking consumers in possible disputes and in the general consumer area, as well as undertaking any necessary research projects which would support their work and thereby support the ordinary people of this country. It will allow the banks the opportunity to prove to their customers what they have been claiming, at least in their advertising campaigns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps we ought to have a look at the response to the banks' advertising campaigns recently. On 11 October the Australian ran a story about some findings on advertising generally of a group of analysts at Advertising Diagnostics Pty Ltd who said that they found that consumers found bank advertising unconvincing. The researchers found that advertisements portraying banks as the caring victims of government monetary policies were seen as non-genuine, exaggerating, unconvincing, often confusing, generally uninteresting and lacking a call to action. All banks, except Advance and Westpac, registered weak to negative reactions from prospective customers. What we are saying is that 2 per cent of the money spent on all that ineffective hype that is going out to the wider community would be better spent in supporting the interests of consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The successful passage of these amendments would therefore ensure that the genuine needs and interests of the banking sector's long-forgotten customers, who are feeling neglected and abused, would be met. As Senator McLean said in his contribution, the banks operate with a `monolith of legal advisers' at the top, a fairly daunting prospect for an ordinary consumer at the bottom to take on, even under the bankers' ombudsman scheme. The strain and expense of carrying the millions of consumers in this country ought to be supported financially, we think, by a levy on the banks. I carry the primary industry portfolio for the Australian Democrats and am accustomed to the passage of multitudes of levy Bills at the end of every session, and I do not think we should restrict levies to the primary industry sector by any means at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to comment on the up-and-down fortunes of an inquiry into the banking industry. As Senator McLean has said, the Democrats will persist with our longstanding call for such an inquiry, and we insist that banking is an election issue. I believe that the Government already acknowledges this. I believe that Mr Steve Martin's hype on this issue during the two weeks away from this place was really an exercise in insurance on the part of a government that was still contemplating an election towards the end of this year and wanted to be seen to be doing something about a significant community issue. Therefore, the chairman of the appropriate House of Representatives committee obliged-and I have some concerns about the use of a Senate committee if that is the reason why this all happened. But the inquiry was ditched a couple of days ago because, I would say, the Government has also ditched its idea of having an election towards the end of this year. It has been dropped with a lot of excuses that much is being done. Mr Martin was quoted in the Melbourne Age of last Saturday as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        The creation of a banking ombudsman, Federal Government progress in sponsoring uniform credit laws by state governments, improvements being fostered in customer relations. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        He is saying that because all that is happening, an inquiry is not needed, yet none of that has happened since Mr Martin first made his proposal. Mr Keating must have told him, `Don't worry, we don't have to smooth things over in the area of banking because we are not having an election this year'. Mr Martin said that his inquiry was intended to focus on consumer issues. He is quoted in the same article as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Credit card charges, customer relations, electronic funds transfers and the like and their contribution to bank profits were the matters most raised by constituents. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Yes, they are, as we have said time and again in this place. Even if the Government does not support an inquiry-and Senator McLean has said he does not hold out much hope that it will do that in the Senate any more than in the House of Representatives-the very least it can do is look seriously at our proposal for a bank consumers assistance fund. I commend our amendments to the Government on that basis also. Here is a chance for the Government to do something on the banking issue, even if it is not having an election towards the end of this year. Let us see some real action on behalf of consumers and not just leave banking in this deregulated system to the bankers themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to comment, finally, on some aspects of the Opposition's contribution so far in this debate, in particular the contribution from Senator Michael Baume, which I heard almost in full. As usual, he berated the Government for the economic mess that we are in. I thought he rather skirted around the specific banking legislation before us, but his contribution certainly raises the question of how the Opposition will fix up the economy. The Opposition has said from time to time that one way is to reduce the money supply. How? By re-regulating? By reactivating the powers of the Reserve Bank of Australia? Not Senator Stone, Senator Michael Baume, Senator Alston, Senator Bishop and that bunch of privateers, surely? Alternatively, as David Potts said in the Australian on 18 October, is the scrapping of Medicare part of the secret agenda in an economic policy which has to be based on big cuts in government spending, no doubt as part of reducing the money supply? David Potts suggests that that is the case. He goes on to condemn aspects of the Opposition's policy such as negative gearing and speculative gains tax and finishes up referring to the Tweedledum and Tweedledee policies of the Government and the Opposition, and the exhortation, `Good one, Tweedle brothers'. All I can say is hear, hear!
       </para>
       <para>
        Is there a way of fixing up the economy, as Paul Lyneham put it brilliantly in the Melbourne Sunday Sun last weekend under the heading, `Swag of jobs up for grabs'? Has the Opposition determined, in its opinion poll scanning, that `self-interest is ahead of compassion by several lengths'? Paul Lyneham will have to be forgiven, as he is writing in a Melbourne newspaper in the middle of the spring racing carnival, but that is all he will have to be forgiven for in this article. He points out that if one looks at the policy put forward by the Opposition and at what has happened since, one will get the idea. Paul Lyneham states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . Liberal President, John Elliott, spelled out the new Rambo politics with a strong defence of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan-
       </para>
       <para>
        in those now immortal words-
       </para>
       <para>
        ``I heard Hawke say that it's taking from the poor and giving to the rich. Absolute nonsense. It's taking from the bludgers and giving to the workers''.
       </para>
       <para>
        I always thought that Mr Elliott thought Australian workers were bludgers, but I will not go into that just now. We heard from Senator Michael Baume that monetary policy, coupled with the deregulation of the labour market, would do it. The article demonstrates how Paul Lyneham sees that working, and maybe this is the secret weapon. After Mr Keating and Mr Howe made their rather puny attack on the Opposition's policy, he referred to Dr Hewson's rebuttal as `so macho he made Sylvester Stallone look like Tinkerbell'. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearing the books of half the long-term unemployed was a very conservative estimate, he said. Indeed the final figure ``will most like be much lower''.
       </para>
       <para>
        This refers to doing away with unemployment benefit for all those unemployed for longer than nine months. The article quotes Dr Hewson as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        `` Clearly, most of the long-term unemployed will be expected to accept jobs that they would otherwise find unacceptable or live by their own means''.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone was reported in the newspapers a couple of days ago as saying that unemployed people are just too fussy. What will the unemployed do? What if there are no jobs, even unacceptable ones, in their district? Dr Hewson says, `We'll move them', just a step ahead of the Government, which is saying it will not let unemployed people move, under the piece of legislation that is next coming up. Paul Lyneham says that these people will have to be more inventive, that is all. They will have to be particularly inventive because the lawn mowing business is a bit oversupplied at the moment, but never mind. Paul Lyneham says that he would go door-to-door, offering to do any unacceptable job at a bargain price. His article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The 30 per cent of them aged over 45 might not be able to do heavy work but it doesn't take much capital to set up a shoe shine business or clean windscreens at traffic lights.

        As for the 24 per cent who are women, if they can't earn their way by cleaning, washing or ironing they're not really trying. With good references many could become child minders.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, if all the child-care centres are closed down we will need to have some of those women child minding for nothing, but what is new? Paul Lyneham continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the long-termers might resort to unseemingly begging at shopping centres and other public places. However a stout walking stick should keep them at bay and persistent offenders can always be dealt with by calling a constable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Shades of Dickensian England. That is the deregulated labour market connected with this policy. The article goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        With compulsory unionism banned and enterprise bargaining flourishing, some entrepreneurs should be able to fill entire factories with long-termers.
       </para>
       <para>
        It all looks wonderful! Paul Lyneham says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Taiwanese and the South Koreans will not know what has hit them when our cheap exports flood their markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe that is the answer to our economic woes; I do not know. I have listened to this debate so far-I will no doubt have to listen to more of it-and I would like to hear something from the Opposition that had more than a sense of Tweedledum and Tweedledee. All I can say is that if Paul Lyneham is anywhere near correct-I agree with him that it looks a pretty grim scenario-it is certainly back to the Dickensian England days or, even worse, our own form of slavery.

         —Tonight we are debating the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The essence of the Bill is, as has been explained by our leading speaker, Senator Stone, to change the method by which the Reserve Bank of Australia holds deposits from the various banks in Australia from previously so-called statutory reserve deposits to what will now be called non-callable deposits. Without going into the technicalities of this, I cannot resist the opportunity first of all of addressing the few remarks of the previous speaker, Senator Powell, because I note that, while she has yet to move amendments, I look now at the second reading amendment which she will apparently move to this Bill.

         —Perhaps he will be enunciating the same types of views as Senator Powell has. I am taken especially by the second paragraph of the amendment. I really should not give it this much publicity but I guess we have to understand it a little. The amendment states:

        deregulation should be reversed, so that banks are limited to lending the money deposited with them-

        while the role of credit creation is properly assumed totally by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask: What kind of policy is this? We have a situation where we are talking about absolute control over credit creation and, consequently, the development of the economy being vested in the Government. I can only think of one word that sums up that type of principle. I hesitate to use it in this chamber but quite clearly it is very close to one of those things known as socialism. I find it hard to believe that the Australian Democrats, which claims to be a free enterprise party which identifies with those issues that affect small business and all of those little people in the community, wants to take away from the credit creating institutions in Australia the role of being able to provide money to small business so as to develop the community and to provide jobs through the small businessman in the Australian community and put it in the hands of the Government so that the Government will adopt the role of handling credit creation and thereby take full control of the Australian economy. I find that astounding.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am absolutely horrified that this should be a policy motive of the Democrats. I am sure that the electors, especially the small business electors of the seat of Kingston in South Australia, will be particularly interested in this and to find that the Democrats want to restrict the generation and the creation of credit in the Australian economy to one body only, and that is the Government. Maybe something has gone wrong in the works of the Democrats-which of course we understand happens all the time. I can only assume that that is not the point and that they have considered this issue thoroughly.

Please, let us not hear this nonsense mentioned in this place. Save it for the little armchair socialist groups-I think we can now call them-within the Democrats. Talk to them along the lines of this type of nonsense. Let us get on with some real debate in this chamber.

        As I said earlier, the essence of this Bill is a very important matter. In a nutshell, it is the prudential control of the banking system within this country. This has been introduced by a Treasurer (Mr Keating) who stands in the eyes of the Australian community totally discredited in the development of his economic policies. We have a situation where only two weeks ago the Government, floundering about in order to protect itself against a challenge from the Opposition in the forthcoming election campaign, sought to control interest rates by doing a deal with the four major trading banks in Australia by providing them with $250m of taxpayers' money so as to get an undertaking from those banks that they would not increase their interest rates beyond their present level. That is the essence of the debate tonight. That is the gravamen of this matter. That is what we in the Liberal and National parties are seeking to expose.

       <para>
        I might just interpose that it is interesting that the Democrats failed to touch on any matter of any substance in this debate and did not raise this matter in any way whatsoever. While seeking to find out what their policies might be, we are still waiting. I suppose we will continue to wait in the light of what Senator Powell had to say to us tonight. That is the issue here tonight. The Treasurer, who really parades himself now unfortunately without clothes, is a man who has failed to deliver to the Australian community. He is one-unlike all other Treasurers in my experience in this place-who in his estimates in the latest Budget refused to state what he believed the inflation rate for this coming financial year would be. He also failed to state--

         —Yes, because we will then have the September quarter consumer price index figures released. Everybody who is close to the market would know a little about what to expect there. But the point is that the Government fails to put any figure on inflation for this full financial year. In the area of growth of the economy we have the most ambiguous comments in the Budget statement by the Treasurer that demonstrate that he has no idea of what the growth rate will be in the Australian economy this year. I think he mentioned about 2 3/4 per cent, a figure being the same as the previous year. The truth is that, of course, it is running well in excess of that. That is why-according to the Treasurer's logic-we are suffering high interest rates in order to try to restrict that growth.

        In the last financial year we saw an estimate of the current account deficit on our balance of payments at about $9.5 billion. But what was the actual figure when it came in? It was $17.5 billion-nearly double what the Treasurer said a year before would be the figure. That is not just some marginal increase, some marginal problem in calculating the effect of the current account deficit: this is an error of nearly 100 per cent. Mr Acting Deputy President, you as a professional man, and others in this chamber who are professional men, know that if we suffer an error of that type we are out of our profession. We are likely to be thrown out, disbarred and everything else under the sun. The truth is that this Treasurer, who has failed by all the tests of modern economic analysis, still remains the Treasurer. That is unbelievable, in terms of the Liberal and National parties' concept of government, but it is also not believed by the people of Australia, because they know exactly what a failure the Keating economic policy of the past seven years has been.

       <para>
        We have talked about the current account deficit of $18 billion last year, but what will it be this year? The Budget estimates say that it will be $18.5 billion. Already the numbers indicate that it could well be of the order of $22 billion in this financial year. Surely that is a matter of grave concern to the Treasurer. But do we hear any comment about that in the public arena? Do we hear him speaking about these matters as being of vital concern? No, he brushes them aside.

         —It is time for the Treasurer to come clean, as my colleague Senator Brownhill rightly says. All these things are leading to a crisis in the Australian economy which has been building since the Government came to power in 1983. It is exemplified by very high debt owing to foreigners-approximately $140 billion gross, up from about $30 billion in 1983. These things, together with the cost to the taxpayers of servicing those debts, are putting very high burdens on the Australian economy.

        The issue I want to raise, in terms of the Bill, is the Treasurer's lack of control over the money supply in the past 12 months. The August Economic Round-up from the Australian Treasury refers to the monetary aggregate figures and shows the percentage change on a year on year basis for what is described as M3; that is, a fairly broad description of money supply in the economy. In 1988 there was a growth rate of approximately 13.3 per cent, which one would describe as relatively tight against the inflation rate of about 7 or 8 per cent and a growth rate of about 4 per cent. That is not so bad. But in the financial year ended 30 June 1989 that figure leapt by 100 per cent to 26.8 per cent. It was double what it was the previous year, with the growth parameters and inflation at similar levels to what they had been in previous years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is content to claim that it is all the fault of everybody else, but I repeat: monetary supply growth in the Australian economy in the past financial year was double that of the previous year. In terms of some other measurements of money, the growth was somewhat less, but still of frightening orders of 50 or 60 per cent. Those numbers clearly indicate that the Government is not in control of monetary policy in the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are suffering the highest interest rates in history. The Government has applied those interest rates in order to restrict money supply and to try to get down the growth rates in the economy. But we have found, on the evidence of the Treasury's figures, that the growth rates have been well above those of previous years. The Government has failed in its policy to restrict the supply of money. If the Government has failed in that, it means that the Australian economy is in for some very interesting times ahead, because history has continually shown that increases, especially sudden increases, in the supply of money in an economy usually lead to very substantial increases in inflation, which has consequent effects throughout the economy in other years. In the end it leads to problems with unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke-Keating Government has lost control of the Australian economy. That is the essential element of the economic policy being developed at present. By contrast, in recent weeks the Liberal and National parties have announced the Economic Action Plan, which demonstrates clearly where the Australian economy ought to be going. The policy deserves the highest level of support. It demonstrates that the greatest need is with families. That should be addressed by seeking to ease the pressure on those people, by giving support through increased spouse rebates for taxation purposes, and by increasing child allowances and providing child-care support through the taxation rebate system. All of those things demonstrate quite clearly a sense of compassion from the Liberal and National parties for those who are suffering greatest at the hands of this Government, which has totally lost control of the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have the phenomenon of bracket creep in taxation. Many people refer to the Treasurer as bracket creep, and I suppose that is a fairly relevant comment. Bracket creep is the way in which the Government has been able to finance the wonderful surplus that it has been able to demonstrate in recent months. That is, of course, the key to the difference between the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Labor Party. We intend, through our Economic Action Plan, to hand back to the people of Australia the taxes that have been ripped off them through the bracket creep phenomenon which applies to taxation scales. That will have enormous benefits for the Australian community. Some parts of that policy were used during the period of the Fraser Government, when that support was provided for families and the effects of inflation were handed back to those people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the new Peacock government the taxation effect of inflation will be provided for in a similar manner. We believe, even though the Labor Party obviously does not, that that will provide substantial benefits and extra savings at the community level, in order to fund the development of housing and new industries and to give individual families the ability to reduce their debts so as to stay viable during this most difficult period imposed by the Hawke-Keating Government.

        All this can be summed up by that wonderful phrase from the Prime Minister in recent times, when he said that he and his Government would abolish poverty for children by 1990. He was so advanced in his thinking that he was able to claim victory only a matter of a month or two ago, by changing the definition of poverty. That is almost laughable in this situation.

        In coming back to this Bill, let me say specifically that we are talking about the way in which the Government exercises, in the broadest sense, its control over the money supply through its agency, the Reserve Bank. I hasten to add that we on this side support the independence of the Reserve Bank from government. But the point is that we have seen the Government fail in terms of controlling money supply in this country which, as I said earlier, has doubled compared with what it was in the 1988 financial year. This will have enormous consequences for the economy in the next 12 to 18 months. As we look at the figures that will come out in the next few weeks on inflation, the current account deficit, wages, overtime and so on, we will need to remind ourselves what is really going on in this economy. These results can be pinned right back to this Government's lack of control over the money supply, and that is the gravamen of this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        In broad terms, what does this country need to do? First, we obviously need to build policies which are productivity oriented. We need to seek to get better value for every dollar that we put into our costs. We need to produce more for less dollars. That does not mean screwing down the worker. We need to have a policy of rewarding people for the effort that they put in. It is as simple as that. That is why we need to have a substantial restructuring of the labour market through the kind of policy that has been put forward over recent years by the Liberal and National parties. This will lead to a far more prosperous Australia where people can meet their debts, buy new homes and new motor cars and substantially build up their wealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also need to move into the deregulation of areas of the economy which offer substantial growth opportunities compared with the rest of the world. One such area is telecommunications. Australia could become the hub of money markets operating in the Pacific and Asian region. We could operate on a 24-hour basis. Telecommunications will give us a chance to do just that. Other developments in the telecommunications markets will aid our productivity and provide business opportunities for entrepreneurs in Australia.

        We have handed out $150m to waterside workers in order to reduce the total number of workers on the waterfront and try to improve productivity. That is the Government's approach. But what we need is a totally different approach so that we can reward people according to what they do in their jobs. That is a commonsense approach; it is the Liberal and National parties' approach. Let me give one example of what this Parliament could do right now. Let me tell the Senate what we could do to improve productivity and solve the almost intractable problem in the airline industry, caused by the pilots dispute and exacerbated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)--

         —Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator MacGibbon gave notice of a motion which, if passed, would lead to the deregulation of the airline industry. I can almost hear the Australian Democrats rising on this one. But the fact is that we need to get back to a situation of normality in the airline industry. If this were done the tourist operators in this country would be able to make a buck again, people would be employed and the banks would be paid what was owed to them in interest and would not have to foreclose on many tourist operations which are in danger at present because of the Hawke Government's draconic approach to its handling of industrial relations in the airline industry. We know that deregulation will come about next year. The intention of these motions is to bring about a situation in which new airlines could come in and provide scheduled services that are not now being provided because of the way in which the Government has sought to support the present operators. That is not a matter of argument and I do not seek to intrude on Standing Orders in any way. But I believe that this is one way in which this Parliament could act immediately to enable us to reach the much needed productivity goals of this country. As we watch, day after day, the Hawke Government gradually sink more and more into the morass of confusion and the absolute disaster which it is bringing upon this country, we can see that parliamentary action of this sort is more and more relevant.

Senator Messner seemed to take the view that one could simply demolish an incipient argument by putting a name to it. He suggested that what I was putting by way of a second reading attachment was socialism and seemed to think that the term `socialism', being to him such a pejorative term, was sufficient to demolish an argument no matter how well put. If socialism means justice, equity and fairness, then I guess I am a socialist. If in the reverse we have inequity, injustice and unfairness-which is what we have at present under this Government's policy of deregulation-then I am opposed to that. That is not socialism; it is not fair or just.

        Senator Stone said, `Oh, that is Douglas Credit', as if putting a name to it were sufficient to demolish the idea. I point out, in linking those two aspects together, that Lincoln and Jefferson-two of the fathers of the American system, which is held in such high regard in this country-both in their time supported the idea that the State should be the origin of credit creation. There is a long history to the value of this idea.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, when this question was raised at the time the Government was moving to sell off 30 per cent of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), and I raised the issue that the Government could raise the credit through its own credit creating facilities, Senator Walsh attempted to demolish the idea by saying that that idea was out of fashion-not that there was anything wrong with it, but it was just unfashionable. I suggest that there is a lot that is absolutely wrong with what the Government is doing and with what the Opposition is supporting in the fashion, as my colleague Senator Powell has said, of Tweedledum and Tweedledee. It is fairly clear, when one looks at the facts rather than the ideology, that the present system is simply not working.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Messner wept crocodile tears about small business. I point out to him that Christopher Skase, who has been very much in the news this morning, had no difficulty in raising large amounts of funds for his Mirage hotels. At the same time under this process of deregulation, supported by both the Government and the Opposition, small business people have had enormous difficulty, are paying very high interest rates and are going to the wall in droves. The fact of the matter is that the present system is not serving small business. Moreover, it does not necessarily follow, in a system in which government creates credit and makes that credit available to productive enterprise, that that credit may not go to a whole range of small businesses. It is more likely to do that than it is under a system which is simply driven by market greed.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, there is unfortunately this ideological belief that deregulation of the banking industry would somehow lead to more competition and, through that, would lead to cheaper money. The price of money of course is interest. It is quite clear that deregulation has not led to cheaper money. One of the reasons for its introduction in the first place has simply not been borne out by the history of deregulation. Since deregulation interest rates in Australia have more than doubled. If one looks for the source of this interest rate increase it is not all that difficult to find, because more competition has led on the input side to more competition for funds to be borrowed by the banks themselves-the funds against which the banks lend money. So the competition for funds pushes up the interest rates on the bank borrowing side and because the banks have to pay higher rates of interest it follows that they must lend at higher rates of interest. It is at least plausible to argue that the increase in competition has not led to a decrease in interest rates, but has led directly to an increase in interest rates. Moreover, because the banks are borrowing larger amounts of money and paying higher rates of interest this necessarily leads to an increase in money flow into the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Messner is arguing that it is necessary to control the money supply. I ask: How in a deregulated system is either the Government or the Opposition going to control that money supply under those conditions of deregulation? It follows logically that one needs, at least in some measure, to regulate the system if one is going to control the inflow of money. Of course, the high interest rates being paid by banks and other lending institutions are directly related to the inflow of money. As Senator Messner has pointed out, there has been a real increase in money supply in Australia. He gave those figures--

         —Senator Stone is attempting to be distracting. As Senator Stone's colleague pointed out to him, M3 is a reasonable definition for the purposes of this debate here. It has increased very substantially and that, in itself, is a cause of the high inflation rate. At the same time the Government is telling us that it wants to control demand, to reduce demand. One of the Government's stated aims in relation to high interest rates-to the extent that it has anything to do with them-is to decrease demand. The Government has essentially bought itself into a system in which deregulation and the need to control demand are operating in different directions, are operating counter to each other. The Opposition would make both these situations worse because it is essentially ideologically committed to the same program.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Other countries have more tightly controlled their banks. Indeed, in countries that are doing better economically-countries such as Germany and Japan-there is much tighter control of banking than there is in Australia. The central German bank has essentially sterilised capital inflow into Germany and it allows much less credit creation against deposits. The Japanese Government prevented the Japanese banks from underwriting the purchase of United Airlines shares. That situation directly led to the hiccup in the share market the other week, indicating the degree of control which the Japanese exercise in relation to Japanese banks buying what they regard as-it is a beautiful term-`junk shares'. This is the sort of thing that the Australian Government is not able to control at present and is loath to attempt to control.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is unfortunate that, while the Japanese see the United States as a cowboy economy, we tend to follow the United States example. We send people over there to its business schools and we bring back those ideas. The United States economic model is one which is far more laissez faire with far more short time horizons, whereas the Japanese quite clearly have much longer time horizons and keep much tighter control in their banking. One need only pose the question: How would any company in Australia take a 15 or 20 year time horizon with interest rates as they are at present? It would simply be quite impossible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Coming back to the point about credit creation, it is not generally recognised that banks in this country lend approximately 10 times as much as they have on deposit. If one goes in to a bank and borrows $60,000 for the part purchase of a home costing $100,000 in most instances the bank is simply creating a couple of book entries. One is a debit entry which it makes against one's account and the other is a credit entry which it makes to itself. The point is that, as one pays off that loan, one pays with real money and the bank acquires a real asset.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are told that at present we have an acute shortage of housing in Australia, yet housing interest rates are now extremely high. With the possible exception of Hobart, one sees cranes festooning almost every city skyline. The finance companies and the banks are building at a prodigious rate. Of course, banks can simply create credit for themselves; they can build banks and, at the end of the building period, simply demolish that debt to themselves through the stroke of a pen. As I have indicated already, the banks creating this credit are a major source of inflation in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Credit creation by government was the intention of the Labor Party with the creation of the Commonwealth Bank. I remind honourable senators sitting opposite that the policy of the Labor Party at its inception was that the government should be the credit-creating body in the country. One can only bemoan the fact that the Labor Party has moved away from that policy. The market system, which operates under deregulation, determines that credit does not go to those productive areas to which one would wish credit to flow. Indeed, one has seen numerous examples in Australia and, as I have indicated already, one could point to the construction of a chain of Mirage hotels by Christopher Skase, who now appears to be in great financial difficulty. Not only have the foreshores of places like north Queensland been desecrated by the building of some of these enormously expensive hotels but also, as we have now learnt, they are not even good investments. That is where the money has gone. One must pose the question: What does it benefit Australia for money to go into those sorts of enterprises? What does it benefit Australia for Mr Bond to buy yet another brewery, which may already be owned by Australians, by using some of that credit that is created rather than that money flowing into productive enterprise? Of course, if it were government controlled, government could determine that it went into productive enterprises. A moment ago Senator Stone attempted to interject and asked why banks occasionally go broke. It is precisely because, very often, they make quite massive, stupid investments. We have seen a number of those in Third World countries where they have simply overreached themselves.

         —If Senator Stone had been listening, he would have heard me saying that banks have to have some deposits against their credit creation, and it is quite possible for them to overreach themselves. Quite clearly, the Government's policy is not working. The banks and other lending institutions are spending large amounts on speculative investments, directly and indirectly. In doing that they are desperately attempting to stimulate demand against the professed program of the Government, which is to dampen down demand. Under these circumstances the only thing that the Government can do is attempt to push interest rates still higher, which further advantages the banks and shifts money even further away from areas of need into areas of greed. Of course, in recent years we have seen banks making excessive profits, far higher than the sorts of modest increases which are allowed to all other workers in the economy. Moreover, the credit which is created by the banks has not been going to those areas where the money is used productively or to areas of real need, such as housing. This blind, ideological commitment to deregulation is simply not working and there is a real need to re-regulate.

Since when were the best ideas not adopted because they were unfashionable? The answer to this rhetorical question must be: When we have totally pragmatic governments and totally pragmatic oppositions unfashionability becomes a sufficient excuse for not adopting an idea.

         —The Opposition does not oppose the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which we are debating this evening, although we will be moving an amendment to one clause of the Bill at the appropriate time in committee. Of course, the Opposition has moved an amendment to the second reading motion concerning the Government's quite reprehensible action in engineering, through the Reserve Bank of Australia, a recent deal to in effect bribe the major trading banks to hold down further interest rate increases for home loan borrowers in a desperate last throw attempt to retain power at the next election. I will come back to that later.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to implement a number of revisions to the Banking Act 1959. It simply formalises in large degree an already well-tried and well-established practice for the prudential supervision of the banking system. Two of the specific changes were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget in 1988: first, the removal of the distinction between trading banks and savings banks and, secondly, the phasing out of the statutory reserve deposits arrangements and their replacement by what are to be called non-callable deposits which banks will be required to maintain with the Reserve Bank as part of their obligations as authorised banks. Both of those steps go towards achieving a more effective, stable and efficient banking system. Therefore, the Opposition does not oppose them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note in passing for the record-it is an important noting for the record-that both these changes flow not initially from this Government but from the days and the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, which was established by the Fraser Liberal-National Party Government in 1979. It was commissioned by the then Treasurer, Mr John Howard, in 1979. Through his commissioning of the Campbell Committee and through the recommendations and findings of the Campbell Committee in its final report, I believe John Howard was, quite unequivocally, in many ways the architect of the deregulation of the financial system in the 1980s, although it would obviously be churlish not to give credit to the Hawke Government for having followed through and actually put in place many of those reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am astounded, though perhaps I should not be surprised, in this debate by the vehemence of the Australian Democrats against the banking system of this country. Obviously it is born of massive ignorance, a lack of fundamental understanding of what the banking system in this country is all about, the role that it plays in commerce and industry in this nation, and the extent to which the banks are subjected not only to internal competition but also, through deregulation and freeing up of the financial system, competition from overseas. To deny the role that the banks play in the overall functioning of our whole economic system seems to me to be as indicative as any other point could be of the extent to which the Australian Democrats are bereft of even the most basic understanding of economic management and the economic functioning of an economy such as ours.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have just given the Treasurer and the Hawke Government the credit for having put in place many of the changes which flowed through from the recommendations of the Campbell Committee. However, in his pronouncement in the second reading speech in introducing this Bill and in other comments in this place and outside, he has attempted to rewrite history with the regrettably highly exaggerated claims about his role in certain important respects. For example, it was not this Government but the Fraser Government that in June 1982 removed quantitative controls on bank lending. I accept that the Hawke Government abandoned monetary targets in January 1985. Mr Keating has claimed that the Government abandoned them some considerable time before that-another notable exaggeration. But he omits to mention that the reason this Government abandoned monetary targeting was that its economic management was so deplorable and its targeting made so inaccurate by the actual monetary aggregates that it was forced through that pressure to abandon monetary targeting because it had allowed monetary growth to get out of control in a way that helped and continues to help to fuel the inflationary pressures which have been one of the more notorious hallmarks of this Government's economic mismanagement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have mixed views about the abandonment of monetary targets. I do not see any theoretical reason why they need to be abandoned in a deregulated system. They imposed a useful discipline even if that was essentially a psychological discipline. With their abandonment came an apparent abandonment of debate and consideration of monetary aggregates. That is regrettable because it has led to the view in many quarters, and seemingly within important councils of the Government, not least the Treasurer, that monetary aggregates are somehow not important, that the rate of change in these aggregates is not important, that the earlier concepts of money supply and money supply growth are no longer relevant and that monetary policy is therefore not important. But of course it is. Under this reckless, hopelessly mismanaged Government, monetary policy is the only arm of economic policy on which it allows itself to rely.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government abandoned fiscal policy long ago. It forfeited any ability to use wages policy through its spineless, obsequious subservience to the trade union movement, through its abject but unsuccessful attempts to buy industrial peace through the accord and through its total capitulation to the Australian Council of Trade Unions over the details of the Industrial Relations Bill. I believe this capitulation has been responsible for the total failure of the Government to provide any leadership whatsoever towards the resolution of what is arguably the most crippling dispute in Australia's history, namely, the pilots dispute. This dispute has been prolonged by the hysterical and erratic gyrations of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by the reprehensible abuse, misuse and misappropriation by the Government of taxpayers' funds in the form of a bribe to the Government's mates in the airline industry to continue the dispute in order to prop up and preserve the accord and therefore the relationship between the Government and the trade unions. What a way to run an airline, let alone run a country! The expected cost of that bribe is not yet known, but reasonable estimates put it at $100m or more.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the Government has thrown two potential arms of macro-economic policy out of the window. It has thrown out fiscal policy and wages policy. What of the other two, namely, exchange rate policy and monetary policy? Exchange rate policy has been effectively sabotaged as a result of the torpedoing of fiscal policy and wages policy. That leaves the Government with only monetary policy. How has the Government used monetary policy? It has used it very simply. It has used it in an entirely political way, not in terms of rational economic policy or effective monetary management but in a cold, cynical, opportunistic political way at a very great cost to the economy and at great cost to practically all Australians. It has done this on numerous occasions. It did it in late 1984 as we ran up to the early election of 1 December 1984. It did it in 1987 and running into the early part of 1988 in a last ditch, desperate attempt to save the Unsworth Government in New South Wales. Thankfully it was an unsuccessful attempt but it was a very costly attempt for Australians. Now in an equally desperate last ditch attempt to save its own political skin the Government has done a quite reprehensible deal, engineered through the Reserve Bank, to bribe the major trading banks to the tune of some $200m in order to get them to refrain from further housing loan interest rate increases, regardless of whether the situation demands or would warrant those increases or not.

The Opposition agrees that the concept of the interest rate on non-callable deposits being more a market rate is unexceptionable but two things are highly exceptionable and reprehensible. The first is the timing of taking that action now when all the circumstances facing the economy would argue against it at this stage, and the second is tying to a shabby deal with the banks to forgo what may be necessary housing loan interest rate increases not only in the interests of home lenders and the economy as a whole but in the interests of small business and all those other sectors of the economy that rely on borrowed funds. That is reprehensible, shabby and politically and cynically opportunistic and I believe it is going to cost the Government a great deal in votes.

        The Government has shown that it is bereft of new ideas. It is a very tired government. It is becoming an increasingly opportunistic government. That political opportunism and the populism for which the Prime Minister has been notorious throughout his whole career are costing Australians, particularly Australian taxpayers, dearly. I have mentioned the outrageous decision to subsidise the airlines. I have mentioned the deal with the banks. Then we have the proposal to succumb to a $60m virtual blackmail threat by Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd to preserve the jobs of people who live in the Prime Minister's electorate. Looking at populist indefensible decisions we come next to the indefensible decision to prevent mining at Coronation Hill. Some people may see these decisions as clever politics. That is all they are. They are absolutely bereft of any semblance of rational or responsible government. Some people may see these decisions as clever politics; obviously the Government does. I am absolutely certain that the Australian population is more intelligent than that. It will see through that opportunism and that tiredness and will reject this Government at the polls whenever the election may be held.

       <para>
        There is an enormous contrast between the policy position of the Government and that of the Opposition at this point. The Government has run out of ideas. It is clutching at straws in a desperate effort to retain power. In the last couple of weeks the Opposition has produced a policy package of enormous importance and of major dimensions. It is not just a change at the margin of the policies of this Government. It is a policy of fundamentally different dimensions in economic terms and in social terms and in terms of the whole role of government in our society and our community. For a start it brings down the level of government spending and revenue. It produces smaller government on both sides. In doing that it provides an incentive for people to get back into the work force if they are not in it already and, more importantly, it provides incentives for people who want to have a go at doing their own thing and using their own initiatives and it rewards them for the effort that they put in. The policy package that the Opposition has brought forward is all about creating a more productive Australia, a more efficient Australia and a more competitive Australia and, therefore, a fairer Australia for all people.

This Government, despite the wishes of some of its senior members-not the least perhaps the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-has not had the political will, courage or ability to get through such a program. Instead it has been continually controlled by the extreme left of the political spectrum in this country, which has said to the Government, `Thou shalt not sell one productive asset in this country that is now owned by the Government. Therefore, let's condemn it to continuing inefficiency and stultification'. They are the differences between this Government and the Opposition.

         —The Banking Legislation Amendment Bill is an important piece of legislation. All honourable senators who have spoken in this debate have conceded that. It seeks to remove the distinction between the trading and saving banks, replaces the statutory Reserve Bank requirement and provides for the Reserve Bank to monitor and investigate certain aspects of banking operations. The Opposition supports the thrust of the legislation because it relates to a process of reform of the financial sector that dates back to the Fraser years. Due credit has been given to the Treasurer of the time, the honourable member for Bennelong, John Howard, for the process that he put in train, for which he fought hard in those times in the Cabinet.

        Madam Acting Deputy President, you may well have been in the chair when the Australian Democrats' economic supremo, Senator Coulter, presented his case and the case for the Democrats with all the economic wisdom that the Democrats could muster. It was a dog's breakfast and we all know it. We know that the Democrats have absolutely no economic credibility not only in this chamber and in this Parliament but also in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coulter spoke of the German banks. He would not specify whether he meant East Germany or West Germany. After listening to him, I believe that he meant East Germany. Senator Messner's accusations about the Democrats this evening were spot on. They are the old time socialists. They live back in the days of the 1960s and the 1950s when it was believed by the academics, and they were trying to sell the idea, that socialism was a legitimate alternative, that the Eastern bloc nations were economically on the move. We all know today that that is a farce. Today we are witnessing historic events in the Eastern bloc countries. For Senator Coulter to align himself with those sorts of operations is nothing short of a disgrace. Certainly, the people inside those countries would have a thing or two to say about Senator Coulter's idea of economics.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coulter's wild assertions-that is all they were-about banks being able to write off their investment projects would take me all night to work out. I cannot see how that could possibly happen. What Senator Coulter fails to understand is that a bank is nothing more than a shell. It has other people's money. Has he not seen the advertisements? It is our money. When a bank goes out to invest under its own banner, it does so in the same manner as anyone else. It gets its money from other people. It is a financial cycle. Banks cannot write off their own loans. What idiotacy.

         —Senator Stone did not quite make the point, so let me make it for him. The Democrats are verging on being imbeciles when it comes to talking in the financial sector. The banks are nothing but financial intermediaries. That is all they are and that is all they have ever been through time. Senator Coulter's senseless accusation that a bank will invest in a $100m skyscraper in Collins Street, Melbourne-indeed, it would cost more than that-and then write that debt off is senseless and unworthy of presentation during this very serious economic debate. Its presentation is certainly unworthy of a public representative. He should stick to what he assumes he knows, which is Aboriginal affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation. Senator Coulter will have a very heavy burden to carry in the years to come for the part he played in the passage of that legislation. To give him credit, he did a good deal of homework on it, but in the final analysis he lacked the wisdom to know which way to vote. He will have to wear that over the years. He should stay out of economics. He should stay away from preaching about the financial sector. He should watch how that legislation unfolds because he has done in this chamber a grave disservice to the people of Australia, let alone the Aboriginal people, and he has to wear that. He dares to dabble in other areas when he has already been a disaster in one. I will now move on to the substance of the legislation before the chamber, the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1989.

        In an attempt to keep a lid on interest rates, as has been said by my colleagues, a deal has been entered into, via the Reserve Bank, with the commercial banks. It is a clear indication that this Government will go to any lengths to interfere politically with the proper operations of the Reserve Bank. It is a desperate move. It completely throws out the Government's monetary policy, once the centrepiece of its economic policy. Now the Government must tackle this nation's growing economic crisis, including its current account crisis. In reality, the deal with the banks will not stick. It will be lucky to stick beyond Christmas, because of the growing current account deficit. It is a discriminatory deal. It distorts the market. It is very selective. It does not include the non-banking sector, the credit unions and the building societies, which have already put up their home loan interest rates. It discriminates against small business and other borrowers, who will derive absolutely no benefit from it. Indeed, it will disadvantage them, as prime overdraft interest rates will rise to compensate to some degree for the subsidising of home loans. So the banks have joined an array of desperate deals that this Government has set up to prevent the economy from falling apart, hopefully until the election.

        The deal with the banks will cost taxpayers about $200m. The Kodak deal will cost taxpayers $60m. As Senator Stone pointed out in his speech, in his State of Queensland and in my State of Victoria this deal has rubbed small business up the wrong way because Kodak has direct competition in the domestic market. It is another very selective deal. The airlines deal will cost taxpayers about $100m. Who knows how much it will cost if it keeps going the way it is? The latest prediction is that it will go beyond Easter. What a disgraceful set of circumstances. Every honourable senator who has spoken in this debate on my side of the chamber has pointed out that the dispute is destroying the tourism industry.

It is well known that their relationship is not a business relationship. The relationship goes back further than this strike. Sir Peter Abeles has an advantage over ordinary Australian families. That is the way it is turning out and that is the way it is being seen in the electorate-that there is favouritism. The Prime Minister must come out and say that any deal he has done with Sir Peter Abeles has not been done on the basis of friendship. It would not hurt him to come out and say that, but he has not done so.

        The waterside workers deal costs an estimated $150m. Tas Bull, the head of the Waterside Workers Federation, is dictating the reforms on the waterfront. The reforms will be nil. We will have another three years of talkfest. No-one should hope that under this agreement there will be substantial reforms. The taxpayers will subsidise the $150m pay-out. The Kakadu deal will cost a massive $7 billion. Coronation Hill, which could cost as much as $7 billion, is another deal done with a very selective group and with an eye towards the election. After all these deals-the banking deal, the Kodak deal, the airlines deal, the waterside workers deal and the Kakadu deal-when an unfortunate pensioner approached the Prime Minister and asked him for a better deal on pensions or at least for an explanation, the Prime Minister called him a `little bugger'.

        The Treasurer is nothing more than a little man standing at the dyke with his fingers in all the holes as the tidal wave approaches. The Government has no policies except to make a deal. The Government is finished, and the Minister in the chamber knows it. Each deal that it does is selective. It in no way contributes to the fundamental restructuring of the economy. Why does the Treasurer not do a deal with Australian families? Families have carried the burden of high interest rates and high inflation rates with the promise of a light at the end of the tunnel. All Australian families have had in the six years of this Government is a train coming the other way.
       </para>
       <para>
        In stark contrast, the coalition's policies in the run-up to the election are all in place. The coalition will reduce interest rates and inflation. It will achieve a major shift of resources into production, and export and import replacement. Coronation Hill will be the first step in getting our exports going and releasing the mineral wealth of this nation. The waterfront is equally important. Crushing the waterside workers' monopoly on the waterfront is important in making our exports more competitive.

        The public sector will not escape from the dynamic enterprise policies of the coalition. There is no reason why the Government should be providing goods and services which the private sector can provide just as efficiently. The coalition's privatisation paper lists certain enterprises such as Medibank Private, Australian Airlines, Australian National Line and Aussat. What is the policy of the Government on privatisation? It is a split Cabinet and a split party. Meanwhile, enterprises such as Australian Airlines and Qantas Airways are starved of valuable capital.

        The coalition's Economic Action Plan has not forgotten the Australian family. Reforms in the economic package include: the provision of substantial child tax rebates, estimated at around $1 billion; assistance to working mothers with tax rebates for child-care; easing of the income test for dependent spouse rebates; and the commitment to hand back the increase in tax caused by bracket creep. These measures are all fully funded as outlined in the Economic Action Plan document. It is the most comprehensive and detailed plan ever produced by an Opposition in this country.

         —I would like to thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate, but I would be an absolutely smarmy hypocrite if I did. It is only a week ago that this Senate was proudly slapping itself on the back and congratulating itself on the quality of debate in this chamber on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. Anyone reading the Hansard of this second reading debate would find nothing very illuminating and nothing of which the Senate can be proud. In fact, most of the contributions have had absolutely nothing to do with this Banking Legislation Amendment Bill.

        We heard from Senator Stone, and I have to say that his was the most coherent speech made during the debate on this Bill. The other speeches seemed to fall into two categories. First of all, the second eleven of the Liberal Party made their Appropriation Bill speeches on a banking Bill. I wondered what the common theme was when I saw that it was Senator Michael Baume, Senator Messner and Senator Short speaking for the Liberal Party. Of course, the common theme is that they have all been relegated to the back bench. I suppose the banking Bill is seen as a vehicle to get back to the front bench. Most of the contributions included the pilots strike and meandered like Snake River over a whole range of things, and I do not intend to respond to those irrelevancies.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I found the performance of the Liberal Party somewhat meandering, I could at least divine what its members were saying. When it comes to the Australian Democrats, I am totally and absolutely bemused as to what they were getting at. Senator McLean can occasionally make rational criticism of banks, but it is so mixed up with paranoia and irrational hate of banks at the moment that it is hard to follow. Senator Powell takes what we call the soft underbelly approach each time, talking about the little people and how much she wants to help them. And Senator Coulter-well, Senator Coulter was Senator Coulter. Finally, we heard from Senator McGauran, who introduced a couple of new words to the English language. I would like to congratulate him on `idiosocracy', or whatever it was. That was a fascinating one.
       </para>
       <para>
        The theme of the criticism was a general criticism of the Government. I understand, although one could not tell it from the debate, that most people in the chamber will probably support the substance of the Bill, with maybe a couple of amendments being moved during the committee stage. Senator Short and Senator McGauran pointed to the wonderful economic policy released by the Opposition last week. I listened to their Federal President talk three or four days ago about taking from the bludgers and giving to the workers. I picked up today's newspaper and saw what he is about-a $50,000 per week pay rise for the person who made that comment. I do not think anyone on the Opposition benches is crass enough to be as crass as John Elliott-that he could make that statement about taking from the bludgers and giving to the workers when he got a $50,000 a week pay rise is absolutely staggering. I am certain that Senator McGauran, even though he took seven years to get his economics degree, would have to agree with me that it is absolutely staggering that the Federal President of the Liberal Party could do that.

        In conclusion, I normally try to be gracious and thank honourable senators for their contributions. I am sorry the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is not here to handle this Bill, as he could do it a lot more competently than I can. I think the substance of this Bill is accepted by most people in this chamber. I take it that the Democrats' opposition to the Bill would have been opposition no matter what was in the Bill. As long as it had the word `bank' in it they would oppose it because of the populism which they are trying to develop. It is akin to the know nothing movement of the 1850s in the United States of America, which Senator Cooney has probably studied. It is crass populism. It always goes down the drain in the end, but it always peaks; and if one can ride the wave at the right time it is very good.

       <para>
        The substance of the second amendment is, as I have already outlined in the second reading debate, to insert a new part VIa into the Bill which will establish a bank consumers assistance fund. As I said in the second reading debate, if the self-regulation approach of the banking ombudsman scheme is to work and is to be seen to work then it is important that the voice of consumers in the banking industry is heard. We have heard time and time again from Opposition members that they object to consumer organisations being funded from government funds. There have even been some voices from the Government occasionally-Senator Walsh among them-making similar objections. Therefore we think these amendments should be quite acceptable, at least to the Opposition, since the source of funding is the industry itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also pointed out in the second reading debate that the basis for the funding as a formula is the money spent by the banking industry on advertising, that is, promoting its wares and, as my colleague Senator McLean said in his speech at the second reading stage, largely promoting debt in this community and advertising which the community is now saying is ineffective, confusing and irritating. Nevertheless, that is the formula base that we have chosen. In this amendment we have outlined a number of significant and reputable organisations in the community that could be the recipients of these funds. I have already listed groups in my speech at the second reading stage. The list is able to be extended by prescription. The discretion on payments is in the hands of the Minister, but one part of the amendment makes it clear that no less than 90 per cent of moneys would have to be paid out during the financial year to the bodies listed in the amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is acknowledged by the Australian Democrats and by consumer organisations that some attempt is being made, through the establishment of the banking ombudsman scheme, to address the concerns in the community. We do not have enormous confidence in the scheme and we have said that we will be watching its progress closely, but it is timely that the day after the scheme was officially launched by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) the chamber has the opportunity to materially-and I use the word advisedly-support the genuine operation of that scheme in the interests of the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the amendments to the Opposition on the basis that at least we are not asking for taxpayers' money this time, and to the Government on the basis that a couple of weeks ago it clearly thought it ought to do something about the consumer ground swell of concern about banks-Steve Martin proposed his committee reference with great sound and fury-but has now pulled back from that and has the opportunity to be seen to be doing something for consumers, as opposed to hundreds of thousands of dollars being doled out to the banks.

         —I do not wish to be unreasonably harsh in my comments on the Australian Democrats' amendments; so, before I allow myself to be, I might seek some elucidation from Senator Powell on the amendments. Senator Powell assured the chamber that the Opposition ought not be concerned about the amendments because the funding of the mythical creature, the bank consumers assistance fund, which the Democrats in their fevered imagination have conjured up, is to come not from the Parliament, the Commonwealth or taxpayers, but from the banking industry. I find two problems in that regard. First, clause 53 (3) in the proposed new part VIa says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are to be paid into the Fund such amounts as are appropriated by the Parliament from time to time for the purposes of the Fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        That implies that a parliamentary appropriation process is involved somewhere, despite what Senator Powell told us. Secondly, and perhaps more fundamentally, I take it that Senator Powell would rely upon her proposed new subclause 54 (1) of proposed new part VIa, which reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Where there is in force an Act imposing on banks, for the purposes of this section, a tax on the advertising expenditure of banks . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask Senator Powell whether there is some piece of legislation that I am not aware of that imposes on banks a tax on their advertising expenditure or whether the Democrats have a Bill up their sleeves to put through the Parliament-it will not have much chance of getting through this chamber-which will give the clause effect. In the absence of such a piece of legislation, unless I am misreading the clause, the clause has no effect whatsoever.

         —Senator Stone is wrong: of course the amendments would have an effect. That is, the Australian Democrats can get out on the campaign trail and tell everyone they have done it, even though it has no possibility of occurring. If it is put as a proposition when no-one is there to contest it, the gullible will believe it. The Government shares Senator Stone's attitude to this clause. We cannot support the amendments, not least because I have the same query as Senator Stone: which tax are the Democrats referring to? It is apparently a tax that will be imposed in a possible private member's Bill some time in the future. I think the Democrats have put the cart before the horse, in any event.

       <para>
        There are other problems with the amendments, in terms of the narrow range of organisations that the Democrats would like to pork barrel in this instance. Some of them are good, some of them are bad, some of them have nothing at all to do with the clause concerned. We will have to wait until the Democrats introduce their other legislation, and they might like to include this in it, but I would still find it very hard to support it. Perhaps in the meantime we can see whether the banks' initiative to set up an ombudsman is a real move, or is working, and that will be found out over time. At this stage, it seems to me to be a double-barrelled approach, and it also seems that the Democrats are saying that they do not like bank advertising. I gathered that from the second reading debate. I do not see why they would single out the banks in that regard. There is very little advertising that I like or approve of.

        `(1a) Nothing in this section authorises the board to furnish a report under paragraph (1) (aa) with respect to the affairs of an individual bank or the affairs of an individual customer of a bank.'.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both amendments relate to the same matter, namely, that elements of the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill will give the Reserve Bank of Australia power to conduct investigations and in particular to inquire into, for prudential purposes, the affairs of a bank and more particularly the affairs of an individual customer of the bank. While the Opposition does not question the good faith in which the amendment is put forward, nor the good faith in which the Reserve Bank would observe or carry out this section of the Act, we feel uneasy that there should be in the law of the land a provision which, on the face of it, contains no safeguard against potential invasion of privacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am choosing my words carefully because I do not wish to impugn the motives of the Government in bringing forward this legislation; of the Reserve Bank, which no doubt advised it to do so; and least of all those officers of the Reserve Bank who are at present engaged in prudential supervisory tasks and would be called on to administer this part of the Act if a question arose in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have suggested in our first amendment, to clause 16 of the Bill, that the first subclause should be replaced as provided in the first amendment, to make it obligatory that the Governor of the Reserve Bank must be satisfied that a report on specified prudential matters in relation to a bank is necessary. That is the essential difference between the clause which we are proposing and the clause as it stands in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second amendment which we have proposed is to insert after the present clause 49 a new clause that would deal with the annual report and financial statements of the bank and which would make it mandatory for the Reserve Bank to include in its annual report a specific reference to any investigations on prudential matters pursuant to section 61 of the Banking Act, which we were dealing with a moment ago, including details of persons appointed to investigate and report on such matters. At the same time, of course, we make it clear that nothing in that amendment would authorise the Reserve Bank to furnish a report regarding the affairs of an individual or the affairs of individual customers of a bank.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both amendments go to the question of privacy and they are put forward in good faith. I understand that the Government in the other place has said that it would not accept the amendments there. I do not anticipate any particular change of view on Senator Ray's part and by a shake of his head he confirms my pessimism in that respect. Nevertheless, we feel that it is necessary to give our colleagues on our left-the Australian Democrats-an opportunity to show what they feel about these privacy matters.

         —With great insight, Senator Stone has guessed that the Government has not changed its position between when this legislation was considered in the House of Representatives and today. This is mostly because we think the Opposition's desires are already covered, in many ways within the existing legislation. The Opposition's proposed change to clause 16 is to insert a condition that the Governor of the Reserve Bank be satisfied that a report on the prudential matters is necessary before the Reserve Bank appoints a person to conduct an investigation. The Government sees no reason to depart from the formulation used elsewhere in the Bill and in the Banking Act which is to vest powers in the Reserve Bank. There are many areas of the Banking Act which vest powers in the Reserve Bank and which deal with sensitive and important matters. As the Bill stands, any use of the Reserve Bank power would have to be consistent with policy and procedures established by the Governor or the board of the Reserve Bank for the bank's operations and the Governor would have responsibility for any investigation which the Reserve Bank may initiate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to the second amendment, it is somewhat unclear what purpose would be served by the proposed change to section 81 of the Reserve Bank Act. On the one hand, the amendment appears to require that the Reserve Bank report to the Treasurer on the investigations of prudential matters undertaken pursuant to the proposed section 61 of the Banking Act. On the other hand, the Bank would be required not to report on the affairs of individual banks or the affairs of an individual customer of a bank-that is, the strictures in the proposed subsection (1a) would seem to cancel out much or all of the effect of the requirements of the proposed paragraph (aa). This could leave the Reserve Bank with the obligation to report only details of persons appointed to investigate and report on the prudential matters rather than the proposed section 61. It is difficult to see that this represents a matter of such importance that the Reserve Bank should report on it invariably rather than according to its discretion.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Reserve Bank were to appoint a person other than a Reserve Bank officer to conduct an investigation it could be expected to appoint professional auditors and accountants, including auditors already familiar with a particular bank's accounts. As the Privacy Commissioner has noted, these outside investigators would be bound by the strict standards of confidentiality applied to the Reserve Bank staff by Reserve Bank regulations. In view of the doubt regarding the usefulness of the provisions proposed by the Opposition and the fact that there is already a requirement in the Reserve Bank Act that the Reserve Bank report annually on its operations to the Treasurer, the Government cannot see its way to support this amendment.

         —I will be brief because presumably we would like to see this Bill passed this evening. The Australian Democrats support the amendments. I think the Committee is aware, as indeed the Australian public is aware, that we have been the one party which has been consistent in our attitude towards privacy matters. We believe that one has to be ultracautious in this no-risk area. We believe that we must totally protect the privacy of individuals. After all, we were the only party to campaign against the Australia Card. The Opposition visited it belatedly after the event. It would have been in government had it realised before the election the privacy implications of the Australia Card issue. We were the only party to protect, or attempt to protect, the privacy of Australians in relation to the tax file number legislation. We were the only party that seriously addressed the inadequacies of the privacy legislation when it was before this chamber last year. Indeed, on all of those matters the Opposition has been inconsistent and has even contradicted its own position. We are delighted that the Opposition has finally realised the significance of the issue of individual privacy. Therefore, it is the Democrats' intention to support these two amendments.

        <para in-line="1">
         —On 4 September, during the presentation of papers, I spoke briefly on a paper dealing with deaths in custody of Aboriginal people. At that stage I chose to talk about some deaths in custody of non-Aboriginal people. I have subsequently had the opportunity to go back and visit the Prison Medical Service at Long Bay, to examine some medical records there and to receive some briefing. Following this further information provided by Dr Frank McLeod of the Prison Medical Service, I wish to correct some errors in my first account. They are not large errors, but I think that I should put the record straight.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I referred to the death of Daniel Victor Taylor in custody. It turns out that Daniel Victor Taylor died from an acute fungal meningo-encephalitis due to candida albicans. That is a fairly common form of fungus, but it is very unusual to have it affect the brain. I am told by Dr McLeod that there have been only 28 recorded cases. The question arose as to whether there had been any negligence by the Prison Medical Service, and that is the crux of the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also drew attention to the fact, as it had been put to me, that Mr Taylor's methadone maintenance-he was addicted to heroin-had been reduced by half as a disciplinary measure. I now learn from Dr McLeod that it is true that Mr Daniel Victor Taylor had had his methadone reduced in dosage by half, but it transpires that there was no temporal relationship between that event-the reduction of his methadone-and the illness which killed him; in fact, they were separated by some four or five months. His methadone had been halved four or five months earlier and it bore no relation to his death.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would say that those who have put this claim up would not have had access to the records and would not have known that fact. He died after an illness of some 10 days, I think, but for the last three or four days had been clinically brain dead. He was admitted to the prison hospital at Long Bay with some very difficult, nondescript symptoms. After going back and getting a briefing I must say that I would not have been able to make a diagnosis and I certainly could not have made the diagnosis of the illness from which he died. I do not believe that the prison medical service could have made that diagnosis. The diagnosis was not made at Prince Henry Hospital. I believe that as there have been only 28 recorded cases it is almost impossible to have made a diagnosis.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question then arises as to whether he was admitted at an appropriately early time to Prince Henry Hospital. Soon after he was seen the medical officer in the Long Bay prison hospital determined that Mr Taylor should receive an urgent referral to a specialist physician-that was on 4 September-but his condition deteriorated very rapidly. I believe that he was in the hospital very soon after, on 5 September, and he was clinically brain dead by 11 September. I just want to put the record straight and say that there was no temporal relationship between the reduction in his methadone and the illness.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other person whose clinical circumstances I mentioned in the Senate was Mr Malcolm Hatch. His story was that he became ill at Cessnock gaol, was eventually transferred from Cessnock to Prince Henry Hospital via the prison hospital, and died of acute meningitis. It turns out that an inadequate recording system was operating at Cessnock prison. That has since been corrected. I will describe the recording system that Cessnock prison had. It was similar to the sort of system that one would have in casualty. When each person came in for attention, his name was written down and some clinical note was made. The problem with that recording system was that, if one person came back six or seven times, one might not be immediately aware that that person had come back six or seven times. At the time Malcolm Hatch became ill there had been a flu-like epidemic at Cessnock. I am told that between 3 and 10 July, which were relevant dates, there had been 557 visits to the clinic by people in Cessnock prison, all complaining of flu or flu-like symptoms. Mr Hatch was one of those people who had been to the Prison Medical Service in Cessnock on succeeding days. His symptoms seemed to be like those of other people who were attending the clinic at Cessnock gaol. On each occasion he was seen by one of the nurses, although he was treated symptomatically. Using what we call in medicine the retrospectoscope-Mr Acting Deputy President, you would understand that it provides perfect vision-one would say that a clinical error was made, but if one had been on the spot at the time one would have understood that people at the clinic were treating his illness as it seemed to occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        He presented first on 3 July 1988 and his symptoms then included the classic flu-like symptoms-rigours, aches, pains, cough and fever. One would have thought that this was just like every other illness. It was not until some days later that he started to develop any kind of central nervous system symptoms. On 8 July he was seen twice by the nurses. At this stage he had pain behind the right eyelid and in the head, but his headache, although getting worse, did not suggest that he had meningitis. In fact, he played touch football that day and he did not fail to attend muster every day in the prison. On 9 July he was seen again with more headaches and more pain in the right cheek and eye and he was again given symptomatic treatment. In hindsight, one might have become a little suspicious at this stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 10 July, which was a Sunday, he was seen in his cell because the correctional services officer was worried about his condition. He was seen by one of the nurses and at that stage, I am told, a clinical error was made. In retrospect, he then had a fever and a rapid pulse and he was slightly delirious. A decision was then made to get a doctor to see him early in the morning, whereas in retrospect a decision should have been made to move him at that stage. The next morning he was moved to the Long Bay prison hospital and from there to Prince Henry Hospital, where he was found to have a meningeal infection which rapidly deteriorated, and he died.
       </para>
       <para>
        The interesting thing is that one would have thought that, with pain in the right cheek and X-rays suggesting that he had a blocked sinus, the clinical diagnosis that was eventually made of meningitis, secondary to sinusitis, would have been a reasonable diagnosis. In fact, at autopsy something quite unexpected was discovered. He certainly had meningitis but he did not have right maxillary sinusitis at all: he had a quite unsuspected chronic osteomyelitis of the inner ear on one side, of which there had been absolutely no symptoms and which bore no relation to the illness from which he had suffered.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that there is a lot to be learned from that case. I understand that the Prison Medical Service, which is anxious to try to look after its charges, has made some changes in its recording system. In fact, one of the nurses looking after Mr Hatch has suffered grievously in a professional sense: she has felt remarkably upset by what happened. However, having now made several visits to Long Bay hospital and seen the work done there, I want to place on record my appreciation of Dr McLeod and his officers. I believe that they try, in a serious and consistent way, to look after the prisoners under their care. They are doing a number of things to address some of the major issues that occur in prisons, which I think it proper not to set out in the Senate or to go over in some detail. They are very concerned to look after the welfare of their charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Jenkins will know that we were concerned with three or four people. Dr McLeod made no reference, in his notes, for example, to the case of young Mr Searcy, another prisoner who died and about whom Senator Jenkins was concerned. I can make no further comments about that incident, but I must say that, in the case of Daniel Victor Taylor, the reduction of the methadone dosage was quite unrelated in time to the episode which killed him-an episode of an extremely rare fungal meningo-encephalitis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, in my previous speech I inadvertently said that Jamie Partlic-and some honourable senators would know about Jamie Partlic-had been bashed during his time in prison hospital. Of course, I did not mean that; he had been bashed during his time in prison. I said that he was a fine defaulter, but Hansard recorded it as a `find defaulter'. I ask Hansard to note that he was a fine defaulter who was in prison for a few days. That is what made both his case and the case of young Searcy so tragic.

        <para in-line="1">
         —Earlier today a report entitled Report of the Inquiry into the Death of John Raymond Pilot by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was tabled in the Senate. Senator Peter Baume, who was speaking before me on another matter, referred to an inquiry by this same Commission. At the time of the tabling of this report earlier today I believe that Senator Jenkins also spoke. We can all be distressed at the profound activities revealed in the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The report that was tabled earlier today regarding the death of John Raymond Pilot is a very tragic report; in fact, it raises an awful sequence of events that resulted in that death, including many instances of neglect. I wish to quote from the introduction to that report by Commissioner Wyvill, where he says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Pilot who had died alone was a 33-year old unemployed, homeless, Aboriginal man with a serious history of alcohol abuse. The cause of death was asphyxia brought about by a fit following a complete withdrawal of alcohol.
       </para>
       <para>
        His death in the watch-house was a consequence of official neglect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Throughout the report Commissioner Wyvill spends a lot of time looking at the various circumstances and makes a number of recommendations as well. Let me quote from some other comments:
       </para>
       <para>
        Pilot was at the time known to the police at the watch-house as an alcoholic and it was inevitable that at some time in the near future he would once again be in their custody and they would be responsible for his welfare.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report also states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, unless adequate preventive measures are taken, alcoholics incarcerated within hours of a drinking bout and without adequate supervision, or persons otherwise prone to epileptic seizures, are at risk in lock-ups and watch-houses throughout Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, this report makes awful reading. In fact, it records some tragic and unnecessary circumstances. In chapter 14 of the report Commissioner Wyvill outlines a series of underlying and other issues relating to the circumstances of Pilot's death. Let me give the particular points that Commissioner Wyvill covers. They are:
       </para>
       <para>
        14.1 The Establishment of Detoxification Units and Rehabilitation Centres
       </para>
       <para>
        14.2 The Acquisition and Use of Medical Information by Police
       </para>
       <para>
        14.3 Coronial Inquiries
       </para>
       <para>
        14.4 Reserve/Community Upbringing
       </para>
       <para>
        Those circumstances have been well set out by Commissioner Wyvill and relate to the underlying issues and causes of Aboriginal deaths. In this circumstance it related to the death of John Raymond Pilot. The Government has found it necessary to appoint a commissioner in Western Australia to undertake a series of other investigations into the underlying causes of Aboriginal deaths in custody in Western Australia. Mr Pat Dodson, a former Deputy Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and a former director of the Central Land Council in central Australia, has been appointed the commissioner to undertake this task.
       </para>
       <para>
        What concerns me about the appointment of Commissioner Dodson is the very unrealistic expectation that the underlying causes of Aboriginal deaths will obviously not be addressed by the other commissioners charged with the responsibility of investigating these causes as part of their inquiries. As I have said, Commissioner Wyvill has covered this very satisfactorily in the report tabled today into the death of John Raymond Pilot. In our investigation of the estimates of the Department of Administrative Services yesterday I was able to pursue questioning relating to the order of costs for the special inquiries that have now been put in place for Mr Pat Dodson.
       </para>
       <para>
        While Mr Dodson will be looking at these Western Australian instances, I seriously question the allocation of $1m for his series of investigations. They will take place over a 15-month period. Of course, Commissioner Dodson will not be looking at individual cases; he will be reviewing the underlying causes. I will just go through that order of costs that has now been determined. It is quite well known that Commissioner Dodson's salary is about $100,000. His travel allowance and fares will be $33,000; his staff and staff travel costs, $283,000; his consultants, including a former ADC commissioner with whom he shared status on the ADC, Mr Peter Yu, who I was able to ascertain in the course of my questioning had very little expertise in this area, $71,000; the set-up costs of an office in Broome for Mr Dodson, $80,000; the provision of four-wheel drive vehicles, $36,000; office requisites for Commissioner Dodson, $40,000; and office rental costs in this financial year, $53,000-in all a total of almost $700,000 in the financial year. If that is extrapolated through for the other three months to when the letters patent will be returned at the end of September next year, the order of costs for the running of Commissioner Dodson's office, to investigate 33 cases in Western Australia of which 11 are up in the north-west region, is extraordinarily high.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are well aware that the costs of this Royal Commission have blown out from the original estimate of $2.2m when it was set up to a total cost now of some $30m. But I seriously question the qualification of Commissioner Dodson to undertake this work, particularly at such a high cost for the result. I believe the outcome of Commissioner Dodson's report in this area of investigation will be predictable. Given the nature of the consultant he has appointed, Mr Yu, it will probably also be very questionable. I am fearful that it will be just another glossy magazine or glossy report to be put on the shelves. I would have preferred that $1m to have been expended in preventative measures, particularly in the area of alcohol rehabilitation, alcohol being a problem that underpins so many of these tragic cases of deaths in custody. As is so often the case with expenditure in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, it is a pity that the Government just throws money at the problem rather than seeking out proper solutions. It is also very important to question why mates of the Minister are given these responsibilities. Through investigations of the ADC, particularly since Minister Hand appointed Mr Dodson to the Board of the ADC in May 1988, we are well aware of the problems and complications that continually confounded the ADC in its various activities with regard to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am hopeful that the reports of the Royal Commission can be quickly brought to bear. Just as this one today on John Raymond Pilot by Commissioner Wyvill deserves and demands the attention of the Parliament, I hope that the other commissioners' reports into the individual deaths can be quickly brought to finality. I hope that they will all contain chapters relating to the underlying and other issues inherent in each and every case and will prove the totally unnecessary nature of the $1m consultancy that this Government has handed out on a platter to Mr Pat Dodson.

         —Senator Tambling has raised the question of the cost of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I will not detain the Senate very long in what I want to say about it. Honourable senators interested in this matter will know that I have spoken on this matter on a number of occasions and have also written a number of fairly lengthy newspaper articles about it. Honourable senators may recall what was probably the most recent address I gave to the Senate on the question of Aboriginal deaths in custody when I canvassed, in the same way as Senator Tambling has done with this report, what I think at that time were the seven reports by the Commission into the deaths of seven people. I expressed then my concerns about whether the interim recommendations of then Commissioner Muirhead would be implemented.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The reason I rise to speak in the adjournment debate tonight is to note, with a considerable degree of frustration, anger and sadness, the death in Maitland prison-this was referred to earlier today by, I think, Senator Jenkins-of Dermot Pidgeon, a 17-year-old kid who, apparently at his request, had transferred from a juvenile detention centre to an adult prison. It appears that some time on Saturday night of last weekend he took his life by hanging. Tonight on television news I watched an interview with the responsible New South Wales Minister who did not dispute what appears to be the case, that this young boy died at about 9 p.m. on Saturday and his body hung dead in his cell until 7.15 a.m. on Sunday, that is, for 10 hours. Of course, it is unknown at this stage how long he had been locked in that cell without supervision before his death. I was also interested to note that it was stated and confirmed by the Minister in the television interview this evening, that he was confined in an observation cell at Maitland prison.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have pointed out in a number of speeches that I have made previously in the Senate that some of the more interesting and pertinent statistics that have been produced by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody relate to the horrible fact that a very large number of young people take their own lives in Australian prisons. The number of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people who kill themselves in Australian prisons is almost precisely in proportion to their percentage of the prison population. That proportion is almost exact for any age range. For every 21-year-old Aboriginal person who kills himself in an Australian prison five 21-year-old non-Aboriginal prisoners take their own lives as well. I raise that-it is relevant that I raise it-for a reason. As I pointed out at the time, the recommendations-I am simply stating the obvious now in respect of what Senator Tambling has said earlier in the adjournment debate-of this very expensive royal commission will be of benefit not simply to Aboriginal prisoners but to all prisoners, no matter what their racial origins are, particularly those prisoners who are intoxicated when they are taken into custody.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is with some degree of despair-that is not too strong a word for how I feel about it-that I note the death of a 17-year-old boy in a New South Wales prison, Maitland prison, shortly after being transferred there. He apparently hung dead in his cell, an observation cell, for 10 hours without his body being discovered. I dare say that the inquiry-no doubt there will be a coronial inquiry held-will determine how long he had been confined in this cell without supervision of any kind.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the obvious point that before Commission Muirhead left the Royal Commission he brought down a comprehensive set of interim recommendations. That was not accidental. Commissioner Muirhead did that deliberately in order to get down in black and white a number of measures to try to stem this dreadful loss of life, particularly of younger people, in Australian prisons. Some of those recommendations were certainly controversial-for example, the ones about screening out racism and so on in police forces or prison services which I said at the time I thought would be very difficult to implement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality is that the great majority of those recommendations were sane, sensible and urgent. In terms of Government resources, there is no question at all that the urgent need at this point in time is for Muirhead's recommendations to be implemented in Australian prisons. We should all feel angry about the continuing role which I think is properly being played by the Royal Commission into Deaths in Custody when young Australians, in this case Aboriginal kids, are continuing to kill themselves in Australian prisons under circumstances that indicate that even the most basic of Muirhead's recommendations have not been followed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There does not appear to me to be the slightest point in the Commonwealth spending $20m or $30m on an inquiry to produce a report if the final result of that product is for that report to sit on a shelf somewhere gathering dust. The reason I make that point is that the Commonwealth is responsible for setting up and administering the Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody but it is not responsible for administering the prison systems in Australia; nor, in my view, should it be. That is clearly and properly the responsibility of the State governments. I simply rise to make the point that there does not appear to be much point at all in the Commonwealth allocating such large sums of public money to conduct what I think is an extremely necessary and warranted inquiry-an inquiry producing what the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs said in a recent press release have been extremely useful and pertinent reports into the deaths investigated so far-if the most basic of the recommendations regarding supervision that were brought down by Commissioner Muirhead are not implemented by the State prison services. If that is not done this is an exercise in total and very tragic futility.

         —I want to spend a few minutes of the Senate's time tonight to pay tribute to a constituent of mine who, sadly, died last week from asthma. Ironically Tony Miller, from Culcairn in New South Wales, died from this ailment in the very month that the Asthma Foundation had chosen to publicise the dangers of asthma attacks. Tony was not unaware of his ailment. In fact, I am told that he was such a severe sufferer that many years ago his doctor suggested he should stop working and receive sickness benefit. However, those who knew Tony Miller know that this was not an option he would ever have chosen.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Tony Miller was a doer. He thought about things and devised things, particularly ways to improve the welfare of animals. It was because of his involvement in overseas aid projects that my office first came to meet him several years ago. My most recent involvement with him was in relation to the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. This time last year he appeared before the Committee to discuss his work with sheep and goats in arid areas of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        He had great expertise in the behaviour of animals, particularly sheep and goats, and had acted as a consultant to large companies on welfare aspects of transporting sheep and goats, particularly in the Middle East live sheep export industry. He was concerned that sheep in arid and semi-arid areas of Australia suffered in drought times and he devised a water trough for use in outback areas. This has now attracted the interest of a major pump company and the autotrough will improve significantly the quality of water in outback areas and therefore the quality of life for sheep in those areas. That was just one project Tony Miller worked on in a lifetime of working with the land and animals. I regard it as a pleasure to have known Tony Miller, and I extend my sympathy to his wife, Glenice, and family.

         —I rise tonight to speak because I do not know whether many people are aware of the fact that today is the centenary of the speech made by Sir Henry Parkes at Tenterfield on 24 October 1889 which called for the federation of Australia. That speech is considered amongst historians as the turning point that began the process which just over 11 years later led to the federation of Australia and to the establishment of this chamber and the House of Representatives. I think it would be remiss of us if there were not some acknowledgment in the Senate and in the Parliament of Australia that we are here today as a result of the vision of Sir Henry Parkes, who on this day 100 years ago called for the federation of Australia.

         —I was unaware of that. I was at an interminable Senate committee meeting-something which federation has inflicted upon us as well as the Senate. I also want to pay tribute to the Tenterfield community. Only a couple of weeks ago I received a letter asking for support for Tenterfield's attempts to promote the celebration in the local community and the significance of that speech in Tenterfield 100 years ago. I think that we should put on the record that a small town in northern New South Wales is the place where a great speech was made.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also want to use this opportunity to point out that I believe it is time for the Australian community and the governments of Australia to start preparing for the celebrations of our centenary of federation on 1= January 2001. That is a long way off but I point out that we took 10 years to prepare for the celebration of our bicentenary. To me, the centenary of Federation is much more significant than the bicentenary, which was a celebration of 200 years of European settlement of Australia. It did not establish Australia as a separate or distinct nation; it celebrated the beginning of European settlement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most important celebration in my lifetime, and I hope I live that long, will be the centenary of Federation celebration. It will be the centenary of our becoming a nation. The centenary of Federation will be able to be conducted without the controversy and the agony particularly of our Aboriginal citizens who believed that the bicentenary was a celebration of an event that began 200 years of their exploitation. The centenary of Federation will celebrate the foundation of Australia as a nation and the Aboriginal people, as well as many other diverse sections of our community, will be able to celebrate their participation in our country despite the agony of their experience of the previous 200 years, or what will be 213 years by the time of the centenary of Federation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that, already, the Federal Government has established the continuation of the bicentenary road funding and that it is now called the centenary of Federation road funding. That is the first I have heard of any government moving to commemorate the centenary of our Federation. That should be only the very beginning of our preparations for that centenary.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the 1890s were the great ferment in Australian political affairs concerning what sort of constitution we should have in Australia to achieve Federation, I hope that the 1990s will be a decade to match the 1890s, enabling people in Australia to discuss maturely the need for constitutional change so that what Sir Henry Parkes and others called for in the 1890s to achieve Federation can be updated and we can go into the twenty-first century having made appropriate amendments under which Australia can govern itself and meet all of the challenges of the twenty-first century, which will be so different from what people perceived in 1890.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the long record of opposition in the Australian community to constitutional change, there could be some opportunity for the community to discuss maturely and reach some consensus on the need to change and adapt the Constitution for the next century. That, in conjunction with the centenary of Federation, would be very appropriate to the memory of Sir Henry Parkes. I do not believe that, when he made his speech in 1889, he would have expected the Constitution of Australia, which was adopted in 1901, to remain almost unchanged for the next 100 years. I believe that the founding fathers would have believed that constitutional change could have been achieved in this country much more readily. The Constitution is not a dead document. It should be a living document open to discussion leading to change.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of that process, referring again to the Aboriginal people, it should be possible to achieve a treaty between the descendants of European settlers of Australia and the Aboriginal people. It should be possible to obtain agreement between those peoples that we both share this continent, that we both have rights in this country and that we both understand where we came from.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that, in our history, there is a void in this area and, until it is resolved, we will always have a deficiency in the moral sense about the standing and establishment of our country. There is a case for the establishment of a treaty between the Aboriginal people and their descendants and the European people and their descendants concerning the nature of our country.
       </para>
       <para>
        My final point on constitutional change is that, during this period of the 1990s, though it is not popular in both countries at the moment, constitutional change leading to the political merging of Australia with New Zealand will become more popular. I was in New Zealand recently and I believe that anybody who raised this matter in New Zealand at the moment would be run out of the country very quickly. However, recent indications from polling in New Zealand show that the majority of New Zealand people believe that there should be a common economic policy between our countries, that there should be a common defence force between our countries and that there should be such things as a common currency in our countries. Those are already acceptable but political merger is absolutely rejected by a majority in both countries. Once we start moving towards merging economic and defence matters, people will, by evolution, see some advantages in the merging of both countries in a political way. That should be part of the process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again we should pay tribute to the founding fathers because the Constitution contains a clause that allows New Zealand to be considered as part of the Australian Federation. I agree that, if Australia and New Zealand did merge, we may have to consider adapting the name `Australia' to take account of New Zealand. In the past, the two countries have been referred to as Australasia and Oceania. Those names may be appropriate in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Above all, we ought to pay tribute to Sir Henry Parkes tonight for his foresight. If it were not for his commitment and ability to proselytise the Federation, it would not have occurred. The great tragedy is that he died in 1896, just under five years before Federation was achieved. So many visionaries who called for change in affairs did not live to see what they set out to achieve. That was a great tragedy and a great disappointment for many of the supporters of Sir Henry Parkes at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the 1990s we should not forget the memory and vision of Sir Henry Parkes and we should have the courage, as a community wider than parliament, to consider further constitutional change. I say thank you to Sir Henry Parkes. If it were not for him I, like all the other senators, would not be here today to participate in a Federation as we know it. It has achieved much for Australia. It has established us as a distinctive country, and that is a great achievement to the memory of a great man.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) It is not possible to give a single figure for the ``range'' of transmitters used for medium frequency radio transmissions. The area within which a service can be received satisfactorily is usually irregular in shape, depending on geographic location, physical topography etc; reception quality also varies from day to night.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The interim Parliamentary Network has been established using the standby transmitters of the Radio National Network. These standby transmitters, which were used as a back-up in case the Radio National transmitters failed, are generally not as powerful as the main Radio National transmitters which carried the Parliamentary broadcasts. In addition, in order to carry the interim network, the standby transmitters must be operated using standby antennas, which are less effective than the main Radio National antennas. This means that the area covered by the interim Parliamentary Network is smaller than the area covered by the Radio National transmitters. It is estimated that audience reach of the interim network is approximately 10% below that of the Radio National Network.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The number of potential Radio National listeners who will be outside the range of the new Parliamentary broadcasts is estimated to be 50,000 Australia-wide. However, only a small proportion of these Radio National listeners would be Parliamentary broadcasting listeners.

       Many people living in these areas would have received a marginal or poor grade of service under the previous transmission arrangements. In most cases the broadcast signal would not have met the Department of Transport and Communications' Planning Guidelines for an adequate service.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, there is still a significant degree of fortuitous reception of transmissions on the stand-by network in regional areas, particularly in South Australia. Reception in and around Perth is actually an improvement on the Radio National transmissions.

       (4) The Parliamentary network will transfer to new frequencies on a permanent basis in the context of the AM/FM conversion plan in the mainland state capital cities. This will occur in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide later this year, and in Brisbane in 1991. Canberra, Hobart and Newcastle will need to be considered separately in the context of AM/FM conversion policy in multi-station regional markets.
      </para>

       The transfer of Parliamentary Broadcasts to the interim network and later to the permanent network was approved by the Joint Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.

       In its 1986 Report on `Television and Radio Broadcasting in Both Houses of Parliament', the Joint Standing Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, recommended that the range of Parliamentary broadcasts should be extended to provide a service to 100% of Australians. The recommendation is still to be decided upon by the Government. Matters for consideration include the means of distribution and the cost.

       (2) to (5) As announced by the Prime Minister in his Statement on the Environment on 20 July 1989 the Ministers for Administrative Services and the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories are investigating the possible use of recycled and unbleached paper in Commonwealth Government Offices. Also Commonwealth and State environment Ministers recently agreed to set up a working group to develop standards for recycled paper for government use and to examine further uses for low grade recycled paper. In addition, all portfolio Ministers have been asked by the Prime Minister to report to Senator Richardson on the wastepaper recycling strategies which their departments have adopted and ways in which those strategies may be improved or extended. The Prime Minister intends to issue a report early next year on the progress being made in relation to the measures announced in the Statement, including the results of the current investigations into the use of recycled paper by departments and their wastepaper recycling strategies.
