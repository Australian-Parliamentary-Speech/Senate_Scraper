       X-rated and Violent Video Material

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of citizens of Australia points out:
      </para>
      <para>
       that all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       that most `X-rated' material available in Australia is imported.
      </para>
      <para>
       that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the A.C.T. Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material.
      </para>
      <para>
       that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Exclude from the `R'-rating all gratuitously violent material.

      <para>
       The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.
      </para>
      <para>
       That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medi- care provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.

       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

       Animal Patents

      <para>
       To the President and members of the Australian Senate
      </para>
      <para>
       The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would reduce biodiversity, compromise animal welfare, concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.

      <para>
       Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more;
      </para>
      <para>
       2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.

       Company Tax Collection System
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.
      </para>
      <para>
       The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the Senate of their concern regarding proposed changes to the laws governing credit reporting, as suggested in the Bill ``The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed reforms will:
      </para>
      <para>
       Restrict the legitimate use of credit checking by businesses who sell/supply goods and or services to their customers on credit terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposals/reforms will prevent businesses from determining the solvency of their customers and will increase the financial risk of credit providers, leading to an increase in company liquidations and individual bankruptcies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additional costs to business from bad debts due to the lack of adequate credit checking information will result in increased prices/charges and will result in credit providers refusing credit facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate will call on the Government to refer these proposals restricting credit checking to a Senate select committee for further consideration before proceeding with the matter.

This is the first opportunity that the Senate has had to respond to the quite disgusting and dreadful reports which have come from Romania. I suspect that the whole of the Senate would agree with the Opposition view that this is something on which we should record an opinion. At a time of great hope in Eastern Europe, this motion will be a reminder of it. In response to Senator Harradine, this is not a matter of dumping anything on the Senate; it is a matter of raising in the Senate something which is of vital importance and significance. I look forward to it receiving unanimous support.

        The Committee will note that the amendments which were circulated in my name last night have been split into two because I believe that the Government or the Opposition might find one or other of them acceptable. The wording is exactly the same as the form in which they were presented last night except that they are now presented as two amendments. The amendments, which are to clause 4 of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989, deal with the definition of `primary industry'. I remind the Committee of the wording in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        `primary industry' means any field of endeavour whose objective is:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) the production of agricultural or other primary produce; or-
       </para>
       <para>

        (c) the conservation of, or the sustainable use and management of, a natural resource;
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to stress very strongly two points. Firstly, just as with sexist language we have, over recent decades, dealt with a situation in which the language has not only reflected certain attitudes in the community, but also to some extent has reinforced them, so in this definition we have the use of words which misunderstands the way in which society is thinking. Secondly, the words are physically incorrect. I point out again that it is unfortunate that we do not have more people with a science background in this place and in the House of Representatives and that we do not have among parliamentary draftspersons people who also have some knowledge of such basic elements of science as the first law of thermodynamics-that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us take the first objection which is to part (b) of that definition. Part (b) states:
       </para>
       <para>
        the extraction from the environment, or the production, of:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) minerals;
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is that we cannot produce minerals. There is one possible exception and that would be Synroc, which some people have called an artificial mineral, but that is really stretching the imagination. The objection here is to the idea that we produce anything from nature. We extract it, exploit it and process it, but we do not produce it. The word `production' there is physically quite incorrect; it is not in conformity with what we actually do.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that the Government's intention is to cover the extraction from the environment of minerals and various other substances, and therefore to take out the words `or the production' is quite appropriate. The paragraph would then refer to `the extraction from the environment of minerals' and that is covered. I stress again that we do not produce minerals and therefore the word `production' is quite inappropriate in that context. Moreover, if we go onto (ii) of paragraph (b), in its full context it refers to the extraction from the environment of `substances from which energy may be produced'. The physical truth of the matter is that we do not produce energy. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. That is one of the basic laws of physics. We take one form of energy and transform it into another form. For example, we burn coal and it is chemical energy. We then turn it into heat energy and that heat energy is turned into mechanical energy and that mechanical energy is turned into electri- city. That is a series of processes of transformation of energy. We do not produce energy. It is physically impossible for human beings to produce energy. So again, (ii) is quite inappropriate.

         —It would be nice if they did. The second objection is to paragraph (c) and is of a different kind. This indicates the way in which the Government appears to be picking up on words such as sustainability but not really understanding what the conservation movement is on about. Paragraph (c), reading it in context, states:
        </para>

       <para>
        (c) the conservation of, or the sustainable use and management of, a natural resource.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely, conservation does mean the sustainable use and management of a natural resource. They are not alternatives. The point I would like to stress in relation to the second amendment to this definition is that it should read `the conservation and the sustainable use', and not `the conservation of, or the sustainable use.' Those things are not inconsistent: they must be consistent. If the Government is serious about sustainability and is beginning to understand what these terms mean, it should support the alteration of those words to read `the conservation and the sustainable use and management of a natural resource'. I do not think that in any sense changes the thrust of what the Government is attempting to legislate for in relation to its coverage of primary industry. I therefore commend both of those amendments to the Committee. If there is objection to one or the other I would seek to split the two and vote on them separately, but I hope they will both be acceptable to the Committee.

         —The Opposition has no objection to the Australian Democrats' amendments. I would like to comment on something Senator Coulter said in relation to paragraph (c). As I understand him, he is saying that, as to the words `the conservation of, or the sustainable use and management of, a natural resource', the words `conservation' and `sustainable use' are synonymous. Senator Coulter nods to confirm that. That goes along with something I said previously in a debate in this chamber in which Senator Cook and I participated. All of this talk about sustainable use is a lot of nonsense. We are talking about the conservation of the environment, and Senator Coulter has just confirmed that it is a lot of nonsense because they are in fact synonymous. When the Liberal and National parties talk about the conservation of our environment they are saying exactly the same thing as the Democrats, who are talking about the sustainable use of our environment. I thank Senator Coulter for confirming what I believe to be the case.

         —I have had a chance this morning to look at the newly circulated amendments from Senator Coulter and listen to his supporting argument for them. They entice me to make a long, erudite and incisive speech which would dwell on pedantry to make clear the fine differences of meaning between the various shades of emphasis that come into this debate. I will decline to do so because, while we would have a morning-long intellectual gymnastic exercise which would be rewarding to those of us who engaged in it, it would not advance the progress of this Bill very far. Suffice it for me to say that, from a government point of view, that long discourse would come out, at the bottom line, to agreeing with Senator Coulter's amendments. Perhaps I should weaken at one point and be enticed marginally into the argument about sustainable use, since it was the Hawke Labor Government in the July environment statement, the first environment statement ever put down by a government in Australia, that brought into political popular usage the word `sustainability'; but I will not. In short, we support the amendments.

        These accountability amendments deal with proposed subparagraphs 28 (1) (a) (iv) and 28 (1) (a) (v), which in effect require these research and development corporations to report to the Minister slightly more extensively than had been anticipated. In particular, they will provide information in relation to the activities of any company in which the corporation has an interest and the activities relating to the formation of a company. That goes back to the Senate inquiry into the activities of Asia Dairy Industries, where a subsidiary of a statutory authority had gone on a bit of a spree and had powers much wider than the powers of the original statutory authority which created the subsidiary company. Since that time the Senate has formed the view that it ought to be keeping an eye on subsidiary companies as well as on the statutory authority or the corporation which is established by Act of Parliament.

While the nom de plume `Asia Dairy' has been used to identify these amendments, it is fair to record that we intend that a research and development corporation will be in a different class entirely from a trading house, which was what Asia Dairy was. Within the meaning of this Bill, subsidiaries can be formed only for the purposes of research and development. From any plain view, that would be adding to the obvious good that the corporations seek to address. Having said that, and with the reservation I expressed in the speech I made at the second reading stage, we accept these amendments.

         —I indicate to the Committee that the Australian Democrats support this amendment. I canvassed this issue reasonably widely in the speech I made at the second reading debate stage. As Senator Lewis has said, this industry is pursuing the precedent established in the Australian Horticultural Corporation legislation. As I said at the second reading stage, the industry, given the terms of this amendment which relates to cooperatives, has a production arm which has the characteristic of a strong cooperative base. The concerns about this amendment which I expect the Minister to express on behalf of the Government ought to be met by that fact. While the Government has some concerns about the potential of this amendment to allow the dairy industry to get more funding than other industries for research, I remind the Government that producer money will be used on the basis of the cooperative structure which is set in place by this amendment. Therefore, we see that this is a useful amendment to this legislation for an industry which needs to and is prepared to build its research base. If it does and does so successfully, this will be to the benefit of the whole country and our economy.

         —It is my instinct to oppose this amendment to the full extent. I will make a few remarks and then invite Senator Powell to respond once more so that I can be clear as to the precise position of the Australian Democrats before I finally indicate to the Committee the Government's position. What is intended is that there be a research and development corporation established for producer organisations, not for processing organisations. It is true that many of the cooperatives that are referred to are owned by producers but have a charter to be processing organisations. The Government could certainly live on the cusp of a definition which enabled the smaller-quite clearly, almost communal-cooperative type of organisations to share in a research and development corporation of this sort.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To illustrate my point, let me refer to two major cooperatives which dominate the field of dairying-Bonlac Foods Ltd and Murray Goulburn Co-op Pty Ltd. According to the June 1989 figures, Bonlac's sales stood at $574m for that year; Murray Goulburn to June 1989 had total sales of $481m. The market share for Bonlac was 15 per cent; the market share for Murray Goulburn was 18.6 per cent. If we look more closely at Bonlac, the pre-tax operating profit for that company to the end of the financial year was $11.5m, up by about $1.5m from the previous year and the net after tax profit was $10.5m.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the observation that these are not small cooperatives of rural producers; they are major entities and major corporations in their own right. Given their size in corporate terms, let me make this analogy: Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the biggest company in Australia, is owned by its shareholders. But no observer of corporate life in Australia would necessarily argue in the case of BHP that the shareholders at shareholders' meetings run that company. In fact, frequently it is observed that the managerial elite in charge of the company do so. When we get a huge company with small holdings by multiple shareholders, it is not really the case that it can always be argued that those shareholders get their own way all the time because we have to take into account the operational dominance of the management sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not necessarily want to try to apply artificially that type of concept to Bonlac and to Murray Goulburn. I am certain that those companies make an effort to reflect the interest of their cooperative membership. Nonetheless, the very size gives rise to that bureaucratic distance between the managerial elite and the people who own the company. That is the first point I make. I think those two companies are in a different category from those normally regarded as small producer cooperatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point I make in respect of those companies is that they are producers of branded goods and they market branded goods in the same way as any other manufacturer. Companies of the sort that we are talking about are entitled to the 150 per cent tax deduction for research and development investment in Australia. Under this research and development legislation, we are trying to provide a means by which small farmers-in dairying they are usually very small-can actually have research and development carried out in their area of activity. It seems to me that major and dominant companies, which receive tax incentives to conduct their own research and development, could move in and dominate corporations thereby denying small farmholders the possibility of benefiting as they ought to. With those remarks, I wonder-if I might wonder aloud-whether the Democrats would consider a form of words which would exclude those two major companies-Bonlac and Murray Goulburn from within the ambit of this research and development corporation, while the same form of words would admit the smaller, obviously producer-run cooperatives.

         —The Minister is wondering aloud about a form of words which I do not have, but I will address the points that he has made in his wondering aloud. It is clear that in the dairy industry there are two major players in Bonlac Foods and Murray Goulburn Co-op Co. Pty Ltd, but it is also clear that they are grower cooperatives. The reason they are as big as they are, as much as anything else, is that they have-particularly in recent years-subjected some of the small cooperatives to takeovers. I certainly know from my own experience that many of the shareholders who have come to those larger players as a result of those takeovers of smaller cooperatives are very active in their participation in the decision-making of those bodies.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The view that we take at this point is that this particular amendment is important to the dairy industry, the arguments put forward in favour of it are compelling, and we should proceed with this legislation with this amendment in place. However, it is always possible-indeed, we do it all the time-to tidy up legislation if we find that implementation requires it. We do it regularly. We are doing it with this package of Bills, the previous two of which have already been dealt with by the Committee. For instance, in the area of plant variety rights we have tidied up a piece of legislation because the implementation demanded that that be done-the asexual reproduction was not covered well enough in the original legislation. While Bonlac and Murray Goulburn are large players, they do not comprise even 50 per cent of the industry, and that means that a very large part of the industry-the majority-is certainly comprised of smaller cooperatives. We are talking here about the manufacturing side of the dairy industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other thing that needs to be drawn out in the committee stage, and which I referred to during the second reading debate-I think, Senator Lewis did as well-is that the system of a levy on producers of milk does not really cover the needs of industry because of the difference in the treatment, particularly the difference in what they earn, of producers of whole milk vis-a-vis producers of manufacturing milk. We believe this amendment addresses that particular concern as well. Indeed, if anything, that is perhaps the most compelling argument for going into this new structure on this basis. We certainly would be sympathetic as a future time-if it can be shown that this disproportionate size of two, at least, of the cooperatives in the industry is creating problems in terms of the distribution and effectiveness of research funding in the dairy industry-to any tidying up that might be brought forward at that time. But we believe that, because of the compelling overriding reasons that we have articulated, this amendment should go forward.

       <para>
        All these amendments seek to ensure that each of the representative organisations under the research and development corporation umbrella are provided with a copy of the research and development plan or its variation. Amendment 4A amends clause 20 in the Bill to ensure that a copy of the plan is also provided to each of the representative organisations concerned. Amendments 5 and 6 cover subclause 21 (6). Under this clause the Minister can ask for a variation of an original research and development plan, and can then either accept or reject it, or approve such other variation as he thinks fit. We do not challenge the Minister's right to seek a variation of the plan from the research and development corporation, nor his right to accept or reject that variation. However, we do not believe that he should have the right to approve such other variation as he thinks fit, because this implies that the Minister can ignore the corporation's plan and run with his own or somebody else's plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment 7 adds subclause 21 (6a) to the Bill. It simply calls for the corporation to send a copy of any varied plan to the representative organisation within one month of the Minister's approving it. Amendment 8 amends subclause 21 (7). This is tied in with amendments 5 and 6 and removes the words, `or approves another variation'. The Minister should have the right to accept or reject the corporation's variation of the plan that he requested, but not some other variation, and should write to the corporation explaining why he has rejected the plan.

         —This group of amendments falls within that category of amendments which address the concerns of industry about the relationship between the industries which are represented on the corporations, the corporations and the Minister in that sort of tripartite way. The Government expressed to the Australian Democrats the concerns that it had with the wording of the Opposition's amendments. The concerns related to the possible broad dissemination of material which might, from time to time-although not always, necessarily-require a degree of confidentiality. Therefore, the rewording, which basically ensures that copies of plans, changed plans and altered plans, go to the representative organisations on the corporations. But by the re-wording of the Minister it is a direct conduit from the corporation to the president or equivalent office holder. We feel that is an appropriate mechanism from a responsible body to another responsible body and addresses the concerns that the Government has, without diminishing in any way the needs and wishes of the industry. I understand that the industry people concerned are also satisfied with that rewording, which is what it really amounts to. Our support is for the amendments as proposed, but accepting the re-wording the Minister has put forward.

        These amendments seek more detailed accountability for the grain industry because there have been some sections which have established special funds for special purposes. Separate grain industries see the wisdom of having a single grain corporation, but agreement by them to it has been conditional on detailed accounting of their special funds because they are levied at different rates. One would presume that any grains research and development corporation is likely to do this. But the coalition parties believe that it should be in the Bill so that the growers can have confidence in the new system.

        The words that I will enunciate in this statement were discussed with representatives of the Grains Council in the last 48 hours and obtained from them a favourable response. The words are: in respect of the grains industry I accept the difficulties which the industry faces in its movement to the establishment of the Grains Research and Development Corporation. This will involve the incorporation of four grains commodity councils and a number of State wheat and barley committees into the new Corporation. I understand the concerns the industry has in these issues and the Government is prepared to agree to a number of changes to alleviate these industry concerns. In particular we are prepared to accept amendments (21) and (22) as proposed by the Opposition which specifically apply to the grains industry. The grains industry also has been keen in its discussions with Government to get greater specificity about the structure the new Research and Development Corporation will adopt in its organisation, planning and accountability. The industry has discussed with Minister Kerin the advantages of a commodity and regional focus to these arrangements.

        The Bill before the Committee specifies that research and development corporations are free to establish their own committee structures and that they must also give details of the research and development activities they fund and the groupings of those activities. We intend to write to the incoming chairperson of the Research and Development Corporation requesting close consultation with the industry to determine the most appropriate way to structure grains research and development activities, taking account of the Grains Council of Australia's views on commodity, cross-commodity and regional research. The Government's acceptance of amendments (21) and (22) as proposed by the Opposition will, in fact, mean that the Research and Development Corporation cannot become operational until these consultations have occurred, and the Government's acceptance of these amendments will ensure that this is the case.

        In respect of the South Australian grains industry, growers in that State have voluntarily contributed over and above the required levy contributions in recent years and should not be disadvantaged for that initiative. In our correspondence with the chairperson of the Research and Development Corporation we will ask that he or she take particular note of the surplus funds in the South Australian State Wheat Research Committee and that the outgoing members of the State Committee be consulted on the most appropriate use of these funds and that the Corporation account back to the industry over their use. As that is a clear statement from the Government of intent I hope it means that it is not necessary to proceed with Senator Lewis's amendment.

         —I appreciate the statement put down by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), as I am sure does the grains industry. I appreciate perhaps even more actually working in tandem with the Opposition-for once-in the interests of the grain industry. It is rather a nice way to end the year. The statement emphasises the fact that the Government will accept the later amendments, and amendment No. 18 in particular, and the Government therefore feels that that underpins the statement and ought to be of comfort to the industry. One of the problems we have is that the present Minister will not always be the Minister-indeed, before such a letter is written we might very well have another Minister. Having been at loggerheads with members of the Opposition, I am particularly nervous about accepting in the interests of the grains industry any ministerial assurance from the Opposition side. After the election the Corporation's implementation might require ministerial action from them. I am even more inclined to support the amendment which Senator Lewis has moved at the behest of the grains industry. I underline my delight that that is the way it is going this time, contrary to the way it went the last time we talked about the interests of the grains industry.

        It is important when we are establishing a corporation of this kind that goes across commodity groups that, as we have done with the issues concerning the dairy industry, we bend over backwards firstly in the consultation process-the industries will acknowledge that that consultation has taken place-and, secondly, in acknowledging the variations in the legislation. We must make provision for the variations which occur historically within and between commodity groups. As I said in the second reading debate, we are bringing it altogether so that we can get cross-commodity research, but in doing that we must be very careful that we do not disadvantage any group vis-a-vis another group, or that we do not disadvantage any section of any of those commodity groups. I believe that is the crux of these amendments. While it would be nice to sit back and accept the assurances of any Minister in this place, I suggest that the end of 1989 is not really the time to do it. Therefore we will be standing by these amendments.

We can seen no reason why this provision should be put in there when no taxpayers' funds are to be involved in such a corporation.

        Amendment 14 amends clause 59 to ensure that there is no compulsion to hold annual general meetings for reporting purposes. This arises because of the problem which was created by the model adopted by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation when it was discovered that that process ended up being a debacle and a waste of money. It is now realised that there are better ways of informing members or representative organisations other than by a compulsory annual general meeting simply for reporting purposes.

Although he has mentioned the drawing together of two of the categories, he has not mentioned that amendment No. 19 removes an additional category which the Government inserted covering people suitably qualified and with expertise in environmental and ecological matters. The Australian Democrats do not support the Opposition's amendments. We are pleased that the list has been extended. Paragraph 132 (1) (h), which refers to expertise in environmental and ecological matters, is very important. We cannot see why it is not useful to have the additional area of management of natural resources in the clause as well. If anything, it is an area where expertise is lacking in the community. Nevertheless, the Government, in this part of the legislation, is putting legislative thrust behind its expressions of support for environmental and ecological matters. We would be the last people to discourage the Government from legislating according to what it is saying in the community.

        A Selection Committee must not nominate a person for appointment to an R &amp; D Corporation or an R &amp; D Council unless the person appears to the Selection Committee to be suitably qualified for appointment because of expertise in one or more of the following fields . . .

       <para>
        (d) conservation of natural resources . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's amendment would change those words to `conservation and management of natural resources'. That is a pedantic amendment. If we look at the foregoing fields such as commodity production, commodity processing and commodity marketing-that is, (a), (b) and (c)-we see that the management of natural resources is covered by at least (a), which is commodity production. Therefore, (d)-conservation of natural resources-would stand as a separate qualification, distinct from the management which is, I would argue, picked up in (a). A further argument that could be put is that a `conservation of natural resources' is seen to be an environmental type skill, whereas `management of natural resources' is seen to be an exploitative type skill. Those emphases ought to be understood.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also oppose the removal under (h) of `environmental and ecological matters', for reasons expressed by the Australian Democrats. The point here is that the commodity groups who make these selections will be dominated by the representative organisations. They will make a selection. Each of these categories is designed to provide a balance of skills on the research and development corporation and are meant as a guide for selection to the selectors. It is not compulsory that each one of them be met. I think, therefore, it is important that the various categories are set out clearly. We agree with the Democrats and oppose amendments 18 and 19.

        This amendment simply says that in the event of the research and development corporation ceasing to exist the money held by it will be placed in trust pending direction from the representative organisation instead of being transferred to the Commonwealth, as the Bill suggests. After all, producers should have paid at least half of the funds for the corporation and their money should not simply be paid across to the Commonwealth.

         —The Australian Democrats have a problem with this Opposition amendment and have made that known in various quarters. The problem is that, while we understand the industries' concern that all money should just go to the Commonwealth-because 50 per cent of those moneys would be producer moneys-we felt that an amendment which said that the Commonwealth could do nothing with the money without the say-so of the industries involved was going too far in the opposite direction. We had sought a rewording. We had circulated a rewording ourselves, but I understand that the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has proposed a rewording of the amendment which, in our minds, comes up with a fairer approach. Therefore, we are minded to oppose the Opposition's amendment in the event that the Government moves a differently worded amendment to address this particular clause.

         —In addressing the amendments of Senator Lewis, I preface my remarks by saying that the process into which we have moved over the last few amendments is a different one from the one that we pursued earlier when on a couple of occasions Senator Lewis sought leave to withdraw his amendments and accept the amendments put forward by the Government. On each occasion the Committee disposed of Senator Lewis's amendments first. Senator Lewis has taken the opportunity to make sure that we note how the Australian Democrats are voting. He is doing that for a particular purpose. It is pretty futile. Anyone who can count obviously knows, if an amendment is lost or won, who voted with whom, and on this amendment I particularly wanted to draw attention to that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I make two points here. The Democrats have accepted the reworded amendment of the Government. We acknowledge that the Government, appreciating the situation of the numbers in this place, is being realistic in trying to expedite the passage of a very important piece of legislation. Across commodities, the industry is supporting the legislation, but wants it amended. That is happening through what I think have been fruitful negotiations on all sides. At the point where the last amendment is being moved, I acknowledge that negotiations have taken place, not just between the players in this chamber but with industry as well right up until this morning. In acknowledging that, I say to Senator Lewis that in this particular case he should not really be wanting to draw attention to the vote, because I believe-and, as I understand it, so do the industry people who have seen this rewording-that, as the Minister said, not only does this amendment give better force to the spirit of Senator Lewis's amendments but seems to go further and give greater comfort to the industry people concerned. The amendment talks about taking into consideration the recommendations that will be made. The process that has been undertaken in the last little while over this legislation has been productive, not just for the passage of the Bill but, in some cases, in substance. We all know how difficult it is, particularly so late in the year, to get amendments drafted and to get them to each other and so on. That is particularly so in this House when we are dealing with Ministers and shadow Ministers who are actually in the other place. I certainly appreciate that difficulty for my colleagues in the Government and the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that, while we are opposing Senator Lewis's amendment, it is not because of the substance of the issue. It is simply because of a rewording which, I think in the minds of all honourable senators, not only does what Senator Lewis's original amendment was designed to do but, we are sure, also does it well and effectively. The end result will be that we do not see this Bill again in this chamber, and a new system of research and development which will be better will be implemented. We have taken a lot of trouble to make sure that each commodity group that has had concerns has been satisfied and that across primary industry generally, certainly in the agricultural side, we have a better system which will allow some cross-commodity work. In opposing Senator Lewis's amendment I want to make it clear that we are not opposing the spirit of it, but simply the mechanics. We will support an amendment moved by the Government.

The Democrats are quite clearly doing it for no reason other than that at some stage, in due course, they will be able to publish a list of figures showing the number of times that the Opposition and the Government have joined together. That is quite clearly the only purpose for which they are doing it, and it is futile, as Senator Powell has just acknowledged.

        I do not want to get involved in the squabble that is apparently going on between Senator Powell and Senator Austin Lewis. The Government is nothing if it is not magnanimous and will stand above that argument. However, I do pick up a point made by Senator Powell about how realistic we have been in facing up to the passage of this legislation. It is true that in terms of our ideals we are romantics, but in terms of our application we are practical realists. I acknowledge that that is now recognised in this chamber. I thank the leaders of the various parties, including Senator Lewis on behalf of the coalition and Senator Powell on behalf of the Australian Democrats, for their expressions of cooperation. I acknowledge too that it would not have been possible to have come so quickly to this point without their cooperation and inspired negotiation. I congratulate and thank the honourable senators for that, and I hope that we can pass these amendments and thus the Bill.

        The reform of Australia's transport system is urgent and long overdue. Australia has a global isolation, and its resource centres and population locations are dispersed. The 1982 report of the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping indicated that only 3 per cent of Australia's international trade was being carried by Australian ships. As Australia is a major trading nation, that was an appalling story.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since then we have established a link between certain taxation incentives-firstly, with investment allowances and more latterly with depreciation allowances-and agreed crewing levels. There has been some progress in that area. But Australia has some major problems, because Australian coastal shipping is extraordinarily expensive when compared with the costs of international shipping. As I come from Tasmania, I am particularly aware of that and of the impact it has on our local economy. For example a little time ago the Ford Motor Co. of Australia found that freight charges for sending motor vehicles from Melbourne to Tasmania were roughly comparable-in fact, only 5 per cent cheaper-with charges from Melbourne to San Francisco. That gives some indication of the problems that we face in Australia with the high cost of shipping. Clearly the cost of coastal shipping is unsustainable because of its impact on other industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, we must acknowledge that there has been some progress in the area. But from the Liberal-National Party coalition point of view, progress in micro-economic reform has been far too slow. Manning levels have fallen-I think from 35 crew to about 30; about 14 per cent. Fuel efficiencies have increased, from 1.26 to 0.7 tonnes per thousand dead weight tonnes. But over 50 per cent of shipping costs-for example, in the Bass Strait general cargo trade-are incurred in port, stevedoring and port authority charges. This is a major problem. For bulk and tanker operations, these costs account for up to 30 per cent of total shipping costs. So the cost of general cargo stevedoring, speed of ship turnaround and reliability of the waterfront are of prime concern not only to shipowners but also to the coalition and the people of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Navigation Act and the relevant regulations have no power over the conduct of intrastate trade. Matters that impede competitiveness include our lagging behind in international trends in manning costs. We are making improvements, but certainly not far or fast enough. There must be access to capital and fuel at the same cost levels as apply to foreign competitors because, of the costs, capital represents something like, for 100,000 dead weight tonnage, 33 per cent; crew, 22 per cent; fuel, 16 per cent; port charges, 14 per cent; and other costs, about 15 per cent. Ship-based costs compare unfavourably with those for international vessels. While the investment in new ships and changes in management practices have produced savings of 20 per cent or more, as I mentioned, large cost disadvantages remain. Those areas need to come within the compass of what we term micro-economic reform.

        Certain people have difficulties with the concept of governments actually subsidising reform from which industry participants themselves tend to benefit. Before us today we have legislation to amend the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. When in government, the Opposition will recognise the need for more urgent action than we have here before us today to reform the Australian transport and communications structure. It is not unnatural that people around Australia have some concerns about proposals to extend the eligibility to grants under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act because they have a legitimate view that Australian taxpayers should not be called upon to subsidise the shipowners who benefit from these proposals. The Opposition was considering an amendment in this area but, given the urgency to get this legislation onto the statute books and through the Senate, we will not delay proceedings at this stage. It is in Australia's interests to get this legislation through speedily before Christmas.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will deal first with the Acts to be amended under the auspices of the transport sections of this Bill. Clauses 3 to 5 of part 2 of the Bill seek to amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 by proposing a new definition of aviation security to both the principal Act and the regulations. Following the enactment to the Civil Aviation Act in 1988, the regulatory power of the Air Navigation Act to extend to aviation security unfortunately became unclear. The Civil Aviation Authority is supposedly responsible for aviation safety but this did not extend to aviation security. Previously, aviation safety was considered to extend to security. The Opposition supports this amendment to clear up this anomaly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the amendment to the Australian Airlines (Conversion into Public Company) Act 1988. The proposed changes to this Act are contained in part 4 of the Bill and cover what appears to be a fairly routine drafting error. Amendments to the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 are contained in part 9, clauses 22 to 26. There are three main changes. Firstly, the amendment will allow the State and Territory regulatory authorities to link the prescribed fees that are payable to the consumer price index so that there do not have to be adjustments from time to time. Secondly, the Government is tightening the prosecution provision of the Act. Thirdly, these amendments will allow spot fines for mass limit or over loading offences as an alternative to prosecution. The maximum penalty will be $200 for individuals and $3,000 for corporations. The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the burden on the court system. Again, the Opposition supports these amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendments to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 are contained in part 10, clauses 27 to 37. This very recent Act has been amended to provide a proper link between it and the Customs Act in regard to Customs clearance of imported vehicles, which must meet the standards of the principal Act. The amendments also empower the Minister to make determinations of practices to be followed by manufacturers or importers of vehicles in regard to testing and record keeping. The amendments also cover the power of the Minister to suspend or cancel an authority to affix compliance plates where these practices are not followed and to bring emissions of particulate matter within the pollution control measures under the Act, which currently apply only to emission of gases.
       </para>
       <para>
        While these amendments are not objectionable, it is difficult to understand why they were not included when the principal Act was passed earlier this year. Again, I think we have a case of overloaded legislation and insufficient attention to detail. As we have been told that the Act was the result of years of consultation, the Opposition, not unnaturally, asks why the basic points about cancellation of authority to affix compliance plates and the involvement of the Australian Customs Act were not considered. On the face of it, it would seem that the matter has not been thought through. As I said earlier, it simply represents a sloppy approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Navigation Act 1912 is amended by clauses 38 to 47 contained in part 11 of the Bill. In summary, the clauses seek to allow a trading ship to be brought under Federal jurisdiction, amend some provisions in respect of the Marine Council, rationalise the statutory committee system and revise the agreement of jurisdiction in the case of collision regulations. This omnibus package also contains changes to the Navigation Amendment Act 1980, which is amended by clauses 48 and 49, which simply repeal unproclaimed provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 is amended by clauses 52 and 53 in part 14. Again this corrects a drafting deficiency and enables Australia's ratification of annexe V of the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships-the MARPOL Convention-which was mentioned yesterday briefly during the debate on the hazardous waste and industrial chemicals package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally the Bill amends the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. Some members of the community are concerned about using taxpayers' funds for a sort of subsidy in this matter. Again the urgency for change is great. Something has to be done. Some people believe that this is an appropriate way of spending taxpayers' funds to improve efficiency and lift Australia's productivity; other people believe this is the wrong use of taxpayers' funds. Again, the purpose of the change is to extend the availability of grants under the Act for new ships to 30 June 1997, and in respect of modifications to existing ships completed before 30 June 1992. The current scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1987, was to end on 30 June 1992 for new ships and 1990 for modifications. Also under this Bill a loophole is also closed against claims of excessive grant payments and a drafting error is corrected to make it easier for a special category of applicants-namely, for ships crewed below the standard crew.
       </para>
       <para>
        In April this year the report of the shipping reform task force was presented. Its recommendations included an extension of assistance provided under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 for at least five years. The Opposition welcomes any moves to decrease manning levels, which are very high by world standards. In Australia it is well known that we require approximately 2.5 crews per ship compared with about 1.6 in most other parts of the world. But we do have some reservations, as I said earlier, about the idea of taxpayers footing the Bill for a grant aimed at putting these industries on a commercial basis from which, ultimately, the shipowners will benefit. Of course, that concept is not new in Australia. The cost to the taxpayer in this area is $52m over and above what is already committed to this project.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that reform of the waterfront and coastal shipping must be a priority if this country is to return to normal financial health. It has been estimated, for example, that if we can improve the efficiency of the waterfront by 20 per cent, Australia's gross domestic product could be boosted by over $1,000m each year. In regard to coastal shipping, reforms in that area could save something in the order of $550m per annum. However, whether the taxpayer should foot the bill for measures aimed at productivity increases is a matter for some concern. The Opposition also has some reservations about this link between the unions and government and the effect that this is having on the ability to institute reform of the magnitude and with the speed necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        In closing, I would like to remind the Senate of what the Industries Assistance Commission said in its annual report. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . an efficient transport sector is essential because of our global isolation, the location of our natural resources and the dispersion of major population centres.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will be much harder to improve our trading performance if we maintain a transport system which unnecessarily inflate costs or delay the delivery of goods and services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Naturally, the Opposition supports that. We support the thrust of the Bill despite some reservations, but we are concerned at the lack of speed and effectiveness of this program of micro-economic reform.

         —Today we are debating the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. This is an omnibus Bill with a wide coverage of amendments to various Acts pertaining to transport and communications. I would like to address briefly a few of those Acts; namely, the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, the Interstate Transport Act 1985, the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Telecommunications Act 1989. The amendment to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act is probably the most important one. This is to put into effect the part of the shipping industry reform announced by the Government earlier this year. The amendment extends the period of available benefits to 30 June 1997 for new ships and to 30 June 1992 for older ships. The purpose of this exercise is to help shipowners to the tune of 7 per cent to provide for older ships to take advantage of the opportunity to get crew levels down to comparable figures with vessels of other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Australian shipping has undergone some major structural changes in recent years. That has certainly not been before time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Anyone who has any remote knowledge of the Australian shipping industry knows full well of the practices and overmanning that has been inherent. It takes 2.5 crews to operate an Australian ship, whereas in other countries similar to Australia it is down to 1.6 crews. This has been going on for such a long time that this move to cut manning is well overdue. We are still lagging behind the rest of the world because it is reducing its manning levels faster than we are. It is able to provide the shipping services for exports at a lower cost. In many cases these exports are competing with our own exports. Australian exports have been put to a great disadvantage for years and years. This has also been due to problems with the waterfront. An Industries Assistance Commission report of last year pointed out that savings of $550m per year could be achieved if coastal shipping could be brought into line with other OECD countries. Australia needs these reforms of coastal shipping and the waterfront if it is to achieve anything towards cutting its overseas debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cabotage must be removed to let Australian shipping compete with overseas shipping so that we can find out what rational freights are. To show my point of what some members of this Government think of removing cabotage I will quote from the House of Representatives Hansard. I have said before in this chamber that it could be the `fairytale publication' of this Parliament. I will quote Mr O'Neil, the honourable member for Grey, who spoke in the debate in that House. I do not have the date. Mr O'Neil said:
       </para>
       <para>
        As for opening up cabotage on coastal shipping, I realise that vested interests want to repeal part VI of the Navigation Act 1912, which would mean the deregulation of Australian coastal shipping. I firmly believe this to be scandalous. I am delighted to see that honourable members on this side of the House, including the Minister, are very strongly opposed to this. With the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Australian coastal trade and in the manning of ships and so forth, it is quite appalling that we should further disadvantage our people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Who are those vested interests that want cabotage lifted in Australia? I will tell you who they are, Mr Acting Deputy President. They are the producers of wealth and exports in Australia. They are the ones that want cabotage lifted to throw Australian coastal shipping open to competition with other countries so that we can experience how coastal shipping and freight rates should be. It was from the next quote from Mr O'Neil that I concluded that he did not know what he was talking about. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is ironic that we will not accept shearers from overseas to work in our shearing sheds and we do not want other people coming in and controlling our industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know where Mr O'Neil, the honourable member for Grey, has been since he has been in Parliament. I am in a position to know what the shearing industry and the wool industry of Australia are doing. I can tell honourable senators that the shortage of shearers has been fixed in the last 10 years by bringing in the Kiwis. Here we have a fellow saying that we will not accept them. Not knowing much about Mr O'Neil I thought I would get out the Parliamentary Handbook to see what sort of electorate he represents. His electorate was described as rural and industrial; its location as a large electorate covering most of rural South Australia. The industries in that electorate are power generation, railway workshops, lead, silver and zinc, smelting, steelworks, shipbuilding, as well as extensive grain, wool, fishing and service industries and opal mining. This gentleman does not know that we have Kiwi shearers in Australia. He does not know the importance of coastal shipping and of rationalising shipping in Australia so that we can compete in the world markets. So much for Mr O'Neil. On the same day he continued.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a national disgrace that less than 5 per cent of our trade is carried in our ships.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is a slow learner. He is wondering why only 5 per cent is carried and then he carries on with all those stories of why we should not remove cabotage.
       </para>
       <para>
        However welcome this reform is, I do not see why the Australian taxpayer has to foot the bill while ships are being adjusted to take the lesser crews. From my understanding the taxpayer will be paying out $52m over the next three years, over and above what has already been committed to this program. Over that period that $52m should provide benefits to the shipping industry of some $80m. From that point forward the Australian shipping industry should benefit to the tune of $50m annually, hopefully spreading to all Australians. If the shipping industry is to benefit that much, why should the taxpayer have to pay out?
       </para>
       <para>
        This is similar to the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd deal, the airlines deal and the tourist industry deal, but rather different from the farm manufacturers deal that we had, especially as it related to the John Shearer Ltd manufacturing industry of South Australia which manufactures tillage and harvesting machines. If, after having spent the money to restructure coastal shipping, the results are that good, the shipping lines could foot the bill themselves. That would at least show that the companies plan to stay on in the future, not just for the life of the subsidy. This is what I am afraid will happen with Kodak. The waterfront is a typical example of where the Government has to fork out money to buy out restrictive practices and fund early retirement because of various fiascos. The wheat industry, which we have recently deregulated, has received no such treatment. I am sure that there are other industries, such as the road industry, that would like to receive the same sort of treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main purpose of the part of the Bill dealing with the Interstate Road Transport Act is to link the prescribed fees applicable and payable to the States and Territories to the consumer price index (CPI). This is a commendable measure. It means that fees are able to be increased without having to be justified each time. It is a pity that the Government does not index the money that is returned to roads, through the fuel levy, to the CPI. Fuel is indexed to the CPI but the return to roads is certainly not treated in the same fashion. Only the collections are indexed; not the spending on roads.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second purpose of this part of the legislation is to strengthen provisions on prosecuting directors, agents and employees in breach of the Interstate Road Transport Act. The provisions apply mainly to make managing directors, directors and agents responsible for the actions of their employees. This has not been very well explained, and during the committee stage I will be seeking information. The last purpose of this part of the Bill is to allow for on the spot fines for overloading offences. Once again, I am well aware of this problem. This move, in the name of cutting down on the log of work in the courts, is a reasonable enough measure. In the future, revenue raising will get a boost because of the advances in technology. Trucks will be able to be weighed and have speeds recorded electronically while on the move. If laws are being broken, people will be fined and there will be an increase in revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will say a few words about the viability and safety of the interstate transport industry. Heavy vehicles have certainly been in the news lately. Many have been involved in traffic accidents with a resultant loss of life. We heard about some more this morning. There are a few reasons for this upsurge in accidents. The main reasons could be speed, the state of the roads and the volume of traffic on the roads. One must look beyond these three points to ascertain why these problems exist. I will take them in order. First, speed could be attributed to a plethora of reasons but the main ones could be summed up by referring to rising costs, extra competition and cowboy drivers. We need to cut down on the number of cowboy drivers. There is a need for graduated driving licences. To cover ever increasing costs under this Government heavy vehicles have to do more trips each week. Interest rates are the greatest single factor, closely followed by increased damage to vehicles and tyres and increased fuel usage because of this Government's neglect of our roads. One adds to the other. Secondly, Australian roads are in their worst condition ever because of the 40 per cent cut in real terms in road funding over the last four years, less than the life of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        My third point is the increased volume of traffic. Traffic is increasing because of a few factors. Heavy vehicles have to increase their number of trips to stay viable. There has been an increase in traffic due to the airline dispute. It finished one month ago, but we still have record numbers of bus and heavy vehicle trips. Along with the Australian one car, one person mentality, we have a worse traffic volume scenario because of the failure of the other transport modes; that is, coastal shipping and rail transport. It is scandalous that road transport should be able to compete with shipping and rail on the long haul routes for bulk loads.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already discussed coastal shipping. I cannot see that there will be much improvement in the short term. But there is one hope on the horizon-and that is rail. If the recommendations of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure are carried out, there is hope for the future. My understanding is that the subcommittee emanated from the House of Representatives Standing Committee to examine the national rail system. At present, we need more money on roads and we need to assert control over the drivers of heavy trucks and buses. Generally, bus drivers get off light in the debate on road accidents. But they speed and they break road rules, as do drivers of the heavy vehicles. That is why I do not mind giving them a mention. Whatever is needed on these vehicles, such as speed limiters and tachographs, should be installed. However, that is a debate for another day.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I move to the Telecommunications Act. Under this Bill, the service available to constituents having trouble receiving radio or television broadcasts is to be charged for. I know that the Department of Telecommunications and Aviation Support should not be responsible for funding reception problems, either in television sets or in homes. With today's more electronically minded young people, these problems can generally be sorted out in the home. If they cannot be sorted out at home, tradesmen are available. Interference in home reception usually comes from power generators, supply lines and transformers. In respect of clause 19 the explanatory memorandum states:
       </para>
       <para>
        21. This clause amends section 125d of the Principal Act by inserting a new subsection (4) to allow the Minister to make charges for the investigation of interference to the reception of radio and television programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        22. Often broadcasting reception difficulties are not caused by interfering signals, but rather are attributable to factors which are quite beyond the Department's ability to correct.
       </para>
       <para>
        I fully understand that. However, it continues to say that common examples involve emission from electrical reticulation systems. How does the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) justify asking the householder to rectify such problems? I believe that the householder, in general, will always try to sort out his or her problem with receivers, whether they be radio receivers, television receivers or two-way radio receivers, if one happens to have one in the home or in the business. The next move is to ring the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        But there are times when it goes beyond that. I can give a good example of that in Western Australia. At one stage we had radio interference for three months and no-one could find the problem. We live in an area where there are not too many power failures. Even if there are industrial problems the power is not cut off, because the mining industry relies on it. We had a power failure and the radio reception improved just immediately. The power supply to the microwave tower was `singing', if I can use layman's terms, and creating the interference. So how can we turn around and ask the householder to pay the costs to establish where the interference is coming from-whether it be from the power generation system, a transformer yard in the vicinity, or a transformer in the street?

         —If it is not intended, I would like to see it in the legislation in black and white. If that is the case I believe that the cost for finding such faults should be borne by the power authority or whatever authority is responsible for the interference. As I have said, microwave links are known to be a source of interference. I believe that, in regard to cost recovery, the Department could have left things as they were. The Department would have to determine whether it is an interdepartmental matter. Looking at the financial impact of this aspect, as described in the explanatory memorandum to this legislation, I see that it will cost $100,000 to set up a new charging system. The Government believes that there will be an estimated net cost saving of $350,000. I do not know whether that allows for the $100,000, but we are looking at an amount of $450,000 less $100,000 income.

        All in all, this is a wide-ranging Bill which will have various effects, some of which are of doubtful benefit, as I have already said. We will have to see what occurs in time. I say to the Government and to the Minister that there are a lot of positive moves in this omnibus Bill that I have not had the time to discuss across the board. There will be some benefits. A lot more has to be done in the road transport industry to get heavy vehicles across the country off the roads. There is no way in the world that we will return the roads to the state that they should be in unless some of this volume of goods is transported by rail-hopefully the Australian National railways, which I hope one day will connect all the State capitals-and if some bulk loads are transported by coastal shipping we have some hope of getting heavy traffic off the roads. This will reduce the number of accidents and, as I have said, enable us to get the roads back into a serviceable condition that will be much safer for all Australians.

         —I wish to confine my remarks to the communications provisions in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which is an omnibus Bill. I would like to start with the matter which Senator Panizza has just finished dealing with. The principal amendment to the Broadcasting Act will allow the Minister to make charges for the investigation of complaints of interference to the reception of radio and television services. The proposed change is said to be necessary because of the increasing use of the Department's free investigation services, often in cases where the problem lies with the domestic receiving installation and, therefore, should be treated as a problem for the consumer rather than a problem for the Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have been provided with some statistics which suggest that some 16,000 complaints of reception and interference difficulties are investigated annually by some 40 staff members of the Department. Over 75 per cent of those cases ultimately turn out to involve problems caused by deficiencies in receivers, inadequate or faulty antenna installations, local faults in power line systems, or people trying to receive stations not intended for their areas. In other words, these are not strict interference problems; they are not difficulties caused by the installations for which the Government ought to be responsible.
       </para>
       <para>
        We take the view that it is reasonable for a charge to be imposed in circumstances where consumers are essentially freeloading off the Government, where they could quite simply, and presumably much more cheaply than with all the unnecessary costs that are often built into government charges, make their own arrangements. But there are still some areas in which I think we have genuine concerns and on which we would require some further information.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is proposed that a $60 call-out fee should be applied, but it is not at all clear from the explanatory memorandum whether that money will be refunded in the event that it is found to be a problem relating to the equipment rather than a problem that could have been rectified by the individual consumer. It would certainly be our view that, if it ultimately transpires that the consumer was justified in calling on the Government to investigate the matter, that amount should be refunded.
       </para>

        Senator Panizza raised what I think is a much more difficult area. We can always see these things in black and white and say, `If it is the individual's fault, the individual pays; if it is the Government's fault, in terms of interference, the Government pays', but there will inevitably be a large number of grey areas. Senator Panizza quite rightly raised his experience of microwave links which some months later turn out to be the problem. Presumably in that situation the Government should bear the cost. But I can envisage situations where it is a scoreless draw, where no-one really knows who is at fault and, in those circumstances, I would take the view that the consumer should get the benefit of the doubt. So it is only where it can be clearly demonstrated that it is a problem that can be rectified by technicians employed by the consumer that any charges should be borne by the individual.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also not clear to me whether that $60 call-out fee is merely a start and whether other charges might be levied down the line. If there are to be those charges we should know about them up-front. It is also not clear when the system is to start. I think one can safely hazard a guess that the Government's intention is that it should not be introduced prior to the election, because the note I have states that it is planned in early 1990 to introduce the proposed $60 call-out charge for the investigation of individual reception.

         — We have no intention of doing that. We are interested to see how it works. We note that the actual charge is $175-or so it is said-but I again take the view that that probably has substantial featherbedding built into it and the real cost is probably significantly less. So we do not see any need to have full cost recovery at this stage.

        The matter I draw attention to is a classic example of the way these issues are generally handled at ministerial level, as opposed to departmental level, where I think a genuine effort has been made to come to grips with the difficulties. The booklet that has been put together, no doubt, has involved a lot of time and research and I think is ultimately a very useful guide to users. But what concerns me is the pre-election pollyanna material put out by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly). It rabbits on about Government moves to improve television and radio knowledge; it tells us about all these wonderful things that the Government will be doing to help us, how copies of the booklets are going out to 2,500 technicians and antenna installers around Australia; and it makes it clear that, in the best of all possible worlds, this is meant to assist consumers and help people to determine whether they can handle the problem themselves or whether they need the assistance of a technician. What it does do quite clearly and deliberately is avoid any mention of the cost. It is very selective and disinformative in that sense.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, knowledge of the charge is meant to bring about a revolution in consumers' attitudes, so that their first port of call is not the Government but rather the local technician to get their own advice, which will be much more cost efficient. But no, none of that is included in this press release. There is no mention made of charges, just the usual soft sell-another example of the obsession with public relations, an utterly superficial approach to serious technical issues. In combination with `do-nothing Ralph', the assistance of the Minister for self-promotional media opportunities makes it clear why broadcasting regulation is in a state of crisis and why this sort of press release will do nothing to address the real issues.

        The amendments to the Telecommunications Act are to enable the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) to continue to provide reserve services by satellite-based facilities within the external territories and by satellite facilities or otherwise, between the external territories and other places within Australia. This is said to be a drafting error and we do not object to drafting errors being corrected; we are all fallible. What is of interest in this context is an article that appeared in yesterday's Age by Jay Spencer, in the section `Computer Age', which says:

       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom has been dead keen for many years to get its hands on Aussat Pty Ltd. It is news to me that it is now in the business of trying to take over OTC. Either of those steps would be entirely retrograde in the interests of genuine competition. The last thing we want in this country is yet another bigger and better monopolist. This is clearly, to date, the Government's favoured and favourite monopolist. Its policy is driven entirely by the pressures that derive from the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association, the Public Service unions, the anti-privateers and the left wing of Caucus, all of whom take the view that Telecom can do no wrong and that indeed it needs all the protection it ought reasonably to have. What we now have in this country is probably the most cosseted and protected telecommunications environment in the Western world. I am not sure whether Senator Cook is up with developments overseas, but the fact of the matter is that even conservative Europe is moving very much away from the sort of regulated and protective environment that has been in place for many years. We are alone; we are going backwards.

         —They certainly have vigorous disagreements with Telecom, in terms of wages and conditions, but they are as one in supporting the effort, sometimes against the inclinations of Telecom, to maintain and expand the monopoly. Classic examples of that are the first phone monopoly and the cellular mobile telephone services which Telecom was prepared to surrender to the task force in 1987-88. Senator Evans was prepared to concede this but the Caucus Telecom liaison committee-the monopoly protection society-weighed in very heavily, with two out of three members, Roger Price and John Saunderson being former Telecom employees. The inevitable outcome was that not only did Telecom retain what are now called reserve services but they have actually been expanded. We are very much concerned about the results of all of that.

        In terms of the costing, as Senator Panizza pointed out, it is said that there will be estimated net savings in the financial year of approximately $350,000. It might be helpful to know how that figure is arrived at because 75 per cent of $16,000 multiplied by $60 comes out at about $720,000. There may well be other offsets that are not readily apparent and I would certainly be interested if the Minister could provide a better than ballpark figure in that regard.

         —In addressing the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) I will be brief. Most of my remarks will relate to the communications sections of this legislation. I note that part of the Bill is to amend the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. I have had a great deal to do with that Act, having called for that legislation to address the problem of the import of substandard vehicles. That legislation did come forward very quickly from the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping (Mr Robert Brown). The Australian Democrats supported the legislation and now we have some tidying up amendments to it. One of the amendments in this Bill concerns ministerial discretion. Since the passage of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act I have had some representations from people in specialist areas of importing vehicles. While I was not deeply moved by their representations, one does understand that some people have particular interests, although in the case of some of the representations I thought they were more than just hobby and personal interests and were developing into considerable commercial interests, which I felt quite appropriately ought to come under this kind of legislation. I can see that from time to time there would be a need for some further discretion and I am pleased that the Government has come forward with this particular amendment, and indeed with a tidying up in general of that whole exercise.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In addressing some of the communications issues raised by way of this amending Bill, which is of course an omnibus Bill, including amendments to a number of Acts, I do not want to take up much of the time of the Senate at this stage of proceedings. However, I want to make a couple of general points on behalf of the Australian Democrats.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the disappointments of this parliamentary session-indeed, one of the disappointments for us since the election in 1987-has been the lack of substantive action in the area of communications and in particular in broadcasting legislation. Under the previous Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, there was movement and there was promise of more action. However, under that same Minister we saw moves in broadcasting, with which the Democrats strongly disagreed and still do, that led to increased concentration of ownership, particularly in the area of television services while at the same time, I acknowledge, stronger cross-media rules and in the area of radio broadcasting some limitations, which were supported and encouraged by us.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of oligopoly ownership in television remains a problem. We now have considerably more problems in that area, generated in the first instance by the carrot that was dangled before the noses of the entrepreneurs in this country with the establishment of networking, which is basically what the range of legislation at that time amounted to, leading to the considerable financial problems that we have in that sector. That shows up starkly the lack of action in that area by this Government. We will be dealing later in this session with some further amending legislation of a very minor kind with regard to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I take the opportunity to express our disappointment that there has not been the action, particularly in the area of broadcasting, that we would like to have seen. It is of particular concern because we now come towards another election, and, if there is a change of government, we would be very concerned that some of the trends which we would prefer not to see will be escalated. For instance, the question of the very survival of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal comes before us in that context.
       </para>
       <para>
        I just put those remarks on the record. In doing so, I also say, with more direct relationship to this Bill, that we still await the total review of the three telecommunications carriers-Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission of Australia (OTC) and Aussat Pty Ltd-which was signalled in May 1988 and which clearly is quite urgent. The annual report of Aussat was recently before this chamber. It is of major concern to the Democrats that Aussat has enormous problems. We do not believe that those problems are being met properly. Perhaps we would have achieved more had the review been completed by now.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats say that the whole story of Aussat is a sorry one. In the early 1980s it was clear to those who wanted to see that Aussat was not going to be a success-at that time it was just an exercise to satisfy the interest of Kerry Packer, in particular, who had views about how we should get into networking. The Government at that time ought to have cut its losses which in 1983 amounted to about $80m. Now we see annual debt problems of hundreds of millions of dollars in Aussat. We are facing a new generation of satellite. We say to this Government now that it should look again at this issue. We have the technological tail driving the broadcasting dog, as Kenneth Davidson said recently in a newspaper article on this issue. It has been the tradition that that is exactly what has happened. When we toss in the odd entrepreneurial spirit who is looking down the track at the interests of a commercial entity, not at the interests of satisfying the needs of the Australian community, let alone concerns about the public purse, we get what really amounts to an unholy mess, a very expensive one at that.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we have often said and continue to say, the way out of this mess would be, first, not to go ahead with the second generation and to amalgamate Aussat and OTC. We are opposed to the speeding up of the introduction of pay television, using Aussat in the first instance as a kind of crutch for OTC, which it would be in the short term because of the question of economic viability. If and when we have pay television, the optical fibre network which should be in place by the end of this coming decade would be a much more appropriate way to go. In any case, pay television has not been fully investigated. I believe that it is a system which does not have wide support. I am dismayed at the approach being taken by John Saunderson, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. He seems to be putting forward the introduction of pay television and using various excuses, in particular the provision of public television and diversity in television programming to support that approach. It seems to me that the consumers in Australia have a right to diverse and public community television without having to pay extra for it while the networks gobble up the major and free frequencies. I do not see that that is a valid argument for a quick introduction of pay television.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not support any escalation of the push towards pay television. We would much prefer to enshrine a broadly based television system in the mainstream which would be widely owned by a diverse group and which would provide much more diverse programming through ownership provisions and also through strengthening of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and other measures. Those are the major points that I want to make in this debate. As I say, we welcome many of the tidying up elements of this legislation but we have some fundamental concerns about the basic principles behind government policy and the general inaction in this area over the period that this Government has been in office.

         —in reply-A number of speakers in this debate have indicated that they will support the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and that amendments to the Bills will not be forthcoming. However, all of the speakers expressed reservations or opinions about the conduct of the Government or of the specific government business enterprises covered by this legislation. In the first instance I acknowledge the contribution of Senator John Watson who indicated that although it was his intention to proceed with an amendment he would now not do so. He took the advantage of the speech he made in the second reading debate stage to set out all of his concerns that that amendment would have addressed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On behalf of the Government I acknowledge the actions of Senator Watson and take on board his views as expressed in his speech. I will certainly be commending those views to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). I thank Senator Watson for not proceeding with the amendment. I do not in any way doubt that his concerns and those of the Opposition are real, and the Government acknowledges that. Many of the other speeches made in the second reading debate stage dealt with matters not specifically addressed in this legislation but were made on the basis that this legislation covers the whole of the `waterfront'-if I might coin a phase-of communications and transport. Therefore, in that very wide purview it is possible to make speeches relating to alive and real political issues or concerns under that broad umbrella and do so without specifically addressing any particular amendments we are seeking to bring forward. I acknowledge that and I do not wish to pursue to a logical conclusion each of the arguments that have been put because that would mean an extraordinarily long reply. We will meet the Opposition and the Australian Democrats as appropriate in forums and in this chamber and debate many of those arguments when the occasion arises in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it is incumbent on me to reply to some points that have been made in the debate. It is appropriate that the Government put its views on the record since these matters have been ventilated. The first of those points is the issue of micro-economic reform. Once again, I acknowledge that the main proponent of the debate on micro-economic reform in the second reading debate stage was Senator Watson. It is a field in which I know him to have a considerable personal interest. While often many of the things he puts to the Government are not to our taste, one has to acknowledge that in this area he is an authority, albeit not in a way which we agree with. I acknowledge that, but in Australian economic life one of the most important and significant economic debates is about the degree, the pace and the extent to which micro-economic reform can occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is little difference between the major parties-the coalition and the Government-as to the objective. We all agree that it is important that we obtain efficient, lean, competitive infrastructure for industry development in Australia. The areas in which government attention is needed if Australian industry is to become more competitive include transport, communications and a plethora of other areas. I do not think there is very much difference between us over the objective. There is a considerable difference between us-a difference which distinguishes the philosophies of the major parties-over the means by which we should achieve the desired outcome. It is in the field of that difference that there is real contention between the Government and the Opposition, perhaps appropriately, because it is then for the Australian community to choose which of the methods to reach the goals is the most desirable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would argue strongly that the method of resolving contention, conflict and division in the community which the Government has employed, of bringing together all the social partners-be they unions, industry or interested groups-to work with it through a consultative process with the objective of achieving significant and real change, is by far the preferable one. I identify that as being the Government's desire and, indeed, practice across a range of areas in this community-the most shining example being the prices and wages accord. In this way, the Government has been able to work with the community to achieve significant change of durable benefit for Australia. I juxtapose our approach with what I identify as being the Opposition's approach of ignoring-by pretending they do not exist-some of the very thorny difficulties of making changes, which involved structural alterations that put people out of work or change the way in which they do things without taking account of the individual needs and the ordinary dignity of Australian workers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to continue with that point unnecessarily, but I think this is really what this debate is about. We can argue about the pace and the extent of the reform that is possible. I point to this Government's record of achieving significant reforms of the financial market and foreign investment guidelines, introducing major tariff reductions, establishing a free market for crude oil in Australia and achieving significant reforms-which I count as micro-economic reforms-in education and training in this country. These reforms have all been undertaken-not without heat and argument-and we have been able to move very constructively down a path of real change which, it appears to me, will be enduring.

        I turn to shipping and the waterfront which were referred to in particular by the Opposition. Under the micro-economic reform that we are proposing, the Australian shipping industry has a bright outlook. It is one of the most traditional of Australian industries and is in the process of reconstructing itself. It can be argued that this reform has led workplace restructuring in Australia. More credit-rather than criticism and dispute-needs to be given to the Australian shipping industry for what it has achieved. Those real gains should be acknowledged rather than simply dismissed as if they were always there for the taking.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1984 the average crew on a major Australian trading ship was 33. Today it is 27. Next month it will be 25. More importantly, by mid-1992 it will be 21 and, at that level, Australian shipping will match the average crewing levels on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ships. Senator Panizza asked why we cannot get to the OECD level. We will, in 1992. By the same benchmark date the most efficient and modern of Australia's ships will have crews of 17 or 18. By 1993 the training regimes will be in place allowing crewing of 14 to 16.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be argued that that is not quick enough. But this is an established industry-a strong industry, an industry that has been wrought in the tradition of Australia over many decades-and adjustments are painful and upset practice. We do not shirk from that, but we say that that change is to be obtained sensitively-and, when it is obtained, it will be real and enduring because of that-rather than by forcing, pushing and compelling which, in the event of disputes, will mean that the foundations upon which it is erected are suspect. As a consequence of this, ship owners in Australia have embarked on a major re-equipment program. At the last count, this result in 26 new, modern fuel efficient ships being introduced into the fleet by 1992.

Is it the case that the only eastern European head of state to visit Australia during the Hawke Government's term of office has been President Ceausescu of Romania? Was Ceausescu not accorded the honour by the Government of being the first head of state to visit Australia during our bicentennial year? Is it not also the case that the Ceausescu visit took place shortly after similar government-supported violence in Brasov, Transylvania, somewhat similar to the violence that we have become aware of in the last couple of days? Will the Minister explain what sort of message he believes the Government is communicating to such tyrannical regimes by its hosting of such visits?

        Australia has been a consistent critic of the human rights record of the Ceausescu regime. At the last session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Australia co-sponsored the Resolution which expressed concern at human rights abuses in Romania and appointed a Special Rapporteur to investigate the situation in Romania and in particular the campaign of forced assimilation of Romania's ethnic minorities.
       </para>

        The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, currently visiting East Europe, made Australia's views clear in contrasting the reforms taking place elsewhere in East Europe with the bloody suppression of protest in Romania.

        I will go on to give some background information. Popular discontent has begun to boil over in Romania, one of the last bastions of hard line communism. On the weekend of 16 and 17 December, crowds of mostly ethnic Hungarian youths gathered in the Transylvanian town of Timisoara to prevent the deportation of a local priest known for his criticism of the Ceausescu regime. The crowd soon turned into a huge demonstration of between 5,000 to 10,000 people shouting anti-government slogans and denouncing President Ceausescu's repressive Stalinist regime. This is the first demonstration since the Brasov demonstrations in November 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        The demonstration turned violent when police brought in armoured personnel carriers and used water-cannons to disperse the crowd. Reports state that shots were heard and the military were seen to be carrying fixed bayonets. Shop windows were broken and fire bombs were thrown during the running battle with security forces through the town. The unconfirmed death toll could go as high as 400. Many injuries and arrests have been reported, although many demonstrators would not have had their injuries tended in public hospitals, fearing further intimidation. The town is now sealed off and security forces are in control of Timisoara. It appears that many other parts of the country are under martial law as well. Romania has also closed its borders with Yugoslavia, Hungary and Bulgaria.
       </para>
       <para>
        While other countries of eastern Europe are shedding their totalitarian systems, Romania appears to be intensifying its repression of the population in the vain hope that it will stifle dissent. In the past, even Romanians resident in Australia have, out of concern for their relatives back home, been careful not to publicly denounce the President of Romania. The Romanian people, cowered by their fear for so long, cannot be repressed indefinitely. Importantly, eastern European countries such as Poland, the German Democratic Republic and Hungary are at the fore by joining the West in their condemnation of the brutal force used against Romanian people.

        Senator Evans, in Berlin yesterday, stated that any government which can cling to office only by shooting and beating its own people has lost all claim to moral authority. He added that Australia has been a long-standing critic of Romania's human rights abuses. Senator Evans also instructed the Australian Embassy in Belgrade to find out exactly what happened in Timisoara and to register with the Romanian authorities Australia's expectation that the Romanian Government avoid violence and honour its international human rights commitments. I am not sure whether Senator Hill has a copy of the press release issued today.

I know that both I and many others did not attend any of those functions because of our views on the President of Romania. I did not put `regret' on my invitation; I put `reject'. However, as I understand it-and as I have said, I have not been fully briefed on this-the invitation to that particular person goes back over many years to when the Opposition could not have seen with foresight that in the period of the Los Angeles Olympics, or preceding that, Romania would take the course of events which it has currently taken. At that stage, there was the general view-maybe a view which was not correct-that it was one of the lesser repressive regimes in eastern Europe at that stage. Clearly, with hindsight, the Opposition may well argue that it was not the case. But many others at the time of the Los Angeles Olympics argued that the Romanians had shown some courage in standing up to the Soviet Union. Whether that was a correct analysis, I am not sure. If I can find out the exact details of when the invitation was issued, and how many prior invitations may have been issued, I will give the honourable senator the information.

I am quite sure that all senators around the chamber are well aware of the personalities of those two persons. Lois O'Donoghue is currently the chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission.

         —Before going to the specific point of Senator McMullan's question, I should reiterate that the Australian Government warmly congratulates Mr Aylwin on his historic victory in the Chilean presidential elections held on 14 December. Voter participation of over 90 per cent and Mr Aylwin's marginal victory of 55 per cent, to the next candidate's 29 per cent, bear witness to the hunger for democracy after 16 years of authoritarian military rule in Chile. That rule has long been opposed by many in Australia and the Hawke Government has been active in the United Nations, as well as through its official representatives in Chile, in supporting the full restoration of democratic and human rights in Chile. The restoration of democracy in Chile is not yet absolute as General Pinochet has entrenched himself as Army commander for another eight years. While the centre left coalition appears to have won 72 of the 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies-that is the lower House-and about 22 of the 38 elected senators, it will be deprived of a majority in the Senate by the fact that nine senators are to be appointed by the outgoing Pinochet regime rather than elected. In this context the Australian Government renews its call for all Chileans to continue to work actively and in a spirit of compromise to enable a complete return to democracy at the earliest possible date.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Australia looks forward very much to working with the government to be led by President-Elect Aylwin in strengthening the healthy bilateral relations between the two countries and in cooperation on matters of mutual interest, including the Cairns Group and Antarctica. The Government will be examining other ways in which bilateral relations can be broadened and strengthened in line with the progressive restoration of democracy in Chile. Elements such as those mentioned by Senator McMullan will certainly be looked at sympathetically in the context and in the light of resources available. The Government will be giving attention to this matter in the period leading up to the formal inauguration of the Aylwin Government on 11 March next year and, thereafter, in our discussions with the new Chilean authorities.

         —My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. On 5 October this year I asked Senator Button, at that time representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, a question relating to the business interests of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) in South Africa. In that question I pointed out that the report on Australian activities in South Africa, the Code of Conduct of Australian Companies with interests in the Republic of South Africa, the second report of the Administrator, May 1989, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, listed on page 27 of schedule 3 the subsidiaries of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and did not include Phoenix Mining Finance Co. Pty Ltd. I also pointed out that the BHP financial statements published in August 1989 listed that company as a wholly owned subsidiary carrying on business activities in South Africa. In answer to my question, the Minister gave an undertaking that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would seek further explanation of the discrepancy from BHP. Can the Minister tell the Senate what action he has taken and what, if any, information he has received?

BHP has provided the following explanation: the only activities of Phoenix Mining Finance Co.

Accordingly, as it had no other interests in South Africa and has no employees, there was no requirement for it to be disclosed in the information given to the Administrator of the Code of Conduct.

         —This is an important matter. It gives me great pleasure to speak of this, and I do so in the context of congratulating the Labor Government in Queensland on its magnificent victory. Last Sunday I met with the new Queensland Attorney-General, Mr Deane Wells-he will be well known to members of this chamber having been a former member of the House of Representatives-to discuss a matter of the utmost importance to ensuring a fair national sentencing scheme for those convicted of Federal offences. The issue was the availability of community service orders to Federal offenders convicted in Queensland. As a result of our discussions I can report that the Commonwealth and Queensland governments have agreed on a new system of sentencing options which will allow people who offend against Federal laws to be given community service orders as a penalty.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of the principal benefits of the new agreement will be to ensure that, where appropriate, the families of people who commit social security offences do not suffer because of the conviction, particularly of a mother. Community service orders require offenders to devote a specified number of hours to community work. In Queensland such work includes person to person work, such as reading to the elderly, or doing gardening and repairs for pensioners, group projects, such as building school playground equipment, working for the disabled and environmental projects, such as clean-ups and reafforestation schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Community service orders are a particularly effective penalty in certain circumstances, especially where the offender cannot afford a fine and imprisonment is not a suitable punishment. Importantly, this community-based option stops short of the deprivation of liberty and loss of income and family contact involved in a prison sentence. This Parliament legislated in 1982 to make community service orders an available sentencing option for Federal offenders. Until now, however, we have been unable to reach an agreement with the Queensland Government that would entitle Federal offenders to be given such a punishment when convicted in Queensland. This has meant that there were insufficient alternatives to imprisonment for Federal offenders appearing before Queensland courts charged with what were quite often minor fraud offences. This absence of community-based sentencing options for Federal offenders principally affected social security offenders, particularly women with children. Tragically, in some cases, it caused mothers to be separated from their children, making innocent children themselves the victims. Obviously the Commonwealth cannot condone deliberate and repeated defrauding of the social security system. However, equally, I have been anxious to ensure that the suffering of families is not out of proportion to the offence. Greater use of community service orders makes sense in every way.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the latest available Queensland figures, the average annual cost of administering a community service order in that State is less than $750 compared to almost $30,000 for keeping a person in prison for a year. The successful negotiation of this agreement with the new Queensland Government follows similar agreements with other States and Territories in 1986 and with the new Tasmanian Labor Government within a couple of weeks of its coming to office in late winter this year. New South Wales is now the only State not a party to the scheme. I congratulate the Queensland Attorney-General, Mr Wells, and his Government on taking such prompt action. I also take the opportunity to send a cheerio and a Christmas greeting to Mr Wells and his wife, Jane, who had a baby on Sunday morning.

The effect of the Federal Court order is that councils are not required to make pay as you earn (PAYE) contributions in respect of allowances paid to elected members and fringe benefit tax (FBT) returns are not required to be lodged in respect of those allowances paid to elected members. Has income tax ruling MT2035 been withdrawn? If so, when was the announcement made? If not, will the Government be directing the Commissioner of Taxation to withdraw the ruling? Will the Government be repaying to local government bodies all PAYE tax collected this financial year and fringe benefits tax contributions paid since the date of the ruling?

However, I will take out the most relevant points. The Federal Court, as Senator Bishop has already said, declared that local government elected members were not deemed to be employees for purposes of taxation. I understand from the Treasury minute that the taxation ruling was withdrawn in the same month as a result of that decision. The Government endorses that decision because it recognises the largely voluntary nature of the service most local government elected members provide their communities. I also understand that with the exception of a relatively small number of elected members in Queensland who are paid salaries determined by the individual councils concerned, the remaining 9,000 or so local government elected members in the rest of Australia receive only a small allowance, generally less than $2,000, in lieu of their civic duties.

We sent two onto the island, and apparently the father is the young one. We sent a five-year-old which had successfully raised a family with a 12-year-old. He piked out of it but an 18-month-old, called Tintola, which means darling, has done the trick, evidently, and two chicks have now been born. We should not get too excited.

However, Mr Farmer's suggestion that there should be a convention, to which both the major parties subscribe, that financial legislation will not be obstructed is extremely naive. The events of 1975 demonstrated that no convention is regarded as sacrosanct by an opportunistic, power hungry Liberal-National Party.

        Some commentators have recently expressed shock and outrage at Senator Haines's announcement that the Australian Democrats, should there be a coalition government, would block savings measures and also block the watering down-the effective repeal-of the capital gains tax. The same commentators do not seem to have noticed that the Democrats have been doing that to this Government for years. Ever since we have been in office, the Democrats have been doing precisely that. So I do not see why there should be so much outrage at the Democrats saying that they will continue to do that under a coalition government-continue to do what they have been doing for years under a Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, one important distinction between what Senator Haines said a couple of weeks ago and what the Democrats have done over the last 6 1/2 years is that the Democrats' proposal would actually give a coalition government, should there be one, an extra $450m in revenue. Of course, that would have the opposite effect on the Budget bottom line of everything else that the Democrats have done to this Government in the last 6 1/2 years. Indeed, the $450m extra revenue would go a long way towards plugging the $830m-odd black hole in the Opposition's costings in its Economic Action Plan. The final point is that we will see again, before the end of this week, whether the Senate will allow this Government to implement its taxation revenue policies or whether it will try to continue to block the collection of $500m in this financial year.

Unfortunately, a number of politicians in Western Australia, in particular from the Liberal Party-and this is not a National bagging day; they come from the Liberal Party-have egged on those League of Rights people with some of the more stupid propaganda. In fact, it goes to that great line about the one world government of which we are apparently a party with all the nasty socialists. I do not know what happens now that the wall is breaking down, but I have never taken that propaganda too seriously. Unfortunately, Senator Vallentine, there are a number of people in the area who continue to spread it. I know that Minister Pearce from the Western Australian Government has been talking to them on many visits that he has made to the area. From the reports I have received, I think the people of Shark Bay and its surrounding areas are much more aware of the truth of these matters than they were a year ago. Of course, that does not mean that the community accepts that the World Heritage program is the right way for us to proceed.

       <para>
        I do not favour the `Man and the Biosphere' program as the best way of ensuring the future protection of Shark Bay. I have always favoured the World Heritage program and continue to do so. I have had a number of discussions with the Western Australian Government, which I hope will eventually lead to the listing of Shark Bay. I would like to report to Senator Vallentine that I have its agreement, but I do not. Nonetheless, the talks are continuing. I think the Western Australian objection is to a concern that sovereignty over the area will be taken away from it and from the local people. I am encouraged by the management plan the Western Australian Government has put out for Shark Bay. If we were to list this area for World Heritage, that management plan would form the basis of the way in which we would proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there was to be any move towards this, though, there would need to be a long discussion about the possible boundaries of the area. I have never accepted the original boundaries suggested by conservation organisations as being all that wise because they are so broad that they take in areas of pastoral land which are so degraded as to concern me as to whether they are worthy of being put in. Fortunately, the Western Australian Government is now buying some of that land and, hopefully, that will mean that some developments which could have occurred on the edges and fringes of Shark Bay will now not happen. As far as the future of the area is concerned, I believe that in terms of both mining and tourism the management plan should provide the basis for an orderly future development which will not damage the values of Shark Bay. Whether one talks of seagrass beds, dolphins, stromatolites or whatever else, at Shark Bay World Heritage values abound.

In combating major fraud against the Commonwealth there are special personnel trained and dedicated to that task. Senator Newman has mentioned one of the key personnel in that area. Indeed, there have been extremely fruitful discussions between the Minister for Defence, Mr Kim Beazley, and myself leading to the appointment within the Department of Defence-or the secondment to it; I do not know the exact phrase-of Australian Federal Police personnel to assist in combating the type of fraud to which she has pointed. One would hope that the preventative strategies, which are absolutely essential, are in place in a way which prevents the rise of fraudulent activity so that temptation is not in place so as to lead weak or corruptible people to succumb to that temptation.

The community will refuse to pay to them those entitlements which otherwise they and their families would be able to obtain on leaving the Commonwealth Public Service.

        In answer to Senator McLean's question, bank service fees are not debited to Westpac defence service home loans accounts. The only charges are those levied by State governments, financial institutions duty and the Commonwealth's bank account debits tax. The amounts involved in the financial institutions duty, where applicable, are very small, amounting to no more than $16 over the 25-year life of a loan, and the bank account debits tax applies only where cheque withdrawals are made from the borrowers' excess credits. The Government does not consider that it would be appropriate to absolve this one small group in the community from the financial institutions duty or the bank account debits tax; nor does it intend to change the current policy on married couples as it would be inequitable for one married couple, both partners of which are eligible, to have a greater benefit in relation to the establishment of their home than a married couple of which only one person is eligible.

         —I thank Senator Foreman for his question on this particularly important issue. It continues his interest in matters to do with the criminal justice system. Many honourable senators would have read in the Sydney Morning Herald some months ago an article about the Clemenger report-the Silent Majority Part II-which showed that there was a great deal of public disquiet and concern in Australia today about the issues relating to crime and punishment. That survey sought to discover just what Australians are worried about today. Fourth in the list of the top 40 concerns was the early release of criminals from prison. I am pleased to say, however, that this is a concern that the Government has been able to respond to.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        With the passage of legislation through the Senate yesterday the fraud on the public, whereby judges set minimum terms which bear no relationship to the actual time spent in prison, will happen no more. Once the legislation commences operation, the State remissions that come off the non-parole period will no longer be available to eat away at the minimum sentences of Federal offenders. The early release of prisoners brought about by such remissions will not occur. Instead, a sentence will mean what it says. The judge will set a prison term and a parole period to follow that term and the prisoner will remain in prison for the period set by the judge. Obviously, only Federal offenders are affected by the new legislation-persons who have been convicted of a crime against Federal law such as drug importation or fraud against the Commonwealth. For any current Federal prisoners, I point out that the legislation is not retrospective so it will not affect their sentences. As honourable senators will know, there are no Federal prisons. The Federal Government uses State courts to try and State prisons to incarcerate those sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem has been that until now a Federal prisoner has been treated in the same way as would be a State prisoner sentenced to the same term-that is, the remissions and parole systems of the relevant jurisdictions applied. This meant that it was extremely difficult to ensure consistency in the sentencing of Federal offenders as the systems differ in every jurisdiction. It also meant that in those States which grant remissions off the non-parole period, it was impossible for the public to know just how long a Federal offender would spend in prison. It meant that every week I would have to deal with numerous cases where the date of the prisoner's release bore no relationship to the minimum term set by the judge. One recent example that comes to mind is of a Federal prisoner who received a 15-year maximum sentence for conspiracy to import heroin. The prisoner was given a five-year minimum term but, with State remissions, spent only three years and one month of his sentence in prison.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the new legislation, any State remissions that come off the non-parole period will no longer be available to eat away at the minimum sentences of Federal offenders. There will be certainty in the sentencing of Federal offenders. Certainty does not mean longer sentences since mechanisms have been built into the legislation to ensure that judges adjust the prison part of a sentence to take account of the fact that it will no longer be reduced by remissions. The punishment of imprisonment will remain the punishment of last resort. What the certainty of the new regime means is that if an offender is consigned to that last resort, he or she will stay in it for the period set by the judge. What is announced in court will be carried into effect and everyone-the prisoner, the judge and the public-will know that what is announced in court will be carried into effect.

       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the question which Senator Alston asked yesterday about the Government's television equalisation policy. The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to Senator Alston's question.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Solicitor-General has advised the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that certain practices embodied in draft network affiliation agreements may, in their current form, be contrary to the requirements of the Broadcasting Act. The Tribunal has referred copies of the advice to the networks concerned and they have asked for supplementary advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        When that advice is to hand, the networks will be able to assess their position and advise if they consider it impossible under the current Act to proceed with the affiliation agreements for television equalisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        If equalisation is, in fact, threatened, the Government will act decisively to remove that threat, while ensuring that a proper balance is maintained between the integrity of the ownership and control regime of the Broadcasting Act and the desirability, on commercial and planning grounds, of equitable networking arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister is meeting today with representatives of regional television companies. They will be discussing current issues of concern, including the economic impact of equalisation on the profitability of regional services and the programs provided to the public, and the legal question of networking agreements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has not seen a copy of the report to which Senator Alston refers, and so cannot comment on it. Senator Alston's question is believed to refer to a report which has not yet been released, by a media consultant, Mr Peter Cox. The Government will certainly consider it if a copy is made available.
       </para>
       <para>
        The outcry about the so-called ``disastrous effects'' of equalisation is far from being universal, as Senator Alston has claimed. Rather it comes from a very small and previously highly protected group of regional broadcasters who are now having to face competition for the first time. Indeed one television operator, Mr Jack Gleeson of Telecasters North Queensland, is reported as saying that his company is ``positively looking forward to aggregation''.
       </para>
       <para>
        The aim of equalisation has been to provide a choice of commercial television programs for country people. There may be problems in particular areas, and the Minister is willing to listen to the views of the industry. He is not, however, going to take any action that will in any way jeopardise the Government's equalisation policy.

         —Yesterday during Question Time I was asked a question by Senator Hill. I have obtained the following answer. I am advised that there has been no commitment by the Australian Government on normalising relations with China. The last occasion the Prime Minister communicated with the Chinese Government was when he wrote on 12 June to urge clemency for those detained after the crackdown on demonstrations. This letter, of course, was made public. Senator Cook, in his capacity both as Chairman of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Association and as Minister for Resources, accepted a longstanding invitation to lunch with the Chinese Ambassador, Mr Zhang Zai, on 27 November 1989. The Ambassador has had contact with a number of Australian Ministers and senior officials as part of his normal diplomatic duties. These exchanges are quite normal and were in no way proscribed by the terms of the Australian policy towards China announced on 13 July. In fact, that policy was premised on keeping open appropriate channels of communication.

        During their lunch, the Ambassador raised the Chinese Government's desire for an early return to more normal relations. Senator Cook responded that this was a matter for the Government as a whole to consider in due course. He explained the reasons for the current government policy towards China and gave no indication of a timeframe in which policy would change, beyond commenting that the review of current policy might not be completed before the new year.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Ray) in response to a Question without Notice asked by Senator Hill on 19 December 1989, relating to Australia-China relations.

        I will speak only briefly at this stage because I think there is further development of this matter to take place. I remind the Senate that the Government introduced its constraints in the Australia-China relationship in July and that this action had to be postponed for several weeks because Mr Hawke was overseas. Nevertheless, when Cabinet finally addressed the question of what sorts of constraints should be introduced in the relationship in an effort to dissuade China from the purge that was taking place, it indicated that those constraints would be reviewed by the end of this year. According to information that has been brought to my attention, a decision was made in relation to that matter and the Government has indicated that it would lift those constraints. Senator Cook, under the guise of his position as Chairman of the China-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Association, was instructed to communicate that to the Chinese Ambassador. According to my information, this was done and a discussion ensued on how it might be better communicated. It was suggested by the Chinese Ambassador that a better form of communication would be for Mr Hawke to put in writing the decision to lift the constraints.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further discussion followed after which it was agreed that an alternative process would take place-that is, that Mr Hawke would communicate by telephone to the Chinese Premier the decision of the Australian Government. As I understand it, and as we hear from journalists and on the television, Senator Cook communicated by letter to Senator Gareth Evans and to the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, that he had fulfilled his mission. Perhaps the matter could be ended if the Minister at the table, Senator Robert Ray, was prepared to table the correspondence from Senator Cook to Senator Evans and Mr Hawke, which has been put to me in terms that it confirmed the matters raised in my question. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

       The news emanating from Romania today is deeply distressing. Another regime has turned its guns on its people rather than seek to understand the reasons leading to popular disaffection. The reports coming from Romania are still scanty, but enough is known to condemn yet again the repressive regime of the Ceausescu family. The tide of social change and history will ultimately vindicate and liberate the people of Romania but, in the meantime, through this motion, we join the wider international community in expressing our revulsion at the recent events.
      </para>
      <para>
       Romania, through its reform resistance leadership, is a state that has defied the changes occurring in Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. It is a state where people just try to survive; a state where basic human rights are abused and where dissent is crushed. It is therefore even more important for outside voices to proclaim the Romanians' cause. Contrary to the Romanian Government's official report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, submitted in January 1988, the Romanian Government still violates other basic human rights of its citizens. The right to leave is not safeguarded in Romanian law. Thousands of Romanians wishing to leave that country are not permitted to do so. The rights of freedom of thought, conscience and religion are daily violated. The persecution and forced Romanisation of some minority groups in Romania have intensified. Free expression is not at all tolerated. Independent labour unions are prohibited. Indeed, the technique of repression is actually facilitated by the Romanian legal system-a system that deviates from the standards and requirements of international covenants. The situation is so bad that even ecology in Romania is not allowed to be commented on. A recent report dealing with environmental issues had to be smuggled to the West through an underground group.

      <para>
       In 1988 President Ceausescu restarted a rural resettlement program, meant to serve as a model for the eventual social engineering of the entire nation. This obscene program is to see 7,000 of the country's 13,000 villages levelled by 1995. The main victims of this resettlement policy are the Hungarian and German ethnic minorities, as well as gypsies, the Ukrainians, Serbs and Turks, whose families have lived in Transylvania and other parts of Romania for centuries.
      </para>
      <para>
       This forced assimilation constitutes a violation of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights, in particular those articles which guarantee to ethnic and linguistic minorities the continuation of their own cultural life and the right to a free choice of residence. Indeed, the Government flagrantly ignores these obligations and commitments of the international accords, in particular the Helsinki final act. Indeed, one law of Romania-decree 408-states that all conversations with foreigners must be reported to the authorities within 24 hours.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amnesty International and the United States Department of State report on human rights all too graphically list the disappearances, maltreatments and tortures endemic to life in Romania. It is a State where persons accused of acting against the socialist order can still be committed to psychiatric institutions as a method of punishment. I recently read a quote attributed to the First Secretary of the Ilfou Party Committee-the region being resettled outside Bucharest. He said that the program of resettlement is designed to `mould the new communist man' by changing his present way of thinking, behaviour, customs, practices and habits. Almost everywhere else in eastern Europe the new communist man has shown what he thinks of communism. With the passing of this motion we, as a Parliament, both send and lend our support to the long-suffering people of Romania.

        —On behalf of the Government I join with Senator Hill in supporting this motion relating to the events in Romania. As has been highlighted in the press here, a popular discontent has begun to boil over in Romania. This is the first time that that has happened since 1987, when the Brasov riots took place. I do not want to go to the details of the current dissent, about which reports are not entirely satisfactory. But it is quite clear that a very severe situation exists there. A very repressive regime of police and army activity has been put into place. All the signs of a totalitarian country are being displayed in what is now happening in Romania.

       Today in Question Time Senator Hill asked a question of Minister Robert Ray representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade about events in Romania. In answering part of that question, Senator Ray tabled a statement issued today by Mr Duffy, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to which I can add not very much by way of my comments in the Senate.
      </para>
      <para>
       The events in Romania are really, in a sense, very much highlighted by the enormous changes which have taken place in other regimes in eastern Europe in the past few years. For example, when the invitation was issued in the mid-1970s to President Ceausescu to come to Australia, the Romanian regime, compared with regimes in other parts of eastern Europe, did not seem particularly bad. In fact, it seemed reasonably and comparatively good. There have been such enormous changes in these other countries where, suppressed though it has been, there has probably been a stronger liberal dissident tradition than in Romania. The changes have been so enormous that they particularly draw attention to the monstrosity of the regime which remains in place in Romania.

       The Romanian authorities were insistent upon accepting the invitation for President Ceausescu to visit Australia in 1988 for the bicentennial year, even though it had been issued many years before. It is probably fair to say that he wanted to be treated as a head of state, like the other heads of state who had been particularly invited to Australia for the event. Though I am not at liberty to say some of the things that I learned in the course of President Ceausescu's visit-not in public anyway-the rigidity and closed-minded nature of the regime was amply displayed by the President during his visit.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are only a couple of other points that I will make. For the first time, eastern European regimes, who two years ago were protesting against events in Romania, have joined with the other countries of the traditional Western world in condemning what has recently taken place in Romania. The Romanian authorities do not have many friends either in eastern or western Europe or in the other democracies of the world. Poland, the German Democratic Republic and Hungary are at the fore in joining the West in their condemnation of the force used against the Romanian people.
      </para>
      <para>
       As Senator Ray said at Question Time, Senator Gareth Evans has registered Australia's horror at the events and has asked the Romanian Government to avoid violence and to honour its international human rights commitments. The Romanian Consulate-General in Sydney has been informed today of Australia's views. Australia's voice is being added to the protest of other countries. The problem is also being discussed in other capitals-both East and West-to determine whether there is the international will to make a concerted protest to the Romanian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has been a consistent critic of the human rights record of the Ceausescu regime. At the last session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights Australia co-sponsored the resolution which expressed concern at human rights abuses in Romania and appointed a special rapporteur to investigate the situation in Romania and, in particular, the campaign of forced assimilation of Romania's ethnic minorities, to which Senator Hill referred in his remarks. The Australian Government stands ready to play its part in any further action which is determined by the European or international community.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I have been present at some of the discussions which took place with President Ceausescu. I am not making any claim in respect of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) but he raised, in my presence, some of the human rights issues in Romania and of all the bicentennial visitors we had to this country, President Ceausescu was the only one with whom the Prime Minister clearly did not get on well.

        —I would like to associate the Australian Democrats with the remarks that have been made and indicate our support for the motion that has been moved by Senator Hill condemning the Romanian Government for its repression of its own citizens. Last night I had the honour to speak at a function for a delegation from Paris to establish in Australia a branch of the Federation for a Democratic China. Today, Senator Haines, Leader of the Australian Democrats, was the guest speaker at the launch of that Federation in Canberra. I raise that issue because I think the two events-the one we saw in the middle of this year in Tiananmen Square where the regime turned on its own people, and the one which has been reported as occurring in Romania, not only last weekend but over quite some time now, where the Romanian regime is doing the same to its people-probably reflect in some way the advances that have been made elsewhere in the world, to which Senator Button referred. We have become almost blase about the developments in eastern Europe that have occurred with such breathtaking speed. People in the German Democratic Republic are at the forefront of the condemnation of what is happening in Romania, whereas under the previous Honecker regime they would not have entertained such a thought.

       What we have seen in 1989, probably more than in any year since the end of the Second World War, has been a rising up of the people to take control of their own lives and the establishment of democracy in so many countries. The Romanian Government's actions are even more horrific when we compare them with what has occurred in China and, doubtless, what will occur in other countries such as Albania-if we ever hear anything about what happens in that country. It reminds us that the fight for freedom and democracy goes on and the advances that have been made in some parts of the world have yet to be made in others.
      </para>
      <para>
       One stands in awe of the courage and tenacity of people who want to be free. Where people have stood up against repressive regimes and have won we have applauded and congratulated them. Where people have stood up and lost we have mourned and suffered with them. We know that the human spirit is resilient and tenacious. In 1989 the victories that will be won will be in China, Romania, Albania and the Latin American and Asian countries that still suffer under repressive regimes. We tend to focus on dramatic events-again I suppose that that is part of human nature-but, in the end, continuing day-in and day-out repression is as damaging to the human spirit as is the bullet and the bayonet. In the spirit of the motion moved by Senator Hill we have referred not only to those courageous people in Romania who at least have made this attempt to be free and who undoubtedly will continue to move that way; we have also empathised with all other peoples in countries with repressive regimes and expressed the hope that they, too, will be free and that the next decade will see the finish of something that was started this year. We hope that the sun will shine brightly in the history of the establishment of democracies.

The news reports that we have heard over the last few days may be only a trickle of the truth because Romania is, and has been for a long time, a closed society. News of the happenings within Romania have been very sketchy indeed. Of course, we have known for some time that Romania has been under a Stalinist-type dictatorship and that extreme suffering and gross violations of human rights have been occurring daily in that country. Almost all Romanians are suffering, including the ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania about whom many senators and members in the other place have been aware. There have been petitions which have reflected this fact.

       We now have the opportunity of expressing our condemnation by passing this motion in the Senate. But I think we should learn a bit of a lesson now so that we will know what attitude to adopt in respect of other heads of government who want to come here. Senator Button indicated that an invitation was extended to President Ceausescu in the mid-1970s, and he took up that invitation in 1988. As we all know, a luncheon was held in the old Parliament House for President Ceausescu and a number of senators and members did not go along to that luncheon. I only wish that more senators and members did not go. I do not blame senators or members for not going because I think a bit of leadership should be shown in this area. I know that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, raised quite forcefully the question of human rights with President Ceausescu when he was here. As Senator Button has said, presumably the answer was, `Keep your nose out of our business'. Senator Button has said that Mr Hawke obviously did not get on with President Ceausescu.

       It is very important to reiterate our concern about human rights in various countries but I think we should realise that, when leaders from this type of dictatorship come to Canberra, they also go to all the various States. He went to Queensland and Western Australia, and I am not so sure that the same concerns about human rights were raised in those places.

        —I have said what I said and I think the point can be taken. I take what Senator Crichton-Browne said and make this point: Senator Evans often says that it is important to keep up trade and diplomatic links because, as trading partners, there is a better chance that we will be taken notice of on the question of human rights. That is not necessarily the case. I think we have to study very carefully whether that is an appropriate foreign affairs policy for Australia to pursue. I know that in this case the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government have over the last few months been expressing grave concern about what has been happening in Romania. A number of other senators and members have been doing the same. Senator Baden Teague, who will follow me in this debate, has been expressing his concern. We should take a lesson and we should express our concern. Perhaps if we had made a protest loud enough earlier on and, for example, rejected in 1988 President Ceausescu's insistence that he accept our invitation, which was issued in 1977, then that message would have reached the mark earlier than this. Nevertheless, I very much support the motion. I congratulate Senator Hill for bringing it forward and I give it my full support.

        I commence, Mr Acting Deputy President, by saying that I am very pleased to see that you are in the chair because it allows me to indicate formally that the answer to the question you asked Senator Richardson earlier today was: beetles. You and I both know what Haldane said about the good Lord's inordinate fondness for beetles as the demonstration of why he created so many of them.

       <para>
        I am pleased to speak briefly to the report of the review of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) undertaken by Mr Bruce McDonald, a former head of the Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism. This is an interesting report which I have had the opportunity to scan only briefly since it was tabled. I draw attention to a couple of the recommendations and indicate a preliminary view on a number of those matters which I think are of importance. On page 141 the review recommends:
       </para>
       <para>
        That the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service be merged into a wider-ranging statutory authority, to be called the Australian Nature Conservation Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not a recommendation which I find attractive. Certainly it is one which would not be in accordance with the course of action in this area that an incoming coalition government would seek to undertake. We, in fact, want to strengthen the role of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service but do not believe that a case is made out for the creation of another statutory authority. That is very much opposed to the general thrust of policies which we are putting forward. We do, however, support the recommendation which appears on page 142 that there should be a revision and consolidation of all Federal nature conservation legislation. At the moment there are an extraordinary number of Acts dealing with aspects of nature conservation which should be consolidated into one significant Federal statute, and we certainly do endorse that. There are two points to which I make reference, both of which endorse significant initiatives already undertaken by the coalition parties in the development of their policy. The report recommends on page 143:
       </para>
       <para>
        that an expert commercial specialist be engaged to look at the question of charging, merchandising and publicising of the Commonwealth's nature conservation activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cost recovery within the ANPWS is something which is very much put forward at the moment in the coalition parties Economic Action Plan. We are very glad to see that the consultant has understood the capacity which exists for some greater cost recovery to finance the expanded work of the Service, and I welcome that. On page 122 of the report there is a comment by the consultant about the need to improve the handling of certain Commonwealth-State relations aspects of national park administration and World Heritage areas in particular. He draws attention to the fact that Australia really lacks what he describes as `a truly national parks system', that is a system of national parks which is truly a national system, as distinct from having national parks that simply have those titles because some State or local government authority has chosen to call them national parks.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the statement issued by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Blunt, and me in July of this year we outlined our proposals for the development of what we called a system of priority national parks which is very much in line with the consultant's conclusions in his review of these matters. The consultant suggests that there ought to be a timetable for the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) to phase out and later eliminate-or at the very least minimise-its involvement in management issues related to national parks, leaving the Commonwealth's role to the park authorities. We say that the ANPWS should confine itself to policy development and policy administration. We agree with that observation by the consultant.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a valuable and important report. It is very detailed. Undoubtedly, it will repay a great deal of study. I have great pleasure in commending it to the Senate for its attention and indicating the general thrust of what we do and do not support. Finally, I hope that in the replacement of Professor Ovington, who is shortly to retire as the Director of the ANPWS, the Commonwealth will select an officer who will continue the good work that he has commenced.

         —In October of this year during the Estimates committee hearings I, like Senator Puplick, raised the issue of when the review of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) would be presented in the Senate. It was confirmed by Professor Ovington during the Estimates committee hearings that the report was submitted at the end of March. It has been tabled in the Senate today. This report contains great praise for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, an excellent organisation with dedicated staff. In the report its staff are described as being dedicated, enthusiastic, resourceful, professional and effective. It is great that this is recognised in the review.

        In his executive summary, the special consultant to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT), Bruce McDonald, states that his prime objective has been to suggest future arrangements that will enhance Australia's overall performance in the important field of nature conservation for the benefit of future generations.
       </para>
       <para>
        A major recommendation is the consolidation of ANPWS into a broader Australian Nature Conservation Authority (ANCA), which would include the present Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and some of the functions carried out by DASETT. Consolidation of various instrumentalities into a well-resourced Australian Nature Conservation Authority would appear to be a sound move which would strengthen and coordinate nature conservation activities in Australia. Having not had time to examine the whole of the report, I would like to reserve a final decision on this recommendation. There has been insufficient time to examine this weighty report in detail. I would be very pleased to make some further comments later.
       </para>
       <para>
        A major nature conservation problem in my own State of Western Australia is conservation of the marine and coastal environments. The enormous length of the Western Australian coastline, the conservation value of much of it, and current threats proposed by tourism and mineral sands mining development give rise to grave concern. I refer specifically to Ningaloo reef which is an area of particular concern, as is the whole of the north-west coastline, and the Ashmore and Cartier reefs. If the ANPWS or the Australian Nature Conservation Authority are to be in a position to carry out their briefs to adequately protect the marine coastal environments in Western Australia, the provision of adequate resources and of professional and adequate numbers of staff is absolutely essential.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nomination of wetlands under the Ramsar Convention goes to ANPWS. I have already expressed my concern in this place that Western Australia is delaying its forwarding of nominations of wetlands. The issue that has been raised here today during Question Time by Senator Richardson with regard to the Federal Government's policy of opposing mining in national parks is welcomed by me and by very many Western Australians. It is essential that the identity of the ANCA be an independent nature conservation authority otherwise we will have the same sorts of problems that we have currently in Western Australia. Under the new structure we have the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) together with the separate National Parks Authority of Western Australia. There is widespread dissatisfaction with these bodies because in their new restructured format they appear not to be able to fully protect our conservation reserve system in Western Australia, having no real independent identity. The annual report of the Department of Conservation and Land Management contains only a very limited section on conservation areas, which is to be extremely regretted.

      <para>
       Anybody who has bothered to plough through this report would have discovered it to be probably the most interesting reading of any report that has ever been tabled in the Senate. As I said some time ago with regard to senators' financial capacities, if everybody in this place were to appear in one of these documents one would wonder how they could be allowed to run the country. That goes for all senators; I am not commenting on Ministers in particular. It is a pretty loose and certainly far from optimum situation to have before us a document such as this.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators will remember that earlier this year I attempted to move, unsuccessfully, for the setting up of a committee to look into the establishment of a code of ethics dealing with these types of matters, matters that have been raised both in the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct and the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, concerning politicians' use of their power and influence to enrich either themselves or others. On the basis of this document it is evident that none of our Ministers has done anything of the kind. The problem is that, whilst our proposal for the establishment of a committee to look into a code of ethics was rejected, at the same time elsewhere the proposal for a code of ethics has been lauded. The new Commonwealth procurement policy, of which all senators have received a copy, states:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is committed to maintaining high ethical standards in purchasing and to fair dealing with suppliers. It has agreed to the adoption of a code of ethics for the observation by all staff responsible for purchasing.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is fascinating that the Government has seen the need for the purchasing reform group to have a code of ethics but that it has not seen the need to do likewise for parliamentarians. In regard to the private sector, I refer to an article in the Australian Financial Review quoting the Managing Director of the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd, Mr John Spalvins, who talks about the need for Australian business to adopt higher moral corporate standards to avoid what Mr Spalvins termed `cowboys'. Mr Spalvins was talking about the obvious need in business for the adherence to a recognised code of ethics. Again, business is moving towards this, and politicians seem to say, `It has got nothing to do with us'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Probably one of the most extraordinary propositions is that which was put in this chamber on 10 May 1989 when Senator Richardson announced the establishment of a very important ethics committee. He said that a working group looking at techniques used in current Antarctic research projects involving live animals recommended as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . there ought to be an animal care and ethics committee on a permanent basis and that a code of practice should be developed to cover our research involving Antarctic animals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators will be aware that this committee is called the Antarctic Animal Care and Ionising Radiation Usage Ethics Committee. I wonder how many people knew it existed. It is interesting that we have seen fit to establish the Antarctic Animal Care and Ionising Radiation Usage Ethics Committee to deal with that particular matter and, at the same time, we said that we saw absolutely no reason why we should do anything about the ethical behaviour of the people governing the country.

        The Commission for the Future was established in one of those motherhood gestures involving public relations and little substance. It will be removed when the next government comes to power to save the taxpayers of Australia millions of dollars. I am not saying the Commission has done nothing; it has done plenty. It has become involved in some useful debates, but they are debates in which, in every instance, it is the proper role of other government or private sector instrumentalities, or both, to become involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The list of motherhood activities of this body-led by Mr Phillip Adams-is incredible, and includes such exciting things as our foreign affairs future. I do not know whether Senator Gareth Evans is excited about this, but Mr Phillip Adams's organisation has a program which, the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . comprises a new series of projects to examine and influence the future relationships between Australia and her major North Asian trading partners.
       </para>
       <para>
        The thought of Mr Phillip Adams playing such a role in Australia's future terrifies me. It is bad enough having Senator Gareth Evans doing it, but to have in such a role Mr Phillip Adams, who has confessed to seeking to influence our activities in this area, is totally unnerving.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has also initiated a project to map the future role and character of Australia's trade union movement-I wonder what the Department of Industrial Relations is doing. The Commission is developing enterprise skills-I wonder what the Department of Employment, Education and Training is doing. The report states:

       <para>
        . . . the Commission's wide ranging programs extended from the future of trade unions to the future of our climate, from the ageing of our population to the impact of new communications technology, and the broad demands of future education.

        This organisation really knows little about anything it is dealing with, except putting out media releases at which it is expert. It has put out an average of one every three working days, covering matters about which it appears to know very little. It is a band wagon operation. In particular, it has climbed on the greenhouse effect band wagon when many Government bodies have major contributions to make on that issue-certainly, far more coherent and effective contributions than that of the Commission for the future. The greenhouse effect is of major moment and does not deserve to be trivialised by the Commission for the Future. As I said, many millions of dollars of taxpayers' money will be saved when the new government comes to power and wipes out this self-seeking organisation.

        The idea behind the Commission for the Future, discussing today the types of problems we will probably meet tomorrow, is probably an intellectual exercise-a number of people certainly find it difficult to come to grips with it-but it is a useful one. It is only if we can look ahead and try to understand the types of problems we may meet tomorrow that we can put in place today the solutions to avoid them. It is no good blundering into the future and then trying to think up ways of overcoming the problems that are there. There are ways of looking ahead-by study, debate, consultation and the methods which the Commission for the Future has used so well over the last year. Hopefully, we in this country will be able to make a modest contribution to the solutions that we will need to the undoubted problems we will face.

        The Commission established the first Science Shop in Melbourne. It has already had an excellent response from the scientific and business communities. The Commission has managed to do something which probably no other group has managed to do so far in Australia-that is, bring together the breaking knowledge of technological and scientific discovery and the business people who want to use it as an opportunity for developing industries, and export industries, in Australia. That seems to me to be in itself a contribution that would easily satisfy the expenditure on the Commission for the Future.

        One critical comment I would make is that this year, unfortunately, we did not have any where near as many parliamentary seminars as we have had in years before. I think that is something which is most unfortunate. I found them, and I think most honourable senators and honourable members who attended them would have found them, a stimulating exercise. I would hope in the next year that program of parliamentary seminars will be renewed with vigour.

         —I would like to address a few brief remarks to the annual report of the Commission for the Future and to endorse the remarks of my colleague Senator Macklin. I think a very important part of the role of the Commission for the Future is to draw the thinking of all Australians towards the future. I think what we all too often do not do in our decision making processes in this country, in particular in this Parliament, is to think very much beyond the year-to-year basis of our budgeting and certainly the average two and a bit years basis of our Federal elections. If only for that reason the Commission would have a role.

        I deeply regret the position of the Opposition with regard to the Commission of the Future. I was in fact a participant in an Australian frontier future directions conference, of which two were held in the early 1980s. I was a participant in the second one, which came out with the recommendation that such a body should be formed in this country. I was delighted when it was formed and I remain a strong supporter of that organisation. We need our attention, our thoughts and our sights taken down the barrel a lot further than we currently have them in our day-to-day operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would say, however, that from time to time I have slight concerns that even in the Commission there is a tendency to approach the broad issues, the important issues of the future, which are addressed and which Senator Macklin has outlined, on the basis of the future having been decided and then looking just at how we tackle that future. I think sometimes there is a sense of inevitability in the approach. I encourage the Commission, through its work, to take the position of providing a range of options for the future and then encouraging public debate and thinking on questions of which of the futures that are possible this nation wishes to move towards.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also commend to my parliamentary colleagues the parliamentary seminars which are run by the Commission for the Future from time to time. They are also being run now in the Victorian Parliament and in one or two other State parliaments. As I said at the outset, I think that, of all people in the community who need a body such as the Commission for the Future, parliamentarians would have to be paramount-just the day-to-day grind keeps us very much in the present and does not take us enough into the future. Those seminars are valuable. They are not well attended, I regret to say. Perhaps I should say that they are usually taped for broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which might encourage some people, desperate for publicity, to go along.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also commend to my colleagues other programs that the Commission runs on major issues. I have attended one on community service obligations in our telecommunications area, a very useful exercise not only for a portfolio holder such as myself, but also for policy makers in general, bringing together people from a wide cross-section of the community. I have also had occasion to appear on a platform with people from the Commission, most recently the current Director of the Commission, Dr Peter Ellyard. I can say from that experience that Dr Ellyard, at least, and certainly others from the Commission with whom I have had contact are very successful in drawing people out of the present into the future in their thinking and in just their general approach to whatever goal or whatever field that we might be working towards. I commend the work of the Commission and endorse the remarks of my colleague Senator Macklin and remain one of the Commission's staunchest supporters.

         —The Housing Assistance Bill 1989 provides grants rather than low interest term loans to the States and Territories for the provision of housing stock for rental. It appropriates $1.01 billion to the States and the Northern Territory for each of the next four years. An additional $9.8m will be granted for housing assistance for young people, and $14.8m for mortgage relief payments. The Bill effectively allocates three-quarters of all moneys to public housing and a quarter to rental assistance and mortgage relief. It will be in effect for 10 years and will appropriate this amount of money over the next four-year period.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The coalition recognises the absolute need to provide rental housing in the public sector for people who cannot necessarily provide themselves with housing. We believe that the emphasis should be on placing people in their own homes and that assistance should be given in the form of rent subsidies and mortgage relief payments. The Opposition will support this Bill, but will move a second reading amendment condemning the Government for its policies that are causing undue hardship for hundreds of thousands of home owners and would-be home owners in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's policies are making it very difficult for those who are now receiving housing assistance to bridge the gap to housing self-sufficiency. The emphasis of this Bill is to assist public rental housing. The Opposition would rather see people being assisted into their own homes. The coalition believes that public housing administered by a public sector does not give the best value for money because a good percentage of the money is chewed up by administration. As I said before, we recognise the need to house people who are unable to provide themselves with private housing.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a problem with this Bill that has been taken up by Senator Tambling on behalf of the Northern Territory Government. The Northern Territory will be dramatically affected by Commonwealth funding being distributed on a per capita basis. Some assurance has been given by the Government that the Northern Territory's share will be looked after and maintained. In 1988-89 the Northern Territory's share of the `nominated' funds was $43.8m. However, under the new per capita arrangements this amount will decrease to approximately $3m per annum. I know that Senator Collins has given some undertaking that he will see that the Northern Territory will not be adversely affected. I do not know how he will do that in respect of the legislation that is before us now, unless he has some sort of commitment from the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples).
       </para>
       <para>
        The Northern Territory has the largest public housing sector in Australia-22 per cent of dwellings are public sector housing compared with 5 per cent nationally. The Northern Territory also has a much younger population which puts an additional strain on demand for new and lower cost housing. There are some problems in respect of the number of consultations between the States and Territory governments. I believe that some States have not signed the agreement which is before us today. The Northern Territory Government was not aware of what the new agreement would mean to it in dollars and cents and has continually voiced its opposition to this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real problem facing Australia's accommodation seekers is the Government's one-tiered, irresponsible, high interest rates policies that are putting an unbelievable strain on young home buyers, people seeking both private and public rental housing, and families paying increased mortgages just to keep a roof over their heads. While the appropriation of this money is commendable, it is really not addressing the main issue; that is, that housing interest rates are currently at 17 per cent. That is unaffordable by most standards. All indicators prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the Government's housing policy is in disarray.

         —`In tatters' Senator Brownhill says, and he is quite correct. I will cite a few statistics: in October this year, 11,460 housing and dwelling approvals were granted compared with 15,312 in October last year. This represents a net loss of nearly 25 per cent of homes. In September this year the number of private sector houses commenced dropped by 17.3 per cent over the number of commencements for September 1988. In real figures, this means that in September 1989 only 25,420 private sector dwellings were commenced, compared with 31,870 for the same period last year. That is a net loss of 6,450 homes. Another indicator is the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation which says that since March 1989 the number of housing loans in arrears has steadily increased. The Corporation's annual report points out that recent borrowers face repayments of large mortgages at high interest rates against a background of steady or falling values.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We can cite statistics in the Senate, but they do not give the true picture of the hardships facing many of Australia's young families. The pressure on families of meeting monthly commitments on the family home is resulting in many broken marriages and unhappiness. Buyers are having difficulty in meeting their payments because of high interest rates. I wish to cite some figures, which are quite frightening, from a report of the Housing Industry Association. The report lists the average first home costs in the capital cities and the incomes needed to service first home loans. The average cost of a first home in Sydney is $139,200. One would need an income of $64,100 to service a loan for such a house. That is mind-boggling. A home that one could purchase in Sydney for $139,000 would be a fairly modest home. I think it would be a worker's dwelling. This indicates that the Government's interest rate policy is crippling the home buyers of Australia. In Melbourne the average cost of a first home is $135,000, and an income of $62,200 would be needed to service a first home loan there. In Brisbane the average cost of a first home is $97,500. A more modest income of $44,900 would be needed to service a home loan there, but even that puts home ownership out of the reach of most young home buyers. Very few non-professional young people would have an income-even a joint income-of $64,100, which is required to service a first home loan in Sydney.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we can say truthfully that this Government's high interest rate policy has put home ownership beyond the reach not only of average Australians but of wealthy Australians. The amount of $64,100 is a professional salary, the salary of a high office. It is not an income that a tradesman, an office worker or a bank officer would normally enjoy. It is more in line with the income of a doctor, a solicitor or a barrister.

         —High ranking public servants may be able to afford to buy a home in Sydney, but it is beyond the capacity of a working man or woman, or family. This Government has neglected its base support again. It was elected with the support of the working people. It has taken its support away from those people, its grassroot support, its heartland. It has taken away the right of those people to own a home in Australia. That is an indictment of the Government in which Senator Cook, who is in the chamber, serves.

        The income needed to service a first home loan in Adelaide is $41,000. The average cost of a first home there is $89,200. Again, it is beyond the reach of most working men and women. Young married people know that they have to have two incomes before they can even begin to think about owning their own home. That puts a strain on people who want to have a family. People are having families later in life because they just cannot afford to get out of the work force. It is a strain on them. When they have children, the children are put into creches, into kindergartens, and into child-care centres at a very young age which, again, puts a strain on the families.
       </para>
       <para>
        When Labor came into office seven years ago it took first home buyers 19 per cent of their average weekly earnings to service an average housing loan. In June 1985 that average had jumped to 25.6 per cent of average weekly earnings. Now that figure has skyrocketed to an unbelievable, almost unreachable, figure of 31.5 per cent of average weekly earnings. Savings bank interest rates for housing loans reached a staggering 17 per cent this year. Building society rates are slightly higher, I believe. It is beyond the capacity of many people to meet their commitments. These statistics do not show the real picture of the strain on thousands of young Australians who are struggling to meet their mortgage repayments or who are locked out of home ownership and have either to live with their parents or pay exorbitant rent. The legacy of this Government to young Australian families after its seven years in office is a choice of living with parents, living in flats or in caravans. It is an indictment of the Labor Government's housing policy.

        There has been no improvement in the amount being lent for housing. It has been steadily dropping for the last 12 months. In September last year almost $2,000m was lent for housing. This September, the last month for which I could find figures, only $1,300m was lent. There is no improvement in sight for either the private sector or the public sector. We are going backwards, despite the fact that $1.01 billion will be allocated in this Bill. In June last year 195,370 applicants were on the waiting list for public housing, and only 23 per cent of applicants are allocated accommodation each year. So last June 195,000 people were waiting to get into the public housing sector. So not only is the private housing industry in disarray; the public sector, too, is unable to cope with the huge demand that the high interest rates are causing. Many people who could normally afford private housing at realistic rates of interest are being forced into public housing, swelling the queues waiting for public housing.

        I do not believe that we can debate the Government's policy on housing without debating Australia's homeless youth. That situation is even worse. It gives me no pleasure to bring up that subject. In the 1987 campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that by 1990 there would be no child living in poverty. That is a noble aspiration for anyone to have, but the Prime Minister has not delivered on that promise. In fact, his promise has been a huge disaster. The facts, as estimated in the Burdekin report-the report of the National Inquiry into Homeless children-are that at least 8,500 children aged 12 to 15 years, and 17,000 aged 15 to 17 years, are homeless in any one year. The Burdekin report goes on to say that they are conservative figures and that there is more likely to be between 50,000 and 70,000 children who are homeless. The Human Rights Equal Opportunity Commission report of February 1989 entitled Our Homeless Children said that at least 20,000 to 25,000 young Australians were homeless, with the real figure being as high as 70,000. The Burdekin report and the Human Rights Commission report both confirm that figure. That gives some indication that those figures are on line. Both reports went on to say that, because those children were so young and lacked the basic resources, they were often driven to crime and prostitution. I do not believe anyone, whether they be in opposition, government or, the Australian Democrats who sit on the crossbenches, can take any comfort from those statistics.

        The children on our streets are getting younger, yet the Government's policies are not reaching the majority of those who are suffering. The Government's policies are not reaching the people that are seeking private housing and those seeking public housing, or homeless children. So everywhere one looks, the Government's housing policies have been a failure. In every sector the Government has not fulfilled its commitment. I do not believe that there is any area of government policy in which the Government has failed so badly, so miserably, as in the area of housing. With record interest rates of 17 per cent to 18 per cent, on average, people need to earn $64,000 a year in order to service the repayments on a first home. How many people earn $64,000 a year? A very slim proportion. The public sector waiting lists are growing; only 23 per cent of people are having their needs met. The Opposition will support this legislation, but is forced to move an amendment which criticises and condemns the Government for its failed policies on all sectors of the housing industry. I therefore move:

        The simple facts are that by the turn of the century in 10 years time more than 500,000 Australian families will be sharing their homes with at least two other families. That means that 9 per cent of the population will be living in shared accommodation. In real terms nearly 86,000 people were on public housing rental lists in New South Wales alone this time last year, and the situation has only improved marginally. Home loan repayments have jumped, on average, by $250 per month. The goal of every Australian to own their own home is nothing more than an illusory, impossible dream-and we all know how that song goes. A Sydney Morning Herald poll earlier this year revealed that nearly 68 per cent of those people polled believed that the dream of a house on a quarter-acre block of land was no longer a reasonable expectation. Is it any wonder? One has only to take a drive through the new housing estates or look at the land and house packages being offered and one's head spins. I suggest that if any honourable senators in this chamber were trying to buy their first home, they would have difficulty affording anything at all reasonable.

        While this Government can hold housing summits that do little more than massage enormous and ever-growing egos, the reality is that average working couples are condemned to living in rental accommodation for the majority of their working lives, and it has been established by statistics that couples delay starting families, as Senator Boswell said, because they simply cannot afford to lose one income. That is not a very good position for this lucky country of Australia to be in. This country is obviously not so lucky for those people who want to buy their first homes. We cannot really criticise the Government's housing policy because this Government really does not have a decent housing policy to criticise. An interesting paper was recently put out, in October, by the Real Estate Institute of Australia Ltd entitled Australia's Declining Housing Affordability. I quote from one part of the paper-and I think this is really where the problem with housing lies-which says:

       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's taxation system serves to lower national savings, affordability and the efficiency with which the existing stock of houses is used. The greater an individual's savings, the greater the tax liability. The ability to save is an important factor in housing affordability. Savings which contribute to a housing deposit are generally made from after-tax income. This ability to save is affected by the fact that average income earners today pay a higher marginal rate of tax than did average income earners 10 years ago. This is compounded further by the government's unfavourable treatment of interest earned on savings deposits. Therefore those struggling to raise a deposit are faced with double taxation on the income contributing to this deposit.
       </para>
       <para>
        In essence Australia's taxation system taxes savings and encourages individuals to spend. As a result a critical balance of payments problem has developed through the nation borrowing at a far greater rate to compensate for the lack of national savings needed to finance consumer expenditure. The government's response has been to tighten the supply of money and thus force up its cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        Inefficiency in the housing sector, manifested in cyclical ups and downs in the industry, is a direct result of this policy. Typically when interest rates increase, the borrowing capacity of potential first home buyers is lowered, which limits their access to the sales market. This has a ripple effect through the industry as home owners wanting to upgrade are unable to sell their homes. The result is decreased sales and a downturn in the housing and construction industry, as has been the case in 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The lack of continuity in activity leads to periods of under-utilisation followed by periods of high demand and related cost increases. During periods of under-utilisation there is difficulty in providing a stable environment for the training of workers and the formation of skills. As a result, apprentices are retrenched which causes a lack of skilled workers. This becomes critical when housing demand is again released on the relaxing of monetary policy. As there is a lack of supply of skilled workers, rising labour costs and shortage of new housing stock results. These forces act to bring about another boom in house prices, leading to affordability problems for the potential first home buyer.

        This Government is just lurching from one crisis to another, trying to convince the Australian public that high interest rates are good for them. Senator Richardson was quoted the other day as saying that he believed the Government had not sold its message on high interest rates too well. I would be very interested to know how he or anyone else in the Government can possibly put any positive light on high interest rates. If Senator Richardson can convince the Australian public that high interest rates are good for them, I suggest he is wasting his time in this chamber; he could be making a fortune selling holes out of doughnuts and ice to Eskimos if he could sell that to the Australian public.

        The Liberal and National parties, on the other hand, have a very workable housing policy, based on an acknowledgment that secure, appropriate and affordable housing is a basic need of all. We believe that a home provides a stable family environment, a share in the nation's wealth and a source of personal security. But all this Government has done is push more people into State-owned housing. We are going to reverse this policy by giving priority to home ownership assistance. We will assist with mortgage repayments, thus enhancing the affordability of houses for qualifying first home buyers. We will improve and better target the home deposit scheme and the first home owners scheme. We are going to encourage public housing tenants to buy their homes. Despite what the Prime Minister has said about homeless and poor youth, we believe that they do exist and they do need help. To that end we will continue to enhance programs for transitional, crisis accommodation.

        Above all, the Liberal and National parties coalition will provide a stable, healthy economic climate which will encourage greater investment in housing and make achievable once again the great Australian dream for all Australians: the dream of owning their own home. This Government has robbed its citizens of one of their basic rights: to own their own home easily and affordably. The Opposition has pledged to restore the right to affordable home ownership.

         —The Housing Assistance Bill 1989 provides an opportunity to canvass many of the issues surrounding housing policy and its implementation. At this stage of the session, to canvass all of those questions does not seem to be a very responsible approach, but I take this opportunity to make some general and specific remarks about this legislation, which implements the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. We have to look at this legislation in the framework of what is happening with housing. In this debate something has already been said about that, but I simply want to place on the record the Australian Democrats' concern at the state of housing and the impact that it is having on people in our community. It is getting increasingly difficult for people to become home owners, high interest rates and high home prices being factors involved in that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We will not be supporting the second reading amendment from the Opposition because it is a major concern of the Democrats that more emphasis needs to be placed on the provision of public housing. In an environment where it is more difficult for people to get into home ownership and where private rentals are being pushed up, public housing becomes an even more critical factor in the overall housing picture. It is quite disturbing when one looks at what is happening in that area. In my own State of Victoria just last month a rental report, which is a quarterly review of the availability and cost of private rental property, demonstrated that tenants are paying up to 75 per cent of their weekly pay in rent. When that is put against a benchmark of 25 per cent, the sort of benchmark which is at an acceptable level of household income to be paid on housing, we see that that is an unacceptably high level.
       </para>
       <para>
        An example was given on the release of this report by the Victorian Minister for Housing of a single pensioner parent with one child renting a two-bedroom property at a medium rental of $145 per week. When the length of the queues for public housing and the length of time people are waiting for public housing are considered, one realises that that single pensioner parent with one child is not an isolated case. It ought to be a matter of deep regret to all of us that those sorts of situations are occurring in our community.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those people who are attempting to get into home ownership, the survey of the Real Estate Institute of Australia reported in September in the Australian Financial Review showed that average repayments on new housing loans had reached 35.8 per cent of average family income in the three months leading up to 30 June of this year. That affordability ratio was up from 33.6 per cent in the March quarter and 28.4 per cent in June last year. So it is not just people in private rental who are above that acceptable level of 25 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1988-89 household expenditure survey showed that the proportion of family income devoted to housing had risen in the past five years at the expense of other basics such as food. That survey showed that the proportion of total household expenditure devoted to housing costs had risen from 12.8 per cent in 1984 to 14.2 per cent; the proportion spent on food fell from 19.7 per cent to 18.7 per cent as those higher housing costs absorbed more income; and other items, such as clothing, recreation, and so on, also showed falls.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is this trend of increasing pressure of housing costs on the lives of families in all kinds of housing that is of enormous concern to the Democrats. The causes are complex, of course, but the pressures of interest rates and of the Government reducing consistently over the years its own outlays of expenditure on public services, such as public housing, are major factors in the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are dealing with legislation on the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. The States have been hard hit by the Government's economic rationalist approach, and its reduction in spending in order to provide Budget surpluses. Let us not forget that the picture that I have drawn has to be seen against an economy whose surplus is over $9 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one looks at the pressure in the public housing area, reflected largely at State level, because the responsibility for provision is at State level, one sees other problems which are arising. My own State of Victoria is faced with a very high level of arrears among its public housing tenants. Just this week a report has suggested that there ought to be a system of direct debiting of pensions in order to make sure that public housing rents are paid. I join with those organisations which, in this morning's newspapers in Victoria, have expressed concern about such an approach. The director of the Victorian Council of Social Service, Rob Hudson, has referred to such direct debiting as `a dangerous option' which would `compromise tenants' flexibility to cope with financial emergencies'. Clearly becoming indebted for rent is an indication of a financial crises. While such a system might be deemed to be voluntary, Rob Hudson points out that in the context of rental arrears, where people have no effective choice, it is not so voluntary. Glenn Foard of the Public Tenants Union has said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . direct debiting of pensions to pay public housing rents was not the answer, because it did not deal with the problem of low incomes.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot talk about housing and the people who are hardest hit without looking at income support issues. Whilst the Government has made some moves in the direction of income support for low income people-and families in particular-while we have single pensioners paying 75 per cent of their weekly income in rent it is clear that those measures have not been adequate and that much more needs to be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) in its pre-Budget submission this year devoted a great deal of attention to housing. It pointed out that high prices and high interest rates drive up rents, adding to the overall housing crisis, along with high interest rates for people who are purchasing homes. Nearly one in four private tenants have incomes below the poverty line after paying for housing. Rents and mortgage repayments have pushed hundreds of thousands of Australians into poverty. I draw this fact to the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Premiers and the relevant Ministers who will be meeting next month in what the Prime Minister insists is not a summit on poverty but which is certainly a meeting to address the questions of poverty at State and National level. Without addressing this issue, they would not be addressing one of the key factors that is driving people into poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much can be said about the causes of the housing crisis-high interest rates; pent-up demand; the skewing into speculation largely created by the reintroduction of negative gearing, which was opposed only by the Australian Democrats in this place and which led to overinvestment; as well as heavy investment in owner-occupied housing; scarcity of land for new housing, scarcity of skilled labour and materials; and under-investment in public and community housing by governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to the legislation. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) has been quoted as saying that the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is a key part of the Government's housing and social justice commitments and would help alleviate poverty among low income earners. Would that that were the case. When one looks at funding under the new agreement the picture is not nearly as rosy as that. It does not meet the need outlined by ACOSS for increased government funding for public housing and therefore cannot meet the problems of housing-induced poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one looks at the actual amount being spent on public housing in relative terms and in real terms across the period of this agreement and the life of this Government, the picture is not particularly encouraging. Total government funds for housing to the States in 1989-90 have been reduced in real terms by 39 per cent since 1986-87. This year sees the third consecutive real reduction in total funds. The forward commitment by the Government each year for four years, commencing in 1989-90, will mean a reduction in real terms of 18.2 per cent over that period. By 1992-93, on the basis of the current forward commitment, Commonwealth funds to the States will have decreased in real terms by 50 per cent since 1986-87. The real level of funds in 1989-90 is 11 per cent less than the real level of funds in the first full year of the Fraser Liberal Government in 1976-77. In 1992-93, on the basis of the current forward commitment, Commonwealth funds to the States will have decreased in real terms to the average level of funds provided by the Fraser Liberal Government from 1976-77 to 1982-83.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a regrettable situation in the view of the Australian Democrats. That is a minimal commitment, one that barely matches that of the Fraser Liberal Government and represents a decrease over a long period of time. We are faced with a government which says, as the Minister has said, that housing is a major part of its social justice strategy and which, as Senator Boswell has said, is led by a Prime Minister who has made a commendable commitment to eliminating child poverty. But we know that housing is pushing hundreds of thousands of Australians below the poverty line.
       </para>
       <para>
        The picture that we see before us in this new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is far from rosy. The Democrats and people concerned with public housing and its tenants have other concerns about this legislation. One is the treatment of rental rebates. The agreement resolves in a particular way the increasing rental rebate bills of State housing authorities and establishes a financial viability of public housing but does not incorporate the principle of Commonwealth responsibility for rental rebates, which has been up until now a feature of Commonwealth-State housing agreements. I say that is a principle because the Commonwealth responsibility has not always been met. But in this case the principle has actually been removed-not incorporated-in this 1989 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rental rebates are the difference between what the tenants pay and the costs of public housing-such as rates, maintenance and other service charges, administration, loan repayments, depreciation, bad debts and so on. The rebate issue is resolved in this Bill by shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States. In essence, the Commonwealth is meeting only part of its income responsibilities. In this way the legislation will make it far more difficult for the State housing authorities and community organisations to insist that the Commonwealth meet its income responsibilities to pay for the full cost of rental rebates.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also concerned about the question of assistance plans in this package. I have a series of amendments to move in the committee stage which we believe are necessary to ensure that the Commonwealth-State plans are made public and that the States and the Commonwealth consult community organisations in the process of developing Commonwealth-State plans. The amendments are designed to bring in the consumers of public housing and to make sure that consultation with community organisations is a part of the process of the development of the Commonwealth-State housing assistance plans. We also have some concerns about rentals. We are concerned that the legislation requires the States to charge the minimum amount of market rental. We really believe that charging rentals above market rentals is contrary to the detailed provisions of the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. That remains a concern for us in this legislation. We would prefer to see the rent on each dwelling determined by a set of principles which would mean that rentals would not exceed the market rental on the dwelling. We do not believe that that is covered in this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have alluded to our concerns about the funds available in this new Commonwealth-State housing agreement. The new 1989 Commonwealth-State housing agreement represents a major philosophical shift within the Government and, therefore, within the Australian Labor Party. The 1984 agreement was based on promoting public housing as an alternative to home ownership. This agreement seems to be based on the welfare model of public housing. It is concerned with tightening the reins and ensuring that public housing is targeted to low income households. This is consistent with the Government's very strong targeting approach in its welfare system. Other social and economic forces which I have mentioned have `welfarised' public housing. This is now endorsed by the underlying philosophic and policy change.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are concerned that a feature of this legislation is that a larger proportion of the funding than was previously available is to be made available for assistance for home purchase. That does not mean that we do not believe that the purchase of a home is not a desirable goal. As I have outlined, over the whole period which is dealt with by this agreement we are looking at a 50 per cent funding cut for what is an agreement on public housing. We are very disturbed that the pressure which has come from the States to free up more of these funds for home ownership has been at least to a degree successful. We are concerned because that is a further erosion of funding which is specifically and directly targeted to public housing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until we get a genuine approach to public housing we cannot accept the welfare model totally because it fails to recognise that housing has a number of functions in our community. It is part of the transition between the various stages of peoples' lives. It also fails to recognise that we have an increasing need in our community for single persons or couples with no children to have a type of accommodation which can be very adequately and efficiently provided through a public housing sector, if we have a genuine public housing sector and one which is not `welfarised'. We regret the lack of a strong commitment to a genuine public housing development. We regret the cutbacks over time in funding in this area. We have to ensure that there is community consultation in the process of the continuation and development of this Commonwealth-State housing agreement and we will move amendments to that effect in the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, we are not supporting the Opposition's second reading amendment because it complains about too much emphasis on public housing, which is quite the reverse of our view of this legislation. It does refer to a confrontationist approach with the States. I have already said that in some ways at least the States have had an undue influence in respect to aspects of this matter. I am aware that the responsible South Australian Minister, and the South Australian Council of Social Services, has pointed to some particular deficiencies for that State in the new agreement. They are very concerned that a reduction over five years will reduce the availability of housing for the most disadvantaged in that State. I do not believe it is the case that there has been a confrontationist approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we have some sympathy with the third aspect of the Opposition's second reading amendment which complains about the high interest rate regime imposed on the community, having sat in this chamber hour after hour and having heard Senator Stone, the finance spokesperson for the Opposition, insist that the interest rate regime will be the same upon a change of Government, it will be very difficult for us to endorse even that part of the motion on the basis that it does not have any particular foundation as far as the Opposition is concerned. While we do not oppose this legislation we put on record those particular concerns that we have with it.

As is not obvious from the remarks of many honourable senators who have participated in the second reading debate, this Bill is supported by all parties and is expected to have a smooth passage. Nonetheless, a number of speakers have chosen to use the second reading debate to make what they regard as condemnatory remarks of the Government and to beat their chests about what they might do were they in Government to improve the lot of people who rely on public housing in Australia.

The first comment I make is that the historic and fundamental thing that distinguishes the Australian Labor Party from the conservative parties in this country, or indeed in other countries of the world where that parliamentary representation appears, is that the Labor Party has pioneered the concept of public housing. The Labor Party did that, given its basic commitment to equality of opportunity, its commitment to the fact that people who are poor, who are low paid and who are in straitened circumstances should have access to good quality housing and not be discriminated against because of that. It is a legitimate charge to the public purse to see that the taxation dollar is recycled to meet their needs. That commitment fundamentally and philosophically draws a line of distinction between us and the conservative parties who, in their open honesty on this philosophical difference, have pointed to the need to encourage private initiative and to encourage people to find the wherewithal themselves.

        True it is that in the third version of the Opposition's housing policy, brought down by the third or fourth Opposition housing spokesperson since the 1987 election, the Opposition paid lip service to public housing and rental assistance but, consistent with its philosophical mould, put together a proposal which is uncosted and vague but which aims at moving people out of public housing and into owner occupied housing without explaining how low income earners can afford to pay the types of mortgages that would be attendant on that move. If they could not pay it, they would be left God knows where.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make it clear that the Government rejects Senator Boswell's motion. Our commitment to meeting the housing needs of the Australian population has been clearly demonstrated during our period of office. Our policies have been effectively targeted during the last 6 1/2 years of our period in government. Our policies have provided housing assistance which is distributed equitably between the public and the private rental assistance sectors, the home ownership area and crisis accommodation. Commonwealth assistance for public housing has more than doubled in real terms under this Government with over $1 billion being provided to the States this financial year. Over the last six years an estimated 260,000 households have been accommodated in public housing compared with 194,000 over the previous six years of the Opposition's period in government.
       </para>
       <para>
        During our period in office an estimated additional 82,000 rental dwellings have been provided compared with 47,000 over the previous six years of the Opposition period of government. Approximately $480m will be provided for rent assistance this year compared with $160m provided in the last year of the previous Liberal Government. An estimated 92,000 home loans to low income households have been provided through the Commonwealth-State housing agreement over the last six years compared with a mere 59,000 over the previous six years. I can go on and make a starkly contrasting analysis of what we have done compared with what the Opposition did in its last period in office.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that over 340,000 households have been assisted into home ownership under the first home owners scheme since its inception in 1983 at a total obligation of over $1.45 billion. In 1985 we established the supported accommodation assistance program to provide short term accommodation and support for those who were homeless and in crisis. In short, if one compares the indicators-not the words, not the brave promises but, indeed, the performances; what in fact happens and whether ordinary people get an opportunity-one sees that we have outstripped and doubled or trebled the performance of the Opposition in almost every area. It is not what people say but what people do which is the real indication of their priorities. On this set of statistics, there is no doubt that this Government's priority has been to meet our philosophical objective-the one I spoke of earlier-and provide for low income earners and people in need public housing stock which can meet that demand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Predictably, the Opposition has taken this opportunity to berate us about home mortgages and the level of interest rates. I think it was Senator Powell who drew attention to the fact that the Opposition in this chamber over several debates has indicated that if it gains office it is unlikely that there will be any change in interest rates. That is not Andrew Peacock's view; I know that he has promised the Australian people that he will bring interest rates down. But it seems to be Senator Stone's view. It is certainly Dr Hewson's view and I heard John Howard say something about it the other day. So the question is whether one believes the Leader or the hard economic rationalists within the Opposition. What is true is that the Opposition has no panacea because of the overheating of the Australian economy and the need to keep restraints on money supply. Therefore, while I understand that this occasion would present those opposite with an opportunist possibility of exploiting the high level of home interest rates-something that we do not enjoy and do not like, but have to endure-their criticisms are made simply from an exploitative point of view and not from a point of view of delivering anything real or important.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that Senator Powell has foreshadowed that she will move an amendment at the committee stage. Unfortunately the Government will not accept her amendment. But when she brings it forward I will give a clear statement of the Government's view, which is in sympathy with the sentiments of her amendment although we cannot in practice reach the detail she proposes to insert into the Housing Assistance Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

       <para>
        These amendments, in substance, are designed to provide for community consultation regarding Commonwealth-State plans. The amendments are designed to ensure that Commonwealth-State plans are made public and that the States and the Commonwealth consult community organisations in the process of developing Commonwealth-State plans. The Australian Democrats believe that the consumers of public housing-public tenants and their advocates-applicants for tenancy, consumers of housing generally and community agencies have a right to be involved in plans affecting their lives or the lives of their clients. That general principle is one to which I adhere and I am adhering to it more and more strongly the longer I stay in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find that many political and bureaucratic decisions that are made are far distant from, and show a lack of understanding of, the genuine needs of recipients of welfare services and public services generally. I think this is one of the major negatives in our Commonwealth system. Maybe it is because Canberra is where it is. But I think that wherever the national capital was located we would get a centralisation of thought and experience. Perhaps it would be better if our national capital were situated in an area with slums, with inadequate basic public housing, with high-rise concrete jungles, or whatever. Canberra is a very attractive place in which to live. The more time we spend here-and, goodness knows, we are spending too much time here now!-the more distant we can get from the real needs and concerns of people, particularly people in some of our heavily populated inner urban areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, there are public housing needs in all sorts of communities, not least isolated rural communities. Before I came to this place I had experience of a town in a dairying area where the butter factory had been closed down and the factory houses had been sold off. All the sole parents were moved there. The mums and the kids slowly went mad and, in some cases, became violent, each against the other. That is another example of how distant decision makers can be from the client group. Here I am speaking about consumers, but many bodies in the community who are advocates for the consumers and assist people to become public housing tenants have a clear understanding of the needs of those people and put quite considerable pressure on governments in making those decisions. Quite overtly, I am attempting to put those sorts of people in a better position to put more pressure on governments to get their priorities right.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not saying, by way of this amendment, that there has been no consultation; I certainly understand that there has been. I am simply saying that I, and the Australian Democrats, would like to see-as would the people I have spoken of-the need for consultation entrenched in the legislation. It seems only a very few hours since I made this same comment when speaking to another piece of legislation. I said then that the major motivation for that legislation was the prospect of an upcoming election. I think I said to the same Minister-the Minister for resources (Senator Cook)-that it is all right to have him sitting here making commitments, which I have no doubt that he will, and representing a government which has consulted, I have no doubt that it will with some considerable justification. But we are faced with a democratic system and this Government, whether at this election or at another, will not always be in government and the attitude of an alternative government just may be different. We did hear Senator Boswell saying a lot about housing, so perhaps an alternative government might not be as bad as we think it would be. But I think it is important that these sorts of rights, this sort of access and this sort of consultation is entrenched in legislation; hence I commend these amendments to the Committee.

         -I rise to put the Opposition's view on Senator Powell's amendments. The Opposition cannot support these amendments, although we are sympathetic to what Senator Powell is saying. She wishes to set up a housing advisory council which is to be made up of community housing organisations and public tenants. We believe that a government is elected to govern. It makes the decisions and ultimately wears those decisions at the ballot box. If it makes the wrong decisions, as this Government has on housing, it will pay the penalty when it goes to an election. While we have sympathy with Senator Powell's amendments, we certainly cannot support them for those reasons.

       <para>
        I appreciate that that is not as tightly drawn as the amendment Senator Powell wants us to carry. Hers is more detailed and specifies procedures. However, I think it does pick up the essence of what she wants and provides some flexibility in the administration of that provision by the Minister or the department in order to ensure that proper consultation does occur. Might I also add that in anticipation of Senator Powell's amendment the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Peter Staples, has advised me of a statement that he would like me to put down which I think meets the commitment of this Government to the consultations that are desired. The statement reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank Senator Powell for her proposed amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the Commonwealth has shown considerable support for community consultation, particularly in housing, the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement under this Bill is the result of extensive discussion and heavy negotiation with the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The renegotiation of the agreement to meet the purpose of this amendment would involve extensive delays in the implementation of the Agreement and hold up the expenditure of some $310m for housing people in need.

        Accordingly the Government regrets that it is not possible to accept the amendment.

        —by leave-Mr President, I wish to make a personal explanation. Yesterday on the 2CN morning program and in this chamber today Senator Hill made a series of outrageous allegations regarding the Government's conduct of its policy on China and my alleged role in it. None of these allegations is true. Senator Hill has not had the courtesy to direct any question to me on this matter. His allegations in no specific order of merit are as follows: the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) instructed me to meet with the Chinese Ambassador Zhang Zai-that is not true; the Prime Minister instructed me to tell him that the Government had changed its China policy-that is not true; and I had told Zhang Zai that relations would return to normal-that is not true.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The facts are that in my capacity as chairman of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Committee and as Minister for Resources I accepted a longstanding invitation to a lunch with the Ambassador on Monday 27 November. Other senior Ministers and officials of the Government have had similar meetings with the Ambassador. Such exchanges are quite normal and in no way are proscribed by the terms of the Australian policy towards China announced on 13 July. In fact, that policy was premised on keeping open appropriate channels of communication. The Prime Minister did not instruct me to meet the Ambassador. The meeting took place at the invitation of Zhang Zai. The Prime Minister could not have instructed me to inform Zhang Zai of any change in Asian policy towards China because there has not been a change in policy since Senator Evans's statement on 13 July. Cabinet is currently expected to address the issue of a review of Australian policy on China in January.
      </para>
      <para>
       I at no time told Zhang Zai that there would be a return to normal relations. On the contrary, I told him that members of the Government had been deeply affected by the massacre in Tiananmen Square and that it would be difficult to normalise relations. I reported on the meeting to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. That ministerial correspondence is of a confidential nature and I have no intention of releasing it. I did not write to the Prime Minister. For Senator Hill to paint cloak and dagger scenarios in which I am supposed to have delivered major policy changes under the counter to an ambassador represents a gall even Le Carre would find staggering. Any attempt by Senator Hill to portray me as a 1989 version of Henry Kissinger engaging in ping-pong diplomacy in Canberra is arrant nonsense. If I were Senator Hill I would in future treat the source of his information with the complete contempt it so obviously deserves. It does neither himself nor his Party-nor, indeed, the Senate-any service by peddling such arrant nonsense.

        The last time we were dealing with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988 I moved the Australian Democrats amendment No. 2, to insert a new proposed section 53a. I have now moved our amendments relating to clause 68 and clause 109, which were circulated together with amendment No. 2. They relate to how to vote cards. As they all refer to the same item, it would seem to me to make more sense in terms of time that we deal with them together. These amendments deal with how to vote cards. As I said in the committee stage last time, we have been compelled to raise this yet again and, fortuitously, there have been two State elections since then. In each of those elections I and other members of my Party found-and I think Senator Haines could verify this in terms of the South Australian election, for which she handed out how to vote cards as well-that pressure is now coming from people attending the booths asking why we are continuing to waste so much paper on these cards.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said last time, in a Federal election probably no fewer than 80 million pieces of paper are handed out-an extraordinary amount-on one day. There is a simple and straightforward device to deal with this which in no way takes away the rights of political parties, or the rights of members of the public to see how the parties would wish them to vote, and that is having the how to vote cards under perspex in the polling booths.
       </para>
       <para>
        The attempt to stop the how to vote card is nothing new in the Australian context. As I said before, section 246 of the Tasmanian Electoral Act specifies that the distribution of voting material, such as how to vote cards, is banned on polling day. I worked out the wastage involved and found that 150 hectares of forests and 300 tonnes of paper are used-something we could avoid by using other methods.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that during the last Queensland election campaign the now Premier, Mr Goss, pledged on a radio program that I was on to prevent the future distribution of how to vote cards and opted for the identical method that I have been suggesting-that is, that how to vote cards be put in the polling booths under perspex. We will see Queensland follow the example of Tasmania on this issue. It is a pity that the Australian Labor Party in Canberra could not have got the jump on its Queensland colleagues and moved before them to do exactly the same thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I am suggesting would satisfy all the demands for information that are made. This Parliament has led the way in providing additional information for voters on polling day. This is the Parliament which moved to place the names of political parties next to the names on the ballot paper, so that an individual voter could not be misled by how to vote cards or other literature that was handed out, and could easily see for himself which particular candidate had which particular affiliation. Within Australia we have other innovations such as that in the Northern Territory of having photographs on the ballot paper to assist the voters-particularly Aboriginal voters-in the identification of candidates.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have been about is certainly pursued here, and the proposition I am putting is not a new one. As I say, it has already been followed in the hard form in Tasmania, and in the softer version in South Australia, where how to vote cards may be displayed in the polling booth although the State has not yet moved to the point of banning how to vote cards. Undoubtedly, this issue will become much more of a concern to people on an election day, when the heightened environmental awareness of the public is such that they will want to make sure that not only do politicians preach about these types of things but, in an area in which political parties have some influence-probably about the only one-they take a major step for conservation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other point that should be raised is the somewhat extraordinary exercise that we now put electors through in most polling booths of running the gauntlet. It occurs in most cities around Australia. People need four hands to be able to grasp all the papers that are thrust at them. That does not encourage the type of thing that people have spoken about in this place, but the complete opposite. We are not encouraging the voter to make a decision prior to going to the polls based on information but, rather, we are encouraging impulse buying at the gate itself. As long as one political party does this, the dictates of the electoral system are such that everybody feels obliged to do it. Hence, we need a legislative base to deal with this. I appeal to the Labor Party and the Opposition parties to consider this and take a step which, I think, would be extremely well received-certainly by the conservationists around Australia and also by the average voter who is sick and tired of gauntlet running on election day.

         —The Opposition will not support these amendments. I have never heard such a feeble attempt to do two things at the one time. Firstly, the amendments seek to deny the elementary freedom of speech for people who want to be out on polling day, giving potential electors pieces of paper advising them how to vote. Secondly, they are a masquerade of being concerned about trees, paper and the electorate, when the truth is that this is a plea from a party which has no chance of manning every gate on every polling booth, and which is going to make sure that, once again, the public picks up the cost of the shortfall that the Australian Democrats have in attempting to get their how to vote literature into the hands of the maximum number of electors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The specific regime put forward by Senator Macklin is as follows. Proposed clause 206a (1) states that a poster is to be formed from the how to vote cards. Who is to form the poster? Presumably, it will be the Australian Electoral Commission, the divisional returning office or an officer in the electoral system. Senator Macklin knows as well as anybody else the advantages and disadvantages that will flow, depending on where one's how to vote card happens to appear on the poster. Everybody knows that, unless we have the sort of revolving system which has been used in places like Tasmania, for example, in terms of the position of candidates on a ballot paper, there is a marginal advantage if one's how to vote card is the how to vote card which is displayed in the top left-hand corner of that poster. Everybody knows that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We then come to the question of how the poster is to be formed, what the size of the poster is to be. Let me tell the Committee that in the Senate campaign in New South Wales it is undoubtedly true that there will be some dozens of candidates in party groupings, all of whom will have in terms of the distributions of their preferences a how to vote card which will be quite substantial in its actual physical size. If there are 20 or 30 of those groups on a ballot paper, each of whom is putting out a how to vote card which advises people how to vote for 40 or 50 candidates, and we are going to make a poster of that and display that inside each separate voting compartment, that is to say, those narrow cubicles formed out of the recycled cardboard which is used by the Electoral Commission or, indeed, the older ones which have the timber construction, I will tell the Committee what some of them are going to look like: they will start in one corner and they will run down the side of the booth, across the booth in front and back up the other side of the booth. Either that, or they will be so microscopically small that the Electoral Commission will have to order a couple of hundred thousand magnifying glasses to hand to electors so they can actually see what the wretched thing is all about.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not only that. The how to vote card is to be submitted in the prescribed form. In other words, the Electoral Commission will tell us how to put out, how to design and how to print our how to vote cards. They will be in the prescribed form and in the quantity determined by the Divisional Returning Officer. The poor old Divisional Returning Officer now has the responsibility cast upon him, under this amendment, to make sure that the how to vote card is submitted in the form which has been prescribed, presumably by some sort of regulation or schedule to the Electoral Act. The Divisional Returning Officer in each of the Commonwealth Divisions is to determine how many how to vote cards he wants supplied for that particular purpose, presumably for the purposes of forming these posters. One would have thought that the answer to that in some respects should have been only one. They have to be received within seven days before polling day. And so it goes on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sheer physical and logistical questions that are raised-let me leave to one side for a moment the question of the principle-by this amendment about each separate voting compartment having a poster, the nature of the poster, the responsibility for the preparation of the poster, the way in which the how to vote cards are to be displayed on the poster, and all the rest of it, just seems to me to be in its own way an absolute nonsense.

         —Indeed, as my colleague Senator Reid says, one in fact is entitled to register more than one how to vote card. One has the opportunity to have all of these parties, multiplied by three. We have this wonderful system where the ones left over at the end are determined by lots, in terms of the distribution of the preferences. Imagine in New South Wales 15 or 20 electoral groups which may or may not register one, two or three how to vote cards for a potential Senate ticket which might have 40 candidates on it-and they will be combined into a poster and there will be one of those posters inside each voting compartment, for heaven's sake!

        More significant is the question of the proposed new section 109a to insert a new section 328a in the Act under the heading `No How to Vote Cards on Polling Day'. I have some difficulty recalling the exact nature of the debate that took place some months ago on this, but I do seem to recall that one of those pieces of paper that the Minister read out, which I think came from the Electoral Commission, was that wonderful statement that there is nothing that party workers enjoy more in the course of their life than standing around on polling day handing out how to vote cards and that it would be a shame to deprive them of the joy and the privilege that they get--

There is a very significant principle; that is, the principle that on polling day the political parties' candidates are entitled to approach electors in a particular fashion. There are in the Electoral Act prohibitions on canvassing and on the direct participation of candidates on polling day, and nobody has sought to upset those. There has been a quite distinct view that canvassing on polling day and participation by certain individuals on polling day should be ruled out, and it has been consistently ruled out under the Electoral Act.

        It has always been a feature of Australian electoral practice that when we go to the polling booth there is an attempt by the various political parties to get a how to vote card into our hand. We all know the old techniques about who is at the furthest end of the queue, who is closest to the door, whether it matters whether they have our ticket on top when they go through the door, whether we go scrounging round the bins to get the used tickets out, or put them in the bins so that they do not look as though they are littering all over the street--

In those places where somebody comes along and leaves a bunch of how to vote cards under a rock and the expectation is that we will direct other people to take those cards in case they miss them on the way, or whether in fact there is a friendly political group or party that says, `Look, do you mind handing these out, as well as handing out your own?-they are the common features of polling day activity that those of us who do not mind being described as party hacks have lived with for the period of our political existence in terms of the parties.

        The fundamental principle of saying, as Senator Macklin's amendment does, `You shall be prohibited by Commonwealth electoral law from handing out how to vote cards on polling day' seems to me to be an absolute nonsense. The Committee will note, of course, that it is is not a prohibition on how to vote cards per se; it is simply a prohibition handing them out on polling day. All that in fact would be achieved in this circumstance would be to make sure that in the weeks prior to polling day exactly the same number of pieces of paper were handed out in the shopping centres, on the streets, in the letter boxes-wherever it happens to be. There is no magic that all of a sudden we will wipe out this terrible business of cutting down trees and turning them into how to vote cards. It is a prohibition on a particular day.
       </para>

        The other thing about it is that not only is it offensive, I believe in terms of in the rights of people participating in the handing out of the how to vote cards; it is grossly offensive to those electors who in fact want to go there on polling day and receive a how to vote card, who made up their minds 15 years ago that this was how they are going to vote, and who are never going to vote any other way. They are what the Americans call yellow dog democrats-it does not matter what the circumstances, they are going to vote for their political party, and God bless them. They do not want to be bothered during the course of the election campaign, they do not want rubbish in their letter boxes, and they do not want to be assaulted in the streets prior to polling day. They want to be left alone in the shopping centres because they know full well that on polling day they can go up to the polling booth and get the how to vote card of the party they want to vote for and they can follow it and fill in the numbers. They do not have to go looking around for some great poster inside as to what the advice is, or take those sorts of actions in order to establish the facts that they want.

        Indeed, the Democrat amendment goes on to deal with newspapers, journals, magazines, circulars, pamphlets, `dodgers' or other documents, the essential purpose of which is other than to communicate directions or instructions as to how an elector should vote or as to the method of voting. It says, therefore, that those things are not included, it is only the specific how to vote card. As I say, there are those of us who find that part of the discipline of running a political party is whether in fact we are able to get people out to the polling booths to work. I think that is an indication of the success or otherwise of a political organisation. I appreciate the problem that the Democrats obviously face. They do not have enough people to get out and man every polling booth. It is not unusual for any of the political parties to be in that sort of circumstance. The Liberal Party in New South Wales has difficulty manning polling booths in certain areas. I have no doubt that the Labor Party in New South Wales has difficulty manning certain areas in, for instance, strong National Party territory in country electorates. There is no magic in that one way or the other.

        These three amendments constitute in the first instance an absolute nonsense in terms of the proposed poster inside the voting compartment and a very considerable restriction upon the freedom and liberty of individual subjects in Australia and certainly will not be supported by the Opposition.

         —I will not take very long and will do no other than to reiterate some of the arguments we went through a couple of months ago. The trees argument is always interesting. I think that the environment is becoming the last refuge of the scoundrel, in one sense-it is thought that if one can put in a bit of an environmental argument, one must carry the day. I dare say that the introduction of three large Sunday newspapers in Melbourne in one weekend is using the same amount of paper as we do for electoral purposes. That is a problem society will have to consider, but how to vote cards are a fairly small part of that particular proposal. We oppose this in principle and from a practical and self-interest point of view. We oppose it on principle because we believe it is everyone's right to hand out how to vote cards to inform the electorate and especially one's own supporters, some of whom, as Senator Puplick has indicated, do not take any interest in the political process other than taking a blue and white card, a red, white and blue card or, in some cases, a yellow and black card. That is their decision and that should be available to them. That is the question of principle.

        The question of practicalities has been raised in Queensland, which has single member electorates. I think that the biggest field in the last State election would have been in the electorate of Cook. I could stand corrected on that. There seemed to be about eight candidates in Cook. It would be practical in that sense to put the how to vote cards up just to fit within that. Our problem as a Senate is that 20 groups might be running and each group is allowed three options. We in the Labor Party have exercised all three options so that we could get three berths. It would not matter that effectively we are only swapping numbers around to have the same effect by putting the second and third Democrat--

It does not take into account whether our colours will be printed by the Australian Electoral Commission. One of the things we like to do, and tend to do in a large number of electorates, is put out bilingual material-not that the voters cannot necessarily speak or read English, but in the complexity of electoral laws sometimes it is much more simply explained in their original language. Therefore we see no reason to adopt either of these three proposals.

        Coming to self-interest, we may occasionally have difficulty in staffing a polling booth here and there, but in general we do not. The Democrats and minor parties do. This is part of the great balance of politics. Being a large party we have that advantage. We also suffer from the disadvantage that we have to be careful about the promises we make-so does the coalition-because we have to keep them. The big advantage of a minority party is that it can promise anything it likes. This is one of the broad trade-offs in politics. What Senator Macklin is seeking to do today is just take a little more of that trade-off into his own camp.

        From the point of view of a political hack I will finish on this point: I wonder what I will do with all those supporters on election day. Coincidentally, I was in Tasmania in the last State election. I say `coincidentally' because I was going to an Indian dinner-dance. It was not obvious to anyone arriving in Tasmania that an election was on. I could not find a polling booth. I am glad I did not find one because down there I probably would have been in breach of the electoral law, not knowing it as I do now.

         —It is all a matter of tradition, Senator. The honourable senator argues that the Tasmanian electorate is more intelligent. Looking at its senatorial representation and its House of Representatives representation over the last few years, I will just say, `The defence rests'. Looking at that dog-eat-dog situation in State Parliament where the real enemy is in one's own party rather than the other party, Senator Sanders can hardly preach to me about the glories of the Tasmanian system. When someone resigns at the moment it is more likely that someone will pick up the phone and ring someone in Perth and say, `Hey, you are in the Tasmanian Parliament'. These things happen under that particular system. It is also a very small area. I am not rubbishing Tasmania, but it is a small area. It is like taking five Federal electorates in Melbourne. Sure, the knowledge is greater. Recognition of local members in Tasmania is phenomenally high because it is a small pool. As I say, this particular proposition put forward is wrong in principle, it is impractical and does not serve the self-interest of the two major parties, and that is that.

         -I will respond to the points that have been raised by both Senator Puplick and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). Firstly, the amendments that are set out here have been adopted from the South Australian Electoral Act where they have already been tested in practice. The types of wild assumptions and mythologies that Senator Puplick was trying to run have not occurred there. The method has proceeded to such an extent that there has not been any need to amend those particular provisions, although other parts of the Electoral Act since that time have been amended.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The proposition that Senator Robert Ray relied on was very similar except he added the quite extraneous comment that the Labor Party and the Opposition parties make promises which they keep, whereas the Australian Democrats do not. Let us look at the promises that were made during the Fraser years. I happen to remember Senator Ray talking rather volubly about what Fraser had promised and never done; in fact, I have heard the Opposition do exactly the same with regard to promises made by the Hawke Labor Government. Once in government there is no pressure whatsoever to fulfil the promises that were made. Indeed, one reason for the cynicism in the electorate is that the major political parties, having put up a whole raft of promises, never keep them. Therefore there is not the pressure on the major political parties to fulfil their promises that Senator Ray indicated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Interestingly enough, I would be happy to go through the policies that we raised in the last election and compare them with the Government's policies to see how many of the policies were enacted in legislation in comparison to the Government's policies. I think that we do fairly well. Quite consistently in the last four parliaments day in and day out we have pushed a set of policies that have been clear and unambiguous. A week or so ago Senator Haines got into a lot of trouble by spelling out what our policies would be on a number of items if after the next election a Liberal Government were elected. We were told that we were not allowed to do that. We are not supposed to tell the electorate what we would do and would not do. Senator Ray might remember that in the last election campaign only the Democrats campaigned for a capital gains tax. It was introduced by the Labor Party and people then said to us, `The Labor Party has no mandate to do this'. Our response to them was, `Didn't you listen to what we had said and what our policy was during the election?'. Our support for the capital gains tax was made clear during the election campaign. We were the only party which did that and that is why we voted for it when it was introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts of the matter are that we have had an extremely consistent relationship between what we have campaigned on and what we have done in this place. I cannot be responsible for the fact that people do not bother to read the policies that we campaign on. That is their problem, not ours. We will continue to push very strongly to implement those policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last point I wish to raise relates to Senator Ray's reference to some notion that the environment is now the last refuge of the scoundrel. This, it seems to me, is not where the electorate is at. The electorate very clearly is interested in procedures and methods by which we can conserve the environment. He suggests that the use of more paper, with the introduction of three Sunday papers in Melbourne, somehow exempts political parties, where they have some influence, from doing anything. I do not think it does. We have a responsibility, along with everybody else, to engage in conservation methods where it is possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I have set out in my amendments is a practical method of conservation. It in no way deprives anybody, even the dyed in the wool voters whom Senator Puplick referred to by an American term that my learned colleague Senator Sanders had never heard of although he is a native American and had operated in politics in the United States for a long time. The dyed in the wool voters, who wish to have a direction on those issues, would not be deprived of that direction; it will be there for them. It will not deprive anybody of any information they wish to have. In fact, it is in the engaging in of a fairly massive conservation effort that we propose, yet again, these amendments as we have in the past, long before conservation became a popular electoral exercise.

        In the old days, the local divisional returning officer would effectively keep the roll. In these days of computerisation that is done at the central level, with a divisional returning officer not having much influence. The other reason-other than recognising reality-is the industrial problem that can occur. If a divisional returning officer, for whatever reason, was minded not to certify the roll, we would not be able to have an election. We think it is much better to have that power residing with the Electoral Commissioner, given the changes in the way the roll is now compiled and certified.

         —The Opposition opposes clause 58, which just seems to me to be a bit of additional nonsense. Clause 58 provides that a person who is in a polling booth in the capacity of a scrutineer shall wear a badge, supplied by the Electoral Commission, that identifies the person as a scrutineer. It does not seem to me to be a good idea that the Electoral Commission shall now start producing badges which identify people as scrutineers. We know that from time to time the divisional returning officers at booths run out of ballot papers. The very last thing one wants is a situation in which a person who wants to be a scrutineer goes into the booth at five minutes to six in order to be a scrutineer and the Electoral Commissioner says to him, `I am sorry, we have run out of badges. All the badges have been flogged, nicked, taken away, used up, not returned but I have to issue badges to people who act as scrutineers'. It seems to me that we have a perfectly valid and competent system at the moment in which a person who wishes to act as a scrutineer fills in a declaration which is maintained by the presiding officer at the booth who has an appropriate record of it. This whole idea of having badges of whatever sort supplied by the Electoral Commission that identifies the person as a scrutineer really does seem to be taking some of these bureaucratic things quite over the top.

        Rather than repeat the arguments, precisely the same thing occurs in clause 77-`Scrutineers at scrutiny'- which states:

        A person who is present at the scrutiny in the capacity of a scrutineer shall wear a badge, supplied by the Electoral Commission. That identifies the person as a scrutineer.

       <para>
        That really does seem to be quite unnecessary. The Opposition opposes both of those clauses. I do not believe there is any good reason for it; nor indeed is the expense that the Electoral Commission may have to go to in order to supply badges to scrutineers in any way justified.

         —This stretches my memory a long way back to the hearings of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. I think the clause was suggested more by the presiding officers than anyone else because, at times, in keeping an eye on the activities in a booth, they face some confusion as to who is a scrutineer and who is an ordinary elector. A badge also identifies scrutineers in case an ordinary elector wishes to ask that person for help, and that was the reason that it was brought in. It is not something to die in a ditch over, obviously, but it was brought in for those two particular reasons-not just out of a desire to create an extra bureaucracy or an extra expense.

       <para>
        As for running out of badges, I do not think that is a likely proposition. It is rare these days for scrutineers to sit inside the booth all day. It occurs occasionally, but not very often. Mostly scrutineers are there on the basis of looking at the formality of votes and the flow of preferences and at the recheck stages, and that was the reason why the amending Bill contains this provision.

         —Indeed, and the candidate countersigns it. As candidates, we know the business that we go through about signing forms, having the necessary rubber stamps made, and ensuring they are acceptable to divisional returning officers or whoever it happens to be. But an individual scrutineer undertakes certain things and is bound by the terms of the conditions of the declaration form which he or she has signed. If we are to have this system where a scrutineer shall wear a badge, if anybody actually wanted to rort the system, somebody could go in and sign that they were a scrutineer, complete a scrutineer's declaration form, get a badge, leave the polling booth, hand the badge to somebody else, and that other person would then have access in and out of the polling booths, unless the presiding officer were particularly vigilant. If he or she did anything that they were not supposed to do, they would simply say, `I did not sign any form. I did not undertake to behave in a certain fashion. I never completed a declaration. I am just here wearing this badge'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Unless we are now to have a whole regime where we have to sign for a badge and make a statutory declaration that we will not give the badge to anybody else-and, indeed, that these badges are not going to be simply swapped around for the sake of convenience-it really does not seem to me that, if the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs thinks that it is not worth dying in the ditch over, perhaps he could yield on it. There just does not seem to be a compelling case made out for moving away from a system which has a security element built into it in terms of the scrutineer's declaration to this business of badges and all the nonsense that may well go on with badges.
       </para>
       <para>
        Badges can be numbered. If someone has completed a declaration at one polling booth, has got a scrutineer's badge and then goes off and presents himself at some other polling booth-because, after all, he has got a badge-the badges can be swapped around. I think that this system is open to considerably more misuse and abuse than the system of a controlled series of declarations. The candidate has a role in terms of signing the declaration and the presiding officer has a role in terms of accepting the declaration and maintaining a proper record of who has been authorised to act as a scrutineer and who has not.

        The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs stretched his memory back to the reports of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform and why this proposal came forward. In stretching my memory, too, although I was not directly involved, I cannot think of the strong reasons that were presented to that Committee. I think that the practical considerations that Senator Puplick has raised suggest that the Minister should have another look at this clause. Obviously no-one from either side is going to die in a ditch on it, but it does require further thought before we proceed with it.

         -There seems to have been a lot of discussion over something that nobody is going to die in a ditch for. My memory is that a suggestion was made by the people in charge of the polling booths that some form of identification worn by scrutineers would be of great assistance to them, particularly in the counting of the ballots after the close of the polls, and this clause is in fact a follow-through on that suggestion. I fail to see Senator Puplick's problems because, since this is an addition to rather than a subtraction from the security which is currently offered, this will enhance the protection and not detract from it. That is how the people with practical experience in the booths saw it, and I think that their suggestion is a perfectly reasonable one and should be accepted.

        Will the Minister indicate where under this section the `conduct' of an election is specifically defined, if anywhere? Does the definition reflect the old rule of thumb, which I think it was, rather than a specific part of the Act? For example, is a candidate still prohibited by this proposed section from handing out how to vote cards? Is a candidate who is a candidate for a House of Representatives seat, for example, prohibited from acting as a scrutineer for a Senate election taking place on the same day? Is that prohibition encompassed by that? After all, he is a candidate, and the conduct of an election includes the scrutiny of it. If a person is a candidate in, say, the electorate of Banks and he is subsequently asked to act as a party scrutineer for the count of the Senate ballot some time later, is he prohibited from doing so? Similarly, is a Senate candidate prohibited from acting as a scrutineer for one of his party colleagues in the House of Representatives?
       </para>
       <para>
        The latter actually raises some quite interesting points. I do not know whether Senator Ray's and other honourable senators' experiences in any way have been akin to mine, but there have been many occasions when Senator Graham Richardson and I have sat eyeball to eyeball across a table during the scrutiny of the count in a marginal seat. Therefore, the question is: Am I, at the next Federal election as a candidate in that election, hereby absolved from the pressures of my political party to spend the three weeks following the election campaign acting as a scrutineer in those marginal seats in New South Wales where we tend to put in people who have the required combination of electoral experience and sheer gall?

         —This amendment comes about simply because we are transferring one part of the old section into a new section and retaining the rest of it. My interpretation of it-and it is not based on a terribly learned view-is that `conduct' does refer to scrutineering or acting as an electoral official, which obviously is out. As I have always understood it, a Senate candidate cannot scrutineer until the declaration of the poll and one cannot scrutineer in marginal seats, and cannot scrutineer especially in the electoral office because people there are separating Senate ballot papers which may be relevant to oneself.

         —Senator Puplick says they have all been taken into head office but postal votes and absentee votes are still arriving. The only votes taken into head office, by the way, are below the line votes. Above the line votes are retained in each electoral office. The more touchy area is what happens with a House of Representatives candidate? The general rule of thumb is that one cannot scrutineer in one's own electorate but can in another. At some stage that may be put in doubt if absentee votes are being passed on but I think that is a very remote possibility.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The rule of thumb is that Senate candidates are absolved and House of Representatives candidates can scrutineer only outside their own electorate. State members of Parliament may be scrutineers in Federal elections, and vice versa. It would probably give pleasure to honourable senators to know that they should not scrutineer. Those in the off year who do not come up for election at the time are not only quite free but probably compelled to scrutineer at great length. I would not mind a provision that one cannot scrutinise a Senate election at all, because I do not think it helps one iota these days. The system is almost impossible to follow and when one is knocking out minor party votes one could be signing one's own death warrant, not knowing in advance what is happening. Very few people are skilled enough to know that. I take the term `conduct' to deal mostly with scrutineering. It also rules out members or candidates being polling officials, presiding officers or any other member of staff in the employ of the Electoral Commission for the period of the campaign.

         —I would not think it covers that. If it does, and has traditionally done so, I suppose we would all have been convicted in one sense or another. One would be pretty lucky to find a candidate who does not hand out how to vote cards to get rid of his or her nerves. However, there is an exception. In 1974 we won a seat precisely by sending the candidate bushwalking for the two weeks before the election and on election day. But in general I think we can take whatever interpretation is necessary. The clause does not prohibit handing out how to vote cards, which is not an official part of the conduct of a poll. But scrutineering is recognised specifically in the Act for that purpose and therefore I think that what I said before applies to that.

        On the face of it, this amendment makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, so perhaps I might explain it. Proposed section 62 of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act makes amendments to section 226 of the principal Act, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Section 226 of the principal Act relates to the way in which votes are taken and dealt with in hospitals that are polling places and where mobile booths are in use. Section 226 deals with provisions which are covered in sections 224 and 225 of the principal Act. As I say, they both deal with mobile booths and hospitals that are polling places. The current regime provides that candidates are precluded from entering hospitals, special hospitals, nursing homes or similar institutions for canvassing once the writs for an election have been issued. Indeed, subsection 5 (a) of section 226 of the principal Act says:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the reference in that sub-section to polling day and to all days to which the polling is adjourned were a reference to the period commencing on the day of the issue of the writ and ending at the expiration of polling day or, if the polling is adjourned, the expiration of the last day to which the polling is adjourned . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition amendment proposes that subsection 5 (a) of section 226 should be deleted. It is our view that this is a fair and reasonable provision, given the expanded nature of activities taking place within hospitals and designated institutions for the purposes of polling, and the extended nature of the activities that are to take place related to both mobile booths and hospitals that are polling places and other hospitals. Clauses 60 and 61, which we have just passed, make some amendments to the way in which mobile booths are to operate or be operated in hospitals that are polling places and other hospitals.
       </para>
       <para>
        We say that the period from the issue of the writ up until polling day is too long a period for candidates to be precluded from canvassing, particularly because increasing numbers of persons are likely to be voting in hospitals, special hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions. We believe that people in those areas are just as entitled to visits by candidates and that, provided candidates obtain the permission of the hospital authorities, they should not be precluded by the Electoral Act from entering hospitals for the purposes of promoting their candidacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have moved the amendment for that reason. I believe that it would be fair and proper to extend both to candidates and to the people who are residents of these nursing homes, hospitals, special hospitals or similar institutions the right to be contacted by a candidate during the course of the period from the issue of the writ until polling day. As I understand it, legislation in most of the States provides that the executive officer, matron or responsible senior officer at these institutions is perfectly capable of denying access, and that denial is quite absolute in these regards. We do not believe that this part of the Act should continue in the form in which it is at the moment.

         —These sections of the Act have a long history. When the original Bill was passed in 1983 there was a great deal of dissatisfaction in the coalition as to its provisions. It was discussed at great length in an atmosphere of some compromise in a joint select committee. Certain other concessions were made, such as the availability of postal votes, but on this subject the Government strongly disagrees with the amendment. The amendment takes us back to the potential for corruption that existed before. It is not an area where we have ever had equal access; it has been a very one-sided thing over the years and we believe that the sort of compromise we came to on the electoral reform committee should obtain. If we had known that this provision would also come in we would never have agreed to the earlier compromises.

         —The Opposition opposes clause 66. Clause 66 is the regime put in place for the questions which are to be put to a voter by the presiding officer at the polling booth on polling day. The existing section 229 (1) of the principal Act provides:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The presiding officer shall put the following questions to each person attending before him and claiming to vote in an election or elections:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) What is your full name?
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) Where do you live?
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) Have you voted in this election? or Have you voted before in these elections? (as the case requires).
       </para>
       <para>
        It is now intended to replace that with a section of the Act which will delete subsection (1) from section 229 and insert the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        Questions to be put to voter.
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) The presiding officer shall put to each person claiming to vote such questions as the presiding officer thinks necessary to enable the person's identity and place of living to be established.
       </para>
       <para>
        It then goes to seek to omit subsections (4) and (5). These distinguished between the person claiming the right to vote and another person on the certified list. It also inserts a new section which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        If a person claiming to vote refuses to answer fully a question put to him or her under this section, the person's claim to vote shall be rejected.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of points arise here. The first is that for the first time this omits the requirement for a polling officer to ask an elector whether he has voted before in the election. I do not see any justification for that. The answer may be, `If somebody is going to lie and try to vote more than once, then they will not respond yes to the question ``Have you voted before in this election?'' '. Nevertheless, I believe it is simply an additional safeguard for those who might, for example, in their minds quite legitimately, turn up to cast a second vote. In the case of a person who has cast a vote by post or by pre-poll voting the roll may not have been appropriately amended in a way which demonstrates that that person's name has already been crossed off. There is no justification for having deleted that requirement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the obligation which the current Commonwealth Electoral Act casts upon presiding officers is that they must ask, `What is your full name?' and `Where do you live?'. That is very different from the presiding officers simply asking such questions that they think necessary to establish a person's identity and place of living. For example, a person may turn up and the presiding officer may say to him, `Is your name Robert Ray? Do you live at such and such an address?', if he happens to recognise him. Or the presiding officer may ask, `What is your name?'. The person may say, `My name is Michael Tate'. The presiding officer may look down his list and say, `Do you live at such and such an address? Have you been back there in the course of the last six months?'. He presumably gets the correct answer. It is then left entirely in the hands of the presiding officer to establish what he or she thinks are questions appropriate to establish the person's identity and place of living.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whereas, at the moment, the Act actually enjoins that officer to ask three specific questions. It does not give him any discretion as to what they should be; it says precisely what they are-`What is your full name? Where do you live?'. It then goes on to add the qualification, `Have you voted before in this election?'. I do not believe that that change is justified in any sense. Clause 66 (b) (3) states:
       </para>
       <para>
        If a person claiming a vote refuses to answer fully a question put to him or her under this section, the person's claim shall be rejected.
       </para>
       <para>
        The clause does not state that the claim shall be put to one side-this is a very important point-and subsequently determined by reference to the master roll or whatever it happens to be for inclusion, as is the case at the moment when there are disputes about votes. It states that it shall be rejected because a person has refused to answer fully a question put to him under this section. If the presiding officer asks me, `What is your name?' and I say, `My name is Chris Puplick' and the officer then asks, `Do you reside at Murdoch Street, Cremorne?' and I say, `Yes' and the presiding officer, for the purpose of satisfying himself, asks, `Who else resides at that address?' and I say to the presiding officer, `None of your damn business', it is perfectly competent for the presiding officer under the amending legislation to say, `Right. You have not answered fully the question which I believe it is necessary to ask in order to establish your proper identity and place of living. Therefore your vote is rejected'.
       </para>
       <para>
        He may well believe that in order to establish my identity and place of living he should ask me other questions to satisfy himself. As I said, one such question may well be, `Who else resides at that address?'. If I refuse to answer fully that question he can then reject my vote. The legislation does not provide that he shall put it aside or have it cast as a section vote or that it shall be looked at subsequently by the divisional returning officer; it states that it shall be rejected on the say-so of the presiding officer that I failed to answer fully the question which he wished to put to me to satisfy himself as to my identity and place of residence.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the moment the Act states quite specifically the questions to be asked. It can be said that they are not adequately answered only if I decline to give my full name and the place in which I live; it does not put a discretion in the hands of the presiding officer to determine what questions he thinks are appropriate and indeed to determine what he thinks are full, proper and adequate answers to those questions. This is a discretion put into the hands of the presiding officer for which no justification has been made. The words to be added state:
       </para>
       <para>
        If a person claiming to vote refuses to answer fully a question put to him or her under this section, the person's claim to vote shall be rejected.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since when have we given presiding officers the right to reject an elector's vote because the elector fails to answer a question, which is not a question in a statutory form but a question which, according to this, is a question such that the presiding officer thinks necessary?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Ray previously talked about party self-interest. This may be an invitation to presiding officers to exclude from the count votes from people who do not have English as their primary language and Aboriginal voters. The discretion provided here is far greater than has ever been provided in electoral law. That in particular will cause considerable problems when presiding officers try to establish facts from people who are not particularly competent in English. To establish which one of the Nguyen family is from Capital Street, Mount Druitt, the presiding officer may need to ask four, five or six questions other than, `What is your full name? Where do you live?' He may say to himself, `Look, I have a dozen of these people listed on my electoral roll at this address and they all have names that look pretty much the same to me. They are all Nguyen something-or-other and I will therefore ask additional questions. This poor joker cannot give me answers that satisfy me. I will not have the vote set aside, make him fill in a declaration or a scrutiny or put it in an absentee envelope or whatever; his vote shall be rejected'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The presiding officer may not be satisfied with the answers given by somebody in an Aboriginal community because the presiding officer will be going outside what is provided by way of the statute, which, at the moment, is perfectly clear. It provides for the questions, `What is your full name? Where do you live?' For the point of this argument, I leave aside the additional question, `Have you voted before in this election?'. The Opposition does not believe that putting in the hands of the presiding officers the discretion, first, to determine without the precise backing of the statute what questions are necessary in order to establish a person's full name and place of living and, secondly, to say, `That is not in my judgment an adequate answer', is an acceptable variation to this part of the Electoral Act. The consequence of that will be that a person's vote will be rejected. After all, this part of the Electoral Act goes absolutely to the heart of the electoral process-the method by which an elector is given a ballot paper, is allowed to complete that ballot paper, and is allowed to participate as an elector. I could choke up the courts of disputed returns with allegations that my vote was rejected because when the presiding officer said to me, `Who else resides at that address?', I told him to nick off and he said, `Right, buddy, your vote has just gone out the window'. Under this system in marginal electorates we will invite that type of dispute in courts of disputed returns.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current Act is perfectly clear: it requires three questions to be asked. The first question is: what is your full name? A person can answer that without any difficulty at all. The second question is: where do you live? The third question is: have you voted before? This question requires a yes or no answer. Provided the first two answers tally with the electoral roll and provided the answer to the third question is, `No, I have not voted before', a vote is admitted. This new system puts a discretion in the hands of the presiding officer to make up his own questions and then to make a judgment as to whether they have been adequately answered. I do not believe that that is a satisfactory way for our Electoral Act to be recast.

         —I reject the latter part of Senator Puplick's argument to do with people who cannot speak English or people of an Aboriginal background. Whilst acknowledging that that is possible, I only say that the first three questions are sometimes used to confuse and disadvantage those very same people. I imagine that the strongest point in favour of this clause is the fact that I have never been asked the third question when I have voted at a State or Federal level. I usually get asked my full name and address, but I have never been asked, `Have you voted before in this election?'. I dare say that some people are asked that question, but I think it is more honoured in the breach than in the observance. It is obvious why people are asked to state their full name. I suppose that if one were Ted Tanner, the member for Caulfield, one would not want to own up to being Edward Earl Ponsonby Tanner every time that one went to vote.

        The central argument put forward by Senator Puplick was the possible unintended consequences of a multiplicity of questions-the fact that someone may be refused a ballot paper because he or she did not answer, or did not know how to answer, those questions. The answer to this problem is very easy. No-one has thought that through and, because of that, I will support this amendment. No-one thought that part through until Senator Puplick raised it today. I appreciate Senator Puplick raising it. I cannot think of an answer to it now, so I will make a peremptory decision to agree with the honourable senator's amendment and knock this clause out of the Bill. If it needs to come back in some other form at some other time, we will look at it then.

         -I think the case put by Senator Puplick was overstated because the Act, as it currently stands, allows the presiding officer to ask additional questions. Senator Puplick did not allude to that. If it is not possible to distinguish one person who is presenting himself from another, there is already a discretion in the current Act to ask additional questions and, presumably, that discretion could be used.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think Senator Puplick overstated the case when he referred to the fact that a vote could be rejected. Under the current Act, a vote could be rejected if that occurred. However, the kernel of Senator Puplick's proposition has some validity. I remember fairly clearly when this matter was debated by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We tried to think up some form of question other than question (c). If we read question (c) we see that it is a confusing question even for a native English speaker. It has confused, and still confuses, many people. It becomes very difficult indeed for a non-English speaker to understand precisely what is being asked.
       </para>
       <para>
        The object and intent of the question are perfectly clear to everybody. But we were trying to dissuade those people who, either intentionally or inadvertently, presented themselves to vote again. The Joint Committee endeavoured to come up with an alternative third question. I do not remember the Joint Committee actually having got around to recommending-it might have done so since I left it-that we should try to deal with this matter of the question to be asked. I refer to question 3 and not questions 1 and 2. If a person fails to answer question No. 1, that person is in real difficulty. But the difficulty with question 3 is that some people may say `No' or `Yes' to it and mean precisely the same thing. There is a certain ambiguity in English in that question.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was not able to come up with an easier or simpler form. It may very well be that the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters has made recommendations on this matter; I must admit that I have not read its report. If it has recommended that, and as no members of the Committee are present here and we cannot be enlightened on the matter, I will also have to support Senator Puplick's amendment.

         —I want to draw attention to some very interesting reading that can be found if one turns to the back of the newspaper and moves from the back to the front. I am advised by any number of colleagues that most Australian readers start on the back page of the newspaper and move in. Of recent times I must say I have been rather puzzled by what one can find moving from the back to the front. I referred in this place a few days ago to an article by one Jeff Wells in the Australian on 11 December 1989. Jeff Wells seemed to be very confused about a report from the Western Australian Women in Sport Advisory Council on a $24,000 study to look at why women drop out of sport, particularly in their adolescent years. While I do not necessarily start at the back pages I invariably repair to them, and Jeff Wells usually entertains me with his commentary on things sporting in Australia, but I have no idea what happened to Jeff Wells's brain on this day. He seemed to go completely off the deep end. Comparing his article on this research project in Western Australia with an article in the Age the day after analysing the same report, one would have to think we were talking about two different reports altogether. Anybody who is concerned about the report of the Western Australian Women in Sport Advisory Council I suggest should look at the Age summary of that research on 12 December 1989. It is vastly different from Jeff Wells getting carried away about words such as `lesbian', which drove him to some six columns about four inches long, going into the problems of a young man in sport. Mostly, the article was excessive in the extreme, but it finished up with the following paragraph:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        So let us have some serious research here, you big researchers you. Is that a barbell in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
       </para>
       <para>
        That sort of question seems entirely appropriate to Mae West but it does make me wonder a whole lot about Jeff Wells. It seems also to suggest that, no matter what we have done for women in sport, the media does not take it seriously. This Government has done a considerable amount, starting, I am pleased to say, with the report of the inquiry that I chaired back in 1984-85 into the importance of women in sport. Subsequent to that inquiry, funding for the Women's Sports Promotion Unit was provided, which was pleasing to the thousands of Australians who take women's sport seriously. That seriousness is not yet reflected in our media coverage, in particular our print media coverage. The Age article tells us that research shows that column inches in the print media devoted to women's sport have increased slightly and recent research in Tasmania points out that in the Tasmanian dailies the figure has gone from 2 per cent of column inches in 1984 to 5 per cent of column inches in 1989. I congratulate Tasmania. If Tasmanian newspapers are not at the forefront, at least they are level pegging with other newspapers.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is about as far as we have got with women's sport in terms of print media coverage. That is quite a shame, particularly in view of the achievements of women in sport in this country. I think if we took out of the calculations the amount of newspaper space devoted to horse races we could probably modify those figures somewhat, but even excluding that, we would still have to say that the coverage of women's sport is insufficient. That is despite the extraordinary achievements of women at the elite level of sport in this country. I find it bizarre and somewhat disappointing that a journalist as reputable as Jeff Wells seems to be driven to this kind of nonsense.
       </para>

        Lest it should seem that I want to comment only on Jeff Wells, I was pulled up short when I turned to another back page in the Age on 2 November 1989, where there was an article headed `Hi-tech nobbler shocks racing'. This discussed an extraordinary new way of nobbling horses at Ascot with some kind of battery device in the ear of a horse. A person in the grandstand with a set of binoculars and the right kind of button to press could zap the battery and shock the horse to do bizarre things at the end of the straight and certainly not devote itself to winning the race. Referring to the Secretary of the Victoria Racing Club, Rod Johnson, the article said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it was an amazing story and his club would be closely monitoring any development on the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        `Australian racing prides itself on its strong control, but there are some things we are just unable to guard against, and with the new technologies now available it's frightening what might happen,' Johnson said.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        `It's a bit like when the suffragettes were throwing themselves in front of racehorses to get publicity for the women's movement.
       </para>
       <para>
        `We will try to take whatever precautions are necessary . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I worry about the Secretary of the Victoria Racing Club, who is clearly hanging on to a 70-year-old anxiety. I have no evidence that suffragettes are flinging themselves in front of racehorses on any racetrack anywhere. Indeed, if Mr Johnson was concerned about the problems of suffragettes, all he had to do was give them the vote. I am interested to find that there is somebody in Australia who can actually postulate suffragettes flinging themselves in front of racehorses as one of the possible ways of upsetting the due process and proper management of racing in this country. No doubt, of course, he was appreciating that this appalling problem had happened at Ascot, where the suffragette did fling herself in front of the racehorse. As far as I remember, she was the only person who did it and, for her efforts to draw attention to the suffragette movement, she died. I really do worry, reading comments such as that in the sporting newspapers in 1989. I hope Mr Johnson is comforted to know that since women have had the vote and the suffragette movement has taken its place in the scheme of things, the world has not changed too much; so the Victorian Racing Club need not fret about issues like that causing problems with their horses. Indeed, it might be much more fun to examine what has been happening since the examination into the drugging of horses, which had a substantial impact on the racing scene in our country.

       <para>
        I turned further back in one of the newspapers. I decided that the sports pages were too exciting. With Jeff Wells postulating problems about barbells and the Secretary of the Victoria Racing Club worrying about suffragettes, it seemed to me that I should retire to the financial pages for something more serene. In the Australian on 15 December I found a splendid article in the financial pages headed `Only trifles can fulfil a certain need'. This article by Bryce Courtenay started off with an immutable rule of marketing that goes like this:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . where a need exists it is filled.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like most rules in business, it does not take an MBA to work it out.
       </para>
       <para>
        For some strange reason I read on, I am not quite sure why. You will be pleased to know, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the article was devoted to what happens when men go out to run and the sorts of things they talk about. It is a very interesting article indeed. The first column was devoted to who makes the preferred Christmas pudding and how this compares to a Christmas cake. People were claiming total authenticity for the definitive Christmas pudding according to their grandmothers or mothers. In column two of this article we were shocked to discover this:
       </para>
       <para>
        `Have you noticed how no one has mentioned the cake or pudding made by their wife?' A stunned silence followed. All you could hear was the pitter-patter of Nike, Adidas and New Balance.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it was all right because somebody then added:
       </para>
       <para>
        `Not just that . . . what about bread and butter pudding?'
       </para>
       <para>
        So we forgot wives and hastened back to food and devoted the next couple of column inches to bread and butter puddings and the preferment of our childhood, until somebody mentioned trifle, when all the runners stopped. Trifle stories and trifle recipes were swapped. I can refer anybody to the Australian of 15 December for preferred recipes for trifle. There are a certain number of honourable senators here this evening for whom that is no novelty at all; we have been making them for years. Indeed, I believe some of the Hansard reporters and the Clerk at the table would also know how to make a good trifle. I am perfectly prepared to put on record that these people are women. Any men in the audience who are prepared to say that they can conjure up a good trifle I will hear. Is Senator Tate a good trifle maker or is he just devoted to eating a good trifle?

        I am entirely with the sentiments of this article but I have to say that the poor old wives get an awful beating in it. Mothers are fine and presumably daughters are not too bad-they suck on puddings and look for sixpences. But, again, I am a bit concerned about the view that men in the Australian community have of women. I refer them to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser on Monday, 11 December which talked about the launch of a Tomato Bank in Japan where Japanese people clearly have a different understanding of the virtues of women. The article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Tomato Bank opened its first branch in Tokyo last week and already is deluged with depositors who think it is just too cute for words.
       </para>

       </para>
       <para>
        This bank, the Sanyo Sogo Bank, based in Okayama, decided to change its name and its logo in a particular and deliberate attempt to attract deposits from women. The bank is celebrating a massive increase in profits. I suggest that this could indicate a different understanding and appreciation of women by the Japanese. They are not too concerned, as it seems is Jeff Wells, let alone the Secretary of the Victorian Racing Club, about problems associated with women but are more concerned with women's attributes and the financial assistance they can offer women.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I think by way of no thesis at all, I conclude with some comments from The University of Melbourne Gazette which arrived on my table as I was happily pondering these things that one can find if one starts reading the papers from the back. In this magazine there is an article entitled `No angel . . .' by Peter Connor who traces the history of the familiar figure that is the heraldic symbol of the Melbourne University. As this is my alma mater I was very pleased to read about it. The figure for Melbourne University is that of Victory. The University of Melbourne took this as its heraldic figure because it was not too long after the State of Victoria separated from the State of New South Wales that the University of Melbourne was established. As the State of Victoria had been called after the then British Queen, the university also looked to Victory-Victoria in Latin-for some kind of heraldic symbol. The university chose the symbol of Victory.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those who are not sure, Victory is the god of victory whose usual name is Nike-perhaps more often associated with running shoes and intercontinental ballistic missiles. In ancient times the Greeks understood women, their importance and the place they played in society. Indeed, the gods of ancient times were nearly always women. The Greeks indicated and symbolised women with the sorts of attributes that I would be very pleased if our sports journos-our male journos-could comfortably arrive at for our women-that is, women of achievement, women of virtue, women of talent and ability and women who were just quite normal and naturally marvellous in the scheme of things. I am delighted and appreciative of Peter Connor for bringing to my attention the heraldic symbol of Melbourne University because it interested and informed me further about a symbol of Victory, the god-or goddess if we prefer that sexist term-Nike who represented victory; not victory in war but as it is described in the article which I referred to:
       </para>
       <para>
        The inspiration for the design of Victoria on our University coat of arms comes fittingly from the peaceable Nikes of the early Greek coins, soberly clad and posed calmly with wreath and palm-branch, indicating . . . victory as a characteristic, an aim and a fact.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the sort of womanhood that I would like to represent in this place; that is the sort of womanhood that I think Australia and the Australian Government stand for. I am sure that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, represent that kind of womanhood and speak for it. It is normal and natural in the scheme of things for women to achieve-to try, to succeed and not be regarded as freaks for doing so.

The National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 330, were made, to the best of my knowledge on 29 November and gazetted on 30 November. The normal custom for regulations is that they are tabled as soon as possible after they are made.

        On 14 December I went to the Table Office and was given a list of papers to be tabled that day-a large number of regulations on everything under the sun. The regulations listed were No. 317 to No. 359. But surprise, surprise! When I went through that list to be tabled in the morning regulation No. 330 was missing. During Question Time on that day I asked the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), as the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), whether he had seen the regulations. He said that to his knowledge he had not seen them. Honourable senators may remember that I tabled those regulations, having had advice from a very learned and erudite colleague on this side of the House who said judicial authority could be found in a 1931 case before the High Court of Australia of Dignan and Australian Steamships Pty Ltd for the proposition that a motion to disallow an instrument may be effective after the instrument has been laid before the Senate by a private senator. I sought leave to table those regulations and I did so. Those regulations were not available to me in the Parliament; but they were available at the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS)--

        That was interesting enough in itself. But even more interesting was the fact that I had received from a pharmacist a copy of a letter written to the pharmacist by the Health Insurance Commission. I want to read part of this letter because it is absolutely stunning. The letter states:

We are going to look at the PBRT again, and we want you to cooperate.

I call upon Minister Staples and the Minister for Community Services and Health to do something about the confusion that now exists with the regulations to which pharmacists are being subjected. This situation is a farce. It is flouting the Parliament, and it is also a flagrant disregard of parliamentary process.

         —In many walks of life people are assessed by their peers, by their superiors and by those over whom they may have some authority. This assessment does not necessarily occur in a formal way, but it is an ongoing process. We in this chamber should be aware that our performance is being continually assessed by our peers, by our party supporters and by the public. For some, the assessment process is more formal. Among these are the students in thousands of schools throughout the nation. The assessment of their attainments has long term consequences, especially for those who are about to leave school and join the work force or attempt further study at the post-secondary level. It is about this group-those who are about to leave secondary school-that I intend to make some remarks this evening.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If the assessment process for our secondary school leavers does have long term consequences-and I hold that it does-it is vitally important that the assessment or examination techniques which are used be as accurate as possible. Firstly, we have to be quite clear about what we are attempting to measure. Secondly, we have to ensure that our measures are both valid and reliable. I will not go into these matters in depth, suffice it to say that there is an abundance of educational theory about testing procedures which allow those charged with the responsibility of assessing student performance to do so with a reasonable degree of accuracy. I say `a reasonable degree of accuracy' because assessment is not an exact science. What we must attempt to do is strive for perfection, but we must also accept the fact that we will fall short of that goal. Because of the imperfect nature of testing procedures, some students will believe they have been harshly treated. So, too, will the parents of some students. Their claims may be correct, but until educational theory takes us further, all educators can do is say that they did strive for excellence.

        About four years ago, as Chairman of the then Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, I presented a report dealing with assessment in secondary colleges in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The members of the Committee at that time were myself, Senator Teague, who is in the chamber tonight and was the Deputy Chairman, and Senators Knowles, McKiernan, Parer and Reynolds. In our report, we noted that external examinations were abolished in the ACT in 1977 and, since then, a system of continuous assessment has been used to assess student performance in the final two years of secondary school.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee noted that in Australia only the ACT and Queensland rely entirely on continuous school-based assessment to rank candidates for entry to tertiary education. Other States and the Northern Territory continue to rely mainly on external examinations, with an element of continuous assessment. The Committee stated that it had a preference for an assessment system which combines continuous assessment and external examinations, rather than the system which was used in the ACT at that time and, indeed, is still used. I shall not traverse the arguments proposed by the Committee. They are outlined in the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall mention, however, that the Committee's suggestion met with heated disagreement by the then head of the ACT Schools Authority. Opposition to the Committee's position was not unexpected, if for no other reason than that the Committee noted that it had found the Authority's 1983-84 annual report to be `deficient in several respects'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the not too distant future, for tertiary entrance, the Australian Capital Territory will have the only system in Australia relying solely on suitably scaled school-based assessment. One may ask: will the Australian Capital Territory then be the only educational system in Australia in step, or the only one out of step? The new Labor Government in Queensland has announced that the Tertiary entrance system in that State is to be changed. The exact nature of the new system will be developed next year, so that it may be introduced for students commencing year 11 in 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not before time that the current tertiary entrance system in Queensland should be scrapped. The tertiary entrance score-or TE score, as it is known in Queensland-has been misused and abused. It has been misused by employers who have taken it as a measure of scholastic ability, but who have taken little or no notice of particular subjects the young people chose to study, and how well they acquitted themselves in those subjects. It has been abused by educators who have concentrated on beating the system to have their students gain spurious TE scores at the end of their final two years of secondary school.
       </para>
       <para>
        The TE score is supposed to be a predictor of academic success at the tertiary level. It is a figure which is derived by complex but mathematically sound calculations, taking into account students' marks as obtained in continuous assessment, the relative difficulty of different subjects and the ability levels of the schools in which the students completed their final two years of secondary education. In Queensland the TE score is a scaled score, with a maximum of 990. Scores are awarded to students from 990 downwards in steps of five. A score of 990 places the student in the top one per cent of the 17-year-old Queensland cohort, whether in school or not. Each step of five represents a further one half of a per cent of that cohort. Thus, for example, a student who has a score of 985 is in the top 1 1/2 per cent. A score of 980 indicates that the student is in the top 2 per cent, and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        With a scarcity of tertiary places in Queensland, entry to various courses has been granted on the basis of the level of a student's TE score. In 1989, for example at the University of Queensland, only those with a TE score of 990 or 985 were admitted to medicine. A score of 975 was required for law-that is, a student had to be in the top 2 1/2 per cent of the 17-year-old age group. To study arts at the same institution, a student had to receive a TE score of 880 or above-that is, be in the top 12 per cent of the 17-years of age cohort. Some other institutions had lower entrance scores for their courses but, taking into account the examples I have given, it is not surprising that competition among students is high. The best way to free up the system is to make more tertiary places available-something the Hawke Government has been doing since it assumed office in 1983, and something the Goss Labor Government in Queensland has already done in its first few weeks of office.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of the process of obtaining a TE score, students have to sit for the Australian Scholastic Aptitude Test or ASAT, as it is generally known. The results obtained in this test are used in the mathematical calculations to which I referred earlier. Individual students are not assigned an ASAT score but, all other things being equal, the higher a school's average ASAT score, the higher the TE scores of students in that school. It is regrettable that there have been professionally questionable, if not downright dishonest, practices which have occurred in Queensland schools in relation to the Australian scholastic aptitude test. I digress for a moment to indicate that to use profesionally questionable standards is, by no means, a new phenomenon. I can remember that in my early educational studies I was being lectured on how, in a particular country, students were chosen for various courses by the use of general ability tests-often referred to as intelligence tests. The system broke down because groups of students were coached in how to score well on these tests. This practice made a nonsense of the tests' norms and made it impossible to differentiate between students when some were coached and some were not.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fairly well known that coaching on how to complete the ASAT is widespread in Queensland. Some schools had multiple practice sessions, the hypothesis being that practice would lead to higher ASAT scores and thus to higher TE scores for the school. No doubt, some teachers viewed such coaching with disfavour, but could they afford to place their students at a disadvantage by not following a similar course of action? It is probably a case of `When the world is foolish it is folly to be wise'. Students in some schools, however, had little or no practice and were thus at a real disadvantage compared with their peers in other schools. This makes an absolute nonsense of the distribution of TE scores. Some students are awarded higher scores than they should and the TE scores of others are lower than they should be.
       </para>
       <para>
        The zealous competition which exists for high TE scores has, in the past, also led to criminal activity. I am not sure whether all of this activity has been detected, but in 1986, for example, an ASAT test paper was stolen when a break-in occurred at a Queensland government school. It appeared from police investigations that the sole purpose of the break-in was the theft of the soon to be used ASAT paper. Photocopies of the test paper were promptly circulating in the school.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am by no means the first person to doubt the validity of the ASAT testing process in Queensland. Three years ago, a former State colleague said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Allegations of schools successfully defrauding the system are so rife and so serious that nothing short of a full scale police investigation is required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, if it were not for the fact that the TE score is on the way out in Queensland, I would mention some areas where inquiries could be made in relation to the recently issued TE scores in that state. I believe, however, that the time of senior executives in the Queensland Education Department, now under the excellent ministerial direction of Labor's Paul Braddy, would be far better directed towards the establishment of an alternative system of assessment in the upper secondary school.

         —Today, 20 December 1989, marks the fiftieth birthday of Radio Australia, the ABC's overseas service. While some would undoubtedly argue that to reach this age is a milestone in itself, one must seriously ask whether Australia's short-wave expert will see further years of effective operation. Any nation's overseas broadcasting service which cannot transmit, due to aged or inadequate range transmitters, goes the way of the dinosaur.

        The Federal Government's inaction in failing to provide Radio Australia with adequate resources to ensure its broadcasts can be heard clearly, particularly in northern China, condemns Radio Australia to a bleak and unprofessional future, lacking both independence and viability. Its short-wave services are claimed to reach as far north as Mongolia and the north-west of Afghanistan but, due to unreliable transmissions into parts of northern China, its signal is not effectively received in Beijing.
       </para>

        Radio Australia broadcasts in nine languages and reaches an estimated 50 million regular listeners. It broadcasts 24 hours a day in English and at various other times in Chinese, Cantonese, Indonesian, Pidgin, French, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese. Its annual budget is about $25m, of which half is dedicated to transmission. Telecom provides half of the funds while the Australian taxpayer provides the other half. This compares to the BBC's World Service budget of $228m-$25m compared with $228m. The World Service, however, has a number of other distinct advantages-it broadcasts in 36 languages, not nine; and although permanently strapped for funds, even with its $228m, it has continuing support from both the BBC and the British Government, whereas Radio Australia has been quite sadly neglected by this Hawke Labor Government and by its own parent, the ABC.

        This is quite astonishing when its programs reach more of our neighbours than any other form of national undertaking, whether that be sport, commerce, diplomacy or the arts. It is a key element in Australia's projection of its image to our neighbours. It rivals the BBC and Voice of America as a premier source of information to short-wave listeners, and yet it has been left to languish in virtual penury, with inadequate transmitters and, hence, weakened viability. Its audience is vast, particularly in those countries near our shores-throughout Asia and the Pacific. Its role following the Tiananmen tragedy was to establish that the truth was being denied to Chinese citizens by their own media. Listeners also tuned in to Radio Australia following the democratic turmoil in Fiji and the disruption to its media.

       <para>
        Over six months have passed since the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that he had asked the responsible Ministers, which included Senator Evans, to urgently provide options for action on Radio Australia's inadequate transmission facilities. His request was for immediate, albeit temporary, measures to be adopted to improve Radio Australia's signal into northern China. However, on 7 December, Senator Evans' answer to my question concerning Radio Australia demonstrated his total ignorance on the subject and indicated nothing more than inaction on the part of this Government. That is despite the fact that Senator Evans was one of the responsible Ministers who had been asked to urgently provide options for action.

       <para>
        Following the June massacre in China, Radio Canada International, which had never previously broadcast there but had planned to do so from April 1990, took steps to provide an immediate service. Its efforts to provide regular services took less than four months, and on 1 October it was broadcasting strongly into China following arrangements with NHK in Japan. Meanwhile, Australia continues to drag the chain. Senator Evans's supplementary reply yesterday that `There are no immediate practical options for significantly improving Radio Australia's signal coverage to northern China from within Australia' could quite easily be applied to Canada. Yet lack of geographical proximity did not stop Canada from making alternative arrangements in the short term and in less than four months to ensure that broadcasts from Radio Canada International went into China.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since commencing broadcasts to China in 1956, Radio Australia has built a substantial audience but, following the brutal oppression of human rights in June, it is imperative that the Federal Government provide Radio Australia with sufficient funding to enable it to transmit at sufficient power not to be jammed by the Chinese dictators. Six months is more than sufficient time for the Federal Government to take steps under these circumstances, but it appears that procrastination, unfortunately, is the order of the day.
       </para>
       <para>
        Radio Australia has survived five major reviews in 14 years and recent recommendations that immediate attention be given to the development of cost effective proposals aimed at preventing the degradation of programs transmitted from Shepparton and Darwin have been proposed. The ABC has agreed and recommends that there be an immediate development of a site in northern Queensland to cover the Pacific and East Asia; that there be established an offshore facility to transmit to northern China: and that the provision of additional transmitters at Darwin should redress current levels of downtime into South East Asia. Of course, these and other necessary refurbishments will cost money-and lots of it. The current state of Radio Australia's transmitters have been a national and international embarrassment, requiring some $30m to upgrade them to the point of efficiency. But, despite placing Radio Australia regularly under the microscope with the same old transmission problems being exposed, the Government remains locked in its intractable position. This Labor Government lacks the conviction to provide increased funding for a very necessary facility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite widely publicised and emotional protestations by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) following the Tiananmen incident, nothing has been done to ensure that Radio Australia's transmissions to the north are improved, so that the people of China can be assured of hearing the truth about their brutal regime. It is fairly evident that, due to the limited transmitter capacity which Radio Australia has at its disposal for broadcasts to the Asia Pacific region, a system of priorities operates. Under this system, the South and South West Pacific, with its limited population, enjoys first priority, followed by South East Asia, while north Asia-China and Japan-with its massive population, comes a poor third. In fact, Radio Australia risks losing an audience of some 25 million people simply because of inadequate transmission facilities into northern China. This is because the service's Chinese operations are broadcast from 15- and 21-year-old transmitters sited in Darwin and Carnarvon, which are now simply inadequate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order for Radio Australia to maintain parity with Voice of America and world service programs, it should be operating 365 days a year on up-to-date equipment. In comparison, the BBC has just spent some $15m to install a new relay station in Hong Kong and in the United States, the State Department's funded Voice of America, has invested $100m in upgrading its short wave transmitters. Radio France International has also increased its budget, up 45 per cent over the past three years and Radio Netherland and Deutsche Welle are also currently expending vast sums in the expansion of their world broadcasting facilities. Radio Australia continues to operate outside this mainstream using outmoded and inadequate equipment, locking itself into the role of a regional broadcaster with its targets firmly set. Can honourable senators imagine Channel 9 or any other of the Australian television stations using 20-year-old equipment?
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite a seven-month ABC review, which was completed in October, finding out once again that the reliability of Radio Australia's transmissions was more than doubtful and that this impacted on its overall viability, Radio Australia continues to battle wearily on. Its successes are many and, despite being unceremoniously dragged into the bureaucratic bunfights which are regularly inflicted on it, it has managed to reach this well-respected and, some would say, wise age of 50. Set up in 1939, the original objective was to counter Nazi Germany's propaganda and to give the nation `an independent voice with which to present the allied cause and carry news of home to Australian servicemen stationed overseas'. When Prime Minister Menzies opened the then Australia Calling's inaugural broadcast, with the words `the time has come to speak for ourselves', he set in concrete a solid future for the projection of Australia's national image.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, Radio Australia, although celebrating a birthday today, has been chronically under-resourced for the most part of the past 20 years. Its 220 journalist, announcer and operator staff produce some 18,000 radio hours per year, of what is primarily a reliable news service and programs promoting Australia's culture and its public issues, for about $600 per hour-which non-one can deny is a very economical operation. Mail has tended to reflect the course of political events in the regions receiving broadcasts and during the 1950s and 1960s, most of Radio Australia's mail came from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, but in the early 1970s, letters temporarily increased from Burma, only to wane and build up again later.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be noted that, following decisions taken by China in 1978 to modernise, some 70,000 letters a month awaited the resident ABC correspondent based there. Even today, Chinese listeners contribute by far the greatest number of letters-nearly 80,000 letters were received from China in 1988-which is about 44 per cent of all listener mail received by Radio Australia. It will be a great shame for Australia if the Hawke Government does not display the courage, conviction and tenacity and put its money where its mouth is. Radio Australia may be continually praised for being a terrific asset, but it will continue to be a national disgrace unless positive action is taken on its transmitters.

         —It is with enormous sadness that Australians today heard the continuing news of the massacre that occurred in Timisoara, Romania on the weekend. The first reports yesterday had hundreds of innocent Romanian citizens killed by the Army of Romania after protesting the inflexible and overbearing totalitarianism of the Ceausescu Government in that country. Today's report from Yugoslavian news agencies states:

        The Senate passed a motion today condemning this massacre and called upon the Romanian Government to adhere to the civil rights commitments, such as the Helsinki Accords, which that country has subscribed to.

        I am conscious tonight not only that this motion was adopted unanimously by the Australian Senate, but also that it would have been supported by thousands of Australians and not least those who have immigrated to this country from Transylvania. This terrible tragedy is the worst news that has come from any country with regard to the suppression of the rights of a country's citizens since the dramatic and equally tragic news of the massacre in Tiananmen Square in Beijing by the Chinese Army on 4 June last. It also occurred on a weekend. We are still very conscious of that terrible event. We are also aware that the Government of Romania, without any kind of apology, publicly applauded the actions of the Chinese Army and Chinese Communist Party leaders who called for that action in Beijing in June. Here we see a similar brutal ruthlessness by the last Romanian Stalinist totalitarian dictatorship in Europe. It is a great contrast to the refreshing waves of new freedoms achieved by the peoples of eastern Europe, especially in Poland, Hungary, in the last fortnight in Czechoslavakia and, to some extent, in the Soviet Union. We have this barbaric, retrograde and totally abhorrent action by this totalitarian government in Romania. The city of Timisoara is the fourth largest city in Romania. It is situated towards the western extremity of that country, about 50 kilometres from the Hungarian border and about 50 kilometres from the Yugoslav border. It is quite distant from the capital, Bucharest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some 20 years ago as a post, graduate student in Europe, I visited this part of Romania. I remember with great affection the welcome given to me by the ordinary people of Romania. I travelled from Bucharest to Sighisoara where I stayed several days, to Cluj in the centre of a broad valley in Transylvania, and to the north of Timisoara I came to Hungary. Between 10 and 20 years ago I was all the more conscious of a refreshing realism and progressive acceptance of human rights that were expressed by some aspects of the government in that country. At that time it looked as though Romania was one of the progressive countries that would not only increase trade with other parts of the world and every kind of intercourse, but also would accord rights to its own people. But the last decade has been one of enormous tragedy to the people of that country. It has reversed any feelings of encouragement that we had felt 10 or 20 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        The repression has been especially felt by those individuals, families, communities and institutions which have had a foundation to challenge the conforming nonsense of this totalitarian communist regime. I mention in particular the church and minority communities, especially the Hungarian minority of several millions which used to predominate in Transylvania. That province used to be an integral part of Hungary earlier this century-in fact it had been for many centuries. So the ethnic community whose language, naturally, is Hungarian, has been one of the groups seen to be challenging the power of the communist government in Bucharest which is led by President Ceausescu. The ageless affirmations of the Christian church in Romania have also been seen-and rightly so-as a challenge to the government of President Ceausescu. It is not surprising that when this ruthless, brutal regime chose its time to repress the people yet further it acted in Timisoara last weekend against a popular Christian priest who had gained the ear not only of the Romanian peoples, but also of the Hungarian minority within Romania. It is the case that when the police tried to arrest this popular priest and human rights campaigner, Laszlo Tokes, the crowds tried to defend him and to stand up for their spokesman, the one who had represented their views. Tragically, as is reported, government tanks and helicopters with automatic fire mowed down the people in that demonstration of support for a popular and honourable man.

       <para>
        I stand in the Senate tonight-together with those who spoke on the motion which we all adopted this afternoon and with all Australians, not least Transylvanian and other Hungarian emigres to this country-to protest yet again the suppression of the rights of this Christian spokesman and of the peoples of Transylvania and Romania.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the time that is available to me in this adjournment debate, I wish to refer briefly to a speech I made in the first week of November a year ago. I delivered to the Senate one of the largest petitions brought to the Senate last year. It bore 5,247 signatures and was from the Hungarian Association in my State of South Australia. It was protesting the decision by the Government of Romania to obliterate 7,000 villages in Romania. There are only 13,000 villages in that country. The Government of Romania had ruthlessly decided that, in order to bring the Hungarian minority into line, it would destroy their culture and their villages; it would rip the soul out of the community in Transylvania. Accordingly, it was without surprise to me that there was such an enormous response by those who understood this matter. Being conscious of the fact that I had visited Romania, they brought their petition to me to present to the Senate. At that time I noted that a few months earlier I had greatly protested the visit to this country of President Ceausescu.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the 12 years I have been a senator, I have attended very happily all of the state occasions when we have had dinners, lunches, or occasions to recognise the visit of a president or a prime minister to this country. The only occasion that I have felt it was just and right not to attend was when in April 1988 President Ceausescu of Romania, this dictator, so wrongly was the guest of the Government of this country. Senator Button this afternoon in his speech supporting the motion that we have all agreed to, gave the excuse that a general invitation had been extended to President Ceausescu some decade earlier and that the government of the day, led by Mr Hawke, had felt some obligation to live up to that invitation in the year of our Bicentenary. But I see that as an excuse. I see Senator Button and the Government members wanting to draw away from anything to do with that disgraceful week in the history of this Parliament in terms of those we have accepted here. It was well known last year that this regime was brutalising and denying its own people their rights and that Ceausescu was villainous and was using Stalinist methods to suppress the people of his own country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not detail all of my speech made on 4 November 1988, but I note that just today one of the most famous intellectual Romanians, Eugene Ionesco-a playwright, born in Bucharest who, as a child, went to live in Paris, France, with his parents, then went back as a student to Bucharest and taught in the university there for some years-today said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Ceausescu is a madman, his wife-
       </para>
       <para>

        thirsty for power, is also mad and his son is an idiot and it's these three people who are being allowed to freely torture 23 million people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure that he did not say this lightly. It is a great tragedy that, when even the Communist Party alleges that it is supporting a democratic process, Romania has a father, a wife and a son acting against anything that could be interpreted as democratic principle and applying their own personal views and whims on the people of their own country, to their great harm.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ceausescu is visiting Iran at the moment. He had the temerity today to give a speech at a banquet in Iran in which he said that his country's social and economic position was `good, stable and balanced'. That is a lie, a lie and a lie. There is no soundness either in this man or in his government. The enormous tragedy of this repression of the ordinary people of Timisoara and of Romania will take its toll upon that man, his government and the police state that he operates.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was with obscenity that Australians see the central committee of the Communist Party of Romania standing and clapping its President in a recently televised excerpt of support for the policies which were to stand against all that is happening in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany. I believe that it is impossible eventually to restrain truth, justice and the rights of the people, and it will not be long before the people of Romania win justice and freedom.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only a matter of weeks ago Mr Honecker, the former President of East Germany, was also praising the actions of the Communist Party Government in China for its actions in Tiananmen Square. He and Ceausescu were alone in the whole world in doing that. Already, Honecker has been expelled from his own Communist Party. He is in disgrace; he is accused of corruption. Even his successor is no longer in office, such is the rapidity of the effects of the disgust of the people of East Germany for the Government that so mismanaged their affairs. I look to the day, which will not be far off, when the people of Romania see the same kind of just and sound outcome for their own country.
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking tonight, I am aware of the thousands of Australians, especially those who lived in Transylvania-indeed, in all of Romania-who, I am confident, share the views that have been expressed by so many senators in the Senate today. I can only urge, as I did both a year ago and two years ago, the Government of this country to act together with other countries in taking international action to apply pressure to the Government of Romania to ensure that the human rights of its people are safeguarded and that we will not see this kind of barbarity and uncivilised and terrible tragedy ever occur again in that country.

         —Interestingly, in 1989 the Mount Lesueur proposed conservation reserve faces a similar struggle for survival as that which the Fitzgerald River area faced some 20 years ago. Fortunately for the world and for all Australians, the proposed mining of the Fitzgerald River area, which was vigorously opposed by conservationists and others, did not proceed. Today, the Fitzgerald River National Park is considered to be one of Western Australia's great national parks and is an internationally acclaimed biosphere reserve.

        Unfortunately, Western Australian governments seem to have learned little from that episode when nature conservation values were pitted against short term dollar gains. If they had, farmers, fishermen, conservationists, scientists and unionists would not now find it necessary to campaign to prevent Mount Lesueur being mined for coal with the prospect also of a coal-fired power station being built there. The justification of this proposal, which apparently has the support of the mining industry and the Western Australian Government, is weak indeed, given the abundance of other sources of energy which exist in Western Australia, sources which can be developed without destroying unique and rare flora. We only have to consider the natural gas pipeline which passes virtually through the area and also wind power and solar power, all of which are evident in Western Australia, as well as other forms of sustainable power.
       </para>
       <para>
        The value of the Mount Lesueur area as a national park together with its adjacent sustainable agriculture and fishing industries is the type of regional planning and development that any responsible government would be proud of and should be promoting as a showpiece not only for our State, Western Australia, but for Australia as a whole. Instead, we have all these values being threatened by a possible coalmine and power station. Not only is the coal low grade, but the huge draw on the underground water required for a power station could well adversely affect established and sustainable agriculture, which is well-established in that region.
       </para>
       <para>
        The botanical values of Mount Lesueur have been known since the early settlement of Western Australia. As far back as 1950, James Drummond, the first botanical collector to visit the area, is said to have called it his El Dorado. Since then, successive scientists have reiterated the praise as each survey adds to their knowledge of the area. While no Western Australian government has been able to resist the pressure of the mining industry, which has lobbied so successfully to prevent gazettal of Mount Lesueur as an A class conservation reserve, at least the Court Government in 1976 accepted the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) for the area to become a nature reserve. Despite this, and despite opposition to the granting of mining tenements by the conservation movement, exploration tenements were granted at Mount Lesueur. The existence of substantial coal deposits has been known for many years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Burke Government, a review of mining activity in respect of conservation reserves and reserve proposals was undertaken and a report was provided to the Minister for the Environment. With regard to Mount Lesueur it stated that the State Conservation and Land Management (CALM) Department places the highest conservation value on the area, particularly for locations that have significant coal reserves. A number of alternatives have been discussed but the situation remains virtually at an impasse.
       </para>
       <para>
        Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd (CRA) in 1989 officially notified the EPA that it wished to proceed with a coalmine and power station at Mount Lesueur. The Department of Resources Development came to the assistance of CRA in a report in favour of the proposed development on the basis that the privatisation of power supply would help restructure the industry and improve productivity and thus achieve lower electricity tariffs for Western Australia. A further report by CALM scientists dated July 1989 documenting the international significance of Mount Lesueur and the need for A class conservation protection of the whole area-approximately 28,000 hectares-has been suppressed. All attempts by myself and several others to obtain copies of the report have failed. The fear in the community is that the report will be doctored to suit the needs of CRA and the Western Australian Government should the Government ever allow its release. This fear is reinforced by the hip-pocket reaction of the Chairman of the EPA to a statement by Dr Christine Sharp on 22 November reported in the West Australian. Dr Sharp was appointed to the Western Australian Environment Protection Authority in October 1989, the first woman ever appointed. Dr Sharp has a long history of conservation activity as well as of being a farmer and tree planter. But Dr Sharp made one mistake: she dared to state publicly what scientists and public servants alike have said behind closed doors. The West Australian article of 25 November stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interview, on the morning of her first EPA meeting, Dr Sharp said she believed the power station-plans for which include mining coal at nearby Mt Lesueur-should not go ahead.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Sharp believes that the Mount Lesueur power station should not go ahead and that, instead, the Government should strongly encourage renewable power generation. The Chairman of the EPA, Mr Barry Carbon, just three days later responded to such honesty by disqualifying Dr Sharp from assessment of the CRA mining proposal. I quote again from the same West Australian article. Mr Carbon said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have determined that Dr Sharp will take no part in any discussions, deliberations, or decisions relating to the forthcoming review of the Hill River power station.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Sharp's comments caused uproar in the mining industry. As yet, no public servant has spoken out publicly in defence of freedom of speech for Dr Sharp. Members of the voluntary conservation movement have, thankfully, expressed their abhorrence of the intimidatory tactics used.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe, bearing in mind that a Labor government is in power in Western Australia, that the situation is an extraordinary demonstration of just how politicised government agencies have become. We know a lot in Western Australia about WA Inc. It is extraordinary that scientists are muzzled and their careers and jobs are in jeopardy should they speak out, or, in fact, even whisper the truth. It is extraordinary that a person appointed to enhance the environment is disqualified from speaking the truth. Dr Christine Sharp was merely restating the EPA conservation assessment of 1974, restating what eminent scientists such as the Government Botanist, Charles Gardner, said in the 1950s, and the Academy of Science in 1962. The context has changed, but not the facts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both the Western Australian Government and the EPA stand condemned for not prioritising implementation of the recommendation that Mount Lesueur be an A class conservation reserve and they stand condemned for allowing the mining proposal to proceed to the stage it is now at. Exploration has already damaged the area, but, from what I have seen with my own eyes, I believe that the situation is not irretrievable. Not only will a mine and/or power station destroy this botanical wonderland, but it will also threaten one of the most stable mixed agricultural regions in the State, an area where the farmers show practical day to day concern for the land which provides their living. The coalmine and power station could also jeopardise the fishing industry which is based at nearby Jurien. Indeed, the fishermen of the area have expressed very vocally their concern on this score. I am appalled that local farmers like Don and Joy Williams, who have worked tirelessly to protect seven rare eucalypts on their Badgingarra farm at their own expense, and who this year won the John Tonkin Greening Australian Gold Tree Award-people with an abiding commitment to land care-have to devote time, energy and funds to opposing the mine and power station proposal, a proposal which any government committed to sustainable development would by now have rejected.

        I cannot believe that the commitment of Senator Cook, Senator Richardson and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to `Our Country Our Future' will dissipate into smooth words and lame excuses when it comes to the future of Mount Lesueur. Mount Lesueur undoubtedly qualifies as a biosphere reserve. Senator Cooks' public commitment to the use of constitutional powers where co-operation with the States to uphold environmental protection fails may well be put to the test at Mount Lesueur. I urge Senators Cook and Richardson to avail themselves of all the scientific reports on Mount Lesueur and to view the video produced by the Lesueur Community Group. Western Australian is not quite so bankrupt that it needs, or should be allowed, to destroy one of the world's treasures in order that electricity costs might be marginally reduced. It is far too high a price to pay.

The Letter of Intent was signed by the then Deputy Director of the Antarctic Division, Mr Rex Moncur. The letter was referred to my office for approval prior to it being signed.

       Federal cabinet has approved the Commonwealth Government entering a charter for a research vessel to be deployed in the Antarctic and pursuant to this approval it is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to award P&amp;O Polar a firm ten year charter for such a vessel for use in the Antarctic subject to the negotiation of a charter acceptable to the Commonwealth which is based on:

       (5) The charter does provide for payment by the Commonwealth of the off-season lay-up costs for the Aurora Australis should it be laid up. However, this provision only applies if the vessel is actually laid up and not being used for other purposes. As far as can be established, through the checking of recent ship charters, this has not been a provision of previous time charters for ships for the Antarctic Division.

      <para>
       (8) The successful contractor along with most other bidders submitted their own specification as part of their bid. This was assessed as meeting the functional requirements of the Commonwealth. Following further negotiations the specification was refined and enhanced to provide additional functional requirements (eg ice breaking increased from 80 cm to 123 cm and passenger capacity increased from 70 to 109) and the inclusion of retractable axial thrusters to support slow speed research operations, increase manoeuvrability and provide a back up in case of damage to the main propeller. These enhancements were included in the final specifications which were agreed between the Commonwealth and the contractor on 13 October 1988.
