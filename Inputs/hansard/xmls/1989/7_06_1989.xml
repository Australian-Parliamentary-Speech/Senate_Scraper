      <para>
       We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.

       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray; that you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.

       Health Insurance
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate reject this legislation.

        The speech read as follows-

       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is to remove section 41 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 which exempts from the operation of the Act discrimination in superannuation on the ground of sex or marital status and to insert a number of more limited exemptions dealing with superannuation practices and prohibits discrimination by persons conferring dependant superannuation benefits. As section 41 also provides an exemption in regard to the terms on which insurance may be offered, the amendments have necessitated that the insurance exemption be rewritten and reinserted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process which has led to the Bill dates back to the preparation of a report by the Human Rights Commission titled ``Superannuation and Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 Part 1-Superannuation.'' That report was prepared in response to a request by the then Attorney-General, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, and was tabled in Parliament on 25 November 1986. The report was considered by the Government and the Government decided to remove the exemption and to insert into the Act certain more limited exemptions for particular practices in superannuation. Following the Government's decision, consultations on the proposed exemptions were held with the superannuation industry, employer groups, State and Territory Governments and the ACTU.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, as indicated in its National Agenda for Women, is committed to the objective of removing discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy. The major effect of the Bill is to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status in superannuation practices for new schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under the legislation, the reasonable expectations of the members will be maintained and the discriminatory fund will be allowed to continue. However such funds will not be entitled to admit new members. Further, members of such discriminatory schemes will generally have to be given an option to obtain ``non-discriminatory superannuation benefits''.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed continuing exemptions, shortly stated, deal with the following areas:
       </para>
       <para>
        the inclusion in fund conditions of a provision which is based upon reasonable actuarial data upon which it is reasonable to reply.
       </para>
       <para>
        the current practices whereby lesser death and disability benefits are provided to members who are single, that is members who do not have a spouse or a de facto spouse or to members who do not have a child.
       </para>
       <para>
        the possibly discriminatory effect of current vesting, preservation and portability arrangements in funds' conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The introduction of the Bill has been delayed to date pending the reappraisal by the Government of a proposed exemption which would have allowed funds to confine the provision of superannuation benefits to permanent and full-time employees. In January 1989 the Government decided not to proceed with this exemption. Following that decision a further round of consultations on the issue was held with the superannuation industry, peak employer bodies, State Governments and the National Women's Consultative Council. Those consultations have only recently been completed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to a brief description of the proposed limited exemptions to be inserted in the Act. Because, statistically, women live longer than men, the actuarial exemption covers the resulting difference in costs of providing a pension for women. Schemes will be able to continue to offer optional conversions between lump sums and pensions which differ by sex, so long as the difference is based on reliable actuarial data. As many superannuation benefits are provided via insurance this exemption is interlinked with the insurance exemption.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is currently preparing a Report on the exemption of insurance from the Sex Discrimination Act. The need for the actuarial exemption for superannuation will be reviewed in light of the Commission's recommendations concerning the insurance exemption.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exemption for dependent superannuation benefits is designed to allow schemes to continue current practices, whereby upon a member's death or disability no benefits are payable to a member who does not have a spouse or children. In the absence of this kind of exemption it may have been possible for a member who was single to succeed in a complaint of marital status discrimination. There are a number of reasons for maintaining this exemption. As the former Human Rights Commission noted in its Report, the exemption reflects the community's attitude that it is appropriate to make special provision for persons who have a spouse or who have children in the event of the death, or physical or mental incapacity of the members of superannuation funds. As was noted by the Commission, to provide benefits to all dependents of members on proof of financial dependency, would create difficulties both in administration and in finding a suitable objective test of ``dependency''.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the exemptions dealing with vesting, preservation and portability, the issue of discrimination arises because there is evidence that women statistically do not remain in continuous employment for the same length of time as men. Matters such as vesting, preservation and portability fall within the area of the operating standards for superannuation funds administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Regulations made under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 impose a number of operating standards with which superannuation funds must comply in order to be eligible for taxation concessions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised that current vesting standards require a superannuation fund to vest in full in a member all benefits arising from contributions made by the member and earnings thereon. The effect of this is that all member-financed benefits are fully vested.
       </para>
       <para>
        The preservation standards which require benefits to be preserved generally until retirement at or after the age of 55, apply to the following benefits (except for amounts less than $500):
       </para>
       <para>
        any vested employer-financed benefits arising from employer contributions made in accordance with an agreement or award certified or made by an industrial authority (ie the 3 per cent award based superannuation); and
       </para>
       <para>
        any new or improved vested employer-financed benefits arising from any arrangements entered into after 21 December 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The preservation standards do not extend to vested employer-financed benefits flowing from ongoing superannuation arrangements which were in place prior to 22 December 1986. They also do not extend to member-financed benefits arising from member contributions which are non-tax deductible made to employer sponsored funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of its review of retirement income policy, the Government is looking at the question of whether improved vesting and preservation standards should be developed in respect of superannuation funds. The issues are discussed in Social Security Review Issues Paper No. 6, ``Towards a National Retirement Income Policy,'' which was released for public comment last year. Submissions and comments on the paper are currently in the process of being assessed by the Government. It is to be noted that any improvements that are introduced would have the effect of reducing any indirect discrimination in vesting and preservation arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides in clause 3a that section 14 of the Principal Act will be amended to make it unlawful for a person who exercises a discretion in relation to the payment of a dependant superannuation benefit, for a member of a superannuation fund to which the provisions of 41a of the Bill apply, to discriminate on the grounds of sex and marital status. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that trustees, when deciding who should receive such benefits, consider the circumstances of all the potential beneficiaries rather than making their decision purely on the basis of a person's marital status. For example, it will not be lawful to pay a death benefit to a current de facto spouse, purely because of a fund policy to always pay such benefits to the current spouse.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the provisions of the Bill which are designed to protect the existing expectations of members in superannuation schemes. Proposed section 41b will enable schemes which cannot or do not wish to comply with the new requirements of s41a to continue to provide benefits for existing members, providing that members of these funds have the option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may however grant an exemption from this requirement pursuant to section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. This will enable trustees or employers to apply for an exemption where it is clear that it would not be beneficial for members to join a new scheme or obtain non-discriminatory benefits. It will not be necessary that members actually be offered the opportunity to join a new scheme, as it will be sufficient, for the purposes of the option, that existing members be offered the option to obtain benefits which would comply with proposed s41a.
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed section 41c will enable regulations to be made to repeal section 41a or 41b. This provision reflects the Government's commitment to progressively moving to a truly non-discriminatory superannuation industry. This provision continues the status of existing subsection s.41 (1) of the Act which could be repealed by regulation. The Government believes that this provision will encourage the superannuation industry to progressively remove discrimination in the terms upon which superannuation is offered. Regulations under s.41c will only be able to be made after consultation with industry and will not come into operation until 1 year after their making.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposals put forward in this Bill should not impact upon Government expenditure. However it is anticipated that Commonwealth schemes will be amended in separate legislation to comply with the Act by the time of the commencement of the amending Act. These changes may have some effect on Commonwealth expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Superannuation is a very technical area of the law and the issues of discrimination which may arise may vary from case to case and industry to industry. The Attorney-General has therefore written to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner requesting that guidelines be published on issues which have not been specifically addressed in these amendments. Where trustees or employers feel that they should be exempted from a particular requirement of the Act they may apply to the Commission for an administrative exemption under s.44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. Decisions by the Commission under s.44 are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that the amendments outlined above represent a significant reform. While I am informed that most schemes will be able to comply with the new amendments with only minor adaptations to their existing conditions, the amendments will require schemes which have not yet improved their benefits to do so over the next two years, or to close off their membership. Further the amendments are likely to increase the opportunity for part-time employees to gain access to superannuation. This will significantly improve the opportunities for women to build up a worthwhile superannuation entitlement over their working lives. A large majority of part-time employees are women and it is clear that women tend to return from child rearing to part-time employment. Where part-time employees are performing the same duties as their full-time counterparts and the full-time counterparts receive superannuation, it is likely that a Court would find that a failure to provide access to superannuation to such part-time employees unlawfully discriminatory.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments should therefore be viewed in light of the Government's commitment to increasing superannuation coverage for the Australian workforce. Arbitrated superannuation awards are providing increasing superannuation coverage. These amendments will not only encourage this development and help Australia make appropriate provision for its ageing population, but the benefits which will be offered will be fairer and more equitable and in line with the Government's commitments under the National Agenda for Women.

        The Opposition moves this one amendment to the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill in relation to the payment of fees. The whole reason for this Bill is to justify the excessively bureaucratic structure which has now been put in place, requiring the granting of permits, variations of permits and licences, supposedly in the name of regulating the industry. But from our perspective, and I believe from the perspective of the market, it is a cumbersome and unnecessary approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are essentially two ways that one can go in seeking to scrutinise an industry which is dynamic and fast moving. One is to take the bureaucratic approach, whereby we keep a piece of paper attached to everything that moves and closely scrutinise any changes which might be sought by way of application for variation of licences and permits. The other way is to stand back and take essentially the market approach, which would involve simply taking action where it is necessary. We do not see that there are any players in the game who are likely to transgress deliberately. To the extent that they accidentally did so, they would be very susceptible to advice proffered by Austel. If they were to disregard such advice, they could clearly have action taken against them by way of Federal Court injunctions or actions for damages in due course by any one of the carriers. We think that regime would effectively ensure that there was proper scrutiny of the industry and, therefore, an adequate degree of supervision. We do not think the bureaucratic solution, which involves a whole series of permits, licences and variations, is necessary. This Bill is just a self-serving excuse to justify that regime by imposing licence fees which can then be used to fund the additional public servants who will be required to supervise the licences. Therefore, we have moved that paragraphs 4 (2) (a) to 4 (2) (d) inclusive be deleted from clause 4. That would mean that there would not be a need for the payment of fees in respect of value added services, private network services, or customer premise equipment, or, indeed, for variation or registration of those services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, we understand that if one is committed to such a regime, one will obviously want to tax it to garner revenue to fund that bureaucratic solution. The Government and the Democrats have combined to ensure that that sort of regime remains in place. Nonetheless, we want to make it clear that we do not approve of that solution or see the need for the payment of fees. We would certainly move accordingly.

         —The Australian Democrats do not support this amendment. It is another in the category of amendments-of which there have been many in the process of debating this package-in which Senator Alston is putting to us a new twist on an old story. The new twist is that he is saying, `Trust us; we are not from the Government'. Basically, he is suggesting, as he did in relation to another amendment last evening, that we ought to take self-regulation on trust and that those private sector groups which in a sense are going to plug in to the public network can be trusted not to do anything that would be unacceptable or damaging to the network, which they will feed on and out of which they will make profits. In typical fashion, Senator Aston proposes, by way of this amendment, that no system will regulate that process or charge fees appropriately for that sector which is going to use a publicly provided infrastructure facility by way of the communications network.

         —I do not wish to delay the Committee unnecessarily but I have to correct what I presume is yet another accidental distortion or misunderstanding. I put to the Committee that there is an alternative regime that involves overall supervision and requires Austel to exercise its statutory obligations and to take action where necessary. Clearly Senator Powell is not aware of the long and protracted debate in the United States of America over the last decade or more involving what was colloquially known as `harms to the network'. The outcome of that was that there were very few instances of any carrier or provider of telecommunications services wishing deliberately to sabotage the network or infringe beyond the letter of the law. The simple reason for that, and the reason why we say one can trust the market-in contradistinction to the Australian Democrats, who have a deep and abiding hatred of anything that is market-oriented and believe that the only solution is one predicated upon continued market failure-and the proper solution, is that we do have a regulator with absolute powers where necessary to take action to restrain.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That in itself is perhaps the single most powerful instrument if it is necessary to deter improper behaviour. But at the end of the day, if people are in the business for the long term, surely it is in their own self-interest not to do anything that would damage the integrity of the network or to infringe beyond a network boundary. Otherwise people will find themselves involved in protracted litigation and, at worst, put out of business.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be a number of cases at the margin, especially with technological change occurring as rapidly as it is, where it will be necessary to have test cases to define those boundaries. The way to do that has got nothing to do with the imposition of licence fees, permit fees and variation fees; it has got a lot to do with making judgments about where the boundary line ought to be drawn. That can be done just as simply by people approaching Austel for advice and, if necessary, Austel seeking restraining orders until the position is clarified. None of that has anything to do with fund raising.
       </para>
       <para>
        This whole regime which is predicated on the need to somehow be involved in every bit of change and movement in the industry can only slow down the process and ultimately only result in Telecom being made prematurely aware of any changes in the system. This will give it not only the first mover advantage but also a decidedly unfair advantage in terms of its privileged access to information. I do not have the blind confidence that Senator Powell seems to have that we can assume Chinese Walls in Telecom but we should not trust anyone out in the marketplace. If anything, I think the situation ought to be reversed, simply because of the structural dynamics. There are inevitable and irresistible temptations for a monopolist to abuse that market power.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyone who is familiar with the Tytel case will know that Telecom persisted in maintaining that it was not susceptible to the Trade Practices Act and engaged in an elaborate regime of locating equipment manufacturing offshore and importing from places which would minimise the duty payable. I would have thought that Senator Powell would regard that as anti-social behaviour. But no, she will undoubtedly spring to the defence of Telecom and say that anything that a public sector entity does is right and proper by definition; while anything that the private sector does must be treated with deep and abiding mistrust. We say that is not so. The incentive structures operate in quite the opposite direction. Telecom, as a monopolist, is put into that invidious situation where the temptation is irresistible.

What we will do is beat up a big scare campaign about privatisation'. That is perhaps a fairly shabby and predictable political strategy, which Senator Messner quite rightly identifies, but I regard it as totally dishonourable and indicative of the sort of expedient and opportunistic political approach that the Democrats take to this issue. They have shown no willingness at all to come to grips with very complex issues and understand the complexities of the market. They have shown no ability to comprehend the experiences of other Western countries which have gone down this very same path and have no apparent awareness that throughout the rest of the Western world the telecommunications industry is being opened up on all fronts to the point where, once this package goes through, Australia will now have the most conservative and regulated telecommunications environment amongst the developed countries of the Western world.

        Senator Powell seems utterly oblivious to any of that. She does not understand why it is happening. She probably thinks that it should be treated with suspicion and distrust. She is obviously not concerned with what we are concerned about, which is to introduce as much competition as possible in order to drive down the cost of the services and minimise the inefficiencies that palpably exist, even on Telecom's own concessions, in the customer access network and the way in which the first mainframe monopoly has operated to date. Senator Powell's uncritical approach is not shared by anyone in industry or business or anyone who has any understanding of the telecommunications industry around the world. It is a cheap, populist approach, a frantic endeavour to somehow whip up a bit of a scare campaign and pretend that the Democrats are the big, bold defenders of Australia's largest business entity. If they are in the business of supporting big business without criticism, I am very interested to hear about it. But, of course, they are not; they spend most of their time deploring multinationals and trying to kick all the larger--

         —That is right. All the larger business enterprises, if they are in the private sector, are by definition threatening and dishonest and need to be restrained at all costs. Of course, the Democrats will be vigilant in making sure that there are no excesses or tax minimisation schemes, that there is no unfair treatment of employees and that big business operates properly and fairly. But when it comes to public sector big business the Australian Democrats have never a word of criticism, even to the point where we had that pathetic display last night of Senator Jenkins wandering in here to retail some anecdotes about her own experiences in Western Australia. That was all in order to demonstrate that somehow Telecom is beyond reproach. I want to make it clear that we have said time and again that Telecom has a very efficient board, and it has some top people in its management structures. It is an enterprise poised to go. It is a tiger in a cage and this Government will not let it out of the cage. If it were able to get out and perform in the competitive jungle it would do very nicely indeed. One has only to look at the experiences of NTT and American Telephone and Telegraph, or AT and T, to see what first mover advantage is all about. The dominant carrier will continue to dominate the industry. There is no suggestion that Telecom will be under threat. As I have said repeatedly, Telecom has money coming out its ears. If it can keep its net operating profit this year below $1 billion, I will be amazed and I will want to call in the stewards and check its accounting procedures.

        In conclusion, yet again the Democrats seem determined to misunderstand the approach that economic rationalists on all sides of the political spectrum except the far Left-that clearly includes the Democrats in this instance-appreciate is necessary. Unfortunately the Government is hidebound and constrained, as it has been in a whole range of areas when it has attempted to embark on meaningful micro-economic reform. The great tragedy is that it did not even bother to try in this area. The conservatives have held the day from the outset. Mr Willis, I am sure, has no thought at all of looking positively at what is happening around the world. Obviously the Democrats are not interested in finding out about it. To the extent that they do, they simply see in it more evidence that the citadel is crumbling and they are determined to go on with their uncritical defence of government business enterprises. We are not in the business of putting them out of business; we are in the business of making them more efficient and more competitive. We do not believe that this new regime of wholesale licences and payment of fees at all stages will do anything to free up the industry or to ensure that consumers and telecommunications customers get a better deal. I regret that the Democrats are not prepared to read or understand about this very involved and difficult area. I sympathise with Senator Powell to the extent that she has a number of portfolio responsibilities. Whenever I attempt to discuss these matters with her, there is always something else on her plate. That is regrettable, but it should not be any basis for her coming in here and pontificating about solutions to difficult problems in this area.

         —We have had an interesting third reading stage speech from Senator Alston which was mainly aimed I thought not so much at the amendment but at heaping abuse on the Australian Democrats with the tried and true method that they are much more sensitive than anyone else here and that if one abuses them long enough they will eventually agree to one of the amendments. There is not much point in doing it to our side because we are not so sensitive to these matters. What we saw in this particular contribution from Senator Alston did not have much relevance to this clause. Nevertheless it summed up his frustration. It was only a week ago that he stood in this chamber and accused me of spitting out the dummy. I tell Senator Alston that his performance on this Bill--

Basically what Senator Alston did-I have commended him for it before-was go to an adult education course on Telecom at Monash University, my old alma mater. One thing Senator Alston should also have done at the same time there was Statistics 1. He would have then realised that he cannot win with 34 votes and I would not have sore feet from walking to 22 divisions last night. But we are straying a fraction from the amendment. Basically the argument was put last night. If Senator Alston had won the argument last night his amendment would have great rationality. But he did not. Where a beneficiary of government regulatory action can be identified, it is our policy to recover costs when we are providing that particular benefit. We also argued that fees are not onerous and that the Government can see no good reason for not applying them.

         —I will spare the Committee any elaborate defence. However, I would like to point out that Senator Alston's remarks about the general handling of this legislation need some response. I find them extraordinarily patronising apart from being a demonstration, to use his words, of fits of pique. Just because people do not agree with Senator Alston does not mean that they have not discussed and considered the issues concerned. All he can say with any accuracy is that he was not agreed with on this occasion. That is factual. The rest of it is a load of garbage arising from the fact that Senator Alston is obviously not satisfied with having tied up the Parliament for an inordinate length of time and also he has had to find some sort of whipping person and he has found him. Fair enough. I do not accept the patronising approach that suggests that the Democrats had too much to do. Certainly he may feel a bit put upon that people do not agree with him. He knows that he is not agreed with, that his view is not agreed with. We chose not to take up extensive time of the Parliament in this matter. We chose to put our position clearly at the beginning and then to let matters flow. It is a shame that the time of the Parliament has been so abused by this process. I hope that what might have been a new shining light on the front bench can toughen up a little bit and take it a bit better in future.

         —The Government does not accept the amendment. In saying that, I do not want it to be believed or understood that there are ideological grounds, if you like, for saying that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) should remain in public ownership forever. Because it was once appropriate for it to be in public ownership does not necessarily mean that it should always be in public ownership. That is a matter for examination from time to time on the basis of the facts and the circumstances of the organisation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government would say that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill, providing for a corporatised structure of SMEC-if that is the right expression-is appropriate at present because SMEC still fills an important flag carrier role. Its reputation both in Australia and particularly internationally has been an important one in that regard. It has already assisted a number of Australian engineering organisations to obtain a foothold overseas. What we have seen in the last few years in this country is something which just was not there perhaps five years ago. We have seen the development of big consulting engineering firms in Australia such as Kinhills, Rankines and MacDonald Wagner which, in time, will probably fill the same sort of function in international markets as SMEC has done traditionally.
       </para>
       <para>
        SMEC is a national asset with 85 per cent of its work overseas-a higher proportion than any other private sector consulting firm at this stage of Australian history. It is an exporter of overseas services, providing significant export income for Australia. It has an outstanding reputation for excellence and in that context currently there is still a role for it to play in government ownership. That is not to say that SMEC has been without difficulty. Senator Lewis and I have had occasion to discuss this issue in the Senate. SMEC has recently returned to profitability and it is expected to resume paying a dividend to the Government this year. As far as the Government is concerned, there will be no more capital advances made to SMEC of the kind which were necessary in previous years and there will be no cost to the Government in retaining ownership of the organisation. However, in this transition phase from a period of great difficulty, which started with the downturn in 1982, SMEC has been restructuring its operations and, in our view, it should be allowed to continue that process and show a record of profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the amendment moved by Senator Lewis to the motion that the Bill be read a second time, in terms of the possible sale of SMEC, the Opposition has homed in on the possibility of a management buy-out which may or may not be feasible at present. But what is lacking in that suggestion from the Opposition of a management buy-out is the possibility of competitive bids for SMEC. If one were about to sell it one would hope for competitive bids for the organisation, including the possibility of a management buy-out. By implication that suggests that the Opposition, in pursuit of what I suspect to be an ideological gismo, grabs at the management buy-out possibility because it does not see the likelihood of competitive bids at this time. For a variety of reasons the Government has determined on the course which is embodied in this Bill as being appropriate at present. For that reason we do not support the amendment moved by the Opposition.

I was touched to the quick by Senator Coulter saying that we had an ideological commitment to the privatisation of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, or any other organisation. That is not so. What I did say was that one considers the ownership of a corporation such as this at a particular time. Whether at that particular time it is appropriately in the public or private sector is a matter of judgment based on the circumstances at the time.

         —The first matter I raise in relation to the Bill is the vote by the Australian Democrats. The Democrats divided the Senate for a statistical reason. We are aware that the Democrats are producing statistics which demonstrate the number of occasions on which the Government and the coalition parties have voted together. They call divisions at a particular stage, as they did then, allegedly for an ideological reason, but in truth to have it recorded statistically. Yesterday, we demonstrated that that can be a nonsense and can blow back in their faces. Earlier today I did not call for a division, saying that it would save four minutes, but the Australian Democrats did not respond. We have noted what the Democrats did and we shall take that into account for the rest of the sittings.

        I now refer to the actual contents of the legislation. During the speech by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on the second reading, he indicated to the Senate that there would be no more capital injections of the size of those that have recently been given to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation-I take it that is a reference to the almost $12m that this Government has spent on this body since it has been in office. I put it to the Minister that the Government is at risk with regard to this body. If he examined the most recent statement of assets and liabilities and profit and loss, he would see that there are not provisions in the body's funds for contingencies. That means that if this body, which is involved in the engineering field, makes a mistake it could be subject to some action for damages, so someone is at risk and the ultimate responsibility would rest with the Commonwealth Government. Does the Minister therefore deny that the Government is at risk, because this organisation is continuing as, what will ultimately be, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth of Australia?

         —As an engineering organisation, one would believe and hope that SMEC would carry insurance against risks of the kind to which Senator Lewis referred. I recall that on one occasion in its history SMEC had a substantial claim made against it arising from some work done in Malaysia. Those circumstances are covered normally by similar engineering corporations through insurance. The purpose of the Government legislation is to put SMEC essentially in the same position as a private company. It cannot stand behind the shield of the Crown in respect of any of its operations. Those provisions are contained in the legislation and that is the intention. One of the purposes of the legislation is to see that the Government does not have some contingent liability. I do not think I can add anything to that. Similar legislation has been introduced in respect of a number of government business enterprises.

Does this mean that the Commonwealth will not in any way be responsible for its liabilities? What is the whole purpose of this proposed new section? Let me go a step further and ask: Does proposed new section 51 of the Bill not prove, if I can use that word in a particular sense, the validity of our amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time that this organisation ought to be privatised? It seems to me that, under proposed new section 51, the Government is proposing to set up a corporation that will have so many negatives about what it is not to be that it really establishes and proves that case of the coalition parties that the Government ought to divest itself of its shareholding as well.

         —Senator Lewis has maligned me by suggesting that I have not been living and breathing section 51 of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Registration for the last month. That is an outrageous slur on my character. The honourable senator is absolutely right. He read the provisions of the proposed new section which, in essence, says that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) shall not be regarded in any way as a public purpose instrumentality, which it was once, or as a public authority, which it was once in the time of the Chifley Government when it was established, pursuing Commonwealth purposes, such as building the Snowy Mountains scheme, or, subsequently, doing a whole range of things overseas. The proposed new section says that the Corporation is no longer a public sector instrumentality pursuing public purposes or the purposes of the Commonwealth. In that sense, it becomes independent of the Commonwealth.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The reason for proposed new section 51 is that the definition of a `corporation' in the Companies Code excludes `a body corporate that is incorporated within Australia or an external territory and is a public authority or an instrumentality or agency of the Crown'. The Companies Code excludes that kind of instrumentality from being a corporation for the purposes of that code. So this proposed new section is necessary for us to say that, for the purposes of the Companies Code, this Corporation will no longer be an exception; that it will have the character of any other corporation prescribed or dealt with by the Companies Code; and that it will not have the character of a public authority, instrumentality or agency of the Crown which were exempt from the Companies Code. So, by the provision of proposed new section 51, the Corporation is put in the same position as any other corporation which is subject to the Companies Code. That is necessary to ensure that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is changed in character to that of a public company, That is the reason for the proposed new section.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I might say so without offence, the honourable senator then drew what I can only describe as a long bow. Having read proposed new section 51 to the Committee, he then said, `Doesn't this prove the validity of our argument that the Corporation should be privatised and that the shareholding should be sold at this point?'. Time being what it is and in light of the discussion we had earlier, I will characterise that argument as being in the long bow category. The answer to the honourable senator's proposition is no, it does not support that view at all.

         —I want to make sure that it is properly on the record that the Minister said that the Commonwealth Government would not stand behind this Corporation if it were bankrupted. I mention that because some years ago there was an occasion in Great Britain where a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Kingdom Government went bankrupt, owing millions of pounds to various creditors. The United Kingdom Government failed to stand by that corporation. At the time I thought that was a shameful event because I would have thought that all of its creditors believed that they were dealing with the United Kingdom Government and, as such, they could allow that corporation adequate credit, for the purposes of their business arrangements, without taking the sorts of precautions that they might be tempted to take if they were dealing with what might be called a private corporation-that would include a public corporation. I think it should be publicly known that the Commonwealth Government is saying to the creditors of SMEC, `If this organisation finds itself in a situation where it is unable to meet its liabilities, the Commonwealth Government will not bail it out'. I think most creditors of this organisation, and creditors of any other organisation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth of Australia, would be surprised to discover that.

         —The answer to the question is generally no. But one has regard to the history of these organisations. One must have regard to their economic circumstances. The purpose of this legislation is to put the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in the same position as a private sector company. The fact that the Government remains a shareholder is coincidental to that process in the context of this legislation. Senator Lewis referred earlier to a lot of negatives in proposed new section 51. There are a lot of negative propositions coming out of him. I do not want to debate the matter much further. I understand his point of view, belated though it may be.

        At end of motion, add `, but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should sell the Australian Industry Development Corporation in its entirety to the private sector as soon as possible in view of the fact that the Corporation operates as a commercial enterprise and furthermore that there is no essential public interest reason for maintaining Federal Government ownership'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) the Government is establishing a subsidiary company which the Commonwealth will own as to 70 per cent and the public will own as to 30 per cent. In other words, there is to be a 30 per cent partial privatisation. The Commonwealth Government will then do precisely what it was saying it would not do in relation to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. Because the Commonwealth will be a 70 per cent shareholder, this body, the AIDC public company, will be out there in the marketplace competing with banks and other finance companies, but with 70 per cent government ownership. Whilst it will be operating as a private body in the marketplace, it will have government backing. When one considers the difficulties created by the Government's proposal, it is a nonsense. It is a sop to the Caucus back bench of the Australian Labor Party which, once again, would defy the Government's desire to rid itself of this body. Because the back bench Caucus committee would not allow the Government to sell the body, all that the Government has been able to persuade it to do is to allow it to sell 30 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This body should be in the private sector. It should not be owned by the Commonwealth of Australia. We are going through a partial privatisation measure simply because of the ideological beliefs of a section of the Australian Labor Party, and as a sop to that section of the Australian Labor Party we will see only 30 per cent of this body in the marketplace.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said in my second reading amendment, there is no essential public interest reason for maintaining Federal government ownership. This Corporation will operate totally as a commercial enterprise. In all the circumstances, when the Government is talking about the problems of a lack of capital for Australian Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd and the difficulties in overcoming those problems, the Government could divest itself of this body, sell it in the private sector, take the funds and use them for some other purpose. We would encourage the Government to use the funds to pay off part of the national debt but, if the Government wanted to, I suppose, it would not be unreasonable for it to use them to assist some other government enterprise such as Qantas or Australian Airlines. The Democrats might come up with such a proposition. In our view there is absolutely no reason why the Government should maintain 70 per cent ownership of this body. The fact that it is able and prepared to sell 30 per cent of this body to the private sector to my mind proves beyond any shadow of doubt the validity of our argument that this body should be sold in its entirety.

         —The Australian Democrats will be opposing this attachment to the motion for the second reading, for the reasons I stated before-namely, that we are opposed to the selling of Government assets as a matter of principle, which seems to have been adopted by both the Government and the Opposition. I will be interested to see whether the Opposition calls a division on this in the light of the remarks of Senator Lewis when we called a division on the Bill just completed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Lewis seems to have forgotten that the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) was a creation of a Liberal government, not a Labor government, and that it was brought into existence to help in a quasi-commercial way those industries which required financial assistance which was not generally available through normal commercial channels. Moreover, he seems to have forgotten the clear evidence that this organisation is now functioning profitably and therefore is of benefit to the Government and to the citizens of Australia. It can be sold off only once, and the Government can make a capital gain only once, whereas by hanging on to it, as long as it remains profitable it will be a source of income to the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lewis also seems to have ignored the fact that the amendments, which I understand he will be supporting, in relation to the audit processes for both AIDC's principal subsidiary and the sub-subsidiaries underneath that principal subsidiary, call for the Government Auditor to remain the auditor. The effect of this attachment to the motion for the second reading would be to privatise the body entirely. The amendments which the Opposition is proposing and which the Australian Democrats are proposing would be quite inconsistent with this amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those reasons the Democrats are not supporting the attachment to the motion for the second reading. Whilst Senator Lewis claimed that our earlier division was simply to establish the statistics, we would counterclaim that that was precisely what caused all the waste of time yesterday. We hope that he will not continue down that road and call a division on this matter.

         —The Opposition's amendment is aimed at the complete privatisation of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and acceptance thereby that there is no essential public interest requiring government involvement in an organisation such as the AIDC. The Government is opposed to this amendment. I could hypothecate to my argument now an argument that I heard Senator Button put in terms of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation a moment ago: that the Opposition has been in government for a host of years since the war and during its periods of office it has not proposed to do anything about changing the structure of the instrumentality. But as soon as we propose to change its structure, to bring in 30 per cent public shareholding, then we are accused of not going far enough. I suppose this question arises: If the Opposition really believes that, why, when it had the opportunity to do what it now says we should do, did it not do it?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to give some background to the Government's position. The AIDC was moved initially to the Industry portfolio in late 1983, when the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act was amended to expand the goal of the Corporation. The amendments at that time enabled the AIDC to provide finance for the restructuring and revitalisation of the industry and for high technology and other growth industries in order to improve the overall competitiveness of Australian industry. Since that time the AIDC has made a significant contribution to the Government's industry objectives. Its ability to provide both loans and equity capital across the spectrum of new and old industries is a key characteristic that differentiates it from other financial institutions. Because of the contribution the AIDC can make to industry restructuring plans, such as in the heavy engineering and the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, and in projects such as the anti-malaria joint venture, the Government believes that it should maintain an ongoing interest in the AIDC.
       </para>
       <para>
        In saying this, however, I quickly point out that the decisions made by the AIDC are based on its commercial judgments. On the one hand, it has not been and it will not be directed by government in its normal operations as to where it should or should not invest. On the other hand, it is, as we have already said, in need of a fresh injection of capital. The float of up to 30 per cent will overcome the problem and will provide the AIDC with sufficient capital to pursue its leading programs, particularly those related to equity. The AIDC has had an excellent record and is an attractive investment opportunity for the Australian people. The float will allow the AIDC to continue its operations and will give a wide spectrum of the community the opportunity to participate to advantage in the AIDC. At the same time, those investors will be confident of the AIDC because they know that the Government is going to continue as a major shareholder in the organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those reasons the Government does not accept the amendment moved by Senator Austin Lewis to the motion for the second reading, and we will vote against it in a division, if it comes to that.

         Senator Coulter-Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. The amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats were circulated several weeks before the Opposition amendments. As most of them are in similar terms, I believe that gives the Democrats precedence over the Opposition with respect to the moving of these amendments.

         —One of these days we will have to explain to the Australian Democrats that they are not the Opposition in this Parliament; they are a minor addition to the Australian Labor Party in the Senate. In relation to clause 1, let me put paid to the arguments raised by the Government about what the coalition parties did or did not do during the course of earlier governments. The Government says repeatedly, `We have gone this far; you did nothing in government'. The truth of the matter is that the economic circumstances of this nation have changed violently for the worse-in fact, disastrously-under this Government. Under this Government, Australia's external debt has increased by $80 billion to $103 billion in little more than six years. By its mismanagement of the economy, this Government has sent this nation down the drain by more than $80 billion. We are now in a position where this Government has to take every step possible to try to get the nation out of its troubles. That means-and we will get the opportunity to debate it this afternoon-that this Government should be taking firm steps to rectify the problems on the waterfront.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Yesterday we debated the telecommunications package and we pointed out that the Government should be taking firm steps to bring about increases in productivity and efficiency in the telecommunications industry. That is the only way. I see that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, is now back in the chamber. He agrees with everything I say. He may stand up and make smart alec speeches or excuses in this chamber, but I have heard him say to the business community exactly what I am saying to the Committee now. This nation has to increase its productivity and efficiency. We have to become sufficiently efficient and produce sufficiently high quality goods so that Australian people will want to buy Australian made goods because they are the best, not because there is some financial inducement provided by the taxpayers of this country to do so. In that way we would reduce the amount of imported goods that we buy. Similarly, we need to increase our productivity and efficiency so that overseas countries want to buy Australian goods because they are the best at the most reasonable price, the service is first class and the backup and supply of parts is first class.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government must take steps to overcome the problems which this nation is facing at present. Here we are faced with an opportunity to take another step-and that is for the Government to get out of activities in which it should not be involved. This Government should not be in the business of providing airline services or finance for companies; it should be in the business of managing the economy. Here is an opportunity for it to get out of this industry by privatising the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The Government stands up and says, `We have gone this far. We are prepared to privatise it 30 per cent and you are criticising us for not going the whole hog. But you did not do something 20 or 30 years ago'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Twenty or thirty years ago this country was not in the economic situation that it is now in. This country is sitting on the edge of an economic abyss where, if our commodity prices were to fall, the dollar would fall drastically. Senator Button smiles over there, but he knows that what I am saying is true. If the bottom falls out of the dollar, look out for this country, because we have really hit the Argentinean road. Inflation in Argentina is running at 25,000 per cent. This country is sitting on the edge of that abyss, and Senator Button knows it. We are maintaining our dollar value only by paying high interest and because of our relatively high commodity prices. The Government has to take every opportunity, whatever those opportunities are, to try to bring about an economic recovery. This legislation was an opportunity. All the Government can do is stand up and say, `Well, 10 years ago you did not do anything about it. You have been in government for 30 out of the last 40 years and you did not do anything about it'. But 30 years ago this country was not like it is now. Even 6 1/2 years ago we were not in a situation where we owed $103 billion and were going down the drain at the rate of $17 billion a year. The Government is sitting on its hands doing nothing about it.

         —The Committee is debating the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill. I mention that because people listening not in the chamber, if there are any, would have been pardoned for imagining that we were talking about something altogether different. Not only are we debating the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) legislation but we are debating clauses 1, 2 and 3, which deal with the title of the Bill, the setting out of the Bill and the contents of the Bill. Senator Lewis has used this opportunity to raise matters because in the last debate I touched him a bit when I made the point that for more than 30 of the last 40 years in this country we have been under conservative governments. Senator Lewis gets on his feet and says, `Well, you're not going to get away with that sort of stuff because in all those 30 years things were nice and now the country is in crisis'. Let me go back to some of the expressions about being on the Argentinean route that Senator Lewis used in his speech a minute ago. The books which told Australia about that, which warned Australia about that, were all published in his period of government. The Lucky Country by Donald Horne, Poor Little Rich Country by Max Walsh and Australia and Argentina on Parallel Paths were all published in Senator Lewis's period of government. The difference is that the Opposition of the day, the Australian Labor Party, read them and understood what they were about. When we came into government we started to do something about these things in terms of structural adjustment and so on, which the Opposition did not do for the 30-odd years that it was in government. It did nothing about these hard issue questions.

        Senator Lewis has talked in his speech about weaknesses in the supply side of the Australian economy. They were apparent to anybody who had his eye on the ball 15 to 20 years ago. The Opposition did not have its eye on the ball in that period of government. In a commodity dependent economy, as we have, one has to address these important supply side issues. What is the solution of the Opposition? It comes in here this morning and says, in the context of this debate, that the solution to these problems is to sell airlines and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation; and not to turn the AIDC into a 30 per cent privately owned corporation but to turn it into a 100 per cent privately owned corporation. It says that these are the solutions. It has got these solutions, in ideological terms, from the Thatcher Government in Britain. One thing about Margaret Thatcher that could never be said about Liberal governments in this country is that she had the guts of her convictions and has done these things, whether one agrees with it or not. But if one wants to talk about economies in trouble with growing overseas debt and balance of trade problems, one ought to have a look at Margaret Thatcher's United Kingdom in 1989. Has the route which she has followed solved any of these problems? If one can find an economy which is closest to an identikit economy in terms of its problems with Australia, it is in Britain. There are growing trade deficits and all those sorts of things.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I am trying to say to Senator Lewis is simply that the sorts of ideological solutions which he thinks he has borrowed from Margaret Thatcher and would apply here are not necessarily right and not necessarily productive solutions to the sorts of problems which he describes. Some of those things are probably right, some of them have merit, but let us not pretend, by coming in here and making beefy speeches on clauses 1 to 3 of the AIDC Bill, that we are, by this sort of mini-exercise in here, going to solve the problems of the world or of the Australian economy, because we are not. It is very easy to come in here and say that I go around making speeches about the need to improve productivity, design, quality and all these sorts of things. I do, and I do not retreat from that at all. All those things are correct. But when we come in here and talk about legislation in the serious sense and look at the mechanisms of it all, let us not pretend that there are any easy or glib solutions to some of these problems. I should have taken a point of order during Senator Lewis's speech because it was irrelevant to what is in this legislation before the Committee. I allowed him indulgence because I could see that he was enjoying it. There is no reason why there should not occasionally be a bit of enjoyment in this place. People are entitled to have a bit of fun. Senator Lewis was having a bit of fun, so I did not interrupt him, but I will if he tries it again and it is not relevant to this Bill.

         —I am very pleased to hear what Senator Button has just had to say. He was reflecting on the way in which, as a nation, we have failed to read the portents of history unfolding before us. He has quite correctly drawn attention to the fact that the Opposition has failed to read those signs and failed to do things in good time to redirect this country in ways which would benefit both the country and the future of the society in it. I point out to Senator Button that the portents now are very different and that this Government is failing to read the signs. I have said to Senator Button before that he has come out with a car plan which took no account of things like fuel efficiency and greenhouse warming. Later today we will be discussing legislation which will seek to reduce the export levy on coal below that which it should be. So Senator Button should take note of his own observation, namely, that we should be looking to the future, reading the signs and doing something different from that which we are now doing.

        To turn briefly to what Senator Lewis said in relation to the Australian Democrats, his wild arm waving and lack of logic is just incredible. He asserts that the Democrats are a rump of the Australian Labor Party, but he would know that our amendments are very much in line with the Opposition's amendments to this legislation. In fact, the Opposition is supporting the Democrats amendments. So on this occasion we will be lining up together. I understand that the Government will not be supporting those amendments. The fact that, in the main, we support the Government is that, on balance, we believe that the Government generally has the better arguments. We judge every issue on its merits. In this case we do not think that the Government does have the better arguments, and the Opposition will be supporting our amendments.

        I wish to respond very briefly to some of the points that Senator Button made, but I will not try to extend the debate much further. I wish to say to him that I see nothing funny about what is before the Committee and that I am not having a good time. I think this debate about the future of this nation is most earnest. I believe that the legislation before the Parliament is another opportunity for the Government to pick up some part of the solution to the problems of this nation. I certainly do not believe that there is some simple golden key which can be inserted in a lock to solve our problems. I certainly do not believe that there are some simple glib solutions to our problems. I was indicating that everything should be up for review. This country's economic problem is now of such a size that we cannot afford to allow any part of it to pass without giving proper and due consideration to what is the best way to use a particular measure to assist us out of the crisis that we are in.

       <para>
        Senator Button said that 10 to 15 years ago members of the then Opposition-by that he meant members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in this Parliament-read certain books. Let me add that while parliamentary members of the ALP may have read the books, members of the ALP in the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and in particular Mr R. J. Hawke, then President of the ACTU and now Prime Minister of this country, certainly did not. Mr Hawke took every opportunity while the Fraser Government was in office to frustrate the measures that it was trying to take to bring about recovery and solve national problems.

        It is clear from what Senator Coulter said during his point of order that the only thing that the Australian Democrats are interested in is who will be moving which amendments and who will be supporting what amendments, so that the Democrats in some way or other can manipulate this Parliament-which they will not be able to do because I will not allow them to do it-and say, `We moved the amendments and the Liberal and National parties supported our amendments'. What a pitiful performance that is. Here is the country going down the drain at the rate of $17 billion a year and the Democrats are worrying about who will move what amendment and who will support the amendment. It is pitiful.

         —I am quite happy to go along with the suggestion of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). I agree that it would probably save time. I find it quite fascinating that the Democrats claim some prior right to these amendments. That is absolute nonsense. The truth of the matter is that these amendments arise out of a report delivered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which was made on 9 March 1989. The coalition parties have considered that report and decided to adopt it in relation to the Auditor-General being the auditor of both the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the public company established under the AIDC, of which 70 per cent will be owed by the AIDC and 30 per cent will be owned by the public. This is set out quite clearly on page (xx) of the recommendations at the front of the report of the Public Accounts Committee. Recommendation 23 states:

        It is a very long report by a bipartisan joint committee of the Parliament consisting of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both sides. The coalition parties, having given great consideration to an alternative which Senator Button mentioned to me privately, finally decided that they would come down in favour of the report, including a provision in our amendments that the Auditor-General may either carry out the audit himself or subcontract out the audit to a private audit firm. At the end of the day, having given consideration to all these matters, this has been the decision of the coalition parties.

         —There has been a lot of discussion in private about this. Senator Lewis explained the background. I do not know which honourable senator moved his amendments first; I do not care. They originated from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We had a committee of the Parliament which thought that the idea of amending the Audit Act to allow all government companies, so-called, to be audited by the Auditor-General was a good idea at the time. The Audit Act has not been amended following that report of the Committee. Politicians on the Opposition side, having decided it was a good idea, wheeled it into this legislation but did not do it in respect of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let me quickly review the facts of the matter. The Australian Industry Development Corporation is a government-owned corporation. It is establishing a subsidiary company, AIDC Ltd, to which its assets and liabilities essentially will be transferred with one or two exceptions. That subsidiary company-AIDC Ltd-will be floated shortly and will enjoy subscriptions presumably by shareholders, up to 30 per cent of which will be private sector shareholders.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question is whether it is appropriate for the Auditor-General to audit that subsidiary company, AIDC Ltd. There is no doubt about the corporation itself; it will be audited by the Auditor-General. In the Government's view that is appropriately a ministerial decision and I have said that that will be the position. The main corporation will be audited by the Auditor-General. In respect of the subsidiary company which will be up to 30 per cent private sector owned, the Government's position is that it should stand in its own right and have the choice of who its auditor is. The shareholders will determine through their representatives who the auditor of a company will be. The Commonwealth will be a 70 per cent shareholder. The private sector will be a 30 per cent shareholder. We say that that company, AIDC Ltd, should have the choice of who its auditor should be.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Committee that auditors of private sector companies perform a number of other functions besides just the audit. They are often advisers to companies on a range of both structural and financial matters. A company has the capacity, if dissatisfied, to change its auditor. Senator Lewis, the great advocate of the marketplace, is saying on behalf of this bonkers Opposition that this one company will not operate in the marketplace because it is the will of the Liberal Party of Australia, that it will not be able to choose its auditor and that the Government will impose one on it. In theory if the Auditor-General wants to charge $500,000 for something which could be done by a private sector auditor for $150,000 that does not matter to the Opposition. By the will of this Opposition, which talks about the marketplace, that will be imposed on the subsidiary company. It is extraordinary stuff from an Opposition committed to all of the things which Senator Lewis was committed to five minutes ago as pointed out in his speech on the importance of the market and Margaret Thatcher and how she has done all these wonderful things in Britain. Yet five minutes later Senator Lewis took pride that he, ahead of the Australian Democrats, is moving this motion to saddle the subsidiary company, AIDC Ltd, with no choice of audit.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the principle involved. Senator Watson is now sneaking into the chamber. He is a member of the Public Accounts Committee. He was never a believer in the free market system. Coming out of the textile industry, how could he be? Nonetheless, he is a member of the Public Accounts Committee. If he comes in to speak on this issue perhaps he will enlighten us as to why AIDC Ltd, a subsidiary company, should not have the right of choice of auditor, irrespective of cost, which other companies have. Why should it be denied that? This suggestion flies in the face of what, when I use my field glasses at short distance, I divine as being Liberal Party philosophy. I have to use field glasses to see it but it flies in the face of it. That is the argument. Senator Coulter, of course, supports the Opposition's argument. They are strange bedfellows.

         —Precisely, that is the point I will make. The Opposition is trying to distinguish itself from the Australian Democrats. Senator Lewis says he believes in a free market and Senator Coulter will get up and say that he does not. He wants to saddle AIDC Ltd with this because he has this profound faith in regulation and in the lack of a free market in things like this. The Opposition and the Democrats are together on this issue. How can we govern this country with this lot coming at us from both directions with philosophies which are antiquated and barren? Senator Lewis is determined on this course. He should not make any pompous speeches aimed at me for the next week or two about how he believes in the marketplace.

         —I wish to respond to Senator Button by saying that in the just on 13 years that I have been in this chamber I have observed the activities of government business enterprises. I served for many years on a committee of the Senate dealing with finance and government operations when we analysed the statutory authorities of the Commonwealth and the problems which they can bring about when they enter the marketplace. As a result of that observation, I came to the firm conclusion that I was very concerned about government business enterprises in any way being involved in the marketplace.

If it wants to go down the private enterprise route-I thoroughly support that-let it privatise this body and let it not retain 70 per cent ownership. Then the body could appoint whichever accountants it wished to conduct its audits.

         —I apologise to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) for coming down and intruding into this debate. I do not normally do so in the committee stage but I was actually following the debate and I know that the Minister is too. The reason I intrude is the very point the Minister made very cogently. Senator Lewis's logic on this appears to be from his philosophical point of view that one might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I assume that that was the logic in what he just said. It is not very consistent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The only reason I wanted to contribute briefly to the debate is to say this: in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory conservative Government accomplished a number of quite radical things in terms of government policy which were supported at the time, I might tell Senator Lewis, by the Australian Labor Party. One of them was the complete restructuring of the Northern Territory Public Service in a way that Dr Coombs had suggested years before for the Commonwealth Public Service in providing contract employment for departmental heads. That was totally supported by me at the time.

       <para>
        One of the other accomplishments was allowing highly competent and very professional private auditors, that is accounting firms that specialise in audit, to in fact audit government accounts. That process not only allowed for proper and competent audit of the books of government agencies as well as semi-government agencies in the Northern Territory but also allowed, I am pleased to say, access by that private sector group into what is a very lucrative area of accounting. I find that startlingly inconsistent with the Opposition's philosophy. Senator Lewis's logic leaves me cold. Given the fact that this body is likely to proceed-Senator Lewis would have to concede that at the moment it appears that it will-I would have thought that the proper and responsible approach of the Opposition would be to allow the operation to proceed in a manner as consistent with Opposition philosophy as possible. I would like an explanation from Senator Lewis-a better one than he has just given-as to why the private sector, which I am sure he would concede has extremely competent, professional and highly qualified and regulated auditors, is not allowed to bid for this market in the same way as it does for others.

         —Senator Button knows that, given a challenge, particularly issued by him, I will always respond. So I thank him for offering me this invitation. What we are talking about is a loss of parliamentary control-a loss of linkage with this Parliament through the Auditor-General. Over the years, particularly those in which this Government has been in office, there has been a growth in the Executive branch of government. That growth has been associated with a decline in the power of the Parliament. I remind the Minister that report No. 296 on the reform of the Australian Audit Office has been recognised throughout Australia. The Auditor-General-the ally of the people and the Parliament-has been widely acknowledged. In fact, the major provisions of the report have been endorsed by the Liberal-National Party coalition.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also remind Senator Button that this report was compiled by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which the Australian Labor Party has a majority membership. It is a significant majority. All members of the Committee, many of whom are high-ranking members of the Labor Party, overwhelmingly endorsed that report. They were concerned about this lack of control, this lack of parliamentary linkage. They were concerned about the Government's denial of adequate resources to its own Auditor-General or, should I say, the Auditor-General of this Parliament. One of the features of the recommendations was a separation to ensure the independence of the Auditor-General from the Executive branch of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        What Senator Button is asking us to do today is the worst of both worlds. A statutory corporation, in order to get further and further away from its linkage with Parliament, is to set up its own company. But the Government is trying to remove the linkage with the Auditor-General. It believes that because there is a 30 per cent public interest the body would not be under the scrutiny of the Australian Audit Office, despite the fact that the Commonwealth will own 70 per cent. If the Government is so concerned about competitiveness and all that business, we say: privatise the organisation and we will support it; privatise it and allow the private sector auditors to compete. However, if one dollar of public money is involved, this Parliament and the Auditor-General will have a direct interest. Therefore, the amendment must be supported.

         —I thank Senator Button for pointing out the inconsistency in the Opposition's position and Senator Collins also for reiterating that. However, Senator Button's logic fell down when he said that one cannot support the same form of words for quite different reasons. I thank Senator Button for identifying the Australian Democrats as at least being consistent on this, although for reasons which he seems to have misjudged in saying that we have an ideological commitment to regulation. I go back to his earlier reference to some of the writings which were present in the late 1960s and early 1970s and draw his attention to John Kenneth Galbraith's book The New Industrial State published, I think, in 1967. Galbraith made the point that bureaucracies, whether private or public, exist to serve their own ends and, therefore, need proper checks and balances to remain in place.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The reason that the Democrats will support this series of amendments-I think we are taking them as a block-is very similar to the one which Senator Watson has just given; namely, that in the private area there is a considerable incentive to do the sorts of audits that the company seeks and not have the public interest at heart. Recently we saw the Four Corners program and Bond's company coming out of that public discussion with an adjustment of the company's annual report for the year 1988. We saw the way in which that company, apparently, has prepared for public consumption audited reports which were initially misleading and required adjustment. That indicates that in the private area there is inevitably a strong incentive to produce the sort of audit, the sort of report, that the corporation requires, whereas in the case of the government audit process that situation should not obtain. We support this series of amendments on the ground that a public interest is involved. We believe that the Government Auditor will do the job, with the interest of the public, as expressed through the government ownership, more in hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was distressed to hear Senator Button pull figures out of the air and suggest that the Government Auditor may charge half a million dollars whereas a private auditor may charge only $150,000. I want to put it on the record that he was quite clearly plucking figures out of the air. I do not think that there is any reason to suppose that the difference in cost between government audits and private audits should be that large.

         —In responding to Senator Collins's remarks, I do not think that I can put the position any better than Senator Watson put it. The issue is one of accountability to the Parliament and to the elected representatives of the people of Australia, who will hold 70 per cent of the shares in the organisation. I understand the merits of what Senator Collins said about the situation in the Northern Territory, especially with the creation of a new government. For example, if the Government were to use public accountants to audit the accounts of the affairs of the new Administration of the Australian Capital Territory, I would understand that. There could be a lot of merit in it. However, the truth is that in the Commonwealth Parliament we have established the Office of the Auditor-General. He has developed a responsibility to the Parliament. Sometimes I have been a little concerned about the exercise of that responsibility, but I am sure that, as a result of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, those responsibilities will be enhanced, increased and improved for the benefit of the Parliament. Unless the Government is prepared to go down the path of privatising this organisation in whole, it will find itself stuck with not only this organisation but also any other organisation that it wants to partially privatise with amendments such as the one before us.

        I also draw attention to our other amendment, amendment No. 2, which relates to ministerial directions being laid before each House of the Parliament. It has always been my belief since I served on the Senate committee that I referred to previously that where a Minister makes a direction to one of the statutory authorities, that direction should be tabled before the Parliament so that the people know what the relationship is between the Government and the statutory authority. For example, the Government may decide that there is an area of industry that should be given additional finance. It might decide that the computer industry in Australia might need additional finance. It directs the Australian Industry Development Corporation, or this subsidiary, to take some action with regard to interest rates or loans being made in that area. This is the sort of direction which it may wish to make. It is the sort of direction that the people of Australia are entitled to know about. We move this amendment so that the directions may be laid before the Parliament.

         —The honourable senator should let me finish. The whole idea of these proposals is to free up those regulations which restrict government business enterprises. They will make them more flexible and allow them to compete in the open market-place. This amendment imposes needless obligations on the Corporation. It is one which will put it in a disadvantaged position. Each year the Australian Industry Development Corporation provides the Minister with a corporate plan. That plan sets out the objectives of the Corporation, the overall strategies and policies to be followed. That has worked quite well over the past few years. If we look at the performance of the AIDC, we see that it has worked quite well. That corporate plan incorporates financial targets which will outline overall financial strategies, including the forecasted revenues and expenditure.

        The annual report of the Corporation includes a review of the Corporation's year. That is required to be tabled in the Parliament by the Minister. It is not necessary to table these sets of documents separately as it would impose an additional burden. Senator Lewis, by way of illustration, says that if the Government decides that it wants the AIDC to invest in the computer industry and tells it to do so, that should be a matter of public knowledge. I agree with that, but the Government does not do these things. If we look at the charter of the AIDC, we see that it is independent of ministerial direction, except under the national interest provisions where the AIDC may be directed on a particular course. But that has to come to the Parliament. If a Minister makes a determination on a national interest matter, as we did with the research and development of the malaria vaccine, then that is a matter which comes to the Parliament anyway. In all these issues about whether organisations should be in the private or the public sector the worst possible solution is to have them, in regulatory terms, half in the private sector and half in the public sector, with intrusive regulations. We oppose this amendment.

         —I take great exception to the comments of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), which must be taken as a reflection on the competence of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. They imply that the Commonwealth Auditor-General is not following current accounting practices. Therefore, it is necessary for the Minister to explain to this Parliament how the appointment of the Commonwealth Auditor-General will place `the dead hand of government' on this particular operation. We have seen how organisational arrangements, which are not dissimilar to what has been proposed here today, have gone wrong. We do not propose to allow a similar sequence of events to occur. I have great confidence in the competency and skills of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. From my close contact with him in Public Accounts Committee hearings, I cannot see how he is bound up with red tape, regulations and all the other issues of the so-called dead hand of government. I call on Senator Button to make a public apology because his comments must be construed as a reflection on the Auditor-General's competence and they imply to the people of Australia and to this Parliament that he is not following current accounting practices. I remind the Minister that if an organisation wants to go outside for other services this Bill does not preclude it from doing so. If it wants special services-personnel management services or a reorganisation-it can go outside and pay for them separately. Is the Minister implying that the organisation will get extra benefits at no extra cost as a result of an outside appointment? What does the Minister have to fear? Perhaps he could explain.

         —The new shadow Minister has just walked into the chamber and made one of his usual comments. It is not my function to apologise to anybody because Senator Watson happens to be confused. It is Senator Watson who ought to be apologising. I said a minute ago that I did not want to debate further the questions relating to the Auditor-General, and that I did not intend to do so. I then went on to say, in relation to the directions amendment in this Bill which covers an entirely different matter, that that was part of the dead hand of government intervention resting on a corporation such as this. That was part of it and that was what we had to be wary of. I think Senator Watson is an honest man, but I think he is just confused.

        In so far as the Auditor-General is concerned, the honourable senator has no proprietary rights in his view of the soundness, common sense, capability and integrity of the Auditor-General. He should not come in here making speeches charged with religious fervour about what a great bloke the Auditor-General is and what a great thing the Auditor-General's Office is. Senator Watson has no proprietary rights. I have the highest regard for the Auditor-General. After all, this Government appointed a new Auditor-General not long ago. That is not in issue. If Senator Watson wants to go around the country saying what a good bloke the Auditor-General is he should do so, but he should not see it as being relevant to the issues that we are discussing here.

       <para>
        As to the amendment relating to directions to which Senator Coulter referred, the only direction in this Bill which the Minister can give is a direction relating to the corporate plan. The AIDC presents a corporate plan each year. The Minister may, in respect of that corporate plan, give a direction. In essence, that is what the honourable senator wants tabled in the Parliament at the time when we are trying to free up regulations. That requirement has never been there before. The honourable senator wants to introduce a new burden on this organisation which has never been there in the history of the AIDC. After all, it was not a Labor government which created the AIDC; it was a conservative government. The requirement about directions has not been there before, yet the Opposition wants to introduce it now. I am surprised at Senator Coulter's lack of diligence in not having noticed that in his years in the Parliament.

         —This amendment is no burden on the AIDC. It does not hamper it or impose any heavy hand of government on it. The heavy hand of government already exists because under proposed new section 23g the Minister may direct certain variations of the corporate plan secretly. That is the point. We would like to know what the Government has done in the past, and we want to make sure that we know what it does in the future. I have had discussions with officers of the AIDC and I have been critical of them. I will give the Senate an example of the sort of interference that happens when governments stick their noses into this business. I have been critical of them for loans that they have made. I refer in particular to a joint venture that the AIDC entered into for the erection of a multi-storey building in a capital city. The AIDC provided the finance for a developer to build the multi-storey building. It and the developer then sold the building and made a very substantial profit that ended up on their books. I said, `That developer could have got his finance from anywhere. Any bank or finance company would have lent the money. Why would the AIDC enter into this venture? After all, you are making a millionaire a multi-millionaire. That is not what the AIDC was incorporated for or established for'. The response was, `But you parliamentarians require us to enter into these arrangements because of the requirement that we made a certain return on our capital every year'. So instead of being able to provide venture capital for new businesses or for some of our developing corporations-and I can think of one in Victoria at present that needs some finance-because of a particular requirement to make a particular return on capital, the AIDC has to enter into what I call absolute commercial ventures with a developer. The matters to be considered in setting the financial target are listed under proposed new section 23e which states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        (a) the need to earn a reasonable rate of return on the Corporation's capital and reserves;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) the need to maintain the Corporation's financial viability . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Proposed new section 23g provides that the Minister may give specific directions in relation to those particular matters. In other words, he can say, `Well, I find a reasonable return on your capital for this year should be 12 per cent'. Once the Minister fixes 12 per cent, the AIDC then has to target its lending arrangements to produce a return of about 12 per cent, so it cannot go into some area where there is a need for low return venture capital until an organisation gets established. I am not saying that that is wrong of the Government; it is a decision of the Government, but one which the people of Australia are entitled to know about. It is a decision of the Government which the Parliament is entitled to know about. That is why I say that it is essential that the Minister table these directions so that we all know what the targeted figure for AIDC is this year if the Government decides to alter the figure.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the AIDC does not get a direction from the Government, it may set its own targets. It is only when the Minister interferes and applies his heavy hand to the AIDC that his heavy hand will have to be exposed. That is no detriment to or burden on the AIDC. It will make sure that the Minister who is sticking his nose into this area does so knowing that his interference or direction will be publicly known.

         —It was interesting to listen to Senator Lewis because he clearly enunciated the original objectives of the Australian Industry Development Corporation in terms of venture capital and those sorts of developments which may not be able to acquire funding from elsewhere. He provided very good arguments as to why the AIDC should not be privatised. I just want to pick up on what Senator Button said earlier. I cannot allow him to get away with obfuscating the arguments over the matter of the directions being laid before both Houses of Parliament. While it is true that the AIDC was formed under a coalition government, the corporate plan to which he referred and the conditions which will obtain with respect to that corporate plan and the directions which the Minister may give with respect to that corporate plan, are clearly the initiative of this Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The policy guidelines are included in a document dated October 1987. I understand that they were tabled, and when tabled were referred to in a speech by Senator Walsh on 4 November 1987. So it was clearly an initiative of this Government and therefore it should be answerable for the reasons I have already indicated: that Government policy and the extent to which the directions conform with Government policy is clearly a matter which should come under the surveillance of the Parliament. We are supposed to keep a watchful eye on government to see whether it conforms-in itself, its policies and the directions it gives to various other companies and so on-to those government policies. Therefore, it is quite appropriate that directions be laid before each House of Parliament.

         —Senator Lewis's argument shows a degree of confusion. The charter of the AIDC, as spelt out in the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act, was established by conservative governments and not changed much by Labor governments. The charter says that the AIDC exists for the purposes of serving Australian industry objectives, but is to be a commercial operation independent of government in its commercial decisions. Everybody can make criticisms about what the AIDC has invested in. Senator Lewis referred to its investment in a certain building and said that it should not have invested in it. I cannot say anything about that, as Minister.

We either give a direction which is published here, which is meaningless, or give a direction plus the corporate plan and then we damage the organisation. That is where the bureaucratic interference problem arises. The Corporation has an outstanding record as a commercial organisation and has been the largest investor of any financial corporation of its kind in Australian industry development. It has maintained an outstanding commercial record. It is not our business to make judgments about how it does that, so long as it discharges its fundamental objectives. It was not set up to provide venture capital; we have another vehicle for that. We can each intrude our own wishes into the matter, but that will not help very much.

         —I thank Senator Durack for his question because it indicates his longstanding interest in this area of Australian commercial life. He was responsible for so much innovative work when he held the reins of the portfolio of Attorney-General some years ago. It is worth while being able to indicate to the Senate the transitional arrangements that are envisaged over the next several weeks and months in relation to the coming into effect of the will of the national Parliament as expressed by legislation passed in this place recently. There has been quite a bit of hysteria generated in various newspaper articles. It has been claimed, for example, that there is some sort of gap which will result in an amnesty for corporate crooks, and so on, which is absolute, utter nonsense. If I had time I would read out the whole article by Chanticleer in today's Australian Financial Review where the facts are separated from hysteria in the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) plan. However, I would rather answer Senator Durack's question.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is the intention of the Commonwealth to proceed to establish the Australian Securities Commission as soon as possible. Honourable senators will be aware that the State and Northern Territory Ministers on the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities have been advised by the Attorney-General of the Government's intentions; that was made clear in press reports. In the event that one or more States institute proceedings in the High Court to challenge that legislation, the Commonwealth will consider immediately the implications of those proceedings for the commencement of the various elements of the corporations legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is aware of newspaper reports that Western Australia and Queensland may be considering a challenge. I am advised that they have not yet done so, and apparently did not indicate doing so, at the Ministerial Council meeting. At that meeting the States indicated that it was up to each State to reach its own decision on that matter. The fact of some unrealised threat hanging over the package by way of constitutional challenge will not delay the Commonwealth in moving quickly to establish the ASC. This will enable the Australian Securities Commission to begin work immediately on the development of a concrete implementation plan for the Commonwealth to assume responsibility for the administration of companies and the regulation of the securities and futures industries. In addition to responding to the calls of the business community for the early resolution of the outstanding issues, the purpose of the implementation plan would be to ensure its smooth transition to the new national arrangements. The Government will not be bringing the ASC into full operation until it indicates that it is properly ready to administer those laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        To go to the heart of the question, Senator Durack and other senators will be interested to know that the present intention is for a phased introduced of the national scheme. While details have yet to be settled, the first stage of a phased introduction would most likely involve the initial operation of those parts of the new Australian laws covering takeovers and the securities and futures industries. This will give the ASC an initial focus on the important national activities in the share market. In the meantime, the ASC would be able to establish the administrative framework to assume control progressively of the other areas such as prospectuses and the registration and regulation of companies. The onus is on the States not to act to disrupt or disadvantage the business community and to cooperate with the Commonwealth in an orderly changeover to the new arrangements. We believe that, as more articles in the Chanticleer tone and tenor are written, that message will start to get through.
       </para>
       <para>
        In answer to the final part of Senator Durack's question, existing investigations and prosecutions will not be affected by the passage of the Commonwealth laws. The National Companies and Securities Commission and the corporate affairs commissions will continue to investigate and prosecute breaches of cooperative scheme law. These matters are properly the responsibility of the States as they involve offences under State law. However, the Australian Securities Commission will have the capacity under clause 13 of the Australian Securities Commission Bill to conduct investigations into contraventions committed under State and Territory companies and securities law, including those laws which were in force prior to the coming into effect of the national legislation, if it considers it to be expedient for the due administration of the national law. Under section 6 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, the Director will be able to take over existing and future prosecutions on behalf of the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a rather lengthy answer but I believe the importance of the topic raised by Senator Durack merited such a response. I hope it indicates to the business community the intentions of the Government as far as the implementation of the scheme is concerned.

He wrote to them indicating the way in which various corporate affairs commissions at the State jurisdictional levels might be usefully integrated into a national scheme with consequent recompense and revenue-sharing by the States. That proposal was rejected by all of the States and by the Northern Territory. Therefore, that leaves the Commonwealth free to establish the Australian Securities Commission and administrative arrangements at its will. The Attorney-General will be establishing the Australian Securities Commission and its various administrative networks, as I say, in a way which does not need to take account of the offer that the Attorney-General made in April 1988-12 months ago-in a most cooperative spirit, rejected as it was by the States and the Northern Territory. Nevertheless, I imagine that, as the States come to grips with the reality of the situation, further consultations will be held.

         —I have seen the reports in the Sydney Morning Herald referred to by Senator Collins. The new general practitioner fee arrangements are designed to provide incentives for general practitioners to take part in continuing medical education to ensure that they maintain and improve their skills. The aim is for doctors to be rewarded for their efforts in undertaking general practice training, just as they are for physician or surgical training.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It needs to be remembered that, under the proposal, no GP will be disadvantaged and no GP will be worse off. Current items will remain in the schedule for those doctors who choose either not to register or who are ineligible. However, some 90 per cent of general practitioners, both full time and part time, will be automatically eligible and, if they register, they will be able to use a new higher set of GP fees and rebates. In return, they will need to take part in continuing medical education and quality assurance programs. The Government believes that this will result in better trained general practitioners generally who will provide better quality patient care.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, if this were blocked, general practitioners and their patients would be deprived of $136m in increased Medicare rebates. I believe that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats need to be aware that they will be held responsible if the vast majority of GPs are deprived of fee and rebate increases equivalent to $15,000 a year in the case of GPs. As well, the 5 per cent across the board increase to most fees and rebates, including all specialist items, could not proceed from 1 August as planned because of the disorder created by those in the Opposition ranks. Let me quote yesterday's news release from Dr Peter Doyle of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners on how general practitioners will need to increase their fees by at least $5 from 1 August if legislation is not passed. These are his words:
       </para>
       <para>
        The options facing general practitioners are either to absorb cost increases, which means lower incomes, or charge patients more. Those most at risk are pensioners and the socially disadvantaged patients, whom doctors have traditionally treated at a significant discount for many years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Failure to pass the legislation will make it increasingly difficult for GPs to provide adequate care to this important group at an affordable price.

However, what he has said does not scotch the possibility, that must be held to be real, that a Liberal Party government would allow sandmining to resume on Fraser Island.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think these facts need to be made quite clear: Fraser Island is a unique and fragile environment. Following a report commenced under the Whitlam Government, a decision was taken by the Fraser Government to end sandmining in October 1976. The Fraser Government took that decision at that time for environment reasons and that decision was enforced by the use of the Commonwealth's export control powers. I now see that Martin Tenni, the Queensland Minister for Mines and Energy, and Geoff Muntz, the Queensland Minister for Environment, Conservation and Tourism, have said that there will be no mining on Fraser Island. but I have checked these facts today. Leases for mining on Fraser Island, which run for 21 years, were issued by the Queensland Government some time back. Despite what Muntz and Tenni have said, those leases have not been withdrawn; they are still active. There are only two possible reasons why those leases have not been exercised: Firstly, the price of the product of sandmining does not make it economic-anyone who looks at the indicators would see that that is not true; in fact, sand mining would be a very economic activity-and, secondly, the Commonwealth Government maintains, by the use of the export control powers, the ban applied by the Fraser Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me, therefore, go to the coalition's draft policy on energy and resources and refer to the subject of export control powers. That policy states:
       </para>
       <para>
        We will abolish all export controls on the minerals and metals sector, except where such exports infringe on national security or international obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that case, these powers would not be used by a Federal coalition government-if it were to take office-to prevent sandmining on Fraser Island because national security and international obligations are not involved. Fraser Island is not a World Heritage area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me turn to the Opposition's environment policy, released by no other than Senator Puplick in October 1988, to see whether there is some comfort there. That policy states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition parties have already indicated that they reject the improper use of the external affairs powers of the Constitution to interfere with proper land use policy decisions of the States or Territories or the orderly development of our economic resources. This policy repeats that assurance. Land use policies are primarily the responsibility of the States and the Territories and they should not be circumvented by the improper use of the indirect powers granted to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        One presumes therefore that, even under the environmental policy released by Senator Puplick in October 1988, a coalition government would not obstruct the Queensland Government from the continuance of those leases and the starting up again of sandmining on Fraser Island.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the words used by Senator Puplick in his personal explanation-a copy of which I now have before me. He said:
       </para>
       <para>

        One question that apparently won't go away for the government is how serious it is about eradicating child poverty by 1990 . . . what is clear so far is that the package has gone a little less than half way to eliminating the need for children to live in poverty . . . and studies make it clear that sole parents . . . need most attention in the next round of measures . . .

        I ask the Minister, firstly, whether the Federal Government's abject failure to deliver in its April 1989 economic statement any support to meet the special needs of single parent families means that they and their children have become the forgotten poor within Australian society; and, secondly, when the Federal Government will introduce measures designed to deal effectively with the poverty traps that single parents continue to face.

         —I have seen the article. Reading the first part of it I thought that the researcher involved needed to do a refresher course. Senator Powell's question is based on a false presumption, a false inference from the article in question that the Government did absolutely nothing in the April economic statement to meet the special needs of single families. Nowhere in the article that Senator Powell refers to is that point made or developed. Sole income parents are not the forgotten poor under this Government. This Government has always recognised a need to address their particular problems. This Government has always seen the particular problems facing sole parents as a social tragedy. It is not a recent development, and that has to be recognised as well. In the way the Government normally approaches these issues, we have done that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It should be recognised that in the 1970s and the early 1980s there was an explosion in the number of sole parents living in poverty. One stark figure indicates that fact more than anything else. Whereas, in 1974, 105,000 sole parent pensioners constituted 57.4 per cent of all sole parents, in 1983 the figure had risen to 82 per cent. So, by 1983, 82 per cent of sole parents were pensioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not happy with the situation. As I have said, we have addressed the problem consistently during our term of government. We have responded by rejecting income policies that imprison people in poverty traps and by introducing a whole raft of different measures. The child support scheme is one such important measure that is in place, and the family allowance supplement is another. We have also addressed the question of work force barriers, for instance, with measures addressing problems with pensioner earning credits and the retention of fringe benefits in certain circumstances. Those measures have gone some way towards addressing work force barriers for sole parents.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, in 1987 the child free areas under the income test were increased, once again allowing sole parent pensioners to earn additional non-pension income. We have also recognised, however, that income support is vital. Income support for families with children, including sole parents, has been a priority of this Government since 1983. To that extent we have increased additional pension and benefit rates paid for children in every year of our term, the most recent increase being made in 1989. From 1983 to 1989 there has been an increase from $10 to $31, a three-fold increase, for younger children, and for older children the figure has gone up to $34.10. So there has been quite a substantial increase in income support for these families.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the family package announced earlier this year. We have made adjustments to family allowance, and the higher levels of payments under the family allowance decisions of this Government will also assist the families whom Senator Powell is concerned about. We should not forget the historic decision announced in the April statement to index these payments.

Bringing forward pension indexation by 12 weeks will also assist. I do not need to go into any depth on the jobs, education and training program and the way it is geared towards addressing work force barriers experienced by sole parents.

        First of all, I welcome the emphasis on expanding export markets, wherever they happen to be. Exports of Australian wine have risen rapidly in recent years from $17m in 1984-85 to $97m in 1987-88. This has been across both bulk and bottled wine. To come to the point of the question of what government assistance there is in terms of wine exports-which, as I have just pointed out, have grown significantly-Austrade is active in the promotion of Australian wine overseas, in association with the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. Austrade posts assist exporters in finding markets by putting them in contact with potentially interested importers and distributors. In addition, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and wine exporters participate in a number of Austrade-sponsored trade displays and promotions in a range of overseas markets. For example, the Austrade post in Paris is now involved in assisting with arrangements for an Australian industry display at Vin Expo in Bordeaux, which will take place from 19 June to 23 June. That is the premier show for the wine industry internationally. Similarly, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation is involved with Australian participation in a big wine show in Cologne in October 1989, and there have been similar efforts in North America, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and, of course, Japan. The amounts of money and assistance provided by Austrade are in addition to the export market development grants scheme for trade promotional activity overseas. In the expansion of the horizons of the wine industry-I notice Senator Messner, who took up the cudgels on behalf of the wine industry in terms of the sales tax--

        However, the question of Aboriginal sites is interesting. I would agree that there is increasing community concern about Aboriginal land rights and the protection of their sacred sites. That is certainly true. But when I consider this question, it seems strange that if this range was used as late as one week ago, when 100 rounds were fired into it from two Navy ships, those Aboriginal concerns had not been brought to the attention of the Department. As I mentioned in my answer yesterday, the Department is aware of 25 sites of significance in the area. Of those, only one is within the impact area.

         —I will answer that interjection in a moment. It is called the Drum and Drumsticks, but because the site consists of offshore rocks it has not been bombed since, I think, 1986, which was when its significance was notified to the Department. I share concerns about Aboriginal sites, but the number has jumped from 25 to 200 in a fairly short time, and we will have to examine this question. It is very difficult for the Department of Defence to take into account information which has never been brought to its attention. I am a little disappointed that so much is being made of the Aboriginal argument on this occasion because, even as late as a week ago, this claim did not exist. It has come very late on the scene.

        I am asked, by way of interjection, about these sites. I said yesterday that about 90 per cent of the sites in question-that is, the 25, because we do not know what the other 175 might be-are middens, and 70 per cent of those have already been disturbed. In terms of looking at National Estate values on the Beecroft Peninsula, I do not agree that they have been destroyed by the bombing, because the impact area is rather small. It does not cover anything like the whole of the peninsula.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of section 30 of the Heritage Act and the possibility of feasible alternatives, I point out that there are in fact only two sites on the entire east coast that are used for these purposes. One is at Shoalwater Bay in Queensland and the other is at Jervis Bay. I do not believe that residents anywhere on the east coast or environmentalists would welcome the Department of Defence choosing any more sites. To attempt to do so would cause more problems than the use of the current two. So I should say that on environmental grounds I have not advised the Department of Defence to cease using Beecroft Peninsula.

         —The answer to the first part of the question is yes. In fact, I have a copy of AMIC's mineral production index for the March quarter 1989, which I table for the information of the Senate. The second part of the question referred to the 11 per cent higher mine production output for Australia in the March quarter. The answer to that part of the question is yes, that is true. Our statistics verify that. In fact, the results of the Australian Mining Industry Council's index are broadly in line with the March quarter outlook by the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly, which is a publication put out by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, known as ABARE, which has forecast that the value of Australia's commodity exports will rise by $2.6 billion or 8 per cent in 1988-89 as compared with the previous year. In 1989-90, the ABARE forecast is for a further improvement in our commodity exports-a 10 per cent increase to $40 billion. The factors affecting this increase include a 3 per cent increase in the volume of commodity exports as a whole, a slightly lower average exchange rate and a wide range of world price increases for commodities.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As ABARE explains, one of the key factors that will influence Australia's prospects for a better balance of payments outcome will be the future level of world commodity prices. The downturn that we experienced between 1984 and 1986 was unusual in that most commodity prices trended in the same direction at that time-downwards. It is more usual for commodity prices to be divergent, responding to their own individual supply and demand conditions. ABARE stated in its March quarterly review:
       </para>
       <para>
        The key feature of the present commodity price recovery is that supply constraints for a wide range of commodities are likely to permit markets to hold price gains for some time. This applies to many metals and grains and is also an underlying feature of markets for meat commodities. However, the reverse appears to be the case for precious metals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bureau predicts that the volume of mineral production will rise by 3 per cent in 1989-90 compared with the 13 per cent increase for 1988-89. For 1989-90, significant increases in production are expected to occur in coal, uranium, aluminium, gold and iron ore. That is the market-related side of the story.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other half of the story is the micro-economic reform that the Hawke Government has engaged in during its period of office. That micro-economic reform, which has led to greater efficiencies in the mining industry, covers a whole range of things. I cannot go into all of them, but I mention the reduction in tariff protection which will benefit the mining and minerals processing sector to the tune of $350m; the fact that during the period of this Government and for the future of this Government the prices and incomes accord has lent wage stability to the industry in a climate of high economic growth, reduced industrial disputation, caused unit labour costs to fall and higher productivity per head to be achieved; and that in the May economic statement last year we reduced corporate taxes to 39 per cent. All those elements of the Government's micro-economic reform package have helped the mining sector reach the targets that have been referred to by Senator Jones and which are supported by our own independent surveys from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics.

But the report does highlight that on some days, even in a place like Canberra, particularly during the winter, lead pollution from motor cars equals that of Sydney. That is an alarming point.

        I stand by the views I expressed yesterday on radio, which Senator Alston quoted. But in so far as he identified earlier in this question my position as being identical with that of Mr Willis and Mr Hawke, I am not sure that that is correct. I do not believe that I said that. Senator Alston has perhaps failed to grasp the fact that many of these issues have a degree of complexity about them which is not susceptible to a simple solution. As attractive as the honourable senator might find simple solutions, they are not readily available to people.

        In so far as Senator Alston quoted what I said yesterday, I stand by that statement. As I have said in the Senate on previous occasions, there are very different views within the Government on this question. Hopefully this will be resolved by a committee which is examining those issues for the Government at present. When that is done, if we reach a particular conclusion about it we will implement it.

         —I am aware of one company that has sought to establish such a scheme, that is, Elders IXL Ltd. I understand the reason for that is that Elders does not pay enough Australian company tax to fully frank all of its dividends. The reason for that is not necessarily anything shonky but that Elders derives a substantial part of its income from overseas investments. Under the scheme which Elders either has established or plans to establish, Elders will pay a differential dividend rate with a higher rate being offered on unfranked dividends than on franked dividends.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of the effects of that policy if the imputation of franked dividend benefits were not available to superannuation funds would be that superannuation funds would have a very clear incentive to invest in companies which paid unfranked dividends or, offered the choice of unpaid dividends at a higher rate, dividends earned by investment in overseas businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Imputation benefits to superannuation funds are therefore essential to ensure that the life savings of Australian workers go towards investment in productive Australian industries and the provision of jobs for Australian workers and their children in the future rather than in investment in overseas businesses. There are some other elements of this that I will not go into at this stage. At some later stage I may make the Senate aware of them and of some of the other arrangements or rearrangements which are currently taking place or which are planned to take place in the ownership structure of Elders IXL.

Senator Chaney further alleged that Mr Giffard improperly `removed and began reading a sensitive report concerning the proposed merger between Murdoch and the University of Western Australia'. Far from Senator Chaney's luridly phrased allegation of clandestine and underhand activities, Mr Giffard quite openly and properly called at the office of the Murdoch University Student Guild on Monday, 22 May, the day after the so-called sensitive report in question had been released to the West Australian newspaper. Mr Giffard asked for a copy of the report. The report was duly photocopied by a member of the office staff and the photocopy was given to Mr Giffard who then left the Guild office.

        REFORM OF SHIPPING AND THE WATERFRONT

       <para>
        The House will be aware that the Government has been developing a comprehensive program for reform of the shipping and waterfront industries. I am pleased to be able to advise the House today of the measures we will be taking to implement these major elements of microeconomic reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        Through various reports commissioned by this Government, it is now common knowledge that Australia has been poorly served by its shipping and waterfront industries. The gross inefficiencies which have been allowed to develop in these industries have restricted our economic growth, reduced our living standards and impaired our capacity to develop export markets. In part, our balance of payments difficulties are directly attributable to the acute inefficiencies in these key industries in the export chain. The reforms I am announcing today will dramatically transform these industries. They will lead to quantum increases in efficiency over the next three to five years and will in turn enable our industries, which depend on sea transport, to become more flexible and more efficient.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of all, our reform package is practical, based on commonsense and developed through consultation. It is not based on abstract theory or ideological dogma. It is a practical agenda for cooperative and effective reform which will reap maximum long term benefits for the industries, their customers and, indeed, all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The structure of our inquiries reflects our commitment to consultation. The Shipping Reform Task Force, which we established to investigate the scope for developing new reform initiatives, was chaired by Mr Ivan Deveson, Managing Director of Nissan Australia, and comprised senior representatives from shippers, ship operators, the unions and government. The report was agreed by all members and released on 20 April.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also asked the Inter-State Commission, an independent statutory body within my portfolio, to report on measures to reform the waterfront. During its inquiry the Commission took evidence from stevedoring industry employers and unions; commercial operators; Federal and State interests; and importers and exporters. The Commission's report was released on 6 April. In proposing a detailed strategy for reform, the Commission recommended an in-principle agreement between Government, waterside unions and employers as a central element of its plan. It has therefore been necessary for the Government to hold intensive discussions with industry parties to ascertain their views before finalising its position.

       </para>

       <para>
        Our work on shipping builds on earlier reforms introduced by this Government. In 1984, in response to the report of the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping, we introduced taxation incentives which led to new ships coming into service in 1984 with crews as low as 26, well below crew levels for such ships of an earlier generation which were in the low to mid-30s.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Crawford scheme represented a critical turning point for the industry. It introduced a pattern for reform with ship owners and unions working together in a constructive way, for users and the economy as a whole. It made possible the establishment in 1986 of the Maritime Industry Development Committee (MIDC), representing ship owners, unions and the Government which, in turn, initiated a radically new approach to operating Australian ships using the concepts of multi-skilling, broadbanding of jobs and the integration of functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The MIDC initiatives resulted in crew sizes on new ships being further reduced, for example from 26 to 21 on a dry bulk carrier. There are now five ships operating in the Australian fleet with MIDC crewing levels and a further 15 ships are on order. These reforms have been achieved in a period of unprecedented industrial harmony in the shipping industry. In 1982, 4.1 per cent of ship time, or 1,593 ship days, were lost through industrial disputes. Last year only 0.2 per cent or 72 ship days were lost. This dramatic change has been brought about partly by the reduction in demarcation disputes through union amalgamations and partly by the industry's determination to improve its efficiency and public image.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shipping reform task force, which recently reported to the Government, has proposed a three-year reform strategy which will not only close the competitive gap between Australian shipping and its Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) counterparts, but will also lead to further efficiency improvements after 1992. The Government has accepted the task force proposals and will work with the industry and its users to implement the reform strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the heart of this strategy is a program for reduction of the size of crews on existing ships. This is a major step forward which, taken together with the Maritime Industry Development Committee initiatives, will transform the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian flag shipping over the next three years. These crewing initiatives will save a total of $80m in crew costs by mid-1992 and at least $50m per year thereafter. They will reduce the average crew size on major trading ships from 29 at present to 21 over the next three years. When we came into office the average crew size on such ships was 33. Initiatives taken by the Government will therefore reduce average crew sizes by 36 per cent in less than a decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will support this recrewing program by contributing up to $24m of the estimated $80m required for voluntary early retirement schemes for the 1,000 jobs which may be lost over the three-year reform program. This contribution will ensure that shipowners can quickly pass on to users the benefits of crew cost savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        To recrew pre-MIDC ships, we will expand the skills upgrading programs currently in place. The Government will fund up to half the cost of retraining seafarers required to operate such ships, up to a total of $5m over the three-year program. With existing training programs it will be possible to reduce crews on the most modern ships to 17 or 18 before mid-1992. To reduce crews even further it will be necessary to integrate officer functions; that is, to train officers in both navigation and engineering skills. The Government will work with the industry to design and introduce the necessary training courses before July 1990, so that suitably trained personnel will be available by 1993. This will allow Australian ships to operate with crews of between 14 and 16, or even less. The magnitude of this achievement can best be illustrated by looking at the crew sizes on dry bulk ships; the mainstay of the Australian fleet. Such a ship, introduced in 1983, would have had a crew of 32. A decade later a new dry bulk carrier will be able to be introduced into service with a crew of 16 or less; at least a 50 per cent reduction.

        The task force also recommended the abolition of first-class air travel for seafareres; adoption of measures to reduce waste in victualling; development of a more efficient and, therefore, less costly compensation system; re-examination of study leave arrangements; and further development of dispute settlement procedures. The Government strongly supports the implementation of these measures, which would further reduce costs and cut the crew to berth ratio by about 10 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Shipping is a highly capital intensive industry and the fiscal regime is therefore critical to ensuring continued investment. The current fiscal regime for new ships of 7 per cent taxable capital grants and accelerated depreciation, introduced in support of the MIDC scheme, puts Australian shipowners in a broadly comparable position with their OECD counterparts. To provide a stable framework that supports the reform strategy for the industry, the Government has decided to extend the current fiscal regime for new ships for five years from the scheduled expiry date of 30 June 1992. Also, the 7 per cent taxable grant will now be available until 30 June 1992 to cover the cost of any necessary modifications to existing ships for operation with smaller crews.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the present fuel excise arrangements, 26 per cent of the excise on marine diesel is hypothecated to land transport development programs at an approximate cost of $3m a year and, therefore, directly subsidises competing modes of transport. The Government accepts the task force's argument that this is an unfair burden on coastal shipping and has agreed to rebate the hypothecated component of the excise from 1 July 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the 1920s successive governments have maintained a cabotage policy which requires that coastal cargo be carried in Australian controlled and crewed ships, whenever possible. This policy has not prohibited foreign flag ships from the coast. Where no suitable local ship is available, permits are issued for single voyages to allow foreigners to enter the coasting trade. In the 12 months to the end of March 1989, 38 permits were issued allowing a half a million tonnes of coastal cargo to be carried in this way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cabotage policy was carefully examined by the shipping reform task force. No member recommended its withdrawal but it was suggested that changes be made to the application of the permit system to increase its flexibility. The task force pointed out that almost all major maritime nations have a cabotage policy, including our leading trading partners, Japan and the United States. The only exception to this is the United Kingdom, although even there legislation imposing cabotage restrictions has been recently passed, but not proclaimed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Governments almost everywhere consider that coastal shipping is part of the domestic economy and that it should be treated no differently from other domestic transport sectors. The Government agrees with the task force that the permit system should be made more flexible and has decided that new guidelines will be issued for the operation of the permit system. These will apply to single voyage permits and will also include the use of permits for continuous trading which, although allowed for under the Navigation Act, have not been issued for 20 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        These continuing voyage permits, which can be issued for up to three years, will improve efficiency and competitiveness in the coastal shipping market in a number of ways. For example, small, irregular shippers, particularly those operating from remote locations, will be given greater choice when undertaking coastal voyages. The risks associated with new trades will be reduced because the use of continuing voyage permits could establish viability. This will encourage the development of new raw materials processing opportunities. When existing raw materials processing is experiencing an upsurge in demand, the continuing voyage permit process could be used to supplement local coastal tonnage to ensure that short term needs are met from domestic sources. The continuing voyage permit system could also be used by shippers to improve the overall efficiency of their shipping through promoting a greater integration of coastal and international trading. For example, an Australian shipper might relinquish part of its coastal trades to foreign ships in exchange for greater access for its shipping in international trades. In this way both Australian and foreign flag ships could minimise their ballast voyaging, thus benefiting both domestic and international users of Australian raw materials through lower freight rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        These examples illustrate ways in which the changes to the permit system will provide greater flexibility and hence benefit shippers. Providing a better deal for shippers has been a key objective of the Government, which has been concerned to ensure that the efficiencies resulting from crew reductions and the other benefits of the reforms announced tonight are passed on. The Government will therefore ask the Prices Surveillance Authority to inquire into and monitor coastal shipping rates. If, nevertheless, it becomes clear over the next three years that shippers relying on others for their coastal shipping are not benefiting from reform through lower freight rates, the Government will give serious consideration to including price as one of the criteria used when assessing permit applications.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are three areas where the task force did not reach a final position but where the Government considers that further action is desirable. The first of these is trans-Tasman shipping. When the closer economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand was reviewed and renegotiated in the middle of last year, both governments agreed that it was vital to pursue measures to reduce the costs of shipping across the Tasman. In trans-Tasman shipping, onshore costs represent 50 per cent of total costs-routes are short, cargo volumes are low and port visits are frequent. In addition, shippers expect continuing high and stable service levels. Both governments therefore agreed that reduction of waterfront costs is essential to reduce the cost of trading across the Tasman. High priority was also given to the introduction of low cost, more efficient vessels. The shipping needs of fledgling and specialised trades were put at risk because of the high costs of Australian and New Zealand shipping.
       </para>
       <para>
        The waterfront and shipping reforms which I am announcing and reforms which are being introduced in New Zealand will have a substantial beneficial impact on trans-Tasman shipping costs. In addition I will be holding discussions with the New Zealand Government to determine the scope for further reductions in trans-Tasman shipping and waterfront costs prior to the achievement of free trade between the two countries on 1 July 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second area where the task force did not reach a final position involved company employment for ratings. Unlike the waterfront, there has been little consideration of the issue. In any case the lack of company employment has not impeded recent, major changes to work practices on ships. In fact, both shipowners and unions acknowledge the value of the engagement system and recognise that, even with company employment, some use of supplementary labour would be required to overcome occasional shortages. Nevertheless there may well be advantages in moving to company employment and this issue should be kept on the longer term reform agenda. Finally, there is the towage industry. I will be referring to further reform in this area later in the statement.

        The Waterfront
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Twenty years ago containerisation was introduced to Australian ports. It fundamentally changed the face of the waterfront. The number of cargo handling waterside workers has reduced from 21,000 in the years before containerisation, to a little over 5,000 now. Between 1965 and 1985 the amount of non-bulk cargo handled by each waterside worker increased from 1,000 tonnes to over 5,000 tonnes a year. Despite these large increases in labour productivity the fact is we have not kept pace with our overseas competitors. The last major set of changes to industry arrangements was in 1977 but these did little to improve the performance of the industry, which has remained grossly inefficient. Apart from the changes forced on the industry by technological developments, both employers and unions on the waterfront have failed to adapt to meet the demands of a fiercely competitive world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission has found the waterfront industry in urgent need of fundamental change. It is right. It is characterised by ineffective management and poor work force motivation, introspective industrial attitudes, high costs, endemic unreliability, poor response to user needs, abuse of monopoly power and a pervasive lack of competition. This is not a situation that has developed recently-it is how we found the industry when we came into office. Soon after coming to office the Government therefore brought the industry parties together through the Webber task force to identify the causes of waterfront inefficiency and unreliability. In response to the issues raised by the task force the Government in 1986 directed the Inter-State Commission to examine all aspects of the waterfront and develop an integrated plan to improve its performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has pointed the way toward thoroughgoing reform of the waterfront. The Government accepts the fundamental thrust of its findings. Reform will be complex and contentious but it is essential to our economic well-being that it be achieved. Success will depend on allowing the competitive forces of the marketplace to operate more freely, and on active cooperation between the major interests. Competition and cooperation are hallmarks of our reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will be pursuing change in three broad areas in line with the Commission's recommendations: the stevedoring industry where there will be a fundamental change in employment arrangements shifting from the current practice of industry-wide employment to enterprise-based employment for stevedoring labour; port authorities, where the Government is pursuing with the States, and the Northern Territory measures to improve the efficiency of port authorities and services they influence; and measures to create a more competitive commercial environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission made recommendations on a range of other issues, including improvements to land transport access to ports, documentation procedures and the introduction of electronic data interchange to the waterfront industry. The Government has accepted the vast majority of the Commission's recommendations in these areas and will be pursuing them in consultation with relevant parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Central to the Commission's proposals for the stevedoring industry is the negotiation of a three-year in-principle agreement between the Federal Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, stevedoring unions and stevedoring employers on restructuring the stevedoring and international container depot operations. Following detailed consultation with industry parties the Government has concluded it should be possible for the industry parties to negotiate an in-principle agreement acceptable to the Government. This will be the foundation for the achievement of substantial waterfront reform. As proposed by the Inter-State Commission, the Government is providing the industry parties with up to three months to negotiate this agreement. Provided there is an agreement satisfactory to the Government we will be prepared to commit up to $154m on a dollar-for-dollar basis with employers towards the costs of redundancy payments, training, retraining, skills audits and job redesign projects. We are prepared to allocate this money as an investment in the future. The costs involved are substantial, but there is a critical need for change in this vital sector of the economy. The benefits envisaged by the Inter-State Commission of at least $620m per annum in terms of cost reductions and improved reliability are essential to our export competitiveness.
       </para>
       <para>
        The central elements of the Inter-State Commission's proposals for the in-principle agreement involve the transfer of employment responsibilities to individual enterprises. This will improve competition, enhance employer-employee relationships and reduce costs to the shippers. But in moving to enterprise employment we must ensure the work force has an adequate level and mix of skills and that its working environment motivates employees to accomplish their tasks effectively. Regard must also be had to the high proportion of older workers in the industry where the work force has an average age of over 50 years. We have therefore accepted the Commission's recommendation that rejuvenation of the industry requires a special retirement and redundancy scheme coupled with a recruitment program to bring trained workers into the industry. This will involve 3,000 existing employees leaving the industry over three years and the recruitment of 1,000 new employees no older than 30.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that a satisfactory agreement will need to include firm commitments from the industry parties on the following matters:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. The introduction of enterprise employment arrangements into the ports of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Fremantle within three years. Employment arrangements in Adelaide will need to be consistent with the principles of enterprise employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Flexible supplementary work force arrangements must be developed on an enterprise basis for major ports consistent with the Commission's recommendations. Compatible arrangements will need to be agreed to for small and intermediate ports.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. Awards and agreements must be restructured consistent with the structural efficiency principle of the 1988 national wage decision. This will enable improvements in work organisation designed to increase productivity, efficiency and reliability through the negotiation of specific implementation agreements.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Employers are to provide, on a dollar-for-dollar basis with the Government, $0.5m for workplace restructuring projects to facilitate agreements on changes to work patterns and arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        5. New employees are to be recruited directly into individual enterprises with recruitment in the first year being in accordance with existing industry procedures. In subsequent years each enterprise should determine the recruitment procedures to be followed in consultation with relevant unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. Consistent with the Commission's recommendations current industry arrangements regarding compulsory redundancy for existing employees are to be retained. Arrangements for compulsory redundancy as a last resort for all new recruits are to be allowed at the end of the three year implementation period.
       </para>
       <para>
        7. Employers and unions must commit themselves to develop and support industry-based training schemes and enterprise-based training programs. The development of the programs and schemes should ensure they are appropriate to the needs of the stevedoring and international container depot industries, linked to the introduction of new job structures through retraining of existing employees, and related to the recruitment program.
       </para>
       <para>
        8. The Federal Government will provide up to $8m for improving training facilities, the training of new recruits and the retraining of existing employees to facilitate job restructuring. Employers will be required to provide a matching amount.
       </para>
       <para>
        9. A one-off early retirement-redundancy scheme for the next three years is to be established based on the entitlements recommended by the Inter-State Commission. In negotiating the in-principle agreement parties will need to develop arrangements to more specifically `target' redundancy offers to meet the needs of the industry. Supervisor categories will be covered by these arrangements and this should facilitate reduction in excessive layers of supervision.
       </para>
       <para>
        10. Employers are to provide up to $145m on a dollar-for-dollar basis with Government to fund the early retirement-redundancy offers. The Government is prepared to facilitate the collection of employer contributions through statutory levy arrangements for a period that is demonstrated to be necessary and subject to the levy rate not exceeding present combined statutory and industry levy rates for this purpose. It is expected that the levy would apply for no longer than three to four years.
       </para>
       <para>
        11. The parties must accept that permanent inclusions of stand-down provisions in awards is a matter to be pursued through normal Industrial Relations Commission processes.
       </para>
       <para>
        12. The parties must make a commitment to develop and adhere to agreed disciplinary and dispute settlement procedures to improve industry reliability and efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        13. They must also agree to arrangements to enable the effective contracting out of maintenance work where it is more efficient than in-house facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        14. The Government will be phasing out the existing cross-subsidisation of stevedoring labour costs in small ports through statutory levies over three years. The parties will therefore need to commit themselves to introduction of measures to improve the efficiency of small and intermediate ports through revised employment arrangements including enterprise employment, commercial port labour pools and use of port authority labour.
       </para>
       <para>
        15. Constraints that limit competition in international container depot operations must be removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        16. Where stevedoring employees are employed in association with the loading and unloading of bulk vessels employment arrangements will be in accordance with efficient operational requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        17. Finally, agreement by the stevedoring and international container depot unions must agree to rationalisation of union coverage at small ports, international container depots and bulk terminals. Agreement is to be reached through consultations under the auspices of the ACTU.
       </para>
       <para>
        A firm timetable for progressive implementation of specific elements is an essential requirement of an in-principle agreement. Government assistance will be provided only when specified objectives within the timetable have clearly been achieved. Conditional on the conclusion of a satisfactory in-principle agreement, the Government will also provide up to $100,000 towards the conduct of a special study for the development of safety proposals for the industry, $250,000 for union research staff to assist unions in the implementation of the in-principle agreement and $100,000 towards consultants for skills reviews.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second broad area where the Government will pursue reform is in relation to port authorities and their roles in the waterfront industry. The operations of port authorities are matters of direct State and Territory responsibility and we will be seeking to pursue reform in this area in cooperation with the States. I wrote to State and Territory Ministers on the release of the Inter-State Commission's report asking that they give early consideration to the Inter-State Commission's recommendations. I will be meeting with them soon to discuss their reactions and what actions they propose to implement the proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government endorses the broad thrust of the ISC's recommendations in relation to port authorities. It is clear that there is room for substantial improvement in their performance. Port authority managements need to operate at maximum levels of efficiency. Port pricing practices need to be modified to reduce cross-subsidies and reliance on cargo based charges. The Government is convinced that port authority efficiency will be best achieved by commercialising their operations; that is, Government port authorities should be put on a business-like basis as far as possible-along the lines of the reforms which the Federal Government is currently implementing with regard to its own business enterprises. Because of their monopoly powers port authority pricing is a particular area of concern to shippers and shipowners. The Government agrees with the Inter-State Commission's recommendations aimed at ensuring greater transparency in port pricing and a closer relationship between costs and services provided. This issue will be receiving close attention during my discussions with State and Northern Territory governments. Port authorities can play a central role in encouraging a more competitive environment in ports for such services as stevedoring and towage operations through leases and licensing arrangements. The Government believes that port authorities should be taking a more effective, pro-competitive approach than they have in the past in these areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission's role in this industry will also be enhanced. The Government will ensure that the TPC has the additional resources and backing necessary to apply the Act to those areas identified in the ISC report. The most important of these are the international container depot and towage industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prices Surveillance Authority can also play an important role in monitoring prices and ensuring that the benefits of changes in the waterfront industry flow through to their customers, the importers and exporters. The Government will therefore be requesting the Prices Surveillance Authority to monitor prices in the waterfront industry with particular attention being given to the stevedoring, international container depot and towage industries. Formal surveillance or inquiry processes will be put in train if necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission found on the basis of evidence given to it and research undertaken by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics that the towage industry is not competitive. The Bureau concluded that harbour towage charges were high, tug utilisation low, crew sizes high by comparison with other countries and there was a lack of competition between tug operators. There is clearly room for major improvement in this industry. The shipping reform task force called on the towage industry parties to develop a reform strategy for the industry and report to the Government within three months. The Government will expect it to produce major improvements in line with those proposed for commercial shipping. Furthermore, in my discussions with State and Territory Ministers I will be examining ways to improve competition in the towage industry, such as the introduction of licensing by port authorities to encourage greater competition. Additionally the Government agrees with the Inter-State Commission's recommendations that the Trade Practices Commission should consider reviewing the authorisations that it has granted in relation to towage operations at a number of ports to assess whether these continue to be in the public interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that implementation of the radical reforms which I have announced for the waterfront industry will bring about the restructuring necessary to generate the large productivity improvements predicted by the Inter-State Commission. In our view, these prospective productivity increases would be further enhanced by the introduction of profit sharing or employee share ownership schemes. The joint ventures initiated by the Waterside Workers' Federation in some small ports have highlighted the efficiency gains to be achieved by profit sharing arrangements. Such schemes would also reinforce the concept of enterprise employment by promoting closer identification by waterside workers with their enterprise and its financial viability.
       </para>
       <para>
        The comprehensive program I have just outlined will bring substantial and highly beneficial change to the waterfront industry. It offers benefits to the customers, the industry participants and the nation. In line with the Inter-State Commission report, the program's achievement rests substantially on the cooperation of the parties. If, however, that cooperation is not forthcoming, the industries should be under no illusions about the Government's firm commitment to achieve significant waterfront reform. I will report back to Cabinet within three months on the results of the negotiations on the in-principle agreement. If a satisfactory agreement is not achieved, we will pursue alternative measures to change these industries structurally.
       </para>

        Implementation of Shipping and Waterfront Reforms
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have already mentioned, the Shipping Reform Task Force and the Inter-State Commission both recommended three-year implementation periods for the shipping and waterfront reform strategies. They also recommended independent authorities to oversee the detailed development and implementation of these reform packages. The Government has accepted this approach and will shortly establish the Shipping Industry Reform Authority (SIRA) and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) which are to run for three years. Both will bear major responsibilities of overseeing and monitoring the day to day implementation by the industries of the reform plans that have been agreed to by the industry parties and by the Government. I expect both authorities to work co-operatively with the industry parties to meet the agreed objectives. Disbursement of Government restructuring assistance by the authorities will be contingent upon achievement of strategy targets. Reform will have to be carried through in a systematic and comprehensive way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first task of the Waterfront Authority will be to supervise the negotiation of the in-principle agreement. The Authority will also monitor other industry negotiations in order to ensure that they are consistent with Government requirements for an in-principle agreement and prepare for an immediate start to reforms once an agreement is signed. It will also ensure that the arrangements for recruiting new entrants will conform with Government requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Maritime Safety Authority
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        To further enhance efficiency and contain costs to industry the Government has decided to establish an Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Authority, which will replace the Maritime Operations Division in my Department, will administer the standards and procedures for the construction, equipment and safe loading of ships; the qualification and training of crews, the provision of marine navigational aids and the complementation of anti-pollution measures. Such an Authority will be more responsive to industry needs, while remaining properly accountable to Government. The Authority will be controlled by a board with membership drawn from industry and Government to bring appropriate management skills to the conduct of these important commercial and safety functions. The Authority will be largely self funding through user charges payable by the industry. The cost of providing and maintaining marine navigational aids is already fully recovered through light dues. Similarly, the costs of the national plan to combat oil pollution are paid for by a levy on commercial shipping. The Shipping Registration Office recovers over 80 per cent of its costs on a fee for service basis and is expected to achieve full cost recovery by 1990-91. Charges are made to recover the costs of marine survey, except where the surveys are for regulatory purposes. The Authority would also continue to provide a seamen's engagement system as long as the industry wanted it. The Government's aim is to bring the Authority into being by 1 September 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Light Dues
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The system of marine navigational aids provided by the Australian Government for the safe and efficient movement of vessels in Australian waters is paid for by light dues charged to commercial users. Traditionally light dues have been paid at a single rate per net registered ton. This is the practice for light dues around the world. The rate is currently 53 cents and has remained unchanged since 1983. Following representations from certain sectors of industry, the Government has reviewed the basis for payment of light dues and the formula used to set the rate for individual ships. It has decided that there is a case for providing relief for some of the largest vessels. The new formula provides for a sliding scale of charges by tonnage ranging from 63 cents to 33 cents per net registered ton. This will lead to a reduction of dues for large vessels of about 20 per cent and has been achieved without imposing any large increase in fees for the smaller vessels. To illustrate this point, a small coastal vessel of 200 net registered tons will pay only $20 per quarter more, while a large bulk carrier of 72,000 net registered tons will pay $6,900 per quarter less. Ships in the middle tonnage range will experience no change.

       <para>
        These measures represent the most wide-ranging package of reforms ever introduced for Australia's waterfront and shipping industries. They establish a firm basis for continuing reform. On the basis of the findings of the Inter-State Commission and the Shipping Reform Task Force, these measures will greatly increase productivity and create a more competitive environment in our shipping and waterfront industries. They will reduce costs to our exporters and import competing industries, will create new job opportunities and will bring benefits to all Australians by ensuring a more competitive economy. Such improvements are not simply desirable; they are crucial to our future economic well being. Australia has paid dearly for the benign neglect of those opposite who, during their three decades of postwar Government of this country, allowed these industries to become a burden on the nation and a barrier to economic progress. The reforms I have outlined today will ensure that these industries will have a far more positive impact on the economy in the years to come. I commend the reforms to the Senate.

        REFORM STATEMENT
       </para>
       <para>
        My portfolio contains 10 major government business enterprises (GBEs) operated by the Commonwealth. They are Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines Ltd, Australian National Line (ANL), Australian National Railways Commission, Telecom Australia, Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), Aussat, Australia Post, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). These latter two enterprises were established last year to radically restructure safety regulation, the provision of aviation services and related infrastructure. During the past six years the Government has systematically worked to put the operations of its transport and communications enterprises on a sounder financial footing and to make them more efficient, more flexible and more businesslike. We have given that task a high priority because of the strategic importance of the GBEs in the Australian economy. It is not a task that we have only recently started. Throughout the Government's three terms we have focused on micro-economic reform, including deregulating the financial system, reducing levels of protection and reshaping the GBEs. In our third term we have given greater prominence to micro-economic reform and accelerated reform of the GBEs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The eight GBEs-excluding the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation-are important in their own right. They account for over 9 per cent of total public sector employment. They take up more than 15 per cent of all Government investment-which comes to more than two thirds of the investment by the Commonwealth Government. Their revenues equal 19.7 per cent of Commonwealth Government revenues, and their expenditure is equal to 18.7 per cent of Commonwealth spending. Their assets are worth over $22 billion and government investment in the enterprises, through loans and equity, amounted to in excess of $8 billion as at June 1988. Moreover, the GBEs are of strategic importance to every other sector of the economy. They are an essential part of the economic infrastructure on which efficiency gains and export efforts in other sectors of the economy depend. Reforming the GBEs is integral to our micro-economic reform agenda because those reforms have a multiplier effect on productivity and competitiveness throughout the economy. They help to determine the speed and efficiency with which goods and services can be exchanged, markets can be developed, trade can be expanded, information can be processed and decisions can be made in every industry in Australia.

        Streamlining the GBEs
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        We have progressively modernised and streamlined the GBEs. The work on reforming the GBEs started early in the life of the Government with essential capital injections for the government airlines, Qantas and Australian Airlines, and for Australian National Line. The Ministerial statement on guidelines on Government statutory authorities and GBEs operations of November 1987 placed the reforms in a comprehensive policy framework. This framework was further consolidated in another ministerial statement of May 1988 on re-shaping the transport and communications GBEs. These reforms are now being implemented on a number of fronts, including exhaustive overhauling of legislation, new regulatory arrangements, revaluation of assets, calculation of community service obligations, the preparation of detailed corporate plans and the setting of financial targets for all GBEs. The Government has now put in place coherent and comprehensive change to the GBEs. The changes are coherent because they are all aimed at making the GBEs more enterprising and more businesslike. They are comprehensive because they affect every aspect of the GBEs structures and functions. This statement explains more specifically what these changes to our GBEs are designed to achieve and reports on the benefits which are now flowing to the economy and to the community generally.

       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        All the changes to the GBEs are designed to serve the same critical objectives. These objectives are:
       </para>
       <para>
        to enable the GBEs to perform more efficiently and effectively, on a commercial basis, in an increasingly competitive environment;
       </para>
       <para>
        to make the GBEs more financially viable, so that their demands on the Budget are reduced and they have a secure financial base from which to expand and diversify their operations;
       </para>
       <para>
        to focus the Government's involvement in the operations of the GBE on their strategic direction and financial accountability-put simply, to shift the emphasis from inputs to outputs; and
       </para>
       <para>
        to ensure the GBE provide substantial and growing benefits to the community, including through a strong emphasis on quality and service, fulfilling the designated community service obligations, where appropriate, and prices that have been constrained in various ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have not imposed change according to some ideological bureaucratic blueprint. In each GBE, the reforms made have been specifically adapted to the particular service the enterprise is providing, the market it caters for, the competition it faces, the assets it holds, the investments it has made, and the returns it has been able to deliver. The changes have been pragmatic and flexible. We have taken pains to make sure that in each case we have adopted the most effective approach to achieve reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process of reform is not yet complete but the policy framework we have established will ensure that the GBE will always remain responsive to the need for change. But our achievements have already been substantial and thorough. They are achievements on which all sectors in the Australian economy can build in the years ahead. Those changes will facilitate and accelerate the structural adjustment on which our future competitiveness-which means, among other things, our ability to create jobs and to maintain our standard of living-will depend.

        Financial Base
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The GBEs are now financially viable and have a solid base for future growth. When we came to office, Australian Airlines, Qantas and the Australian National Line were grossly undercapitalised. They had been starved of equity capital and their scope for future development was severely restricted. At the outset we took decisive action to provide the injection of equity so badly needed, which allowed the airlines to take advantage of the tourist boom and the massive growth in air traffic which came with it. In 1983, Australian Airlines had a paid up capital of only $40m and $25m of that had been injected only in the very last days of the Fraser Government. The Airline's debt to equity ratio was over 90 : 10, which imposed a severe burden of high interest payments at a time of declining business in the airline industry. In the two years 1981-83, Australian Airlines's losses amounted to more than three-quarters of what had been its paid up capital. This situation was completely untenable, and was immediately addressed by the Hawke Government through an equity injection of $90m in our first Budget. That made the Airline financially viable and put it on a competitive basis. It has not looked back.
       </para>
       <para>
        Profits earned by Australian Airlines since 1945 when it was established from all sources amount to $176m. Eighty per cent of this amount, $143m, has been earned since 1983. Since 1945 its dividends to the Commonwealth have amounted to $66m of which $28m has been paid in the last two years. In 1987-88, Australian Airlines earned $1.1 billion in revenue for an operating profit of $66.6m before tax. After tax, and extraordinary items, that amounted to a return on equity of 21.5 per cent. The Airline has been able to expand and diversify its operations, and to improve the quality of its service. None of that could have been done without the Government's early financial support.
       </para>
       <para>
        The improvement in the performance of Qantas is also striking. The Hawke Government has provided Qantas with an injection of $60m in capital, more than two-thirds the amount that had been provided in all the previous 37 years in which the Airline had been operating in government hands. Since 1947, when the Commonwealth acquired all of the shares of Qantas, the company has earned profits from all sources amounting to $564m, of which a staggering $485m, or 86 per cent, has been earned since the Hawke Government came to office in 1983. A similar picture applies to dividends. Since 1947 the company has declared dividends amounting to a total of $137m, with $92m out of this amount being paid since 1983. In the 15 month period ending 30 June 1988, Qantas earned revenue of $3.9 billion, for an operating profit of $272m before tax and a 11.6 per cent rate of return on assets. Obviously these indicators of Qantas's performance within the environment created by the Hawke Government are quite spectacular.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the government-owned railway, Australian National, government reform has again resulted in a significant improvement in performance. In our term of office, Australian National's call on the Budget for funds has been cut by 63 per cent in real terms. In 1987-88, for the first time, Australian National recorded a small operating surplus on its commercial freight operations. We have gone further than any State government in giving our railway a commercial charter and its performance in the past few years has been unmatched by any other publicly owned rail system in the country.
       </para>
       <para>
        A similar picture emerges with the Australian National Line, where we inherited an enterprise which was effectively bankrupt. ANL, in 1983, was a debt ridden, heavily subsidised loss maker, without any clear functions or direction. It is not that now. We increased ANL's equity base by $160.5m, to correct its undercapitalisation and high gearing. It has since implemented a rationalisation program which has involved hard decisions about the sale of some ships and termination of some services, and its performance has improved significantly. ANL has recorded a profit in each of the past four years and, in the next few weeks, it will be bringing forward a corporate plan designed to enable it to trade effectively in future years.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the legislated monopolies, Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Aussat Pty Ltd and Australia Post, profitability is not by itself an appropriate measure of performance. Other factors, such as service performance standards, real decreases in prices and levels of capital investment, are important performance indicators. Taking all these measures together, the GBEs are performing well by international comparisons. To enable better measurement of financial performance in the future, we are vesting, for the first time, a proper capital structure in Telecom and Australia Post. Also our complementary telecommunications policy reforms contain mechanisms for monitoring many of the non-financial performance measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Corporate Structures
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The communications GBEs have been given the commercial structure necessary for them to deal with the challenges of increased competition, continuing technological change, and new demands and opportunities in the marketplace. Telecom and Australia Post have been converted from commissions into statutory corporations. Each has been restructured along modern lines, and established with a board of directors. Aussat has been given scope for expanding and diversifying its activities. OTC was transformed into a public company in April 1989 and now trades as OTC Ltd with a better capital structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian Airlines was set up as an incorporated company in April 1988. Australian National's Act was further modernised to give greater emphasis to the commission's commercial charter. ANL will be converted into a public company in July of this year. It was unnecessary to change the incorporated company status of Qantas Airways Ltd, as it already suited its commercial environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Strategic Direction
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's involvement in the operations of its GBEs is now largely confined to two basic strategic management controls-the discipline and accountability of a forward looking corporate plan, and of an agreed financial target. Corporate plans set strategic directions for the enterprises. They establish the business priorities that enterprises will use each day in guiding their decisions. They provide the Government and the enterprises with a clear sense of direction and a clear awareness of their common purpose and shared interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has created a context for more innovative and creative commercial decisions. It is reflected, for example, in Qantas's acquisition of a minority share in Air New Zealand, in Telecom and OTC's successful bids for international contracts, in Telecom's initiatives in value added services in the telecommunications field, in Australia Post's work on electronic mail transmission, and in Australian National's continued exploration of opportunities for increased efficiency in inter-system railway operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is essential that the community's assets are used in the most effective way by the GBEs. The setting of financial targets gives a basis for measuring their performance. The targets can include the rate of return on assets or shareholder funds, lump sum aggregates or profitability measures related to turnover. In making these assessments, we are taking into account past earnings, industry competition, the opportunity cost of capital, the cost of meeting community service obligations and the performance of similar private sector companies. No single indicator has been arbitrarily imposed on all the GBEs.
       </para>
       <para>
        A prerequisite for setting financial targets has been the revaluation of GBE assets. That task will be completed by 1 July, with the exception of Australian National, the assets of which will be revalued over a five-year period. We have also had to assess the financial value of community service obligations. In Telecom's case, that task is being undertaken by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics under my portfolio in cooperation with the enterprise, and is now near completion.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all cases, decisions on the financial target are a matter for extensive discussion between the Government and the enterprise. The targets are being set at a level which will oblige the enterprise to improve its performance and, in doing so, to ensure that the Australian people receive full value for the money they have invested in the GBEs. We will have an interest in making sure that these enterprises use their great resources as efficiently as possible, and that taxpayers-like shareholders in any business-obtain a proper return on their investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Loosening Other Controls
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has removed a large number of day-to-day controls on the GBEs. Most of those had outlived their usefulness and inhibited the taking of commercial decisions. The controls, which covered such matters as opening bank accounts, letting contracts, major purchases and construction programs, are now a thing of the past. At the same time the Government is loosening up a number of strategic controls. The enterprises have recently been given greater autonomy and independent responsibility in managing their industrial relations arrangements. Most of them have also advertised for, and appointed, chief executives under new terms and conditions which include new employment arrangements involving the abolition of tenure and more market related remuneration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet in this regard it should be noted that the extent to which remaining strategic controls can be relaxed must take account of the macro-economic context in which we are operating. The interaction between macro-economic settings and micro-economic reform will continue to affect the timing and scope of further changes to government controls.
       </para>
       <para>
        Community Service Obligations
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        For the GBEs, as for all other businesses, profits and return on assets are critical indices of performances. But they are not the only indices we use in assessing the performance of Telecom and Australia Post, which perform important community service obligations (CSOs). A CSO is a service that the enterprise is obliged to perform in the interests of the entire community, in circumstances where an enterprise acting solely commercially would not provide the service. Hence we have ensured that all Australians can have access to the high quality telephone service we have built up. Likewise, we have guaranteed that standard letters will continue to be carried at a uniform tariff within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will retain control over the CSOs through the ministerial power to direct variations to the strategies and policies to be followed by Telecom and Australia Post in carrying out their CSOs. We have defined these obligations more clearly through new legislation. Provision has also been made for the corporate plans of Telecom and Australia Post to include the strategies and policies they intend to pursue to fulfil those CSOs. In addition, their annual reports will include an outline of these strategies and policies. We are breaking new ground in measuring the extent of the CSOs. The GBEs will be required to give an account of them.
       </para>

        Telecommunications Efficiency Gains
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        All members of the community will benefit from the greater efficiency of our GBEs, in the ways already specified and through lower prices. Telecom has recently implemented a $100m per annum cut in subscriber trunk dialling rates, and OTC has also announced a $50m annual reduction in tariffs. A three-minute phone call between Brisbane and Perth now costs only 55 per cent of what it cost when the Government came to office. Increases in standard postal charges have been kept well below the rate of inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of telecommunications services, we are now going further to ensure that efficiency gains flow through to every consumer of the service provided. That has meant determining new price control mechanisms. As a result, we will be applying price cap regulation as well as setting target rates of return for two of our telecommunications carriers and infrastructure providers, Telecom and OTC. Our aim has been to combine the price gap and the rate of return targets so that the carriers are pushed to achieve further gains in efficiency in delivery of services. Consumers will gain directly, and the whole economy will gain indirectly, from real price reductions for a basket of standard services and improvements in service efficiency generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The price cap will operate for three years from 1 July. After examining available productivity gains, and the various factors which influence the rate of return targets for the carriers-Telecom and OTC-we have set the formula for that period at Consumer Price Index minus 4 per cent. The price control arrangements also include ways of ensuring that proposed price increases for specified non-standard services will be subject to scrutiny by Austel, our new independent regulator. At the end of this statement I will be seeking leave to table a detailed account of the price control arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our formula means that, overall, consumers of the standard telecommunications services are guaranteed to benefit from substantial real price reductions in each of the next three years. Efficiency gains will enable the carriers to meet the financial targets which have been set. The 4 per cent figure may be increased in subsequent years to take account of a different mix of rate of return requirements, increases in available productivity gains and greater efficiencies resulting from technological change.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are making major complementary changes to the regulatory arrangements in telecommunications. More market segments are being liberalised. For example, customer equipment and value added telecommunications services are open to full competition. The activities reserved to the carriers-Telecom, OTC and Aussat-are more clearly defined in legislation. Telecom will no longer be the industry regulator as Austel will take over this task. Under legislation currently before the Parliament, Austel will be charged with a number of functions including protection of carrier responsibilities, protection of competitors from unfair practices of carriers, protection of consumers from unfair practices, promotion of efficiency of carriers and technical regulation of the industry.
       </para>

        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Reforming the GBEs would achieve only limited results if it were not synchronised with other micro-economic reforms. I have referred already to our thorough-going review of the telecommunications policy framework. A package of reforms on the waterfront and coastal shipping is the subject of a separate statement which I have already made today. Those policy steps complement other moves already taken in the transport and communications portfolio including the termination of the two airlines policy; liberalised liner shipping arrangements; the new national arterial roads category of the Australian Centennial Road Development Program focusing on roads of economic significance; steps towards nationally uniform weight and speed limits for interstate road vehicles; and liberalisation of international passenger and freight charter flights. In addition, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation will soon be subject to the same GBE reform process as other enterprises in the portfolio.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our approach has been flexible and pragmatic. We have deliberately chosen the best way, which means the most effective and equitable way, to set the GBEs up to do their business. Our approach is, therefore, quite different from that of the Opposition which, during its terms in office, did virtually nothing to reform, or even to maintain, the GBEs. They were content to let these enterprises operate in an unbusinesslike way, producing minimum returns on capital and insufficient levels of customer service. As for the future, the Opposition has nothing to offer except a doctrinaire, ideological commitment to privatisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have placed the GBEs at the cutting edge of micro-economic reform. We have pursued reform of the GBEs in the firm conviction that the upgrading and reshaping of our public enterprises will greatly assist Australia to become more efficient and more competitive in world markets. We are demonstrating that government enterprises can be efficient, even dynamic, and can compete strongly with the private sector. I commend the GBE reforms to the House.

        New Price Controls for Telecommunications Services
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        A principal objective of the Government's micro- economic reform agenda is to improve Australia's competitiveness through greater efficiency. This is being achieved in the telecommunications sector by applying rate of return regulation and price-cap regulation to two of the country's public telecommunications carriers and infrastructure providers, Telecom Australia and OTC Limited.
       </para>
       <para>
        The policy intention is that the combination of the price-cap and rate of return targets will encourage the carriers to achieve further gains in efficiency. Consumers and the economy generally will benefit from the real price reductions and gains in efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        Price-Cap Formula
       </para>
       <para>
        The new price controls will commence on 1 July 1989 and be administered by the new independent regulatory body, the Australian Telecommunications Authority (AUSTEL). The price-cap will regulate prices charged by Telecom and OTC for specified reserved services by limiting average price rises to a minimum annual percentage below the rate of inflation (CPI minus X).
       </para>
       <para>
        Price-Cap Controls
       </para>
       <para>
        The price-cap will operate for three years. Carriers will need to inform AUSTEL of proposed tariff changes and show how these conform with any relevant determinations issued under the Telecommunications Bill 1989 by the Minister for Transport and Communications. The carriers will not be allowed to implement the tariff changes unless informed by AUSTEL that the proposed changes conform with any relevant determination. The Government intends to direct AUSTEL to notify carriers on this matter within 28 days of receiving the proposed tariff changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Value of X
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided that X, in the CPI minus X formula, will be set initially at 4 per cent per annum. This has been decided after consideration of the available productivity gains in the telecommunications enterprises and of factors affecting the carriers' rate of return targets. By setting X at 4 per cent, consumers and the economy generally will benefit from real price reductions each year. At the same time, the real gains in efficiency will enable the carriers to generate sufficient revenue to achieve their target rates of return.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rate of Return Targets
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom's and OTC's rate of return targets for the three year period are being developed within the context of their corporate plans. The plans will include values for capital expenditures, borrowing requirements, taxation assumptions, the impact of asset revaluations, changes to their financial structures, and variations in operating costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additionally, as part of the general reform package for government business enterprises, the carriers will be required to make dividend payments of a certain order to the Government. The dividend will be determined in part by the level of profitability, which itself may be affected by the level of X.
       </para>
       <para>
        Determinants of X
       </para>
       <para>
        The two major factors considered in the determination of X are:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) achievable cost reductions resulting from productivity growth and efficiency improvements in Telecom and OTC
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) the setting of minimum target rates of return.
       </para>
       <para>
        In determining the value of X, the Government considered estimates of achievable productivity gains in telecommunications services. Current studies of productivity measures in telecommunications enterprises suggest an available annual productivity increase of 3 to 4 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also took into account the need for the carriers to improve internal efficiencies and to take advantage of available productivity gains. In this context, a value for X of 4 per cent per annum was judged appropriate. It will permit them to generate sufficient revenues to meet their rate of return targets, capital investment needs, income tax, required dividend payments and costs of community service obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In setting the value of X, the Government also considered relevant work undertaken by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, the Industries Assistance Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Future Values of X
       </para>
       <para>
        The level of X will be reviewed by AUSTEL before the end of the first three years and the Government may increase it in subsequent periods given a different mix of rate of return requirements, increases in available productivity gains, and improvements in technological efficiencies.
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTEL will be responsible for arranging studies of the carriers' performance to provide a basis for setting the required productivity gains used by the Government to determine future values of X in the CPI-X formula. The studies will include comparisons of the enterprises' efficiency against their most efficient counterparts elsewhere in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        Application of CPI
       </para>
       <para>
        The CPI figure from the previous financial year will be used in the formula. This will avoid difficulties associated with forecasting prospective CPI trends. In any financial year, Telecom and OTC will be permitted to increase average nominal prices by no more than the previous financial year's CPI less the reduction for X.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the CPI-X figure is substantially negative (greater than one), the carriers will be required to reduce prices within the year. To prevent undue implementation costs, carriers will not be required to make immediate adjustments for negative outcomes of less than one per cent, and will be permitted to offset them against increases in later years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Composition of Standard Services
       </para>
       <para>
        Domestic services subject to the price-cap arrangements will comprise the standard monopoly services such as business and residential rentals and local and trunk call charges. Standard OTC services will be subject to a similar price-cap. For OTC, these comprise International Direct Dial and off-peak and operator-handled tariffs for various categories of countries for which OTC charges differential rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Weighting of Services
       </para>
       <para>
        In applying the price-cap to an average of a range of standard services, the Government has decided to weight each service by its relative revenue contribution from the previous year. This approach avoids the need to forecast revenue growth for individual services or to implement retrospective adjustments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Carry-Forward Arrangements
       </para>
       <para>
        Annual carry-forward of unused allowable price increases will be permitted within the first three years to give the carriers flexibility to adjust their price movements during a period in which they will be undergoing financial restructuring and be subject to income tax payments in the 1991/92 financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The carry-forward arrangements mean that the carriers will be allowed to retain an unused price adjustment entitlement from one year to the next, provided that in total prices do not increase in aggregate more than CPI minus X over the three years. The carry-forward arrangement will be reviewed by AUSTEL within the first three year period and a report submitted to Government before the commencement of the next price-cap period.
       </para>
       <para>
        OTC Considerations
       </para>
       <para>
        To allow for exchange rate and other international factors affecting OTC's revenues (eg, adverse movement in net payments to overseas administrations), the Government will establish special procedures for OTC. OTC will be able to request AUSTEL to report to the Government on the need to adjust the value of X for OTC in any one year where international factors affecting OTC's revenue require consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        In reporting to the Government on an OTC request to adjust the value of X, AUSTEL will be required to take into account an assessment of the productivity gains available within OTC.
       </para>
       <para>
        Price Control of Non-Standard Monopoly Services
       </para>
       <para>
        Prices for other than standard services will be a matter for commercial determination by Telecom and OTC in the first instance. However, the Government may use its power under the Telecommunications Bill 1989 to declare specific reserved services for the purposes of price control, whereupon price changes would become notifiable to AUSTEL and subject to disallowance by the Minister following a report by AUSTEL.
       </para>
       <para>
        Determinations Under the Act
       </para>
       <para>
        Appropriate determinations setting out the price-cap arrangements will be issued pursuant to the relevant parts of the Telecommunications Bill 1989. The Government expects the Bill will commence on 1 July 1989. A determination also will be issued for Telecom's connection fees and public telephone local call charges, requiring them to be scrutinised by AUSTEL and subject to disallowance by the Minister.

         —These statements were introduced into the House of Representatives last week and have already been the subject of considerable public discussion. They are statements about areas of reform which the Opposition regards as matters of very great urgency. We heard Senator Button in Question Time, just a few minutes ago, berating the Opposition because it regards matters such as this as matters of urgency. It seems to have escaped Senator Button and members of this Government that Australia is sliding ever deeper into a morass of debt, that the Australian people are feeling the effects of this through the extraordinary interest rates that they are paying and that there is vast dissatisfaction about the future which is now promised for this country under the policies which have been followed by this Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is a drastic need for reform in areas such as the waterfront and coastal shipping and in the operations of government enterprises. I think one could sum up these statements by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) as saying that once again the Government is doing too little too late. What we have is an urgent need for reform. What we have from this Government is the lowest common denominator approach. It has gone just as far as the slowest member of the troop is prepared to move. As a result Australia will continue its slide into ever deeper debt and the sorts of matters which are of direct impact on the lives of Australians-interest rates in particular-will continue to be unbearable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The simple reality of our economy was exposed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He said after the last round of debate in April that the problem for Australia was that we were consuming more than we produced. The fact is that these areas are areas where production is impeded and where we simply fail to achieve the production that is possible in Australia. They are areas of gross waste. They are areas of gross inefficiency. As a result they are areas which weigh heavily on our current economic failings. We had again during Question Time Senator Cook in one of his prepared statements talking with very considerable pride about micro-economic reform and its impact upon the mining industry. It is worth noting the response of representatives of the mining industry to the so-called reforms which we are dealing with today. Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, when asked to comment on the so-called reforms to coastal shipping and stevedoring in an interview just last week, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Well, we will just languish off and become more and more, a third rate country. We can't afford to do that. We've got great resources here, we've got some good people. We should have the technology and be able to build the ships, make them here and be able to use them on our coast. If we don't, other people will be processing our raw materials and adding value to them, rather than ourselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that interview Mr McIntosh made the point that Australian resources are shipped overseas for treatment and have value added to them, to provide the wealth that this country requires, because it is far cheaper to ship them overseas than to ship them around our coast. That is a simple illustration of why this country is not creating the wealth that it could create and why our economic problems continue. The fact that this matter is regarded as urgent by the Opposition is indicated by the 12 Opposition speakers who have sought to take part in the debate. I think that the Government has allowed the balance of this afternoon for that debate. To facilitate as many senators as possible to speak, the time taken by most speakers will be shortened and I will not address the Senate for very long.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are dealing with one of the fundamental defects in the Australian economy-one of those areas where we continue to strangle ourselves, where we continue to impede the production of wealth and, therefore, where we continue to impede our economic recovery. It is a very sorry record of failure when the representative of one of our leading industries refers to us as a third rate country. It is not a matter of the Opposition, in some narrow political way, attacking these issues and not having alternative plans. At the time of the April statement we tabled in the House of Representatives detailed proposals for reform in a number of areas, including those of coastal shipping and the waterfront.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not just a matter of engaging in partisan politics to condemn the Government's failure to come to grips with these matters. Commentator after commentator-users of these services-have all condemned the Government's proposals as totally inadequate. The Sydney Morning Herald, which over the years has been pretty even-handed in its treatment of the Government's economic policies, and indeed has often been full of praise for them, stated in a leading article following the release of the statements that Mr Willis's plan to reform coastal shipping `amounts to a huge bribe for minimal change'. The article went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Willis's plan for the reform of waterfront seems hardly more encouraging. . . . Again there is to be a huge bribe for changes still to be negotiated.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we have this too little too late approach-the lowest common denominator approach-and Australia suffers as a result. When one looks at what could have been done with coastal shipping, the difference between what is being done and the necessary changes becomes clear. The Opposition put forward a series of changes which would have introduced genuine pressure and competition in that vital area of Australian transport-an area which the Inter-State Commission (ISC) has identified as involving hundreds of millions of dollars worth of waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        We find in the statement that trans-Tasman sea lanes-the scandal of the costly shipping between Australia and New Zealand, which is so inimical to our trade there-are not dealt with in any effective way. We find that the Government leaves Australian ships with a monopoly on the coastal shipping trade. There is no suggestion of the removal of cabotage which is the one guarantee that we would have of a genuinely competitive shipping service around our coast. The idea of enterprise employment has not been dealt with effectively. Instead, we find, again, that a system of pooled employment remains in force. That is, again, a formula for continued inefficiency. We find that the Navigation Act, with its strong emphasis on non-competition, has been left in place. In other words, there is no fundamental reform of our coastal shipping. What the Government has done has been to get together with the parties-those who have a direct vested interest in the operation of the system-and it has accepted the rate of change which is permitted by the slowest of the players. Quite simply, the Government has let this country down in this vital area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's approach to the waterfront is equally hopeless. The Government in this case asked the Inter-State Commission to give it a report which would deal with the area of conspicuous waste. The Inter-State Commission offered changes which it believed could save in excess of $600m per year-a $600m addition to our national wealth with a reduction of those unnecessary costs. It made the point that what it was putting forward was required to be done in a complete way. It made the point that a package of interrelated proposals needed to be undertaken. We as an opposition, who had a more radical plan for reform, offered our cooperation to the Government. In a statement which I put on behalf of the Opposition we made it clear that, notwithstanding the fact that we thought more needed to be done than the Inter-State Commission had proposed, we were prepared to go along with the Commission's proposals provided they were implemented in full by the Government. We said that we would facilitate the passage of legislation and that we would support the appropriation of the very considerable taxpayers' funds which would be required if the Inter-State Commission report is adopted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has gladly picked up the suggestion that further taxpayers' funds should be applied to this industry, on this the thirteenth occasion that it has been investigated and where changes have been recommended. The Government intends to put hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds into redundancy arrangements and so on, but the Government has squibbed on the vital issues of ensuring that there is genuine competitiveness and employment at the enterprise level, instead of pooled employment, and that some of the more ludicrous union coverage arrangements are dealt with in an effective and efficient manner.

         —Again, the Minister at the table, who has shown himself congenitally unable to deal with any problem seriously when he is on the defensive, and who yesterday had to go back against his own words and beliefs on matters such as the deregulation guidelines, seeks to interrupt this debate because he knows that this is a third rate attempt by this third rate Government to deal with a genuine problem of which he, as a Minister, is fully aware. When the reports were released the National Farmers Federation said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government appears to be unwilling or afraid to impose reform on the waterfront and maritime unions. It has been frozen into inactivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my press release, when I offered the Opposition's support to this paralysed Government, I did not say that it was frozen into inactivity; I said that it was a paralysed government. That has been proven true by subsequent statements. The National Farmers Federation made it quite clear that the reforms announced by the Government are totally inadequate. It made it quite clear that with respect to New Zealand the reforms have not been undertaken. In the same way, the Australian Mining Industry Council, through its Executive Director, Lauchlan McIntosh, has made it clear that adequate reforms have not been undertaken and the problems have not been solved. A group which is directly concerned, the Australian Shipping User Group-a group that was put together under the auspices of the Federal Government-has strongly endorsed the direction for waterfront reform proposed by the ISC and has welcomed the Opposition's stance on this matter. I quote from what that group wrote to us:
       </para>
       <para>
        I welcome your recent offer of bipartisan support to the Government if it implements a genuine program of waterfront reform based on the Inter-State Commission's recommendations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like you, ASUG recognises that no one likes every element of the ISC's plan, if considered in isolation . . .

        . . . we believe any watering down on the substantive components of the package could place in jeopardy the entire program for waterfront reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        Look at the program that was put forward by the Inter-State Commission. The key part of the program was that it would guarantee a movement to a genuinely competitive situation. There was to be an in-principle agreement between the parties which would cover all of the essential elements of the agreement. We find that the Government is committed only to those elements of the plan which involved the expenditure of taxpayers' funds and the placing of new burdens and obligations on employers. It is totally unable to produce a commitment to those parts of the plan which involved the assumption of obligations by the trade union movement and, in particular, by the Waterside Workers Federation. The Minister at the table, Senator Button, knows that it is a simple fact that if a container is loaded in a depot which is controlled by the Waterside Workers Federation, a very substantial cost premium is paid for that privilege.

Where we need to have changes in respect of union coverage of depots, we get nothing but a promise from the Government to give that further consideration. There is a need to arrange for the withdrawal of the Waterside Workers Federation from loading bulk ships, but there is no commitment on the part of the Government. The simple fact is that the Government has simply squibbed on all of those things which present difficulties for it with its own constituency.

        This is not a package of reform measures.

This series of responses on the part of the Government is a matter of very great disappointment to the Opposition. We believe that Australia has been sold short. It represents a substantial contribution by this Government to the on-going difficulties of the Australian economy.

         —The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), when announcing on 1 June the Government's micro-economic reform package on the waterfront, commented that through recent reports commissioned by the Government it was common knowledge that Australia has been poorly served by its shipping and waterfront industries. What a gross disappointment that it has taken him so long to come to this rather pedestrian conclusion. Had his Government bothered to ask Australian exporters-indeed, the community at large-it would have discovered without commissioning lengthy reports that this was much more than mere common knowledge. It is sheer lunacy that Australia's industries have tolerated such a debilitating disease which has attacked its heart for so long.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In several speeches in this place over the past 18 months I have identified the inefficiencies and rorts on our waterfront which cost our exporters dearly. The Hawke Labor Government now belatedly acknowledges that such gross inefficiencies have retarded our growth, reduced the living standards of ordinary Australians and seriously damaged Australia's export capabilities. These facts have not gone unnoticed by millions of Australians involved in industries which have had to stand by and watch the tactics of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia which has unscrupulously masterminded the almost complete destruction of Australia's waterfront. Its actions have sent this nation back decades. It comes as no surprise that this Labor Government belatedly feels compelled to create the impression that it is bringing the Federation into line. Both the Inter-State Commission's report, released on 6 April, and the report of the shipping reform task force, released on 20 April, were unified in their findings that the requirement for urgent reform and restructuring on the waterfront was critical if Australia was to haul itself into the twenty-first century.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government boasts that current micro-economic reforms follow on from its 1984 measures in response to the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping. The Government failed to mention that the maritime industries have weathered over a dozen investigations, reports, commissions, inquiries and examinations in the last 40 years. Almost as soon as one draws to an end, another is commissioned. Yet the disgraceful situation still exists, virtually intact, crawling at a snail's pace towards the year 2000.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to coastal shipping, the Government has done nothing more than endorse the report of a task force dominated by Australian unions and shipowners. But that report falls far short of the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission to allow competition from foreign ships in the coastal trade.

         —This statement confirms the Hawke Government's complete inability to address the essentials of micro-economic reform. The Minister asked whether we would have done that. He ought to know from reading our policy that over a period that will occur under the next coalition government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        With regard to the waterfront, the Government has completely failed to address the contentious issues of bulk handling, stand-down clauses, smaller ports and container depots. Despite its intended multi-pronged restructure of the waterfront and shipping industries, the Government's proposals fail to create competitive environments in either of these industries. Especially in the area of coastal shipping, cabotage will remain quite intact. The coalition's plan for its elimination over a five-year period is well documented. The Minister ought not have needed to interject to ask that question a few moments ago. The Government chose to reject our offer of bipartisan support on this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition has also indicated its intention, which was reinforced a few moments ago by the remarks of our leader, Senator Chaney, to repeal all sections of the Navigation Act which impinge on industry productivity and efficiency, only retaining those which relate to environmental and safety aspects. The Government has chosen, to its peril-and sadly, also, to the nation's peril-to neglect addressing two of the key measures recommended in the Inter-State Commission's report-the provision of stand-down clauses in waterfront union awards and the removal of Waterside Workers Federation coverage of employees in smaller ports and container depots.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some cuts in crews and increases in efficiency have already been achieved in respect of Australian ships. However, the Government's proposal that total crew requirements for a new Australian vessel be 37 men falls far short of the efficiency of similar vessels in Europe which operate with just 22 men. The Industries Assistance Commission has already presented compelling evidence that the lack of effective foreign vessel competition in our coastal trade is crippling key Australian industries. So why does the Government have to wait for yet another three years before again considering the introduction of foreign vessel competition?
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently I asked Senator Button what the Government intended to do about the illegal union practices in the trans-Tasman trade which have cost Australia several wheat sales to New Zealand. As far as I am aware, not only has the Minister so far failed to provide an answer to that question but also the Government has failed in this statement to initiate any action on that front of the trans-Tasman trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Meanwhile, on the waterfront, acknowledged as the key stumbling block to more efficient shipping, the reform process has barely started. It may be that over the last 20 years since the advent of containerisation the number of waterside workers has fallen by 75 per cent to around 5,000. Despite each worker handling over 5,000 tonnes a year, Australia's position on the international competitive ladder remains unchanged. Our ports remain among the most inefficient in the world. It is about 12 years since the last set of reforms were introduced on the waterfront and these did next to nothing to effect any efficiencies in performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        One look at the image that the waterside workers has is sufficient to realise why inefficiency has survived for so long. Thirty-three per cent of Waterside Workers Federation members are over 55 years of age. There has been no recruitment in Sydney or Melbourne since 1975. In my own State of South Australia, Port Adelaide has not recruited since 1967 and in Hobart only 10 members have been recruited in the last 33 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Upon the release of the Inter-State Commission's report, both Bill Kelty and Tas Bull, the Waterside Workers Federation General Secretary, claimed that the recommendations were industrial relations nonsense. Down the track somewhat, when all Australians see that the Hawke Labor Government is unable to deliver the goods on waterfront reform, it will be judged by business, industry and the community at large to be the dismal failure that it is.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission's central recommendation, that the present industry pool system of employment be replaced by a system whereby workers are employed by individual stevedoring companies, would bring efficiencies to the system, but the waterside workers claim that this is impractical. Of course, it is not impractical. The Waterside Workers Federation is about preserving the union's role in the industry even if an enterprise-based employment system is developed. Such a situation would merely serve to hold back labour efficiencies for the stevedoring companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission also proposes that fluctuation in labour needs should be met by a pool of supplementary labour in major ports. But, again, the Waterside Workers Federation wants to decide who will be a member of that group. It wants to appoint retired wharfies, retired seamen and, if necessary, workers from port authorities. What good would retired wharfies be? Does the union want these retired souls to return after they have received their golden handshakes to further rort the system?

       <para>
        Another recommendation in the report of the Inter-State Commission is that 3,000 of the present wharf work force be pensioned off over the next three years with an extremely generous redundancy scheme, and that an additional 1,000 new recruits be trained. We are not throwing these waterside workers to the wolves. As Senator Stone said, they have received golden handshakes in past periods of redundancy, and an extremely generous golden handshake is envisaged in the Inter-State Commission report. Therefore, there can be no excuse for not implementing the recommendations in the report. The Government proposes to provide up to $145m, shared with the industry on a dollar for dollar basis, to fund this early retirement redundancy offer. It has also agreed to provide up to $8m for improving training facilities, the training of new recruits, and the retraining of existing employees to facilitate job restructuring. Of course, on that dollar for dollar basis, employers will be required to match the Government's financial input.

        The Government, no doubt at the behest of the Waterside Workers Federation, has failed to implement the Inter-State Commission's recommendation that there should be special stand down provisions for the waterfront and that the union should not cover certain workers, including those at smaller ports with an integrated labour force and workers handling bulk cargoes.

         —I am about to come to the point. The reason it should not be handled in that way is that the Inter-State Commission found that employers need quick access to stand-down provisions for the effective settling of disputes to ensure that the unions comply with agreements. The Government has left this to the Industrial Relations Commission process, as the Minister has just interjected. That is an entirely unsatisfactory approach, because it reinforces the role of the industrial relations club just when it ought to be fading away. Recent earnest posturings by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) cannot but lead one to speculate that the unions have already won on this issue. It is certain that the unions will use their continuing industrial muscle to achieve further advantage, which in the past has been characterised by the introduction of restrictive work practices.

        Back on the waterfront, where the real damage filters down to other industries, it has been obvious that overmanning, outmoded work practices, political strikes and ineffective management have cost this country some $2 billion per year. Let me remind the Senate that the work practices issue is not the only issue on the waterfront; another is political strikes. We all remember the strikes that were engendered over the issue of Fiji not all that long ago. They had nothing to do with workers' conditions and benefits. Such practices have cost Australian farmers $130m a year, or about $800 per farmer, on grain exports alone. It is about time these shoddy practices were outlawed, but the Government's mealy-mouthed approach will not do the trick. Australians have learnt to their disgust that it is they themselves who end up paying all the way along the line, from the poor competitiveness of our country's exported goods and services to decreasing productivity and reduced human endeavour.
       </para>
       <para>
        By failing to implement the key recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report on the waterfront, the Hawke Labor Government stands condemned for allowing exorbitant waterfront costs to continue. Although the coalition believes that the Inter-State Commission's recommendations themselves fall short of some of the dramatic changes required on the waterfront, it recognises that they offer hope for a major improvement. We therefore offer the Government bipartisan support in implementing those recommendations. The Minister's statement clearly demonstrates that the Government has rejected that offer. It is largely ignoring the Inter-State Commission. All we will see is another three months of procrastinating committees and reviews, and probably very little action. The Australian people deserve better than that, and they will show this Government only too plainly that they deserve better when they throw it out and elect a coalition government at the next election-a government which will fulfil its commitment to implement the changes required on our waterfront and in coastal shipping.

         —We are debating this afternoon the two ministerial statements by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Ralph Willis, put down last Thursday in the other chamber, entitled, Reform of Shipping and the Waterfront and Implementation of `Government Business Enterprises: Reforms and Telecommunications Pricing'. I propose to speak more to the first of those statements than to the second. Having in mind the long list of would-be speakers, I intend to contain my remarks to a much shorter compass than I would normally wish on a subject of this importance.

       <para>
        These statements follow a long lead-up period and a series of promises from the Government as to a major package of micro-economic reforms. At the time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brought down his so-called economic statement on 12 April, he and other Government spokesmen indicated that the total absence from that statement of any reference to micro-economic reform would be rectified during the month of May, when the Government would make a major statement upon that matter. We were asked to contain ourselves in patience until it did. When we received this so-called major package last week it was found to be a totally damp squid. It was, as the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Chaney) said in opening this debate, too little too late. Apropos that comment by Senator Chaney, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to some recent comments by one or two commentators who have given their views as to Australia's present economic state. The Opposition has been hammering away at this for as long as I can remember. On 1 June Mr Robert Haupt wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald about what he called the need for a sense of crisis to be generated in Australia if we are to begin to cope with the problems besetting us. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        But what do we find in our current economic crisis?
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly our sovereignty is already compromised, for we are at the point where the world is taking charge of our affairs. Our freedom . . . is already compromised. Our security depends, in the end, on maintaining our relative economic position: It-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, our security-
       </para>
       <para>
        is not now compromised, but history shows that weakened nations invite domination by powerful neighbours.
       </para>
       <para>
        All this and no sense of crisis! Why? The first part of the answer is our old friend, wishful thinking. Mr Micawber, it must be remembered, was dispatched to live in Australia. He may still be here, in some modern-day incarnation, in which case he is undoubtedly serving on the bench of the Industrial Relations Commission, a body dedicated to the idea that something is bound to turn up.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The first treatment for a patient who will not acknowledge that he is ill is a stiff dose of the truth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ever since this Government came to office, particularly in its current term since the election in July 1987, it has denied the Australian people that stiff dose of the truth. That stiff dose of the truth is needed to generate the sense of national crisis which can be the only basis for actions which are commensurate with the magnitude of that crisis, as reflected in our monthly balance of payments deficits, our quarterly debt figures and the other matters we debate in this place from time to time.
       </para>
       <para>
        For years the Opposition and private commentators have urged major measures of micro-economic reform, including, above all, reform of the labour market. Just over three years ago I and some other gentlemen formed a body, the H. R. Nicholls Society, which was solely dedicated to reform of the labour market. In the process, it was dedicated to reducing the present grossly excessive power of trade unions, including their highly privileged position which they enjoy at law. The Society was dedicated to changing the manner in which we go about setting wages and salaries and other conditions of employment in this country. Its objectives did not come from any feeling of animus towards trade unions as such. They are perfectly legitimate organisations and people are perfectly free to join them. However, they have become the greatest single threat to the continued existence of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        At that time, as was no doubt predictable, the trade unions themselves reacted with fury to the fact that someone had set up a society, a debating club, devoted to attacking their excessive powers. Their chief journalistic stooge at the time was Miss Pamela Williams, who wrote for the Business Review Weekly; she is now an industrial relations correspondent for the Australian Financial Review. At that time she wrote in the Business Review Weekly a magnificent hatchet piece entitled `The Union Busters'. Her theme was taken up by the then Special Minister of State, the Hon. Mick Young, in a notorious appearance on a Channel 9 Sunday program in, I think, September 1986 when he promulgated and propounded the term `the New Right'. It was taken up also by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), another friend of the trade union bosses. In his normally urbane manner, he described us as economic troglodytes and political illiterates, or some other of the well-chosen phrases which always trip so sweetly from the Prime Minister's lips.
       </para>
       <para>
        At that time the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union financed a vicious smear campaign against the individuals who were associated with the H. R. Nicholls Society, and against some other individuals whom they chose to lump in but who were not associated with that Society. The Australian Council of Trade Unions began planning a fighting fund, which I think was for $1 1/2m or $1 1/2m, to launch a propaganda campaign-it did not call it that; it called it a public relations campaign-to vilify what the ACTU called the New Right, and in the process to attempt to scrub up the appalling image of the trade union bosses, an image reflected in every public opinion poll ever taken in this country. The last poll I saw showed that some 83 per cent of people in this country agreed with the proposition that trade unions have too much power. I add that 55 per cent of trade union members themselves agree with that proposition.

         —I am coming to it right now. I wanted to lay the ground before doing so. The relevance of it is that it is the bane of trade union power which constitutes the barrier to all progress in micro-economic reform in this country, including progress on the part of the Government, assuming that it wants to make progress in this area. I am prepared to concede that at least some Ministers in the Government want to make progress in this area, but in that process they continue to run into this insurmountable roadblock; I should say that it is insurmountable by the Labor Party. We had a classic example of that in the statement before us this afternoon, which was put down last week in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis.

        Let us consider the waterfront. As other speakers have noted, we have had a first-class report by the Inter-State Commission on the subject of the waterfront. It has taken a very long while to arrive and has been very much strung out in the process. On its publication, the report was described by the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, Mr Tas Bull, as being totally unacceptable. He was backed up by none other and no less a figure than Mr Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is true that in the course of the past 20 years or so the Waterside Workers Federation has undergone a very steady loss of membership. Before containerisation came into this country it had something over 21,000 members; today it has a little over 5,000. That is a fact which people like Mr Tas Bull and others before him and others in other trade unions always neglect. New technology will always beat monopolies. It is beating them in the labour market. That is why a few years ago the ACTU brought an action in the High Court in order to bring the process of technological change under its control and under the control of its friends in that moribund body previously called the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission but now known as the Industrial Relations Commission. It has undergone a name change, but it is still the same moribund body.

        If we want to see the kind of destructive effect of the way we go about industrial relations and therefore the ultimate need for micro-economic reform in these matters, we might turn, for example, to page 102 of the report of the Inter-State Commission on which it reports on a coal terminal study. Because of my self-imposed time constraint, I do not have time to go through it in detail, but I will quote a few points from the report of the consultants who were engaged to undertake that study. They identified a number of arrangements which were having an adverse effect on the performance of our coal loading terminals as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        the level of manning at the New South Wales terminals, which is substantially greater than that at the Queensland facilities;
       </para>
       <para>
        the level of manning at terminals owned and operated by the Maritime Services Board-
       </para>
       <para>
        the New South Wales Maritime Services Board-
       </para>
       <para>
        which is significantly greater than employment levels at privately owned Newcastle facilities (even though the throughput at the public facilities is less than that at the privately operated terminals);
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        the large number of unions representing New South Wales coal employees, which inhibits agreement between employees and management; the enforced use of gangway watchmen and hatchmen, which appears to have been maintained as a result of historical practice rather than as an operational or safety requirement of contemporary bulk shipping;
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        restrictive work practices (for example, minimum working hours and wage requirements at Balmain) . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        And so on. The list is endless. That is the problem that the people of Australia are confronting when they seek to undertake micro-economic reform in this country. The problem simply has to be surmounted.

        I close my remarks by referring to a paper delivered to a recent conference of the H. R. Nicholls Society held in Canberra in late February of this year. The conference was entitled `No Ticket, No Start, No More'. The paper was delivered by Mr Joe Thompson, who, in an earlier incarnation, was for many years the General Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia and subsequently a Labor Party member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. I think he has now retired from that position. I hope I do not have that fact wrong. Mr Thompson gave a paper to that conference which was remarkable, particularly coming from the quarter it came from. He began his paper by saying:
       </para>

       <para>
        Initially, the setting up of a legal type system, to set minimum or award rates, by a court did have a beneficial effect and overall was, at that time, in the national interest. We were spared much of the excesses of serious labour disputes, which in many countries, particularly the United States, led to bloodshed and violence to a degree never experienced in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, Australia's conciliation and arbitration systems both at State and Federal levels are now no longer working in our best interests and it can be argued that they are the cause of much of our economic problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are now on the verge of a major national wage blow out, the effects of which will ultimately be felt by the whole community and cause further damage to our fragile economy. This in turn will lead to further government economic restraints with most of the hardship being placed on those in the community least able to afford it.
       </para>
       <para>
        To put it simply, the so called benefits of the Accord have been little more than a mirage and have actually worsened our economy in the longer term.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the short term, the major winners of the accord have not been the ordinary trade unionist but has been the employers, and in the longer term, neither employer or employee have really gained.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the failure of the accord imminent it must be obvious that we cannot continue to rely upon a system of industrial relations which has failed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The time has arrived for no further reliance on a compulsory arbitration system and move to a system of direct negotiations with employers at industry or enterprise level, with a single union having complete coverage and negotiating exclusively on behalf of those employed in that industry. In other words a single Industry Union.
       </para>
       <para>
        This would enable agreements to be made between both parties, which would apply to that industry or enterprise only and flow-ons to other sections of industry should not occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        This would mean that there would be no lowest common denominator as we have in Australia now and obviously some industries or individual enterprises, would, depending on economic or other circumstances, have varying pay rates and other conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        With a single union having complete coverage for an enterprise or industry, it would be in their interest to ensure that the enterprise prospered, as this would lead to stability and greater rewards in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Incorporated in a legally binding contract between union and company, should be a no strike/no lockout clause and most important, an agreed method of settling disputes during the life of the contract.

        This Industrial Relations System has been in operation in both the United States and Canada for many years and is now rapidly spreading to the United Kingdom. In that country the British Electoral Trades Union has been expelled from the British Trade Union Council, for entering into an agreement for one union coverage of a major section of the British Newspaper Industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of other unions however, have also signed single industry agreements, most of which include some type of no-strike clause.
       </para>
       <para>
        The pressure to enter into single industry union agreements has now become so strong, that the T.U.C. has been obliged to now state that before a union enters into such a contract, it must advise the T.U.C.
       </para>
       <para>
        There can be little doubt, that irrespective of the attitude of the T.U.C., it is only a matter of time before a system evolves, of which the cornerstone will be a single industry union negotiating for the whole business.
       </para>
       <para>
        The instability and irresponsibility of much of Australia's Trade Union Movement, cannot be allowed to continue, particularly as we are now no longer insulated from the rest of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        A typical example of the irresponsibility of some sections of our trade unions, can clearly be seen in the recent strike at CSR in Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        Four major unions and a number of smaller unions, served a wage demand upon that company and the dispute which followed led to serious national consequences on our confectionery and food processing industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        That a company, employing less than 400 people in its sugar processing plant, would have at least seven unions, highlights the need for an industrial relations system of single industry unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The majority of unions in the dispute were in maintenance with no real interest in the sugar industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the factory was to close permanently, they would have little difficulty as maintenance tradesmen, in gaining another position and the effect on their respective unions would be negligible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Attempts to gain sugar supplies led to the Federal Government deciding to lift a long standing embargo on the import of sugar and this in turn, led to the Queensland Government protesting at this decision, as they felt that it could lead to problems for that states sugar industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The combined unions at CSR, treated the Arbitration Commission with contempt and defied their orders, particularly in relation to picketing, and it was only the threat of civil action which really led to the settlement of the dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        The CSR dispute is a classic example of the type of industrial anarchy which crippled so much of British industry and the reason why many British companies are demanding and getting single industry unions with a contract of employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Britain is now coming into line and adopting an industrial relations system, comparable to most other nations in the free world.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is vital that we revitalise our manufacturing industry and ensure that extraction and allied industries can compete in International Markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our current reliance on our rural industries to earn export income is extremely dangerous. A major national drought, which occurs with monotonous regularity in this country would be extremely serious in view of our disastrous balance of trade figures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Put simply, we allow our present chaotic industrial relations system to continue at our peril.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, union amalgamations, will they assist in bringing some stability to our industries? The answer is a very positive NO! with little doubt that they will worsen the position and lead to better and bigger industrial disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposals are for amalgamations across the whole broad spectrum of industry, which would defeat the concept of Single Industry Unions.

        Imagine what would happened with an amalgamation between the Storeman and Packers Union and the Transport Workers Union. This super union would have an interest in almost every enterprise in the nation and could bring Australia to its knees, with little more than a telephone call.

        Existing amalgamations proposals have a number of similar propositions and must be viewed with grave concern. No doubt the ACTU would become stronger than ever, but there is little doubt that in our national interests, it would be disastrous.

         —I intend to confine my remarks in this debate to the question of government business enterprises (GBEs) and the Government's penchant for privatisation. Events during the last five or so years have indicated quite clearly to the Australian public that there is not a great deal of difference between the policies of the Labor Government and those of the Liberal-National Opposition when it comes to a range of economic matters. These matters include deregulation of the financial sector which has taken place and has been enthusiastically supported by everybody in this place except the Democrats. There were significant benefits promised from deregulation of the financial sector. We were told that competition would be increased, the entry of foreign banks as part of this deregulatory system would mean greater competition, services would increase, consumers would have a wider range of financial institutions to service them, and costs would go down as competition not only increased the number of services available but also meant the price of those services would be reduced. Nothing of the kind has happened.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The only beneficiaries of a deregulated financial sector have been the banks and, in particular, their shareholders, as interest rates have risen and bank profits have reached record levels at every six-month period to the point where Australia's three banks form the second most profitable banking sector in the world. No attempt is being made by this Government to place any restrictions on them. When the Commonwealth Banks Act was before this chamber, some 18 months or so ago, and the Democrats tried to amend it so that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia would be unable to charge the same fees as private banks were charging to small account holders, that amendment was defeated by a combined vote of the Liberal-National and Labor parties who were not prepared to restrict the Commonwealth Bank in any way from its de facto privatising activities of which we have seen so much in the last five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government and the Opposition have enthusiastically embraced the concept of foreign ownership-something that is of great concern to many Australians who perceive that in both the short and long term Australians as a whole will not benefit. Earlier this year, with the support of the Liberal and National parties, the Government passed legislation which further relaxed restrictions on foreign ownership in all areas with the exception of urban real estate. Of course, the damage has already been done in that area. We are now seeing the farm being sold off in a very real sense. I was disappointed that National Party senators who had expressed concern about overseas control of our been industry were not prepared to support a Democrat amendment for a register of foreign ownership in this country to enable us to have some idea of who owned what and who sending what income back home. Had that happened, we would have been able to take action before the floodgates opened entirely. Unfortunately, that has not occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, we have seen corporate welfare burgeon under the current Labor Government with the support of the Opposition parties while social welfare has suffered severe cutbacks. Last year company tax was cut by 20 per cent at a time when many of the major companies in this country were paying little or no tax at all. Indeed, Alan Bond said in an interview in the Australian Financial Review late last year that while his company was paying less than one cent in the dollar this financial year, it would pay nothing in the next financial year. Despite that a majority of members of this Parliament were still prepared to further cut company tax. In depleting its Consolidated Revenue the Government has had to take other steps to keep the domestic surplus at the high level demanded of it by international financiers. The only way the Government could do that, since it was cutting tax receipts, was to cut expenditure. Progressively over the past five years cuts have been made in the health, education and social welfare areas. The low income earners in this country have been forced to bear the brunt of the Government's deregulatory policies, part of which is its enthusiastic support for privatisation, in the main areas covered by the statement of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) today relating to the airlines, Telecom Australia and Australia Post.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite extraordinary that in his GBE reform statement-I question the use of the word `reform', since by and large that is supposed to mean that a benefit occurs; we need to ask to whom does the benefit occur-the Minister lists those major government business enterprises that come under his control: Qantas Airways Ltd; Australian Airlines; Australian National Line; Australian National Railways Commission; Telecom Australia; Overseas Telecommunications Commission; Aussat Pty Ltd; Australia Post; the Civil Aviation Authority; and the Federal Airports Corporation. In his statement the Minister said:

       <para>
        During the past six years the Government has systematically worked to put the operations of its transport and communications enterprises on a sounder financial footing and to make them more efficient, more flexible and more businesslike.
       </para>
       <para>
        I question why he or anybody else would argue that selling off the farm automatically makes it more efficient, more flexible, more businesslike and puts it on a sounder financial footing, particularly in areas such as the airlines, Telecom and postal services in a country like Australia where cross-subsidisation is almost essential if some people are not to be dealt with very badly. The statement continued:

       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        Somehow or other Mr Willis, along with his Labor Party colleagues, thinks that this has helped. To decide whether there has been any benefit we need to ask: Where is the end benefit to the user? Essentially, there is no end benefit to the user, if by using the term `the user' we are talking about the Australian public, the Australian taxpayer. The big winners in all of this have been the big corporations. As I have said before, we have seen increased bank profits and reduced services and we have seen increased costs to the public. Certainly there seems to be no restraint with regard to the pricing policies of Telecom Australia and Australia Post in recent times.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is amazing then how far we have come from the days when Sir Robert Menzies ridiculed the idea that the Commonwealth Bank should pay tax. He thought it was a ludicrous suggestion. How much more ludicrous would he find it if he were here to see a Labor government putting forward just that sort of proposal? Now we expect our flagships, such as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, Australian Airlines, Telecom and Australia Post, to be tax gatherers and to be market competitors instead of market regulators-to get out there and be hatchet people instead of assisting those who are in need.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is worth while looking at some comments made by a Minister in a previous Labor Government delivered quite recently to a conference in Victoria. The former Minister, Clyde Cameron, was speaking at a conference of the recently amalgamated Australian Telecom Employees Association and the Australian Telephone and Phonogram Officers Association-the telecommunications unions-in April. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Only a few weeks ago, Mr Hawke made noises which suggest that he, at any rate, may still be toying with the idea of selling Australian Airlines and Qantas.
       </para>
       <para>
        This may not be done in one fell sweep. It could be done in stages. Stage one, could be to continue the crazy practice of compelling the public to pay taxes to itself by taxing its own enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next stage could be to deliberately starve them of capital by refusing them the rights enjoyed by Alan Bond &amp; Co. to borrow funds for capital expansion. And the final stage could be to then pretend that the Government is left with no option but to sell.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Or, it could be to short circuit all three stages in so far as Australian Airlines is concerned, by appointing a Chief Executive who will `co-operate' with its competitor instead of engaging in active competition with it. There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with butter!
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Willis, in his statement, pointed out that there were some major important elements with regard to our GBEs. They account for over 9 per cent of total public sector employment; they take up more than 15 per cent of all government investment; their revenues equal 19.7 per cent of Commonwealth Government revenues; their assets are worth over $22 billion; and these are the things on which we are apparently cheerfully prepared to spend public money building up only to flog them off to the private sector. Over the last few years we have spent money in building up, with capital injections, the Government airlines-Qantas and Australian. Having spent oodles of taxpayers' dollars on getting them efficient, well-resourced and with the most up to date equipment, we are looking at selling them off to the private sector which, inevitably, will make a windfall gain in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a lot of rhetoric and, I would have thought, a fair amount of hypocrisy in both the Government's and the Opposition's attitude to privatisation. There is certainly a lot of rhetoric. Despite the rhetoric, when push comes to shove-and there is a fair amount of pushing and shoving in all this-there is no such thing as a private company that operates only on its own resources. Private companies in Australia have their hands out to the Government-and that means the taxpayer-all the time. They are constantly in receipt of assistance from Consolidated Revenue, and that means they are in receipt of assistance from the taxpayer. The obvious one, of course, is the tax deductability of all sorts of things. We have now reached the point where we actually allow Australian companies to borrow huge amounts overseas, push up our foreign debt in doing so and then write off the interest costs against their tax liability, often reducing that to zero, and depleting Consolidated Revenue as a consequence which means that the Government must then cut its expenditure to the more needy.
       </para>
       <para>
        As if that is not enough, we give direct subsidies to some of the biggest companies in the country whenever they bleat or threaten to close down part of their system. In the last few years we have given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, to the oil companies and to the banks in direct subsidies when they threaten to close the steelworks, or not raise Bass Strait oil, or push up interest rates on home loans. This Parliament, by a majority vote, has allowed the Government to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of taxpayers' funds under threat from those companies. It seems to me that those sorts of threats are neither more nor less acceptable than the wildcat strikes by unions that we hear people on the Opposition side of the House complain about so much.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it seems that the Democrats are the only party in this Parliament that supports public enterprises; that sees the value of public expenditure; and that does not tailor economic policies to please international bankers and investors. We seem to be the only party here that acknowledges that people in outlying areas, on farms in isolated areas, in small towns in outback Australia, are entitled to have their telecommunications system owned by the Government-which means by them and other taxpayers-in order to maintain cross-subsidies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does anybody here seriously believe that, if we sell off Telecom, Australia Post or Australian Airlines, people in disadvantaged areas will continue to get those sorts of cross-subsidies? Of course not! Private sector companies are in business to make profits and to please their shareholders, which is why the banks are looking enthusiastically at even higher profits. We will see increased telephone charges to people in isolated areas; increased postal charges to people in isolated areas; decreased services to people outside the major population areas; and, most certainly, a diminution of transport services to people outside the main population areas. Sure, the east coast run will be met by both Australian Airlines and Ansett, no matter who owns what. The Melbourne-Sydney, Sydney-Brisbane and reverse flights are the big income earners. I wonder how the people in Darwin and Adelaide and in more isolated areas will feel when, instead of having a choice of airlines because one is government-owned and recognises its obligation to provide a service to outlying areas, they find that they get one service a day, if they are lucky. This is the problem with getting overly enthusiastic about government business enterprises which will end up in the hands of the private sector. If we want to maintain in a country of 17 million people equal services at similar prices to unequal groups of people we have to acknowledge that the Government has a role to play and it must continue to play that role.

         —I withdraw it. I will put it another way. In my view what Senator Chaney said was totally untrue when one considers the facts. Senator Chaney accused this Government of doing too little too late. For 23 years, to 1972, the Liberal-Country parties were in government. The Australian Labor Party was in government for three years, from 1972 to 1975. For another eight years after that the coalition formed the government of this country. It was either too incompetent or too afraid to do anything about reorganisation. Whilst I, with my trade union background and views, may not support all the Government's activities, it did float the dollar-something that the Liberal-National Party Government never would have done. It deregulated the banks and brought in competition-something that the Liberal-National Party Government wanted to do but was never game to do. Certain government business enterprises are now corporations and are able to operate freely in the commercial world, subject to State laws in terms of public accountability, through balance sheets and other means.

        We have deregulated the wheat industry. The Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board commented the other day that he thought deregulation would open up great opportunities for the wheat industry and the Wheat Board in the future-opportunities that previously were not available. We took the embargo off sugar. People in the sugar industry are now saying that they will be able to do well. They did have a problem in the past but they recognise that now we have given them some tariff protection things will go well. Honourable senators should compare our performance with the inactivity of the Opposition, except when it bashes and fines unions, creating all sorts of friction and obstacles to change in the trade union movement, including changes in work practices.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's attitude to the restructuring of the waterfront is `To hell with the unions. Let's crush them. Let us take some workers, some members of the trade union movement, in isolation, put them down and then deal with others as we come to them'. In my view there is no question that there is a need to reorganise and restructure the waterfront. The waterfront employees are aware of the need. Developments over the years have seen a reduction in the number of waterside workers from about 25,000 to about 6,000. Gradual changes were made to the system. We had bulk carriers for sugar, coal and iron ore. Then we had containerisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The waterfront employees had to live with those changes. In many cases they lost their jobs, with no compensation. It was said that what was done was in the interests of the community, to reduce prices. Statements were made that these mechanisation changes had to occur because waterside workers would not work hard enough. Such statements were stupid and foolish. Such changes were taking place worldwide. The changes were inevitable. They were sensible in terms of reducing costs. They should have been directed towards reducing prices for people in the community. As I said, significant numbers of waterside workers lost their jobs over that period.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are now talking about reorganising and restructuring the waterfront. The trade unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have led the way in recent times on this question. They came up with the idea of training, retraining, career paths and the restructuring of awards. In return, they wanted increased wages for the members of those unions and workers under awards. The increase in wages was about 6 1/2 per cent. If the unions had pursued the same path they had pursued in the past, the consumer price index increase would have been about the same amount. It becomes obvious that, even though wage increases go with restructuring, the cost will be minimal, if not nil.
       </para>
       <para>
        What will the result be? Restructuring will open the gate for all sorts of new methods of organising industry. The benefits to employers over time will be tremendous. Some employers are short-sighted. They say `We want something concrete that we can see next week'. That is their failing. It has always been their failing. Unlike the Japanese, if they make an investment they want a return on it in six or 12 months. The Japanese are much wiser in that regard. They consider that, if the return on an investment takes two or three years, as long as that investment will be ongoing and useful to them, that is what they want. Being short-sighted is ridiculous and stupid. We are talking about the restructuring that needs to take place. I have talked about some of the results of changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The way members of the Opposition speak, one would think that the trade unions and the workers put into place an organisational plan or pattern under which the waterside workers operated for all those years. Nothing could be further from the truth. The organisational plan or pattern was put in place by employers, by companies. In the old bull gang days during the Depression, when people-who were very hungry-turned up in large groups, the foreman stevedore would say `Okay, you with the black hat on, you with the shorts' and he would give that person a day's work. They were there because they needed the money. Their children were hungry. There was no consideration by the foreman stevedore as to whether they were good workers or how much they needed work. His consideration was how he could get the most for the least amount of money. One could not lay a criminal charge against him for that, but one could hardly call it moral.
       </para>
       <para>
        From those beginnings the waterside workers fought and struggled to get the sorts of conditions and protection they have won over the many years since. Some could say that there have been times when they went on strike when they should not have. But that could be said about any union in this country. It could be said about any union that not everything it has done has been right. But Senator Stone has no right continually to attack the trade union movement as though all it wants to do is to destroy the community and not care about the economy or the interests of the community as a whole. Nothing could be further from the truth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Trade unions were set up to look after the interests of people in particular enterprises and industries. Therefore, they serve that need. There are people who say that the trade unions have a responsibility to the community. I say now-I have said it many times-that they understand that but they have to weigh their responsibility to the community against their interests and the interests of their families. Would it be fair for waterside workers to give up their livelihood and go on the dole, if they were lucky, in the interests of the community? Everybody would say `That is very nice; it is great' and forget about them. The community as a whole does not particularly care about them unless the role that the waterside workers have played is brought home to them in some way. So waterside workers want some reasonable compensation for job losses, as many others have wanted in the past. For some years there has been in place a scheme whereby people who have retired from the waterfront have been given compensation by way of redundancy packages. Admittedly, in this instance, quite a large amount of money is involved; about $140m will be contributed by the Government and the waterfront employers. But that is a once-off payment. The Inter-State Commission's report talks about savings of $600m-odd a year. To me that is a pretty good bargain. This matter is being processed in a human, kindly and thoughtful way so that people get some compensation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The waterside workers put out some material recently, which I think I have quoted before in response to being blamed for everything that is inefficient on the waterfront, they make the following point:
       </para>
       <para>
        Other countries have invested more heavily in sophisticated machinery and computerisation . . . we often work . . . on cramped wharves with antiquated equipment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is that the fault of the waterside workers? Are they expected to turn up at work with a tool box that contains a forklift and a crane? I think not. It is the fault of the employers. The waterside workers have had to carry on in those circumstances and do the best they can.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chapman made the point that all the Labor Government wants to do is protect unions' rights and prevent the efficient use of labour. That statement is totally without any force in terms of material to back it up. As I have said before, the Accord provides for a stable wage situation and a centralised system; it provides for education and retraining; it provides for restructuring; and it provides for a safe and proper work environment. It is an economic document for the future; a document which has been put together by agreement between people who want to see the community prosper.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the things that must be in the minds of waterside workers and any other fair-minded person in the community is, when these changes take place, as they surely will, who gets the benefit? Do we want to make shipowners richer? Do we want to make the stevedoring companies richer? Do we want to make users richer? I think not. I think the benefits should go to all of those sections, in the proper amounts, but mostly to the public by way of cheaper goods. Of course the Labor Government wants to protect the rights of unions. Nowhere in democratic countries are workers not entitled to be reasonably served by organisations which look after their interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Trade unions, as Senator Stone said, are legitimate. Surely trade unions which actively pursue and defend the interests of their members are as legitimate as tame cat unions which do very little because they are so afraid. Senator Stone made a point about how powerful the unions are and how they have the ability to influence their members to withdraw their labour. But he should be aware that members of unions who strike suffer the loss of considerable income. No person with any brains would want to become involved unnecessarily in any dispute. In 99.9 per cent of cases, a strike is a last ditch stand to try to protect or maintain a position, or make a reasonable gain.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anybody who believes that great power resides with the unions should talk to a non-union member who has been sacked by an unscrupulous employer. Anybody who does that will find out very quickly that in many cases the union is fairly impotent when it comes to recovering wages to which that person is entitled or getting his job back. The great power lies with the employers and their organisations. If one has to apportion blame for the threat posed to this country in recent times, it must rest with the employers' organisations, certainly not the trade unions. The attitude of the trade unions has been to share, as much as possible, the wealth created in this country amongst the most people and those who are disadvantaged.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone talked about the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) campaign of information and education as though it were an evil plot. I know it would be difficult to inform people that the Liberal Party is a great organisation which should be supported at the next election. People are too smart and well-educated for that-they read a lot more and understand the issues. The ACTU, through its campaign, is trying to come to grips with educating those people who do not understand the way it operates. It is obviously intended to involve as many people as possible in policy-making and carrying out programs, many of which are not associated with industrial action but with developing ideas and reaching cooperation and consensus with employers. In many cases, the benefit is mutual.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone, again in a derogatory manner, talked about the accord. As I said, the accord seeks to take this community into the future in a much better way by providing a greater capacity to create wealth, which can then be shared in all manner of ways, such as social programs, education and health, which are required by the community. A community might have a good balance of payments, a balanced budget and a good rating with Moody's. But it is very clear to me that a country is not prosperous if some of its people are in need, poorly educated and not properly looked after by way of health care. Everybody in the community must share the wealth that is created. There must be a capacity to share those services and consumer goods. That is obviously the direction in which we should go.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone was quite injured in respect of attacks on and criticisms of the New Right. The New Right does not suggest anything new. It only wants to take us back 100 years to a time when the employer was able to dictate wages and conditions to employees who lived in fear that they would lose their jobs, be unable to feed their families and have to send their children to school barefoot and hungry. The New Right is nothing new, it just wants to go back 100 years, and it appears that Senator Stone is one of the greatest advocates of that. The mess he made of the dispute involving an iron ore company in the West was plain for all to see. His method of defence was to attack a decent, proper trade union official, Jack Marcks, who did a wonderful job, in spite of the company, of resolving that dispute. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), in his statement, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . reform package is practical, and based on common sense and developed through consultation. It is not based on abstract theory or ideological dogma.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that unless we get the cooperation of the unions on the waterfront, reform will not be achieved. If reform is forced on them, the system will work very badly. People in the community will observe what happens and will be educated. No doubt, they will support the position of the waterside workers.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I make it clear that if the waterside workers want to sit on their hands and say, `We have had a system which has worked this way for all of these years and we are not going to change it at all', they have got a problem. My understanding, from talking to the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, and looking at the material the Federation has produced, is that that is not the position. The union wants to see changes. It wants to see the community advantaged but it is not prepared to see its members crushed and disadvantaged in a totally unfair way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister talked about crews being as low as 26. This is well below the levels of earlier generations, which were probably 35 or 36. That reduction of about one-third has come about as a result of discussions between the shipowners and the unions. I was at a committee meeting where a representative of shipowners indicated that the shipowners were happy about the current industrial situation. There has been a tremendous reduction in the number of disputes because of that sort of cooperation. I have talked often with seamen and their representatives who have said to me, `Look, we have given a lot already and we are prepared to give some more, but you can't leave us without a feather to fly with. You can't leave us naked. You have got to do this in a gradual way to enable us at least to keep conditions and wages which are reasonable'. That is unlike the attitude taken by many people who would like to see them working on rust buckets with inappropriate wages and conditions. People argue that there should be competition from overseas shipping lines, that foreign ships should be given a free go. No country allows that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Seamen's Union of Australia and the shipowners have never said that foreign ships cannot operate on the coast. Situations have existed whereby overseas ships have, by cabotage agreement, worked on the coast. The Minister's statement suggested that this practice will be extended where local ships cannot be provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will contribute up to $24m of the estimated $80m required for voluntary early retirement schemes. In a short number of years that will be covered and the savings will be of such a magnitude that that money will be recovered-and much more as well. Over time on the waterfront there has been an increase in the tonnage handled by individual waterside workers from 1,000 tonnes to 5,000 tonnes a year. That is pretty good. It is true that it is not as good as the figures for other countries, but I refer back to the remark I made earlier about the lack of proper equipment and proper organisation by employers. Waterside workers cannot be blamed for the situation at all. They have done their best. I am not saying that in the process every waterside worker who has put on a pair of working boots has slaved his heart out from whistle to whistle. I guess waterside workers are like everybody else. I do not see everybody here working 24 hours a day, either. Waterside workers have done a job and have increased their capacity by five times. That will go up much more with the new organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        One thing that concerns me about the statement-and I disagree with the Minister on this matter-relates not only to the waterfront but to industry in general and the general right of people to work. I refer to the suggestion that 3,000 existing employees take a redundancy package and 1,000 new employees no older than 30 be recruited. Are we saying that people over 30 years of age in this country should go on the dole or have no rights to employment? Are we saying: let every other employer employ them, but not the waterfront? If that is the case, why should not every other employer say, `We want no-one over 30 either.'? What a disaster. In my view, any new recruits should be selected on the basis of their ability to be trained in the industry and do a job that is reasonable and proper.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say that to all employers. It is not uncommon now to see advertisements in the press saying, `People 40 years and over, please do not apply'. People who sell goods and services do not say to an 80-year-old customer with a walking stick, `We cannot sell you our services because you are over 40'. They do not mind 80-year-old people if they can make a profit out of them, but they want to employ all the young guys. Next they will be organising a 100-metre sprint to see who gets the job. I think that is quite wrong. I hope the Minister and the Cabinet will reconsider that position.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of changes, we need to give workers the right to help make decisions on the job. That is occurring now in Mackay, where there is a joint partnership between the waterside workers and a stevedoring employer. It is working very well. We must introduce industrial democracy to give workers the right to participate in on-the-job decisions and to have an input into management decisions. Not all of the skill, ability and intelligence resides in those at management level. Many of the problems we have had in this country over many years-and still have-arise from the incompetence of middle management and the fact that managers have never been properly trained and are, in many cases, unsuitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement goes to the question of port authorities in State areas, where it suggests that there should be a more competitive environment and that improvements should be made. I think that that is an intelligent thing to do and the way to go. It also says-and this goes back to what I said a moment ago-that the proposed changes offer benefits to the customers, the industry participants and the nation. It states that, as set out in the Inter-State Commission report, such achievements rest substantially on the cooperation of the parties-and it does. In my view-and I close on this-if this reorganisation results in no benefit to the community at all, if we do not get cheaper goods or get goods more quickly and in a better fashion, it will not have been carried out in the proper sense. I know that this reorganisation will assist the community overall by way of our economic position and macro-economic changes, and that is very good, but it should mean that people in the community get their share of the benefits of these changes.

         —The Senate is debating the ministerial statements by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) relating to shipping and the waterfront, government business enterprises and telecommunications pricing. Senator Burns, for most of his speech, was talking about distant history-way back in the dark period compared with the 1990s, which is what we are looking at. He was talking about periods before the First World War and the period of the Great Depression in between the two world wars. But the present economy has been so mismanaged by the Hawke Labor Government that, from 30 June 1983 up to the period for which the latest figures have been published, our net external debt has increased from $23 billion-which we owed at 30 June 1983, when the Hawke Government had been in office for a few months-to $103 billion. That means money down the drain-a deficit. We are going down the drain this year at the rate of about $17 billion. That represents an increase of nearly 350 per cent during the Hawke Government's reign. What governments were doing in relation to the economy and privatisation prior to the Hawke Government coming into office is distant history. The situation in this nation has so changed under the mismanagement of the Hawke Government that we now have to look at a totally different set of circumstances. We have to take every available opportunity to change the economic climate of this nation. On the question of the foreign debt, let me refer to an article by Mr Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald today. He said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        So the basic cause of the build-up in foreign debt is that for years we've been importing more than we've exported, and borrowing to cover the difference.
       </para>
       <para>
        That puts the situation very simply and clearly so that people can understand it:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . for years we've been importing more than we've exported, and borrowing to cover the difference.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have now reached the stage under the Hawke Government where, frankly, the economy is like a passenger train travelling at full speed with the throttle stuck wide open on the wrong track, the crew members having gone back into the dining car where they are eating and drinking with the passengers while Mr Willis, this Minister, is playing on his fiddle. We need to explore every avenue to change the economic climate of this nation. These ministerial statements were the Government's opportunity to demonstrate that it meant to do that in these areas. It has failed. It is a case of too little too late. Mr Gittins also said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, the way to slow the growth in our foreign debt-
       </para>
       <para>
        one notices that he is talking only about slowing it down because we are in such a bad way that we cannot turn it around at this stage-
       </para>
       <para>
        is to reduce the size of the current account deficits which add to it. But how? There's nothing we can do to reduce the interest we've contracted to pay on our existing debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        And here is the significant part:
       </para>
       <para>
        All we can do is reduce our imports and increase our exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat that because it is so important:
       </para>
       <para>
        All we can do is reduce our imports and increase our exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        To do that we have to take every opportunity-as I have now said for the third time-that presents itself. That will include tax reform. Certainly we have to do something about our taxation system. It will include deregulation to get rid of the regulations which are hindering opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses to develop. It will include some privatisation. At one stage during Question Time Senator Button accused me of thinking that privatisation was the sole answer to all of our problems. I said this morning-and I say again-that there is no simple golden key that can be put into a lock and turned to fix it. All these things have to be taken into account. Privatisation is one of the areas where they ought to be considered.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need greater efficiency, greater productivity and, in particular, the benefits which we would gain from competition. Privatisation is all about introducing competition rather than government manipulation of monopoly markets for the benefit of government business enterprises. We need to produce more of better goods and services at cheaper prices. Australians would then buy Australian rather than imported goods. They would buy Australian goods not out of loyalty or something of that nature, but simply because our goods and services would be cheaper and better than foreign goods. That should be the aim of the Government. What we desperately need to do is produce more of better goods and services at lower prices, backed up with better services and spare parts. If we can improve our productivity and our quality at lower costs, as I say, not only will Australians buy more Australian goods but so will foreigners. In other words, we would be able to export more. We would then achieve what Mr Gittins is saying in this article: `All we can do is reduce our imports and increase our exports'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps I may digress briefly. There are those who worry that this talk about productivity, efficiency and competition will create environmental problems. That is a debate for another day. The core problem in relation to environment around the world is related more to population and to poverty than to productivity, efficiency and competition. The world's population and poverty problems are the chief causes of the environmental problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the magnitude of Australia's foreign debt and the balance of payment problems, the strategy spelt out by the Minister for dealing with Australian ports and uncompetitive domestic shipping services is totally inadequate. As Senator Chaney said, it is too little too late. These papers fail to communicate any sense of urgency. Senator Burns was talking about the Government having to fix up the waterfront and taking, perhaps, two or three years for some agreement to be entered into. We do not have two or three years. The Minister has acknowledged that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . Australia has been poorly served by its shipping and waterfront industries. The gross inefficiencies which have been allowed to develop in these industries have restricted our economic growth, reduced our living standards and impaired our capacity to develop export markets. In part, our balance of payments difficulties are directly attributable to the acute inefficiencies in these key industries in the export chain.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister said that, not the coalition parties. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The reforms I am announcing today will dramatically transform these industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        What nonsense that was! There have been 11 reports on the waterfront since the end of World War II, each of which has identified the rorts and the cost to the nation. The Government has now entrusted the fate of its waterfront reforms to the Waterside Workers Federation, the stevedoring companies and the Australian Council of Trade Unions-rorts and all. They will have three months to negotiate details of an industry plan and then three years to put it into place. The Minister has said, `What I have said today will reform it all'. What nonsense! When he tabled these reports, what he really said was, `Look, you've got three months to try to work out the answers to the really tough questions'. There are a lot of tough decisions that have to be made here. The Minister has not taken any of those tough decisions. He has not made any decision about anything, other than to defer it all for three months while people talk about it and then for there to be three years in which to implement it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The key recommendations of the Inter-State Commission have been rejected. The Government has refused to grasp the nettle and accept the Inter-State Commission's recommendations as an integrated package. Instead, the Government has decided to reward efficiency by offering a carrot. It is some carrot-at the cost of the taxpayers of Australia. Stevedoring companies will be provided with $154m of taxpayers' money for redundancy payments, training, retraining, skills audits and job redesign projects, while the union gets $250,000 for union research staff to assist in the implementation of the in-principle agreement and $100,000 towards consultants for skill reviews-or, should I say, for bribery. That seems to me to be a far more appropriate description of these monetary hand-outs in this package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if the scheme comes to fruition, it will not solve the problem. There is no provision to remove the waterside workers' monopoly and no provision for new companies to enter the stevedoring industry. Both are essential if genuine competition is to be generated. While some cross-training may take up to the maximum of the three years envisaged by the Inter-State Commission, much could be done now. There is no valid reason why depot arrangements should not be freed up speedily. There is no valid reason why differing State requirements should not be speedily resolved. There is no valid reason why stevedoring companies should not attack the unacceptable levels of theft and pilferage of cargo now. There is no valid reason why work force and work practice restructuring should not be introduced now. There is no valid reason why barriers to competition resulting from container depot agreements and arrangements should not be removed now. There is no valid reason why enterprise employment arrangements should not replace industry-wide employment arrangements now. There is no valid reason why the manning levels for harbour tugs should not be rationalised now. There is no valid reason why pilotage exemption requirements should not be standardised now. All these things should and could take place now. Of course, there will be the need for some restructuring and cross-training. That might take longer. Redundancy arrangements must be handled sensitively. But this package recommended by the Inter-State Commission should be implemented forthwith.

        On government business enterprise reform, the Government fell in a great heap in relation to any business enterprise reform when, over the weekend, Minister Willis made it perfectly clear that the only solution for the provision of adequate capital for Australian Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd would be privatisation. But yesterday afternoon in this chamber Australian Labor Party senators repudiated the Minister and his support of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who had supported Mr Willis on this, by joining the Australian Democrats and voting against our urgency motion which called upon the Government to ensure the future of Qantas and Australian Airlines by their sale to the public, as Minister Willis had suggested. As I say, yesterday Labor senators refused to accept that resolution of the Senate and so indicated that there is nothing in what the Government is talking about in that area of privatisation and the introduction of competition. The Minister has clearly indicated in these statements that he has engaged in a cosmetic exercise in rhetoric that has little substance. The objective appears to be to attempt to bluff people into believing that the Hawke Government has significantly reformed Government business enterprises. But to the credit of the media-and it is not often that I praise the media-they have not been fooled by this rhetoric. They have probed these statements of the Minister and found them wanting.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is about time that this Government started to do things. In 1987, Mr Hawke said that micro-economic reform-which means greater efficiency, better production and better quality-would be the keynote of the third Hawke Government. In fact, the Government has done very little indeed in relation to micro-economic reform. It has introduced a few surface changes; it has changed the nature of government business enterprises so that they appear to be companies or they are incorporated under the Companies Act instead of being statutory authorities; it has added the word `Limited' to their names; and it has given them a board of directors instead of appointed officers to manage their affairs. All of that has been rhetoric. Very little has had anything to do with the introduction of competition, efficiency and greater productivity in some genuine attempt to get this country out of the terrible mess it is in by increasing our exports and reducing our imports.

         —I rise to speak on the Government's implementation of government business enterprise (GBE) reforms and the telecommunications pricing statement tabled in the Senate on 1 June, almost a week ago. Prior to the tabling of that statement the Australian community was certainly entitled to have high expectations because we had been fed an unremitting diet which involved constant promises of micro-economic reform, as my colleague Senator Lewis says, almost as the centrepiece of the Government's third term strategy. Yet now, especially in view of its very limited response to the problems of the waterfront, we could say that micro-economic reform is dead in the water under this Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I wish to speak specifically about the new price controls for telecommunications services. Again, I think it is regrettable that the media's approach to date has been fairly superficial. For example, the headline in the Courier-Mail was `Three-year plan to keep rises below inflation'; the Australian had a similar heading, `Telecom has prices pegged for three years'; and the headline in the Sydney Morning Herald was `Cap put on phone prices', as though this were some form of significant discipline upon Telecom Australia. In reality, it is an elaborate charade to mislead the public into believing that Telecom is about to embark on some genuine price restraint. The fact is that according to the Industries Assistance Commission, Telecom's total factor productivity over the last decade has averaged 5.4 per cent per annum. Telecom has revenue coming out its ears. It has an enormous capacity to withhold any price rises at all. As evidence of that I think one has only to look at the feverish efforts made last year to come up with some fancy creative accounting techniques in order to keep the net operating profit figure below $1.3 billion. It ultimately came in at $776.2m, but I think anyone would have to say that that was a significant understatement of the real position.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that the dramatic changes that are taking place in telecommunications technology provide ample opportunity for any carrier to pass on significant cost savings to consumers. Yet here we find the Government providing little more than a token gesture. It is not surprising, therefore, that some Telecom officials should be virtually elated about the result. Telecom's director of corporate pricing, Mr Graeme Ward, is reported as saying that he was confident the company could limit overall rises to less than 3 per cent next year. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not a totally unreasonable result at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a magnificent understatement because quite clearly Telecom is absolutely delighted that it has got way with such a low figure for `X'. In fact, Telecom had the temerity to argue to the Government that `X' should be set at around 3 per cent to 3 1/2 per cent. I think it was only the public pressure that has been brought to bear on the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) in recent weeks that has induced him to even get the figure up to 4 per cent. But when one has regard to the fact that British Telecom had its figure set by Oftel, Austel's equivalent regulator, at 4.5 per cent after it was discovered that 3 per cent was far too low, one can see that what we have here is a very generous figure indeed-a really cosmetic exercise with the Government's election prospects in mind which suggests that somehow telephone charges will not rise as much as the consumer price index; nor should they-not by any figure at all. I have certainly suggested that a minimum figure for `X' under the price control formula should be at least 5 per cent and I think that again is being generous to Telecom.
       </para>
       <para>
        But where this statement really goes off the rails and verges on the dishonest is in its gross departure from the 1988 May statement on telecommunications tabled by Senator Evans. In that statement the Government made its position clear based on a report provided to it by a task force of experts which had spent some nine months considering the new pricing formula. That task force made it abundantly clear that it was necessary, almost by definition, for a price cap to apply to all monopoly services. Although I do not have it in front of me now, I can recall reading a speech by Senator Walsh last year in which he said just that. He had been to the United Kingdom and had become a convert to the virtues of privatisation. He even went so far as to say that before he went there he thought that privatisation was simply about revenue raising, but having looked at the position he realised that it was all about efficiency. He then proceeded to make some fairly generous observations about the merits of the case and even went so far as to offer the Opposition some gratuitous advice about how it could best implement its privatisation strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think anyone in the country now is under any illusion that Senator Walsh is an advocate of the present Government's policy in relation to government business enterprises. Senator Walsh has made his position abundantly clear-he is neither for nor against public enterprise. He prefers to judge the issues on the merits and, in many instances, he takes the view that there is no justification for maintaining such enterprises in government hands. But he did say that where there was a monopoly, a price cap was the only way in which to restrain a monopolist from imposing what would otherwise be exorbitant prices. After all, by definition, competition is designed to ensure-in fact it has the effect of ensuring-that any service provider who charges more than the market is prepared to bear and above long run average cost prices will find that a new entrant will come into the market, undercut that pricing structure and thereby attract business away from the high price alternative. That is what happens under a competitive system. Of course, it is the opposite under a monopolistic system where there is no incentive to keep prices below any form of long run average cost because, by definition, a monopolist does not have to worry about what the market will bear. Telecommunications services are virtually `price inelastic'-in other words, the consumer will pay virtually anything for the service because he has no choice, nowhere else to go. That is why it is so critically important that there is some discipline and sanction on the prices that a monopolist can charge.
       </para>
       <para>
        The task force and the Minister's May statement made it abundantly clear that if one thing was essential in price cap formulas, it was that the price cap should apply to all monopoly services. Yet that is the very thing that does not happen under the Government's recently announced policy. That makes a farce of the whole exercise. It enables Telecom simply to judge the figures to allow for very significant reductions in subscriber trunk dialling rates which are more than justified, but also allows for offsetting increases in local call charges which may well not be justified and which deserve the thorough scrutiny of the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, and certainly of the Australian community. By lumping some monopoly services but not all into the basket we will not be in a position to make the sorts of judgments that need to be made. All the monopoly services should be there but they are not. These include leased circuits, integrated services digital networks, public pay phones and first phone monopolies. This latter one because it is a protected area has very significant consequences for the costs of connections which are obviously very inflated. Public switched voice, data text, video and cellular mobile services are not included either. So what is the point of a price cap that applies only to some monopoly services. The answer is very little indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other very significant recommendation of the task force and one that was accepted by the Government was that it was necessary to ensure that the benefits of efficiency changes are equitably shared among customer groups. With that in mind, the task force made it clear that it was essential that there be two separate baskets, one for residential users and one for business users, so that there would not be a confusion and that there would indeed be transparency which would enable the consumer to see precisely what price increases operated in what areas. Again that distinction has been deliberately obliterated and ignored by the Government in the new regime. That makes it clear that it is, as I have said before, an elaborate charade to mislead the public into believing that Telecom is about to embark on some genuine price restraint. The reality is that it is business as usual for Telecom. It is certainly the end of any serious genuflection in the direction of micro-economic reform. It is clear that the Government is not interested in restraining any real price increases as far as Telecom is concerned. It is a tragedy that what held out so much promise has delivered so little. There will clearly be an enormous responsibility cast upon Austel to somehow try to get back into the game and to exercise the discipline and restraint that the Government has manifestly not been prepared to impose at this stage.

The Opposition solution is to make those employed on the waterfront work harder, to make them surrender conditions, to make them accept enterprise employment. It would strive for a single union cover, giving common entitlements across the industry. This, it argues, would strike the happy balance between the need for greater productivity and fair working conditions. This strategy, it is suggested, would solve the problems on the waterfront. It is a simple solution. It is not the right one. The issue is complex.

        The waterside is crucial to our well-being. The more productive it is, the better our living standards. To attempt to do this by simply laying sanctions on the work force is futile. A strategy based on cooperation between management and workers and between users and providers of waterside services is the answer. There are examples of where this has already been achieved. Orchardists in the Shepparton district complained about the handling of fruit in the port of Melbourne. Union officials met them. They discussed the problems. Some arose from work practices. The union responded and the problems were resolved. Others arose from different causes, for example, poor documentation. The farmers accepted that. Good relations grew up between the two groups to the benefit of both.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are sheds on the Melbourne wharves where containers holding cargo for separate receivers are broken up. This area was losing money. The union proposed an incentive scheme. It worked magnificently. The stevedores processed more cargo. The workers received more wages. Incentives are good within limits. Those limits are safety; reasonable wages; proper conditions; and civil management. Incentives which ignore them engender a harsh, even brutal, workplace.
       </para>
       <para>
        Workers are entitled to safety. There is an example of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Port Waratah Stevedoring Co. Pty Ltd removing the speed limit for heavy vehicles at Western Port wharf. They hoped to increase productivity. A dispute followed. It was settled in favour of the work force. Before the speed limit operated, a heavy vehicle had caused a serious accident at the wharf. In my time as a common law barrister, I noted that too many waterside workers suffered too many injuries. To ignore issues such as safety in this debate is wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        The conditions waterside workers now have are hard won. Prior to 1967 their employment was not secure. A day's wages depended upon their being chosen from a pool. There was limited mechanisation. Work was physical and harsh.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia was born in savage times. The harsh struggle between labour and capital 100 years ago set a context which soured industrial relations on the waterfront for decades. To ignore history is to court disaster. Reforms have and will come to the waterfront if done with understanding. Without that, the way is bleak. Cooperation, not coercion, should be the mechanism for change. This is the thrust of remarks by Mr Ivan Deveson, Chairman of the Shipping Reform Task Force and Australian Shipping Users Group, to the Australian Chamber of Shipping on Wednesday, 31 May 1989. Mr Deveson is also managing director of Nissan Australia. He had this to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say at the outset, that I have no doubt, the various parties in the shipping and waterfront industries are now, more than ever before, talking about the right things-our language is changing-everyday language now includes words like exports, quality, international competitiveness, rationalisation, co-operation, reliability, restructuring and training. There is an underlying dynamic quality contained in this language.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might add that Mr Deveson's language is the language of optimism and conciliation. It is not the language of pessimism and conflict which unfortunately has been the feature of the Opposition's contribution today. It is also perhaps worth quoting another passage from Mr Deveson's speech. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        However, ASUG-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the Australian Shipping Users Group-
       </para>
       <para>
        also recognises that changes cannot be made overnight. It would be unfair to expect a rapid change to a new environment without preparing the way. For example, the ISC-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the Inter-State Commission-
       </para>
       <para>
        has recommended a change to enterprise-based employment-something that is very normal to all of us. But it is very new to the waterfront. As the Chamber-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is the body that Mr Deveson was talking to-
       </para>
       <para>
        succinctly pointed out in its second submission to the ISC `the achievement of enterprise employment may have to evolve rather than emerge in the short term'. It will be difficult for some to make a change to this new environment. They will need new skills and training to make this transition. In this, I include both management and employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Waterside workers will accept change. They have accommodated mechanisation. They have accepted containerisation. In 1975 they surrendered an attractive wage formula to enter the wage indexation scheme then introduced. Had they not done that they would now be earning about $90 more a week than they are. The Government's path to reform is along the road of consultation. It accepts workers, management and users of maritime services as responsible citizens. It wants a cooperative Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has proclaimed the macho path to reform. It is grand in rhetoric. Were it to act on its battle cries, turmoil would follow. Fortunately, though mighty in word, it is meek in action. Were it ever to enter government, that reality may be the best contribution it can bring to a decent humane society.

         —Eighty years ago the two richest countries in the world per capita were probably Australia and Argentina. I do not want to pursue the disastrous Argentina collapse any further except to point out that it was the inevitable consequence of industrial populism and attempted autarky-that is, to be economically self-sufficient through trade protectionism. We must fight these whenever they surface in Australia, as they do periodically. We too have suffered a decline in the last 80 years but we have handled things much more sensibly than Argentina. Of course, our average standard of living has risen a lot over the years but not as fast as that of many other countries. We have not done nearly as well as we could and should have done. Instead of being top of the first division we are now down in the ruck of the second division.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What has gone wrong? Eighty years ago we were rich because of agricultural and mining exports. We are still highly efficient in both of these. Per capita, we are still probably the most efficient primary producers in the world. The trouble is that while we were rich we permitted the development of protected and inefficient manufacturing and transport sectors. The attitude at the time was, `Okay, they are inefficient but we can afford them'. The political and social turmoil of trying to fix them was not thought to be worth it while we could afford them. But we cannot afford them any more. The terms of trade have changed dramatically. In the developed world people no longer think of starvation but of luxury, or at least luxury by the standards of 80 years ago. Cars, television sets, refrigerators, video recorders and so on are regarded as essentials. The result can be seen in the terms of trade. The manufacturing exporting countries are doing very well. The primary producers are doing poorly and the mineral exporters not much better, except for gold and, to some extent, oil.
       </para>
       <para>
        In these changed circumstances, we are living far beyond our means. The world does not owe us a living. In the last six years we have borrowed $80,000m overseas to support our current standard of living. We are like a family living on higher purchase-a family living far beyond its means, as we are. Eventually, the hire purchase bills come in, and our bills are coming in now. We are now the third most indebted country in the world, having just overtaken Mexico, and we are still borrowing overseas at the rate of $17,000m a year. Since we started this debate our overseas debt has gone up by $5m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under this Government we have got ourselves into the most appalling economic mess. It is not only our indebtedness, of course, although the interest on that is starting to take a frightening part of our export earnings; it is more the fact that we are in such a mess after a prolonged period of good prices for our exports, which will not last. It is a matter of astonishment to the rest of the world that we are in such a mess when things should be going unusually well for us. The trouble lies essentially with the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who has a curious habit of seizing on one fashionable economic tool, half understanding it and then brandishing it as if it was the solution to all our economic problems. Mr Acting Deputy President, do you remember the J-curve? We do not hear much of that any more. Then the Treasurer got onto deregulation, which is good in itself, except he made it unworkable by failing to deregulate a key element of the economy-the labour market-which made his further efforts at deregulation ineffective and possibly worse than useless.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has given up almost all of the old methods of controlling the economy, but it has not given market forces a chance to be effective. All that the Government has left is interest rates, and that is a very blunt instrument indeed. Using high interest rates to control the economy not only inflicts hardship; it discourages investment. By holding the Australian dollar artificially high, these high interest rates make our exports and import replacements uncompetitive and, therefore, discourages investment even more. As I said, the economic corner into which this mismanagement by the Treasurer has got the country is appalling. Mr Keating was runner up for the title of World's Worst Finance Minister in 1986. The winner, by the way, was the Finance Minister of Egypt. I think that in 1989 Mr Keating will undoubtedly win the title and win it so easily that they will not even bother to name a runner-up.
       </para>
       <para>
        How do we get out of our mess? The first thing we must do is hold down our consumption until we can justify it by our production. What does this Government do? It grants us tax cuts and wage rises which will increase our consumption and imports. The argument for this ridiculous policy is that the community demands it. That is not surprising after all the Treasurer has been saying about the economy. We remember Mr Keating saying two years ago, `Our Government is winning on inflation, it's winning on interest rates, it's winning on growth, and it's winning on the most important thing of all, the current account deficit and our external debt'. That was Mr Keating two years ago. Last February, just over three months ago, he said, `We're still winning on the continuing structural change in the economy, on its growth and on its strength'. That was Mr Keating three months ago. It is no wonder people want to share in all this illusory wealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The community should be told the truth. We are living beyond our means. The world does not owe us a living. We must restrain consumption until we are producing more efficiently. The key to that is productivity. Yet at a time when the urgent economic need for this country is to improve its productivity, our productivity has actually been going down at a time when the productivity of our competitors has been rising. This is the ultimate economic crime of this Government. It has been fiddling around with temporary measures and temporising tactics and bland statements instead of tackling the real problems. The most pressing problems of our productivity are in our shipping industry and our waterfront.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's action on shipping and the waterfront is typical of the way it has carried on with the rest of the economy-too little too late. We cannot afford to fiddle around until the mid-1990s to solve these problems. As an Englishman said in another context, there is not a week, not a day, not an hour to be lost. We are living recklessly beyond our means. The problem is that there is a tendency in major political parties to be afraid of the political consequences of taking the necessary decisive actions and to pretend that things will get better on their own if we leave them alone.
       </para>
       <para>
        Living standards will not suddenly rise without any serious effort on our part. We urgently need both the Government and the Opposition to agree to tackle the really serious economic crisis that faces us, to refrain from political point scoring and to agree on urgent measures necessary now-this month, this day-to get us out of the accumulated mess of recent years. We must tackle things by, for example, cancelling the absurd tax cuts and wage rises scheduled for the coming year. We must encourage savings by introducing a consumption tax and thus hold down our international debt until we can become more productive. It will take leadership, but it must be tried in the national interest. Otherwise we will hand on a terrible legacy to the next generation.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has happened to our coastal shipping is a classic case of the ruthless exploitation of a monopoly. This monopoly-in this case a labour monopoly-has, like all monopolies, done its best for its members at the expense of the rest of the community. The consequence has been that the only coastal cargoes now carried by sea are those for which there is no other feasible method of transport-bulk cargoes and Bass Strait and Christmas Island traffic, for instance. This is a perfect example of a natural monopoly. The costs to the Australian community are very high. We are a large country with our major centres of population and production on our coastline. For the efficient development of our manufacturing industry, economic and reliable coastal shipping is essential-and that we certainly have not got.
       </para>
       <para>
        Examples of the effects of the high cost of coastal shipping are all too numerous. I will mention only a few of the glaring cost differentials caused by our inefficiences. By any measure, there would be undoubted savings to Australia if cabotage-that is, the reservation or our coastal trade to Australian flagships-were removed. On the basis of spot rates, the savings to Australia would be of the order of $140m a year, or about 19 per cent of our total freight bill. Many of the individual freight rate comparisons could realise savings well in excess of 20 per cent. In some trades savings could even exceed several hundred per cent, which suggests that small and irregular shippers could gain access to much cheaper shipping if cabotage were relaxed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are now in the ridiculous situation where it is cheaper to ship phosphate to Australia from Florida in the United States of America or from Morocco than to ship it from Christmas Island to any port in Australia. The freight rate of cement clinker from Japan to Darwin is $12 per tonne, whilst the freight rate in an Australian ship from Adelaide to Darwin is $17 per tonne. If one happens to use the River Torrens it will cost $29 per tonne. Shipping newsprint from Hobart to Japan costs $144 per tonne, but the same shipment to Perth costs $168. All this is because of the excessive high costs of Australian shipping. The cost differences in liner shipping are even more bizarre. Shipping foodstuffs and general merchandise from Melbourne to Burnie, across Bass Strait, costs 11 times more than from Melbourne to Singapore, 13 times more than to Hong Kong or 16 times more than to Italy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problems and the inefficiencies of our coastal shipping are closely linked with the appalling state of our waterfront. Our ports are widely and justly regarded as the most unreliable and inefficient in the developed world. Improving their performance is essential for our recovery from our present economic crisis. If one goes around Asia one finds the main news about Australia relates to our shipping and waterfront strikes. Those are the main aspects that affect those countries. If we are unreliable suppliers buyers look somewhere else and we lose contracts. The rest of the world does not owe us a living. There is absolutely no physical reason why output rates at major container terminals in Australia should not equal European rates, instead of our terminals being half as productive as those in Europe and only 40 per cent as productive as most Asian ports. What stops us is poor management, outrageous work practices and ridiculous operating times. I repeat: the world does not owe us a living.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only is our productivity low by international standards but it is getting worse. An Australian National Line representative told the Inter-State Commission that three years ago 168,000 containers were handled in one year in Port Botany. Today that has fallen to 115,000, the lowest volume of containers handled since Port Botany opened. Why is productivity in container handling so poor? One reason is that there is a common practice known as `job finish' whereby the employees nominate beforehand the number of containers that will be loaded or unloaded in a particular shift. Once the nominated number of containers has been processed the employees leave work, regardless of how much time is left in the shift or whether or not work remains to be done. Another reason is our appallingly poor crane performance. Work practices on the wharves are such that cranes stop operating during meal breaks. Cranes stop to change drivers. The result is that in Melbourne one crane handles 13 containers an hour; in Sydney one crane handles 14 containers an hour; in New Zealand one crane handles 21 containers and in Hamburg the figure is over 22. We are running the same equipment about half as fast as people in other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The average time taken to load a grain vessel is also considerably in excess of our competitors. Take a 30,000-tonne barley shipment, for example. In the United States loading would normally be completed in three to four days. In Australia, at the rate of 3,000 tonnes per day, it takes nine days. We have to add another four days for so-called lost days. That brings the total loading time to 13 days. That is compared to three to four days in the United States. Of course, the cost is passed on to the public. The combination of all these coastal shipping and waterfront problems can be seen in the absurd situation of a container being taken by road across Australia when, in a rational transport system, it should certainly go by sea. The container does not go by sea because the consignor is looking at cost and reliability, neither of which is provided by our present maritime system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at coastal shipping first. Although we are looking only at coastal shipping, it must be remembered that the conditions which a union monopoly manages to extract in coastal shipping flow over into international shipping, rendering it uneconomic to the extent that 96 per cent of our overseas trade is carried in foreign flag ships. The only reason as much as 4 per cent is carried on Australian flag ships is that foreign conferences welcome the presence of high cost Australian flag ships because it enables them to jack up the conference shipping rate and thus make extra profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        What must we do to make our coastal shipping economical? We must reduce our crews to the level of countries as affluent as or more affluent than we are. We must adjust our conditions-leave, accommodation and so on-to similar levels. I am not talking about flag of convenience ships but the ships of countries richer than we are. We must introduce competition, above all, because competition is the key to efficiency. We must have company employment and multiskilling. We must have greater productivity on board ships so that ships are not unnecessarily held up in ports for routine maintenance tasks that could and should be performed at sea.
       </para>
       <para>
        How far has the Government gone in meeting these needs? There is a program in the statement of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) for a reduction in average crew sizes from the present 29 to 21 over the next three years. It is always over time. At the end of the process these crew sizes will still be 25 per cent higher than the manning levels of similar ships crewed by, say, Germans or Norwegians. It is worth remembering that the cost of each crew place is $150,000 per year. To have a reduction in crew numbers does take some time because we have to multiskill the people concerned. That cannot be done overnight. This Government is going about this process very slowly-much too slowly in view of our economic crisis. As I said, even at the end of the process our crews will still be 25 per cent higher than those of comparable foreign ships. The Government has not even begun to tackle the high cost rorts, such as the extraordinary leave entitlements our seamen have-338 days leave for each year worked compared with 226 for a French seaman, 216 for an American, 176 for a West German and 141 for a Norwegian. If leave provisions alone for Australian seamen were brought into line with our Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) counterparts crew costs would be reduced immediately by 30 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is also not doing anything about the extraordinary accommodation conditions on board ships that the monopoly unions have been able to extort. It costs $1m extra to fit a Swedish or West German ship to Australian standards-$50,000 extra per crew member. The Government also does nothing about the notorious rort over sick leave reimbursements. A seaman who has been sick for more than seven days is entitled to an extra seven days wages after he has recovered. Many unfit and useless seamen are retained because of the extraordinary provisions under the Seamen's Compensation Act. Because of the overgenerous benefits to be gained under the Seamen's Compensation Act, it is cheaper to keep a totally useless seaman in the seamen's engagement system or on board than to try to retire him.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government does nothing about the extraordinary travel entitlements-first class air travel for all seamen. It is worth noting that, rather than working on a voyage basis, which other countries' seamen do, our seamen work on a six-week basis. When their six weeks are up they have to be flown home-first class, of course. A replacement crew has to be flown in-first class, of course-regardless of where the ship is.

It has merely used its monopoly position in an entirely predictable way. Equal blame rests with management which has given in rather than resisting, knowing that it can pass the costs on to the Australian public.

       <para>
        But most serious of all, the Government has done nothing to introduce competition or to involve the work force in the success of their enterprise. Company employment is absolutely essential for this-but the Government will not move on that. I would like to see company employment combined with some type of profit sharing so that the employees are involved in the success of their enterprise. But what about competition to eliminate the monopoly exploitation by trade unions? There are, in my opinion, only two answers to this question. The Government has made a typical timid non-answer by considering the possibility of extending the permit system-that is, single voyage permits and permits for continuous trading, which have not been issued for 20 years-which allows the occasional use of a foreign flag ship on our coast under very restricted circumstances. But this will not achieve very much. What we must do is amend the Navigation Act to allow foreign flag ships from OECD countries of a level of prosperity equal to or superior to ours-there is no suggestion that we will allow substandard flag of convenience ships to operate on our coast-to provide proper competition. We could do this if we had foreign flag ships on our coast. The consequent benefits would come to the Australian people. This has some disadvantages in that foreign ships would not benefit our balance of payments as much as Australian shipping would if it became efficient by international standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to see us develop a system where there is a single enterprise union in each shipping enterprise, and each enterprise would, of course, be competing with the other shipping enterprises. This would bring about a great change in our industrial system. But if we do not change the system drastically and rapidly, the only solution will be to allow foreign flag ships to compete on the Australian coast. We cannot afford to continue as we have been going.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's plans for coastal shipping are timid and far too slow. It talks about things being better by the mid 1990s, but what will happen in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994? There is an $80m scheme for voluntary early retirement of surplus seamen from our Australian flag shipping. This is a very generous scheme, and we should be getting a great deal more for it than we are. We cannot go on as we are. We must be much more urgent in pressing towards what must be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to turn briefly to the waterfront, which is a more serious problem than coastal shipping, because it affects not only our internal productivity, but also the competitiveness of our exports. The problems of the waterfront are deep-seated and longstanding, and much of the blame rests with the employers who have agreed to absurd exploitation by the waterfront unions, knowing that they can pass the costs on, ultimately, to the Australian public. What do we need from the waterfront? First of all we want our ports to operate with workers using equipment at least as efficiently as those in the ports of other comparable countries. We want no demarcation disputes. We want no hold-ups because of events unrelated to the waterfront, such as riots in Beijing or demonstrations in South Africa. As I said, the world does not owe us a living. If we have stoppages for those causes, we are the sufferers. It is our foot which will be shot.
       </para>
       <para>
        To achieve these obvious requirements we must come back to the three fundamentals of efficiency: first, competition; second, a single union in each workplace; and third, the involvement of the work force in the success of their enterprise. We have none of these at the moment. In some countries it is possible for ports to compete with each other-Hamburg versus Rotterdam, for instance-but in Australia this really does not work. If we wish to have competition on our waterfront, it must be within the port itself, that is, enterprise based.
       </para>
       <para>
        How well do the Government's conclusions meet the problem, and do they have sufficient urgency? I think the answer must be no on both counts. There are some good things in the Government's conclusions. Perhaps the most important is the shift from the deplorable system of industry-wide employment to enterprise-based employment for stevedoring labour.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was surprised and pleased to see that the Government also adopted enterprise-based employment for the necessary casual labour requirements. But on one very important area of the work force, the Government wimped. It is very important that there should be an elimination of union control over entry into stevedoring, but the new employees recruited in the first year of the new program will be selected by the Waterside Workers Federation, as they always have been.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have to lower the age and improve the physical fitness of the work force, and the Government has agreed to a very generous retirement scheme which can be justified only if the economic benefits are achieved. Three thousand redundant waterside workers, who have been paid very generously for many years for not doing very much, are to be paid $154m for taking early retirement. This is a very generous scheme, and I think we need more for it than we are getting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has done nothing to create a single union in each workplace. In fact, it has encouraged the continuation of the present Waterside Workers Federation Australia-wide stranglehold. It is not obvious that any of the Government's proposals will overcome the difference in efficiency between Australian and overseas terminals, which at present is at least 60 per cent, except for a timid reference in the Minister's statement to multi-skilling to reduce these demarcation disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not only the waterfront that affects port conditions. It is also the general running of a port and its towage services. We are told that the Minister is going to examine ways-again over time-to improve competition in the towage industry. What has he been doing for the last six years while this crisis has been developing? Ports must be put on a more competitive basis now. We must also reduce the deplorable union control of the operations of our container depots. I note that the Government says in its statement that it will endeavour to reach agreement through consultations under the auspices of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I wish it luck.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no time in this debate to deal with all the deficiencies of our waterfront, so I will just mention a few more of the problems. We need to lower manning rates and to eliminate featherbedding on the waterfront. What is the Government planning to do? Nothing. We need to eliminate restrictive work practices. What is the Government planning to do? Nothing. We need to increase productivity, especially crane productivity. What is the Government planning to do? Nothing. We need to eliminate the levies on shippers for long service leave, sick leave and so on. What is the Government planning to do? Nothing. I think one must say that the Minister has tried hard to get some improvement in shipping and the waterfront without offending any of the unions involved. The problem is that the difficulties, rorts, and standover tactics are so deep-seated that such a timid approach will not be successful, or at least will not be successful within the time frame we need. The Minister should remember the maxim-the boldest measures are the safest.

         —I join this discussion on the ministerial statement on the reform of shipping and the waterfront. First, I would like to refer to the progress and benefits of shipping reform. Senator Lewis, for example, referred to the history of the industry. I believe that recent history has shown quite clearly that progress has been made and that benefits have arisen from that. Unfortunately, a number of Opposition senators spoke in a very hysterical way.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would like to go back to the pre-Crawford fleet and remind honourable senators that the crews before 1984 numbered in the high 30s and that there was a rigid segmentation of shipboard functions. There was no pre-sea training for ratings until 1982. It was probably a condemnation of the industry that it was such a long time before that developed. Under the Crawford scheme between 1984 to 1988 crews on new ships fell to 26. Of course there were taxation incentives for shipowners which very seldom is mentioned but which was significant during that time. More recently the Maritime Industry Development Committee scheme in 1988 changed considerably the face of shipping. Crew numbers on new ships fell to 21. Multiskilled ratings became the basis of the industry and the team approach eliminated demarcation, with union amalgamations and a general cooperative movement on ships. There were revisions of catering arrangements and the broadbanding of jobs. Literally a new social environment was created on ships and there have been capital grants and tax incentives. That is very recent and a great jump ahead in shipping. We now have the task force package for 1988-89 and onwards, with the crew numbers on new ships falling to 17 or 18 and a reduction of crews on existing ships because of multiskilling. Developments in that area and the implementation of a redundancy scheme have been referred to. In addition, there is the issue that was just referred to by Senator Hamer, the increased flexibility of the permit system.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the short history in recent times; it is a history of progress. It means benefits that assist competition in domestic industries; it creates employment; it develops work force skills; it provides tax revenue; it improves defence security; it improves the quality and efficiency of shipping services; and it improves the balance of payments. They are just some of the benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is in the context of an industry that has, since the advent of this Government, reduced the time lost through industrial disputes. In listening to some Opposition senators one would think that there is great anarchy in the maritime industry. In 1982 the number of ship days lost as a percentage of time lost was 4.1. In the following years it has been 0.4 per cent, 0.1 per cent, 0.1 per cent, 0.2 per cent, 0.3 per cent and, in 1988, 0.2 per cent. There is no industrial disruption in the shipping industry because people in that industry realise that moves are being made to stabilise it and provide career employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, I can go further than that. The first Maritime Industry Development Committee ship came into operation in 1988. This year, the BHP tanker, the Iron Gippsland, is trading internationally. The Australian Searoader, an Australian National Line car carrier, is trading internationally. There are three small Western Australian State ships with a crew of 11 on each and the N.W. Sanderling, a large liquefied natural gas export carrier, has engaged a crew and will soon carry the first of our gas exports to Japan, with shipping and the contract under the control of the export consortium. That means that cost insurance and freight and the benefits of these are retained in Australia rather than added to our outgoings. Six other ships are planned for introduction shortly, including coastal bulk carriers, a trans-Tasman bulk container ship and an Antarctic vessel. That is the positive side of Australian shipping.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is against that background that Liberal and National party senators have argued to go back to the past. They are particularly concerned to introduce ships of convenience into our interstate shipping. The Seamen's Union has indicated that it regards this as the equivalent of the Kanak labour that was imported into rural Australia. In other words, the principle is one of exploiting poor people from, say, Indonesia, the Philippines or other developing countries, by bringing them, with their standards of living and employment standards, in ships of convenience onto the Australian interstate coastal shipping run and trying to undermine the conditions of Australian seamen.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only a fortnight ago we had an example of the sort of ship and the sort of system that the Opposition must have in the back of its mind when it argues for these flags of convenience. An article in a Wollongong newspaper headed `Cargo Ship's Safety Gear Found Defective' states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The captain of a cargo ship with useless lifeboats and fire-fighting equipment was gaoled for 12 months when he appeared in Wollongong Local Court yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        `One cannot imagine a more serious death dealing situation,' magistrate John Seberry told Captain Teodoro Licas.
       </para>
       <para>
        `It seems not one piece of emergency equipment would have been available in an emergency and it is still not unusual for ships to go down in this day and age.
       </para>
       <para>
        `It was impossible in this situation for any crew members to use the lifeboats and they would have had to rely on the grace of God to be rescued,' Mr Seberry said.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The breaches included the failure to provide in a fit and ready condition lifeboats, inflatable life rafts, fire-fighting equipment and emergency lighting.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is an example of the sort of ship that the Opposition attempts to foist on the Australian maritime industry. We have to remember that these are the sorts of flag of convenience ships which some people would seek to use to undermine our existing system and reduce its standards. It is a quite stupid idea that we could try to invoke what is virtually a guest working system into our shipping. Even worse, an average of one in 100 of these ships goes down as a result of skimping on basic safety systems. That is a complete example of the foolishness of the proposal that we should allow these people to be exploited in Australia. I understand that it was a recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). I have no great confidence in the IAC. It is another typical example of the IAC making a decision that does not take into consideration all aspects of the needs of an industry when it makes a recommendation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have had great cooperation from the people in the industry in changing the way in which they have done things. We have a three-year program of change for shipping and the waterfront. We need an atmosphere that will allow people to change within the shipping industry. I agree that it is staid in its ways and has to have compensating change, but that change has to take place in a process of cooperation and what has been described as a negotiated consensus. I believe that is the way to do it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not intend to speak at great length today about the waterfront because Senator Parer, who will also speak in this debate, and I are regular competitors in the field, but I am very pleased with developments in this area. I remember Senator Chapman getting very excited about the waterfront because the Inter-State Commission proposal on supplementary labour was not accepted. On the last occasion on which I spoke, I said that I thought that it was a foolish recommendation. I pointed out that not one of the 280 submissions that were presented to the Inter-State Commission put forward that proposal. It came out of thin air. The Government has rightly rejected it, as have the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the trades and labour councils in the various States. I am pleased that the Government has rejected it. Without going into great detail, the package that has been designed for the waterfront is to include a training program to accommodate new recruits, the support of a career structure, the provision of increased skill acquisition and job flexibility, the reclassification of jobs consistent with a career structure, the establishment of an industry training facility, and the implementation of the company based productivity incentive schemes. These are all positive things, as is the enforcement of the safety code on the waterfront.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final report which we now have allows both phases of the maritime and waterfront industries to restructure. The compensation to be provided means that people in this industry have the opportunity for adjustment. In some cases they will be able to retire. It will enable the modernisation of the industry to go ahead in three years' time. I have every confidence in the negotiations that will take place between the unions under the auspices of the ACTU to produce another industry plan for change which will provide for the industry to be more efficient than it has been in the past. As I said at the outset, I believe that the progress that this Government has made in this area is something to be proud of.

         —We are debating the statements by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) entitled Reform of Shipping and the Waterfront and Implementation of Government Business Enterprises: Reforms and Telecommunications Pricing. I intend to concentrate on the waterfront. Initially, I remark on the speech made by Senator Childs. He said that he would be opposed to flags of convenience being used by ships on our coastal shipping routes. Our coastal shipping industry is probably beyond repair. It is used only when there is no other option. We already have what I would call ships of convenience plying in Australia-they are called trucks. It boggles the mind that the cost of moving goods from, say, Melbourne to Brisbane by truck is substantially cheaper than by sea.

       <para>
        Our island continent, which is a major trading nation, is dependent on exports. The efficiency and productivity of our waterfront is vital for the well-being of every Australian. The Inter-State Commission (ISC), as a result of a very intensive and lengthy investigation, made specific recommendations. It is critical to note that in its conclusions, it stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Commission has been obliged to assess the evidence put before it by all parties and then to formulate an appropriate plan. Effective implementation of the plan and the achievement of both efficiency and equity depend on clear recognition that the plan comprises interrelated components. It is of critical importance-
       </para>
       <para>
        and I stress these words-
       </para>
       <para>
        for the parties to commit themselves to the total package.
       </para>
       <para>
        A cursory reference to the Minister's response might lead one to believe that the Government supported all or most of the recommendations. A closer examination, as reflected by the vast majority of press comments, reveals that the Government fooled no-one. Many of the Inter-State Commission's recommendations requiring commitment from the unions have been watered down and are deliberately non-specific, while those requiring commitment from the employers and the Australian taxpayers are specific and costly. I do not think we should be in the position of blaming anyone for our situation. Everyone is at fault. We have to be realistic and look at the situation as it is and tackle it in the way in which the ISC has recommended.
       </para>
       <para>
        I intend to speak in some detail on areas where the Government has failed to address the Inter-State Commission's conclusions: `It is of critical importance for the parties'-the Government, employers and unions; the parties specified in the ISC's recommendations-`to commit themselves to the total package'. There was not a priority list given by the ISC; there was a total package-take it or leave it. One area in which the Government has failed relates to the Inter-State Commission's recommendation that the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) withdraw from coverage of off-wharf container depots. The reason for that was clearly spelt out. Where the WWF is used off-wharf, compared to where the WWF is not used, in stuffing and unstuffing containers the cost is more than double. The Minister's response to this significant recommendation for cost savings to make us more competitive is merely that the unions must agree to rationalisation of union coverage; a weak response which will achieve nothing. People such as Tas Bull know that quite well. They have been through similar situations a dozen times or more.
       </para>
       <para>
        A key area for improvement in productivity on the waterfront is the abolition of crippling restrictive work practices and inflexibilities. The only response from the Minister to this recommendation is to refer to `improvements in work organisation'. Senators on both sides of this chamber are aware of what those restrictive work practices are. I have a litany of examples. Some were stated by Senator Stone. There is the `nick system' which everyone knows is alive and well. That occurs where two or more men are rostered to do the same job, or an invented job, and the spare wharfies nick off while they are on full pay. The employment of spare men is a common practice. In Brisbane, where I come from, two additional waterside workers are employed for each vessel. The spare men do no job and are not allowed to be employed even if a job arises during the shift.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such practices have built up over a long time. Other similar practices include the employment of spare front-end loader drivers who are not used; and the employment of two drivers to operate a derrick crane which is designed to be operated by only one person. If fact, the crane has only one seat. Overmanning is rife. When there is a gang of 15 or more A registered waterfront workers, an amenities man must also be hired, yet he does not do any work because the cleaning up work is done by contractors. One of the most blatant examples is the employment of a first-aid man. This involves a permanent first-aid man who cannot work but who is a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. I could go on and provide other examples. Without the abolition of these archaic work practices-some of which, I would agree, had some relevance before the Second World War, before there was mechanisation-in this modern day and age and in the economic crisis in which we find ourselves, the whole package falls apart.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the major bulk ports where there are modern installations, there is no need for WWF labour to load coal, iron ore, bauxite, grain and so on. In the majority of those ports, that labour does not exist; I agree with that. However, some superfluous employees remain in some ports, particularly in grain handling installations. The WWF has made it quite clear that it will not leave areas in which it has a foothold. I recommend that senators who have not already visited a grain loading port should do so to look at its operations. The operator sits in a cabin above the hold of the ship. He looks into and fills the ship's hold. Yet, there are ports where five, six or seven waterside workers are employed although they have nothing to do. If honourable senators look at such ports, they will see two men standing on the hold and looking into the hold; two men on the wharf; and a first-aid person who just sits on the wharf. These practices were relevant in the days when ships were loaded by men who hoisted bags of wheat over their shoulders. Today this practice is non-existent.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the practices surrounding the loading of bulk vessels, the Minister's response is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Where stevedoring employees are employed in association with the loading and unloading of bulk vessels, employment arrangements will be in accordance with efficient operational requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a wimpish response to something that is absolutely critical! The National Farmers Federation has stated quite clearly that the employment of these people who are not working represents a cost to its members of about $30m. The Inter-State Commission recommended preservation of no compulsory redundancy for existing employees but not for new recruits. There is another cop out. The Minister's statement binds employers to retain new recruits, at least until the implementation period, which is three years. In view of the sustained high interest rates-a result of the monetary policy employed by this Government-and a possible or probable recession, this is an impossible constraint on employers which does not apply in any other industry in this country that I know about.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission called for stand down provisions in awards. The Minister asked the parties to accept that this could be achieved through normal Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) proceedings. This is absolutely true. However, if the Government were genuinely seeking reform it would at least have committed itself as a party to that reform to support an application to the IRC. Yet again the Government has failed when it comes to the acid test. I remind honourable senators that this was a total package, not a priority list.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, in its response, calls for the parties to negotiate a package of reform. I remind honourable senators that, at the instigation of employers, such negotiations were commenced three years ago in 1986. So far there has been no beneficial result whatsoever. Past experience would indicate that because of its entrenched attitude to hanging on to practices that were developed more than 40 or 50 years ago, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia could not deliver on any agreement. I noted with interest the remarks by Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon, a former general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation. I quote from his remarks. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The task confronting Australia is to cure the system failures by stopping the archaic placement of labour, reducing the ratio of supervisory labour at the same time as reducing unneeded production labour.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even the Minister, in the lead-up to his statement, agreed that this had to be done and I notice that speakers from both sides of the Senate have accepted that. Charlie Fitzgibbon continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true that continual demand for a greater slice of the cake has played its part in the Australian system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think anyone would disagree with that. He then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        But the time has passed to think that the cake will always be there.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that should be sheeted home to people like Senator Burns who, because of their backgrounds, are genuine in their belief. Senator Burns made the point that the reason for the existence of the unions was to enable everyone to share in the wealth created. No-one disagrees that there should be a sharing of the wealth. But the difference between the case today and that of some 20 or 30 years ago is that we must have a bigger cake to share among a greater number of people; whereas the attitude of those outmoded thinkers seems to be that we should keep the same sized cake, or even a smaller one, and share it among a greater number of people. Mr Fitzgibbon also said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The dedication to do one's best for a wage hardly exists any longer. We live in a different world, and industry must be tailored to that environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a sense of urgency about that which must be recognised. We cannot delay for much longer. Mr Fitzgibbon continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        But the problems there are far from insoluble. It just takes good will.
       </para>
       <para>
        If only we had that good will. With our continuing current account deficit-it is estimated that it will be a staggering $16 to $17 billion by the end of June-and with our net foreign debt of $103 billion we have an economic crisis on our hands which I believe is of frightening proportions. We need to become more efficient, more productive and more competitive on world markets, in exports and in import replacements. There is no question about the fact that high interest rates will eventually dampen demand for imported goods but that does not solve our inherent structural problem-our inability to compete, particularly in manufactured goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding all this, the Government shows no sense of urgency and, after intense negotiations over the past month between all parties on the waterfront, we are told that they were not negotiations at all but discussions. Three months have been set aside for negotiations to reach an agreement in principle and three years have been set aside for its implementation. If this Government's response is to be the basis for the in-principle agreement we will achieve nothing other than a payout by taxpayers of in excess of $150m for the most unproductive workers in Australia to clear out. Those words were used in an editorial in the Australian of 2 June.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Willis has threatened the industry with what he calls `alternative measures' if restructuring is not agreed to within three months. With his unrealistic and quite wimpish response he, and this Government, might as well accept the inevitable and implement those measures immediately. We, in the Opposition, promised this Government bipartisan support if it grasped the nettle and moved to implement the total package of reform-but it had to be the total package. It was a sad day for Australia when the Government did not take up that offer. The Government, yet again, has failed the people of Australia.

         —This afternoon the Senate is debating two major statements from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). The first statement is entitled Reform of Shipping and the Waterfront and the second statement is entitled Implementation of Government Business Enterprises: Reforms and Telecommunications Pricing. I want to direct a few remarks to the first statement-Reform of Shipping and the Waterfront. On the first page of his statement the Minister said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The gross inefficiencies which have been allowed to develop in these industries have restricted our economic growth, reduced our living standards and impaired our capacity to develop export markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Minister has said that, I accept it, but I do not accept the rhetoric we have had in this chamber this afternoon-that all the blame for the economic mess we are in at the moment can be directed to the feet of the present Government. I do not think any person in the Australian community today would accept that that is the case. If there are inefficiencies-and I have no doubt that there are-in the waterfront and shipping industries of Australia, they have evolved over a period of years. Senator Hamer, who spoke earlier, drew an analogy between Australia and Argentina. Without debating the specific point that the honourable senator was making, perhaps I should also draw an analogy. If we are in a mess similar to that in Argentina perhaps the reason is that for the majority of the past 80 years both nations have been governed and controlled by conservative governments.

         —We have been governed by conservative governments for the majority of that time. For 31 of the past 40 years the conservative parties-of which Senator Bishop is a member and a representative in this chamber-have been in office. That represents more than 75 per cent of that time. If there are inefficiencies in the shipping and waterfront industries honourable senators opposite also have to accept their share of the blame for that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Perhaps the greatest blame that can be directed to people on the Opposition benches today and those who preceded them in the years we are talking about is that they did virtually nothing to bring about any reform in the industries we are speaking about. This Hawke Labor Government, which has been in office for only 6 1/2 years, already has the runs on the board. I will not detail them again because I do not believe in repetition merely for the sake of repetition. I believe that this debate is very important and I want as many honourable senators as possible not only from my side of the chamber but also from the other side of the chamber to take part in it. However, I will restrict my comments. I will not repeat the remarks of, or go through the figures cited by, Senator Childs, Senator Cooney, Senator Burns and other speakers from this side of the chamber. The figures are in the ministerial statement. I commend it to anyone in the shipping industry or involved in transport generally. The runs are on the board. They are in front of us. They have not been refuted by any speaker in this debate, so we will move on.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the runs that we have on the board, which is still not understood by those on the Opposition benches, is that we have been able-though it has not operated perfectly-to bring all sectors of the industry together. Page three of the statement talks about the Shipping Reform Task Force headed by an independent individual, a Mr Ivan Deveson, the Managing Director of Nissan Australia. The Task Force comprises senior representatives of shippers, ship operators, the unions and government. We have also established the Inter-State Commission, another independent statutory body. The Commission took evidence from the stevedoring industry employers, from unions, from commercial operators, from Federal and State interests, from importers and from exporters. We have the people concerned with the industry working together. As I said, things have not been perfect in every instance but at least we have been able to bring people to the bargaining table.
       </para>
       <para>
        Judging by what previous speakers in the debate have said, one would think that blame for all the ills of the industry should be directed at the feet of the trade union movement, in particular the Waterside Workers Federation. The wharfies, as they are commonly known, have a strong union. It is a union that I admire because it has looked after its membership-as unions are established to do. People listening to the debate who were not informed of what has been happening in Australia would think that the wharfies, the Waterside Workers Federation, are an intransigent mob who would not shift or budge if a barge pole was behind them. That is not true. The Minister's statement gives clear evidence of the shifts that have taken place in the union. Senator Parer mentioned a number of individuals who are active in the union, such as Tas Bull. Tas Bull takes a strong position when fighting for his membership. I am sure that Senator Parer would accept that. Tas Bull does the best he can, just as Senator Parer in this chamber represents as best he can the interests that he is elected to represent.

        I have said that I will not take an enormous amount of time on this matter, but let me make a point about efficiency. Efficiency is mentioned at the beginning of the Minister's statement. It has been mentioned ad nauseam in the debate this afternoon. There is an old adage that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. If we, as good senators, are to talk about efficiency, let us examine how efficient we were in this place yesterday. Then we can throw stones. If we can say to ourselves that we are efficient and carry out our duties to the fullest extent, we can, in turn, cast stones at the shipping industry and the waterfront. A lot has been said about the cabotage policy. It has been with us, supported by successive governments, since the 1920s. It has been around for about 70 years, which Senator Parer would know. The Minister's statement reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        The cabotage policy was carefully examined by the Shipping Reform Task Force. No member-
       </para>
       <para>
        it was a multi-disciplinary task force representative of all sections of the industry-
       </para>

       </para>
       <para>
        But there are detailed suggestions of how the permit system should be changed to increase flexibility. The ministerial statement continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Task Force pointed out-
       </para>
       <para>
        to my knowledge, this has not been mentioned in the debate so far, although I have not heard every speaker-
       </para>
       <para>
        that almost all major maritime nations have a cabotage policy, including our leading trading partners, Japan and the United States.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even Britain, under the great helmsperson, Margaret Thatcher, has a cabotage policy. It has just been legislated for, although the legislation has not yet been proclaimed. Even Britain has moved to protect its industry. Most nations see domestic shipping as part of domestic production and seek to protect it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The previous speaker, Senator Parer, mentioned the conditions of seamen here and how they get to travel first class. I reckon that if it is good enough for senators and some senior staff employed by senators or by the Parliament to travel first class in Australia, it is good enough for seamen, who do vitally important work on behalf of this nation. Everybody in Australia ought to be able to travel first class.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to comment on one other matter, which I did not pick up when I read the Inter-State Commission's report and previous reports on the vital issue of restructuring. Senator Burns this afternoon referred to one of the Commission's recommendations about the rejuvenation of the waterfront industry. Particular reference was made to the existing 3,000 employees leaving the industry over a three-year period and the recruitment of 1,000 new employees not older than 30. I had not thought about this matter in the terms in which Senator Burns raised it. I suspect that is the case with other senators and people in the community. I have joked with my children over the past few months that, after this year, I will be unemployable because I will reach the age where few employers are willing to take a person like me on. I will be 45; over 45 and one is not wanted. Senator Burns asked whether we were shifting the age limit for people. Are we saying that, in the future, people over 30 will not be able to handle a new career?
       </para>
       <para>
        This matter needs to be looked at again by the Government, the Task Force, the unions and the industry. From my limited knowledge of the waterfront-and I have worked on the waterfront in the ship repair industry-there are many people in the industry who could quite conceivably carry on until they are 60 or 65 years old, such is the technology at work on the waterfront in Australia today. Certainly many people in Australia who are 35, 40, 45 or 50 could embark on a new career. One does not necessarily have to be below the age of 30 to embark on a new career or even to have some new thoughts and ideas. New ideas are not restricted to people who are younger than 30. Senator Stone, when he was long past the age of 30, changed his career. I suspect that the vast majority of honourable senators changed their careers after they passed the age of 30. Different demands are made on senators than on people who work on the waterfront. Not a great deal of physical demand is made upon us as representatives of the people. I suspect that the degree of physical demand made on people in the waterfront industry is not the same now, as we approach the 1990s and the 2000s, as it was 20, 30 or 40 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could quite easily use up the full 15 minutes allocated to me, but this is a very important debate and I will restrict my comments to those I have already made. I will listen with interest to the remaining comments, not only from the Opposition benches, but also from Government senators.

         —In the interests of parliamentary productivity sought by the good senator who spoke before me, we have agreed to curtail our remarks and keep them brief on this occasion. As previous speakers have said, we are discussing the two reports from the Honourable Ralph Willis, Minister for Transport and Communications, concerning the reform of shipping and the waterfront and, more particularly, the implementation of government business enterprise (GBE) reforms and telecommunications pricing. It is that part of the second report dealing with government business enterprise so-called reforms with which I would like to deal very briefly now.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The starting point is that the Government seems to be interested in creating a myth-a myth that it is possible to create a government corporation which, the Government says, will be able to compete on an equal footing with the private sector, be commercial in its orientation and efficient in the delivery of its services. The real effect of the corporatisation of government services, which still use government moneys, is that they are pushed off budget and are allegedly at arm's length from the government, but they are still users of public money. The money which funds those bodies comes initially via tax money, and no taxpayer has any option as to whether or not he or she pays the tax and where it is spent, whereas the capital that is provided for a company in the private sector is provided by people who, of their own choice, invest in that company and the market makes a continual judgment about that company by monitoring its share price. Thus we have this myth that there is an entity, which is still a creature of government but is somehow supposed to be imbued with all the features of the private sector. As I said, it is owned by government, the directors are appointed by government and the chief executive officers are basically appointed by government on the recommendation of the directors who, as I said, are appointed by government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem is one of accountability. In this statement there is a lot of talk about efficiency, which is laudable. There is a lot of talk about competition, being more flexible and businesslike and being on a sounder financial footing, all of which are laudable aspirations. The one aspect which is not stressed is that of accountability. Under this system there is a movement by the Government to write into legislation concerning many GBEs a move away from using the Auditor-General as the auditor. Indeed, it is important to note at this point that much of the criticism that the Auditor-General has to endure is often a result of the lack of resources that he has to carry out the onerous task which he is required by the Parliament to carry out. Of course, the really inhibiting factor is that the authority which provides the Auditor-General with his resources is none other than an arm of the executive side of government, that is, the Department of Finance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thus, the Public Accounts Committee, when it recently brought down its report, made a recommendation that the funding of the Auditor-General should be taken away from the executive side of government and given to a committee of parliamentarians chaired by a Presiding Officer from either chamber, in order that there can be a truly independent Auditor-General. While the executive side of government is controlling the purse strings it is impossible for him to be truly independent in a meaningful way. Accordingly, as the Government has deliberately under-resourced the Auditor-General and made it impossible for him in all cases to meet the strict requirements we would require, there has been a move by the Government to enable members of the private sector to be appointed as auditors for these so-called government business enterprises. The problem with that is not that the private sector will not do a good job; of course, it will.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, in that Public Accounts Committee report we made the very sound suggestion that the Auditor-General should remain the auditor of the record, but that he could use private sector auditors by way of contract, so that the line of accountability comes back directly to the Parliament. I cite the example of Australian Airlines. There is absolutely no obligation upon Australian Airlines to table its annual report here in the Parliament for scrutiny, but it did. But there is no obligation for that to be done and, therefore, there is less opportunity for scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        To recap, although this paper stresses the need for more efficient, more flexible and more businesslike operations, it completely overlooks the point that the nature of a government business enterprise is fundamentally different from that of a private sector ordinary corporation. A good example of how the playing field is not level, if one likes to put it that way, relates to the corporations that are raised specifically in this report, that is, eight of the 10 GBEs which come within the portfolio of Mr Willis. It is interesting to note that there are approximately 19 of these GBEs, and they employ between them 50 per cent of the Commonwealth civilian employment in the public sector. So it is a very significant area for scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at two of those GBEs. Let us look particularly at Telecom Australia and Australia Post. Telecom and Australia Post both enjoy monopoly positions in the market for some of their activities, and we have just had a very lengthy debate in the Parliament dealing with the telecommunications package of Bills. In two of those Bills, concerning Telecom and Australia Post, there is a provision which gives both of those bodies immunity from suit. That is, they are not liable for legal actions as an ordinary business would be. Part 4, clause 30 of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill states:
       </para>
       <para>
        An action or proceeding does not lie against Telecom or any other person in relation to any loss or damage suffered, or that may be suffered, by a person because of any act or omission (whether negligent or otherwise) by or on behalf of Telecom in relation to the supply of a reserved service.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the previous debate we established that a reserved service is basically a monopoly service. Therefore, this clause includes things such as the first telephone or the cellular mobile. Let us look at an example: Telecom employees come along to a house and dig a trench so they can put in the first phone. In the process, somebody is injured because of negligent action with regard to the service being provided. No action will be open to the person who has been injured to take because Telecom is protected-given an immunity-from anyone suing it in these circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of Australia Post a similar protection is given. The Australian Postal Corporation Bill states:
       </para>
       <para>
        An action or proceeding does not lie against Australia Post or any other person in relation to any loss or damage suffered, or that may be suffered, by a person because of any act or omission (whether negligent or otherwise) by or on behalf of Australia Post in relation to the carriage of a letter or other article by means of the letter service.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at another example. A postman, who is riding his bicycle, bowls over a pedestrian. If this happens in the course of the carriage of the letter service, it is able to be argued that the pedestrian would not have any recourse through the law to sue for damages suffered. On the other hand, if the carrier had been a courier in the private sector, he would be liable. The point is that Telecom does not have to make any provision for damages that may lie against it. It does not have to provide the cost of insurance for damages that may lie against it and it has an advantage in terms of financing itself that the private sector simply does not enjoy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overwhelming principle with regard to government business enterprises is that when we talk about efficiency we must also talk about accountability. The answer to these problems, in the eyes of the Opposition and in accordance with our published policies, is privatisation. In our policy statements we have published a list of organisations which we would privatise and those that would be looked at in terms of peripheral privatisation. Very simply, the conclusion is this-and important questions of public administration are involved: while government business enterprises are able to carry on business without shareholders being able to buy and sell shares and thus make judgments about their performance and without the market being able to make judgments as to the value of those shares, the coalition would regard the Auditor-General as essential to making those enterprises accountable to the Parliament and to the people. There is a need to maintain that strict line of accountability to this Parliament so that there is a high standard of accountability in the expenditure of public moneys, in whatever guise.

         —We are discussing the ministerial statements on reform of shipping and the waterfront made by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). I want to make two points only which arise out of those statements. I am pleased to see that Senator Tate is in the chamber because one of those points relates to his portfolio. Earlier today Senator Button chastised the Opposition by saying that it had failed to properly read the indications which were coming from writers in Australia as regards the direction that Australian society and the Australian economy were taking. In reply to his comments, I made the point that there were evident directions which this Government was failing to properly read and properly direct attention to. In the statement the Minister said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At the heart of this strategy is a program for reduction of the size of crews on existing ships.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on to give estimates of an $80m saving in crew costs by mid-1992 and at least $50m a year thereafter and reductions in crew sizes on major trading vessels from 29 at present to 21 over the next three years. He also recites the amount of money which the Government will put into a voluntary retirement scheme. He points out quite correctly that shipping is highly capital intensive and that it is, therefore, very sensitive to the fiscal regime of the Government. The Minister draws attention to the 7 per cent taxable grant which will be available until 30 June 1992 to cover the costs of necessary modifications to existing ships for operation with smaller crews.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first point I want to establish does not seem to have been given proper weight by either the Government or the Opposition. When a regime of wages, tax deductions and prices is imposed, that in itself directs behaviour and the shape of changes into the future in such a way that the changes are mitigated. In other words, there is a move to work against the changes that have been imposed. For instance, if a government demands a high rate of tax on wages, those who are capable of demanding higher wages will attempt to do so to cover the increased costs of that taxation so that their net pay after tax will remain the same as it was before. If we place a higher tax on material consumption, the system will shift so that there will be a lesser consumption of material things.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government, by taking action with respect to the waterfront and in a number of other areas, is simply responding to the system as it has been and is not reading the signs of where it needs to go. By changing wages, tax and incentives in the system, one can move the system in desirable directions rather than simply responding to what is occurring and being reactive rather than pro-active. I am referring to a clear need to shift taxation away from tax on income and toward a tax on resources. What is happening to our environment makes it patently clear that it is desirable to minimise the consumption of resources. Of course, labour is a resource which is endlessly renewable as long as we look after the workers. It makes little sense increasingly to tax wages and, as a consequence, to do the sorts of things which are contained in the Minister's statements-namely, to have to reduce the size of crews because the costs of labour have become so high-and then, at the same time, provide a taxable grant to shippers to carry out modifications to ships; in other words, to subsidise the consumption of non-renewable material things while taxing wages which are endlessly renewable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first point I want to make is that this Government is being reactive in this document and is not reading the signs correctly as to where it needs to shift the economy. It should be looking, rather, to reducing taxes, modifying wages appropriately and, therefore, reducing the costs of labour, and putting that tax on the consumption of those things which go into the ships themselves. That would be moving us in a desirable direction-a direction in which we will inevitably have to move a few years down the track and a direction which, if taken earlier by other countries, would put us at a severe disadvantage. We should read the signs and modify our policies now.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point I want to make relates to a number of features which are proposed within the ministerial statements. I refer to the head of power within the Constitution under which the Government is carrying out these changes-indeed, the head of power which has allowed the Commonwealth Government to legislate in this area at all. The principal head of power under which the Commonwealth has legislated nationally in this area is section 51 (i) of the Constitution-the commerce and trade power. Note the sorts of things that the Government has succeeded in doing with that power. It has maintained a cabotage policy, which is mentioned in this statement. That policy determines which ships shall operate in what ways around the Australian coastline.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was very interesting to hear Senator Grant Chapman talking about freeing up the operations on the Australian waterfront and saying that what one would need to do there would be to protect things like the environment. If one were to do that, one would be using section 51 (i) of the Constitution, the commerce and trade powers, to protect the environment. The report says that there will be changed conditions for the operation of foreign vessels around our coasts. This power is being exercised by the Commonwealth under this head of the Constitution for a commercial end. There is no reason whatsoever why the same power should not be exercised by the Commonwealth to look after the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is significant that, contrary to what we heard yesterday from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), that sections 51 (i), 51 (xx) and 51 (xxix) of the Constitution were not suitable heads of power for the Federal Government to legislate under with respect to the environment, we find the very next day that the Government is further legislating and exercising its powers under one of those heads of power within the Constitution. Quite clearly, that power has not been challenged but in fact has been used quite extensively. I draw that matter to the attention of the Minister in the chamber. I hope that he will take the point that the Commonwealth does indeed have very extensive powers with respect to the environment. This is an example of the exercise of one of those powers. Those powers could be exercised and extended into environmental protection. What the Government really lacks is the will, not the constitutional power.

       </para>
       <para>
        Yet this Government is in fact asking the industry to reform itself. That is what the Government's response to the Commission's report really says. The Australian, in its editorial of 2 June, noted the difference between the rhetoric of the Government in its response and the reality of its response. It noted that officially the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission, yet by throwing every important question back to the industry for three months of negotiations, it has in effect rejected this fundamental tenet:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is abundantly clear that the waterfront industry will not reform itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        The editorial further points out that there is a conservative estimate that the waterfront, because of its rorting and overmanning, costs about $2 billion a year in lost national wealth. The editorial says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Passing the buck will not produce long-lasting reform. The sweetheart deal between the maritime unions and ship owners-the former being over-paid and under-worked and the latter guaranteed virtual monopolies-has to be dismantled quickly. Anything less will fail to improve the abysmally low productivity of the waterfront.
       </para>
       <para>
        The editorial makes a further point:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is offering to pay $150m for the most unproductive worker in Australia to clear out. But why should taxpayers be ripped off again for an industry that has brought exporters to their knees and reduced our living standards?
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no guarantee the few serious reforms the Government has endorsed will be enacted; we only have its blustering assurances of ``firm commitments'' and ``reform strategies''. The most sweeping of these, ensuring the right of employers to employ-a right which, incredibly, is held by the Waterside Workers Federation-is essential. And it remains to be seen whether the Government-or, more to the point, the ACTU and federation-will accept other employer rights, including control of working conditions, in a way that is taken for granted in every other industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The editorial concludes that the Government has failed in its reform of the waterfront. The Sydney Morning Herald of 2 June adopts a similar approach. It says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The package announced in the Federal Parliament yesterday by the Transport Minister, Mr Willis, does not meet Mr Hawke's promise of last October that ``we are determined not to shirk the challenge'' of reforming the nation's transport infrastructure.

       <para>

       <para>
        Too many important aspects of the package are still open to negotiation, more compromise and possible rejection.

        Mr Willis insists that this huge handout will not be paid until `there is an agreement satisfactory to the Government'. He lists 17 items for which `firm commitments' will be needed. But many of the items are still open to negotiation.

       <para>
        Can the Federal Government, in fact, be trusted to be tough with the Waterside Workers' Federation and the employers if they reach agreements that are unsatisfactory? It is, perhaps, significant that two major recommendations of the Inter-State Commission have been dropped. The WWF will not be forced to give up its coverage of smaller ports and there will be no stand-down provisions in the WWF award.
       </para>
       <para>
        The editorial concludes:
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation on the waterfront and coastal shipping demanded bold action. The Government, unfortunately, has responded with undue caution and timidity.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the essence of the Opposition's concerns about the Government's response. The Government appears to understand the problem and refuses to do anything about it. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) in his statement says that the industry has remained grossly inefficient. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission has found the waterfront industry in urgent need of fundamental change.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the Government has referred it to more committees. It has asked the industry to negotiate. In some instances it is going to take three years for the changes that are recommended to take place. But the Minister says that the Government accepts the fundamental thrust of the Inter-State Commission's findings. However, there is no sense of urgency and no commitment to bring them about. The Minister says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Success will depend on allowing the competitive forces of the market place to operate more freely . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        But we cannot see how there is any guarantee in what the Government is doing that this will in fact take place. The Minister simply says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will be pursuing change in three broad areas in line with the Commission's recommendations . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It is pursuing it, but it is not bringing it about. The Government says that there will be a fundamental change in employment arrangements, but these are subject to negotiation with the unions and the employers. There is no guarantee that the result of those negotiations will be satisfactory. The Minister says:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . port authorities, where the Government is pursuing with the States and the Northern Territory measures to improve the efficiency of port authorities and services they influence . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That pursuit gives no guarantee of success. There does not seem to have been any evidence of urgency so far in that pursuit. The Minister stated that the Government would be pursuing measures to create a more competitive commercial environment. What does this really mean? This is the problem we have with the whole statement. The Minister stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has accepted the vast majority of the Commission's recommendations in these areas and will be pursuing them in consultation with relevant parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's answer to the important question of when, how, and what guarantees of success we will have is that it does not know. The real risk we face is that the Government could go into a situation such as that of the steel plan, where it was prepared, in a major restructuring of the steel industry-which was absolutely needed, and I must say that it was partly successful-to commit very large amounts of taxpayers' money by way of subsidy; the steel industry contributed very large amounts of money by way of capital re-equipment; but the major contribution of the unions, particularly in Port Kembla, was a series of industrial disputes which limited the productivity in the area and in fact reduced productivity levels per man for several lengthy periods during this restructuring of the steel industry to far below those that existed before the huge capital re-equipment program proceeded.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there we had a situation where the company and the taxpayer put in money and the unions put in strikes. What kinds of sanctions and what kind of protection do we have in this new scheme where the taxpayer is to put in $150m? What guarantees do we have that the unions and the employers will adopt procedures which ensure that there are no asinine disputes disrupting the industry, destroying the efficiency of Australian exporters and reducing our capacity to trade our way out of the disastrous balance of payments problems that this Government and this kind of inefficiency have largely put us into?
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Minister, the benefits envisaged by the Inter-State Commission are something like $620m a year in terms of cost reductions and improved reliability if the sorts of improvements that the Inter-State Commission recommended take place. But we have no guarantees that this will happen. One of the things that concern me very much indeed is the fifth commitment that the Government requires under its scheme. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        New employees are to be recruited directly into individual enterprises with recruitment in the first year being in accordance with existing industry procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the Waterside Workers Federation says who can have a job and who cannot. It continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        In subsequent years each enterprise should determine the recruitment procedures to be followed in consultation with relevant unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Either we have a situation in which employers are allowed to employ the employees they want, or we do not. The Inter-State Commission said that this change should be made, but in the ministerial statement it is stated that `the recruitment procedures to be followed are those to be determined in consultation with relevant unions'. What if the unions demand continued control over that employment? What will happen if they are able to determine who can and who cannot be offered a job on the waterfront, rather than the employer? It seems to me that we have a continuation of the sorts of problems that have generated disaster on the waterfront, and there has been no commitment-not even if the Government's requirements are met-to correct what has been a disastrous situation. The eleventh commitment states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The parties must accept that permanent inclusion of stand-down provisions in awards is a matter to be pursued through normal Industrial Relations Commission processes.
       </para>
       <para>
        `Pursued', says the Government. It would be much nicer if the word was `achieved'. `Pursued' is another of those wishy-washy words which give the appearance of great progress, of major change; but the Government is simply pursuing something and it does not look like catching it. There is nothing in this statement that really involves catching hold of the problem and resolving it. The Government is searching after solutions-despite this inquiry, which clearly showed what those solutions should be and how they should be achieved. We are now having these further ludicrous wishy-washy statements which, quite frankly, are a major disappointment and, as the editorials have indicated, clearly show that the Government has failed to grasp the nettle.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is certainly nothing in this ministerial statement which does anything to end the ludicrous situation discovered by the Inter-State Commission of industrial disputes on quite impossible and disgraceful grounds. I will quote from a study made of some industrial disputes between 1 December 1988 and 1 February 1989 which the Commission pursued. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Most disputes were, if not spurious in intent, at least questionable, and they illustrate a degree of failure in dispute-settlement procedures as well as seeming indifference to the consequence of their actions on the part of labour involved . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The disputes studied seemed to have been initiated if and when convenient to labour. Resolution of the disputes was unhurried and, if not completed to the union's satisfaction, impossible. Grievances are considered by both the union and management to be matters that inevitably lead to disputes and work stoppages rather than as impediments to be overcome in completion of their duty to the recipient of their service. This is evidenced by the fact that information provided by the WWF to the Commission regarding these disputes barely mentions delay or diversion to any vessel but merely chronicles the justification for each dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table from the Inter-State Commission report indicating the number of vessels delayed as a result of industrial disputation in Australian ports from 1 December 1988 to 1 February 1989.

         —The focus of economic debate in the last couple of years in Australia, and elsewhere, I think, has shifted very importantly and very significantly from what we used to call macro-economic policies to the question of micro-economic reform. I think that is a very significant and probably very timely shift in the focus of the debate, but I think that we need to exercise a little caution on this. In any event, macro-economic and micro-economic policies and reform cannot be as clearly separated as is often indicated from the debates that take place. But also it is a lack of appropriate macro-economic policy which is the root cause of our fundamental economic difficulties today. There is a complete failure by the Government to adopt and pursue those policies of an overall macro-economic nature which are essential if we are to retain and improve, as we desperately need to do, our competitiveness in an increasingly competitive world.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have had these problems with macro-economic policy. We have seen a complete failure by the Government to undertake the necessary fiscal policy stance. This is needed if we are to restrain government expenditures and, therefore, tax levels. There must be scope to get more incentive and reward back into the Australian economy so that people will have a go at the things that are necessary in business activity if we want this country to grow. As a result we have, of course, seen a totally inappropriate over-reliance on monetary policy. That has cost us very dear indeed, as any home owner or home buyer in Australia can tell us today and as any businessman who has to borrow at 20 per cent plus can tell us today. All of us who suffer from rising inflation in a world where inflation in many countries is not rising could tell the Government that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a balance of payments problem and deficit which is absolutely horrendous. It has led to Australia as a nation having a debt to the rest of the world of almost $130 billion. This is coupled with the situation where we still, of course, have a level of taxation and Government expenditure unsurpassed in our preceding history. We have also seen the abandonment of wages policy to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The Government has become a total puppet of the ACTU in this area, as indeed it has in most other areas of economic policy formation as well. We have also seen a disregard by the Government of appropriate exchange rate policies, which has led to violent gyrations in the exchange rate. This has caused enormous uncertainty and lack of confidence and difficulty in doing business by the private sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is macro-economic policy which ultimately determines the outlook for the Australian economy. Unless our macro policies are correct, then no amount of treatment of other policies will lead us to greater productivity and efficiency, which determine our competitiveness, our living standards and our relative place in the world. However, assuming that our macro-economic policies are basically correct, then micro policies become of critical importance. The statements of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) which provided the vehicle for today's debate deal with the Government's response to two important reports on the shipping and waterfront industries. The shipping and waterfront industries are of critical importance to the Australian economy and particularly to our external situation. It is through the ports of Australia that most of our imports and, more particularly, our exports flow. The balance of payments is the Achilles heel of the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The President of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Michael Poynter, recently described our ports as the lungs of the Australian economy. That is a very apt description. There are many forms of micro-economic issues. We are dealing with just a couple of them today in the sense of the content of the Minister's statements that are the subject of this debate. There are many. There is the whole question of transport, coastal shipping and the waterfront that we are dealing with. There is also the whole question of aviation policy and the policy we have towards the airlines. We had a debate on that yesterday. We had the absolutely extraordinary situation of Government senators in this place voting against a motion which was supportive of the statements of the Government's own responsible Minister for Transport and Communications, who was supported by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as well, in terms of the need to ensure the continuing viability of Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines by privatising them.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have the whole question of industry restructuring and the plans the Government has set in place for industry. They are plans which have been very highly regulatory. They have had a very mixed response. In many instances in my view they have done more to harm industry than to help it, particularly by virtue of the whole web of additional regulations that have been imposed on a wide range of industries. We have seen the spectacle of an increasingly entrenched inflexibility in the labour market sponsored by the decisions of this Government in the establishment of its Industrial Relations Commission and other labour market policies which, again, have been quite contrary to the types of change needed if we are to become a more flexible, freed up and competitive economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen the Government's total inability to tackle one of the major potential areas of economic reform in this country, namely, the privatisation, the sale to the public, of government business enterprises where government has no place at all in being in business. It is the job of the private sector to do most of the things that the government business enterprises undertake. This includes airlines in particular. The Government has shown its total inability to deal with any of the privatisation issues. This is essentially because the traditional and inherent view of the Australian Labor Party has been towards public ownership. That was instanced as recently as in the last 12 months in the Hobart national conference of the Labor Party where it greatly entrenched again the whole concept of public ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one looks at the areas of micro-economic policies and reforms that are open to any country, one realises that the tragedy is that this Government has blocked off many of the potential avenues for improvement that we have. It is all the more of concern therefore that the Government's response to the problems facing both the shipping and waterfront industries is so lacking in urgency, in understanding and in depth. All the Government has done in relation to these industries and the reports that it has received on them is to have fiddled at the edges. The reason why the Government has fiddled at the edges and has shown an absolute lack of understanding of the critical importance and the urgency of the problems involved is that it is totally beholden to the unions concerned and to the vested interests concerned. That particularly relates to the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. There were Ministers in the Government-I know that Senator Button and Mr Kerin were two-who argued strongly for much greater action, activity and change before the Government put its final recommendations to bed in these two areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button was concerned about the coastal shipping measures. Mr Kerin was as well. But he was also concerned about the waterfront. The result was that those two Ministers were rolled. What the Government came up with in response to the reports it had before it was a wimpish, lackadaisical response which shows that the Government is absolutely out of touch with the real issues facing the Australian economy and the desperate task we face over the years ahead to keep ourselves afloat as an economy in a world which is rapidly leaving us behind in efficiency, productivity, competitiveness and living standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        The inefficiencies in the coastal shipping industry have been estimated by the Industries Assistance Commission to have cost the Australian economy up to $460m a year. It has been estimated by the Economic Planning Advisory Council that industry reform on the waterfront could save up to $850m a year. For example, it is cheaper to ship newsprint from the west coast of Canada to Sydney than it is to ship it from Hobart to Sydney. It costs $82 per tonne to ship milk powder from Tasmania to Melbourne, whilst shipping it from Tasmania to Taiwan costs $72 per tonne. The Government has ignored totally the enormous problems of the industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will conclude my remarks in this debate by referring to an important subject in relation to the waterfront industries-and I will come back to it on another appropriate occasion-and that is the role of the Waterside Workers Federation in the packing of containers. Restrictions on the packing of containers have existed since 1967. At that time, when containerisation was introduced into Australia, containers with goods for more than one exporter-that is called a less than a container load-had to be placed at approved container depots manned by Waterside Workers Federation members; otherwise union members on the docks refused to handle them. The cost of packing a container at such depots runs to more than $600 per container compared with $400 for a container packed in a non-approved depot. When I say `non-approved' or `approved' I refer to depots that are approved by the Waterside Workers Federation, regardless of whether union labour from other unions is available at other depots. In other words, the Waterside Workers Federation has had a stranglehold on the packing of containers where more than one exporter is involved in the contents of the container.
       </para>
       <para>
        The freight forwarders have been able to get around the problem. The only way they have been able to do so has been by using false documentation. They have deliberately falsified their documentation in order to get their exports out. The fact that there has to be dishonest documenting of freight forwarding is a matter of the gravest concern. The issue is about to go before the courts. A big battle is to be waged on it. The Minister for Transport and Communications, in his response on 1 June, has made reference to the existence of the problem but he has done nothing, as is the case with most of the other recommendations in the report. He has done nothing to show resolve in the tackling of the problem. It is just one example of the enormous difficulties that we face. It is a classic example of the Government's total inability and lack of resolve to tackle the waterfront, shipping and other industries which desperately require reform. As a result, we as a nation are suffering drastically. That is why the economy is going down the drain at a great rate of knots and that is why the life span of the Government is very limited.

         —Last week the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) delivered two ministerial statements in the House of Representatives-the first on the waterfront and the second on government owned enterprises. The statements can be characterised by four words: too little too late. The disastrous $103 billion foreign debt figure announced last week is an indication of just how the Government not only has lost control of the economy but also has few ideas about how to regain the initiative and actually cool down our burgeoning debt.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I wish to concentrate my remarks on government-owned enterprises and draw attention to the fact that last week in this place Senator Alston asked a question of Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, regarding a contract which has been let by Telecom Australia to build a corporate office complex in the central business district of Melbourne. Senator Chaney followed up Senator Alston's question by asking whether the Government was informed of Telecom's decision to build a major complex in Exhibition Street at a cost in excess of $300m. At the time the Minister seemed not to appreciate the problems with decisions of this nature which inflate an already oversupplied commercial property market glut and which, because of the huge amount of money involved, will have a specific effect on heating up the economy.

        It is all very well for the Government to say that government business enterprises should operate at arm's length and be administered both efficiently and on commercial principles. However, it is ridiculous for a government-owned enterprise the board of management of which is appointed by a Minister, which operates under an Act of this Parliament and which provides an annual report to this Parliament, to undertake actions which are in direct conflict with government policy. The reality of the matter is that a government instrumentality has made a decision to undertake a $300m building development and the Minister says, `We have no say in that decision because we want it to act according to commercial principles'. In all circumstances, government economic policy should override any arm's length philosophy when the national economy is as sick as Australia's has become. It is important that these sorts of enterprises operate within the general philosophy pertaining at a point of time.

        The Government's attitude in this area begs the question: what exactly are its priorities? Why does the Government continue to preside over an economic situation where ordinary Australian families trying to buy or build a home and struggling with ever-increasing interest rates are being squeezed because of decisions such as Telecom's? The Government's lame answer to this is to say, `Our hands are tied'. What an abrogation of responsibility. Ordinary home purchasers are being squeezed and are being asked to pay the price of restraint through high interest rates while at the same time government instrumentalities are allowed to build their large Taj Mahals, pushing upwards the already burgeoning and overheated economy. Therefore, I ask: Does the Government really believe that it should have no say in decisions made by Telecom, Australia Post, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and others? If so, why did the Prices Surveillance Authority-a government agency-undertake an inquiry into foreshadowed postal charge increases by Australia Post? What double standards!
       </para>
       <para>
        I now come back to my earlier point about the Minister's statements. The failure of the Government to involve itself in the Melbourne development by Telecom is yet another example of a government which has abrogated control over the economy. When all the technical niceties are stripped away, Telecom Australia and other government business enterprises operating with public money are accountable to the Australian taxpayer and his parliamentary representatives in this building.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn briefly to another point. In my view, it is vital that either the Commonwealth Auditor-General should maintain a direct audit role over all government owned enterprises or, if an enterprise engages a private sector auditor, the Auditor-General must still have a final overview of that enterprise's accounts. It may be necessary for the Auditor-General to audit the auditor. In many cases, the use of the Commonwealth Auditor-General has become the only link this Parliament has with particular government enterprises. If this link is severed, what role do we as parliamentarians have? Senator Walsh has said that the control is through the bottom line. I say that that is not good enough. It is absolutely fundamental, both to the doctrine of parliamentary accountability and to the oversight of public spending that the Auditor-General maintains an integral role in the scrutiny of revenue expenditure by each government enterprise. I was very disappointed with the two ministerial statements made last Thursday, but most particularly with the statement on government business enterprises. It is no good tinkering at the edges with issues such as the waterfront and government business enterprises. The actions of a responsible government should be a wholesale overhaul of government involvement in both areas.

         —We are debating two ministerial statements that were made in the other place last week. One relates essentially to coastal shipping and the other relates to the waterfront. I join a long list of disappointed and disillusioned senators who thought that at this time, if at no other time, this Government would grasp the nettle and dedicate itself to proper and conscientious reform of the shipping industry and the waterfront. Tragically, its response to these two major problems is epitomised in the way that we have seen the Government respond to many other problems in recent times. It would seem that this Government is paralysed. If it is not paralysed, it is certainly straitjacketed. It is obvious for all to see in the naked light of reality that this Government is absolutely controlled by the left wing.

         —Senator McKiernan chuckles knowingly on the other side of the chamber, being one of those-as is the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-who pull the levers while our Treasurer, Mr Keating, really just has to bow and scrape and deliver what he is allowed to. We hear this Government so often saying to us that it has a relationship with the Australian Council of Trade Unions which allows it to enter into agreements and arrangements in a way that the coalition could not. These are the grotty and grubby sorts of deals that this Government is proud of doing with the ACTU; they are certainly not deals we wish to do when in government. We expect the Government to at least be an equal partner in this relationship, not a wimpish junior partner that gets its marching orders from Kelty, Crean, and the minions that run the ACTU.

        It seems that we now have an economy which is drifting perilously close to stormy waters. By any measure, it is bound to cast itself on the rocks of destruction. There is no informed observer or political commentator who would not suggest that our economy is in serious peril. What is Mr Keating doing? He is hanging on to one lever only-that of interest rates. Why is he doing that? Because that is the only lever he is allowed to hang onto. He is not allowed to involve himself in privatisation, relieving the taxpayers of tens of millions of dollars just to allow these government corporations to have some capital base, some capital equipment and some capacity to function in a reasonable way. What has the Government done to reduce demand through cutting its own budget or more particularly, if it had the skill and capability, targeting more effectively the dollars that it dishes out? Where is the Government in relation to deregulation of the labour market and any of these micro-economic reforms which are fundamental to turn our balance of payments around and fundamental to our economy heading in the right direction? We see this Government straitjacketed and incapable of taking even the most modest steps.

        With some trepidation Senator Button steps out and cautiously suggests that there might be some merit in selling off Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines. One slap from the Left and he scurries back into his little hole. One has only to look at the uranium debate that is going on in this country. There is $70 billion worth of identified resources in the Kakadu region, yet this Government is not even prepared to look at the matter. It finds itself straitjacketed by the rigidity of its ideological pursuits. When it comes to reforms of the waterfront and coastal shipping, is the Government going to be any more brave, courageous, committed or able to undertake the fundamental reforms that are necessary? Of course it will not. At the end of the day it opts out of all the important and hard decisions in terms of the labor force, restructuring of awards, cabotage on the coast and shipping transport between New Zealand and Australia. The Government will not touch any of these areas because it has done a deal with the ACTU, as usual. It is like doing a deal with the devil, or perhaps like doing a deal with a tiger. The result is that one just gets eaten last.

        When we look at this report-time will not allow me to pursue it at great length tonight, but I promise there will be another occasion-we find that in terms of job recruitment, job restructuring, work practices, a supplementary work force, enterprise employment and all the fundamental areas that are intrinsic to any basic changes, absolutely nothing is happening. What has been done in relation to trans-Tasman shipping? Nothing. As we all know, at present it is possible for international shippers to ply between Australia and New Zealand. There is nothing to stop them except the thugs-not the tugs-they run into at each end. They will simply say, `We are not going to load you or unload you'. A ship could find itself arriving in a port of Australia with a New Zealand cargo not being able to discharge its cargo because the trade union movement will not allow it to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        One has only to look at some of the fundamental areas that have been detected by the Inter-State Commission on the waterfront. It talks about ineffective management; poor work force training and career arrangements; introspective industrial attitudes; poor response to user needs; poor information flows to users in between links in the transport chain; lack of supply and demand balance, often reflected in congestion and queues or in under-utilisation of expensive facilities; diffusions of government responsibilities; abuse of monopoly power, reflected particularly in port authority pricing and investment policies; and a tendency for matters to improve considerably while they are under investigation-I think it is the sixteenth investigation-only to lapse once the pressure is removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        One has only to look at the costing, manning and pricing of the ports of Australia. Wyndham, in my own State, is a classic example. In the cute little port of Wyndham members of the work force work for an average of 7.4 hours a week. For their trouble they take home $433.96. That is $62 an hour. Into the bargain, if a ship happens to arrive when all these waterside workers are preoccupied with their second full-time jobs elsewhere, there is a strike on and the ship stays tied up to the side, not being loaded or unloaded until such time as the waterside workers are able to discharge their responsibilities elsewhere. One has only to look at the various restrictive work practices where we see a whole range of problems that confront the industry. Labour ordering arrangements, for example, also impose significant costs. Waterside labour in most Australian ports must be ordered by 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. the day before it will be required.

         —Under Telecom's profit and loss account, a profit of $776.2m is shown. There is depreciation for services for life charges of $311m; charges in treatment of expenditure, net reduction in depreciation of $125.2m; stock write-downs of $38.2m and bad debts written off of $59.5m, with a total of $533.9m. If that were added to the previous profit of $776.2m, the aggregate amount would be around $1.3 billion. That is a very healthy profit. I do not deny any organisation the right to make those profits but, having made those profits, Telecom has a responsibility to fulfil its social obligation. I ask the Minister for Community Affairs, Senator Bolkus, who is in the chamber tonight, to take this on board.

        There are still 8,000 people in western Queensland, central Queensland and, I believe, in the north-west of New South Wales, who are either on party lines or who do not have telephones at all. Up to six people use one party line, which is inconvenient, to say the least, for rural producers. As announced in the 1987 May statement, the Government decided that Telecom would pay sales tax and excise tax. Telecom's response was that it would not finish the rural telephone connection service, and that it would extend the time to complete that service by two years. A government instrumentality which is making a profit of $1.3 billion has an obligation to fulfil the telephone needs of rural people. Some rural people who do not have a telephone have been waiting for up to nine years to have one installed. Meanwhile Telecom has chased contracts all over the world. It is ironic that Telecom is putting phones into Saudi Arabia, yet it cannot put phones into rural Australia. That is a dereliction of its obligation. I ask the Minister to take this matter on board and to take it up with Mr Willis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Out of 5,000 services that should have been completed this year, only 3,000 have been completed because of wet weather; of course, Telecom cannot be responsible for that. Mr Duffy and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised that these telephone connections would be made by 1990. However, there are people who are still waiting for telephone services. That date was extended to 1992 because of the lack of funds, according to Telecom. It is a contradiction in terms when a government instrumentality makes $1.3 billion, sets out to win contracts on the world market, for which it should be commended, and agrees to put telephone into Saudi Arabia and Third World countries, yet our rural producers are being treated worse than people in Third World countries. It is a shocking state of affairs. The Government has to address this problem quickly.
       </para>
       <para>
        People have been allocated automatic lines and have been told that they would receive a telephone in the next two years. They are not allowed to put in their own private line. So some of these people have been waiting for four years to obtain a telephone. They are willing to pay for their own telephones, to bring in their own lines, but they are not allowed to do so. Other lines have become so disused and are in such a state of disrepair that it is almost impossible to receive any telephone calls through them. People have been told that they will receive phones `next year' or `the year after' and so it goes on. Some people have been told for nine years that they will get a telephone, yet they have not received a telephone. They are supposed to have the telephones by 1992. People fear now that Telecom will not even meet the 1992 commitment.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, I welcome any reform of government business enterprises. But the Minister cannot be serious about any reform when he is denying 8,000 rural producers in western Queensland and north-western New South Wales a telephone in 1989. I plead with the responsible Minister to do something about this urgently.

       (1) Yes, the ACOA wrote to me on 3 March 1989 expressing such concerns. You incorporated the text of this letter into the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee E on 13 April 1989. The text of my response to Ms Forward, dated 13 April 1989, is as follows;
      </para>
      <para>
       ``Dear Ms Forward
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to your letter of 3 March 1989 concerning the establishment of ATSIC.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Chairman of the ATSIC Task Force has written to you and other unions with information about the Government's decisions on ATSIC. As indicated in that information the Government will be proceeding with an amended ATSIC Bill, with ATSIC commencing on an interim basis on 1 October 1989, subject to passage of the Bill through Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that there will be a meeting later this month between members of the ATSIC Task Force and relevant union representatives, and that the Government's announcements will be discussed then.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to your comments on the operations of the ADC and the Department I am aware of the effect of the delays in the commencement of ATSIC on the morale of staff. As you know, these delays have not been of the Government's making and I hope that the current timetable will be achieved. At the same time I believe that both the Department and the ADC are doing all that is possible to continue to operate normally in difficult circumstances. I appreciate your concern to ensure that the interests of your members are protected and their morale maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       The announcements made by myself and the Prime Minister concerning the reports of investigations into the Portfolio bodies and the direction the government now wishes to follow with respect to ATSIC are key announcements. I felt it best to delay my reply to your letter until these announcements were made because of their relevance to your concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       If you agree, I would be happy to make this correspondence public.

        —The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Patents Act 1952 specifies the criteria by which all patent applications are examined prior to the granting of a patent. Thus the premise upon which the granting of patent No. 511.711 was based is that the application was considered by the Patent Office to have met these criteria. In very general terms the conditions specified by the Act are that the invention is fully described, including the best method of performance known to the applicant; that the invention claimed is new; and that the subject matter is suitable to be patented.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commissioner of Patents has informed me that the invention relates to excavating teeth for use in machines such as front end loaders, mining equipment and the like and that the claims of this patent do not define a ratio itself, but rather a device characterised by certain components having a prescribed dimensional ratio. Although a ratio is not patentable, the fact that a device is distinguished by characteristics which are defined in terms of a ratio is not itself a bar to the granting of a patent.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) The same as with any patent that is granted. The role of the Commissioner is limited to the consideration of particular issues relating to entitlement to a patent and, even in relation to those issues, the Commissioner is under a legal compulsion to grant a patent unless it is clear that the patent would be held invalid. It is not within the role of the Commissioner of Patents to consider the benefits of a particular invention beyond the point at which the entitlement to a patent is established nor any possible disadvantages to the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No. Upon ``acceptance'' of the complete specification prior to the grant of a patent, the Commissioner advertises his acceptance in the Australian Official Journal of Patents and this allows third parties to mount an opposition proceeding before the Commissioner in which the third parties may raise a range of issues bearing on the entitlement to a patent. Further, there are provisions for the revocation of patents by the courts on the grounds of invalidity at the suit of third parties. Invalidity of the patent is also a defence to a legal action for infringement.
