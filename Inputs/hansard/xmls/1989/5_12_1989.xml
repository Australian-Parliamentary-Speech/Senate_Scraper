       X-rated and Violent Video Material

       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Petition of citizens of Australia points out:
      </para>
      <para>
       that all State Governments, State Attorneys-General, most womens' groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported.
      </para>
      <para>
       that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the A.C.T. Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material.
      </para>
      <para>
       that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children, and families of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia.

      <para>
       2. Exclude from the `R'-rated all gratuitously violent material.

      <para>
       To the President and the members of the Senate. We the undersigned oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act. We believe there should not be two levels of Medicare rebates for general practice. We also believe there should be upgraded undergraduate training and postgraduate training for general practitioners to obtain appropriate skills. Current and proposed Medicare rebates for general practitioner services are inadequate, and there should be appropriate Medicare rebates for doctors who provide out of hours consultations.

       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

       Australian National Botanic Gardens, Education Unit: Funding

       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's decision to abolish the Education Unit of the National Botanic Gardens is a betrayal of the Federal Government's professed commitment to conservation, protection and management of Australia's unique flora. The Education Unit fulfilled an important role in increasing the knowledge, appreciation and enjoyment of Australia's plant heritage of visitors to the National Botanic Gardens, including many school children.

It is not something on which I have a detailed grasp, but I understand that the Bill was intended to allow some pharmacists to be on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, something that has been subject to ongoing discussion and hence not possible to put through the House of Representatives at the time. Other than that, I am not terribly familiar with the reasons but I take it that it is a question of timing. It is up to this chamber, I guess, as to whether it wants to overrule that cut-off date.

         —by leave-The Opposition supports Senator Ray's motion in regard to this matter. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a Bill introduced for the purposes of altering the composition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT). As honourable senators will know, the ongoing debate about the sustaining or otherwise of the PBRT's latest determination about pharmacy remuneration is to come back before the Senate some time in the next couple of days. We received a message from the House of Representatives yesterday indicating that the House of Representatives is seeking to insist on having the Bill in its original form and again disagreeing with the amendments made by the Senate. When that comes forward, I will, on behalf of the Opposition, be pressing the continuation of the Senate's position on the matter and sending back to the House of Representatives, I trust, the Bill, formally overturning the PBRT decision.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If that occurs, because the first Bill, the National Health Amendment Bill, also contains a 1 January starting date for the new, maximum dispensing fee, to move from $11 to $12, the House, when it returns on 21 or 22 December, will be required essentially to accept the Senate's amendment striking down the PBRT determination without qualification and accept what the Senate wishes to do if the House and the Government wish to have the 1 January starting date for the new pharmacy fees. If that is the case, then the PBRT will have to look at the matter again.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) reconstitutes the PBRT in a particular fashion to give representation on that body to a representative of the pharmacy profession. At the moment the membership comprises a Deputy President of the Industrial Relations Commission and two other members. If we were to pass the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) and at the same time maintain our position of striking down the original PBRT determination, then the new body to make the pharmacy determination would be a PBRT reconstituted in a way which gives representation to the pharmacy profession in a more adequate fashion than has been the case in the past. Because we believe that this a sensible way to proceed we are intending to support the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. We will therefore support Senator Ray's motion today to allow that matter to be dealt with in the course of this particular session under the new structure, which we regard as marginally more satisfactory, rather than have the Tribunal set the new pharmacy fees under its old structure, which we regard as unsatisfactory.

        I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.
       </para>
       <para>
        Leave granted.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before the Senate, amends the National Health Act 1953 as it relates to the membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. It increases to four the additional members that can be appointed to the Tribunal by the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        As was agreed the Bill makes provision for one of the additional members to have had experience in community pharmacy. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) has stated that this person will only be appointed after consultation with key organisations representing pharmacy, including of course, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments do not in any way reflect upon the present membership of the Tribunal or the decisions made by those persons. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the present Tribunal members for their diligence and efforts in what has become a very difficult time and in their handling of a highly technical area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill changes the provisions relating to a quorum of the Tribunal; which will now be the chairperson and at least two additional members. This amendment takes into account the new additional members. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

         —Before the interruption of this debate last night, which took place in order for the chamber to debate its own procedures-I would like to put it on the record that the debate resulted in conscience votes, which are not available to members of the Government and the Opposition on this legislation-we were considering the amendments of the Australian Democrats. We believe that the terminology surrounding the information that needs to be provided should be changed and that the words `information that might be relevant' ought to be changed to `information that is relevant'. Senator Calvert, on behalf of the Opposition, has responded to these amendments by saying that the Opposition opposes welfare fraud. He also said that he did not quite understand what the Democrats' position was. I respond to that by saying that we also oppose welfare fraud, but we do not take the view that everybody on welfare is fraudulent and defrauding the system. We also oppose tax fraud, of course-fraud in all its forms-but we do not assume that fraud on behalf of all welfare recipients. One of our major concerns with this, and many other aspects of the social security legislation, particularly in recent times, is that the assumption of fraudulent approach is made so often.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Calvert also said that the Opposition was not supporting this series of Australian Democrat amendments relating to the assessment of de facto relationships because the Opposition accepts the Government's position that we must not disadvantage people who are married by comparison with those who are unmarried. I want to reiterate the points I made in my speech on the second reading for which I used Alison McClelland's paper for the Australian Council of Social Service about the value of parenting. I am very much afraid, and this is the reason for the amendments in this section, that we are in fact discriminating between different kinds of parents.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exhortation for us to continue to value parenting in our community needs to be put again and again, in particular in relation to that group of parents who are performing that task on their own without a partner. The majority of that group are women. We believe that support for parenting as a valuable contribution, socially and economically, in our community is at risk. If we accept some kind of economic argument that we can save money by making sure that people do not get on to benefits of one kind or another, if we allow one group of parents to be discriminated against, the whole concept of support for parenting is at risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate the point I made: if we are talking about the difference between married couples and unmarried people, there is no expectation in our community, as Alison McClelland has said, that in two-parent families both parents should work. There is no expectation of that kind at all. The fact is that in many families both parents work but it is not part of our total community expectation. Increasingly-in this piece of legislation specifically-we come to the position that for a sole parent the goal must be that that person goes to work. That expectation is put on that group of parents. To our minds, and I would be interested to hear Senator Calvert's response, that actually discriminates very markedly against that group of parents vis-a-vis the other group of parents who are parenting jointly rather than singly.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are amongst the reasons why we have moved this group of amendments and other amendments in this section of the legislation. We do not accept the basic premise that fraud is what is in the minds of people who are on benefits and that therefore we must have draconian legislation which ensures that the tax dollar is not misused or abused. In fact, those people who do qualify for benefits, either before this legislation is passed or again afterwards, have to meet a most stringent set of requirements. The benefits they receive are really very much at subsistence level.
       </para>

        The issue of fraud is a major feature in this part of the legislation. I think it is very important to note, particularly in the context of these amendments, that, as the Government's amendment stands, the discretionary clause refers to `information that might be relevant'. When one is talking about information that might be relevant in the context of applicants being seen as potentially fraudulent, we think it is important that the clause be changed to refer to `information that is relevant'. The vast majority of people who are making these applications are not, in our view, wanting to rip off the system and intending to be fraudulent. Some of them may be people who are needing to be fraudulent, and that is perhaps another issue. People on sole parent benefits are being gaoled as a result of a range of circumstances which have meant that they have been overpaid; they have needed extra money above the benefits they have been able to get under our system.

       <para>
        I want to point to some examples of the sorts of people we are talking about. I have taken these examples from the book by Jenny Trethewey called Aussie Battlers. I mention three people who have made application for this very benefit and who, we are afraid, if these words are not changed, in the circumstances of this legislation may have had some problems in qualifying. These examples demonstrate the sorts of people we are dealing with in these amendments. For one thing there is this myth that women applying for the sole parent pension are doing it to get on some sort of gravy train-young girls who have got themselves pregnant in order to get on to the Government payroll. Lyn Thomas is one of the people in Jenny Trethewey's book. By the way, this book is based on a study where families were looked at for a whole year, kept a diary for two weeks of every month, and were interviewed monthly by the researchers. Lyn Thomas's marriage broke up in 1985, and she says:
       </para>
       <para>
        My husband was a foolish spender and ran up debts. The electricity and phone were cut off when he didn't pay the bills. I am relieved to be in control.
       </para>
       <para>
        Her weekly income was 67c below the poverty line. I note that this research study was done before the introduction of the family package, but she is the sort of person who has not been benefited to the extent of many other families under that package. She had to rely on family and friends to give gifts of money and clothes and to take the children for holidays because she could not afford it on her own income. She had left school early and so decided to go back to study but had enormous problems both with transport and with trying to pay for books for study. As the study progressed through the year it was apparent that friends and family gave gifts of money and clothes so that the children could have a better life than they would have on the benefit she was able to qualify for. She was paying a very high level of rent-between a quarter and a half of her income-and she could not get a housing ministry house. She did get an interview and was put on a two-year waiting list.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point I want to make about this woman relates to her attempt to get herself into the work force. She did not need the sort of direction of policy that is being put forward by the Government and the Opposition. As I pointed out in my speech on the second reading, there is a strong self-motivation which results in sole parents being on the benefit for an average of only some 15 or 16 months. This is her final comment in the study:
       </para>
       <para>
        I think staying at home with the children is important. They need me, but in five years time I hope to have nearly finished uni and to be on my way to a successful career.
       </para>
       <para>
        Her children were aged four years and two years at the time of the study. Her hope was that her time of dependence would be short.
       </para>
       <para>
        That story is repeated in one way or another throughout this book. Jenny Lloyd is another woman who left her marriage because it was a financial disaster, with her husband gambling, drinking and never paying the bills. The marriage ended in anger and violence. Again, this woman said that she felt well off on a pension which in fact began with her being $26 below the poverty line. She also began to study, at the same time not being able to afford new summer clothes or shoes for her children and wishing that she could have one night a week free, having no-one else to share the parenting, and being grateful that her children were young enough not to notice that their clothes came from the opportunity shop. Her children were aged six years, four years and two years. They did have a ministry of housing house, which was helpful, but because of the location of the home she had high transport costs. She needed a car, but when she used it, she had trouble buying the petrol. Her final comments in this study are:
       </para>
       <para>
        The children need me at home but I'd like a part time job because I'd feel better if I contributed some money myself rather than having it given to me.
       </para>
       <para>
        The book goes on to say that she felt pessimistic about her job prospects. She says:
       </para>
       <para>
        I've been out of the work force for so long and I have children. I doubt if they'll give me a job because I have kids, the same as when you're looking for a house.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are just two of the stories in this book. We believe in moving these amendments and proposing to move further amendments that it is important to look at the reality of the lives of the vast majority of people who are making these applications and who are having to provide information. In the case of applications for the sole parent pension, under the criteria for determining de facto relationships in this legislation, we believe that much of the information which will have to be provided-let us not forget that the trigger here is for an applicant to have resided in a shared residence with a person of the opposite sex for a period longer than eight weeks and that information on a number of other criteria has to be delivered-will relate to people with whom the applicant does not have a particularly intimate relationship. To us the 14 days clause is not appropriate in that context. It could very well take considerably longer than 14 days for information to be provided about people with whom one does not have a particularly intimate relationship and, there, a call on that sort of information. So these three amendments take into account all those background aspects.

        In commenting on the remarks of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) last thing in this debate last night, we say that, while similar provisions to what the Government proposes in this Bill may exist in other contexts in social security legislation, we do not believe that they are appropriate in this case.

       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment relates to one of the aspects of this legislation which has been commented on by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which is of particular concern to us. Clause 28, proposed new paragraph 43a (4) (b) states that, when a determination is made and `information is not given to the Secretary within 14 days after the notice is given, the claim will be taken not to have been lodged'. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee said that it believed that deeming an application that has been submitted as not having been lodged is likely to make it more difficult for applicants to obtain benefits. We are concerned about this terminology particularly from the point of view of the right of appeal for those people who have lodged applications but have been deemed not to have lodged them. It is a question of when an application is not an application.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are proposing that the words `the claim will be taken not to have been lodged' be replaced by the words `the claim may be rejected'. A rejection of the claim triggers the appeal procedures in the normal course of events. It seems to us totally unfair and quite anomalous to deem something not to have happened when it has happened. If an application has been made, an application has been made. We believe that this terminology, as it stands in the Bill, not only puts at risk appeal rights but also the opportunity for the payment of arrears under the current social security system where, once an appeal is successful, arrears are paid to the time when the application was lodged. If the application is deemed not to have been lodged we cannot see how there could be some right of appeal. The Minister might try in some way or the other to persuade us that there is, but what then is the situation in regard to the payment of arrears? We feel that it would be just to change these words so that if the application is deemed to be not appropriate, if the right information has not been given within 14 days, as this clause states, the Department simply rejects the claim rather than saying that the claim has never been made.

         —The Government does not accept the amendment. We ask the Committee to recognise that we are talking about an overall process which allows two contacts. At the first contact further information which is required from the applicant for a pension is requested, and at the second interview the applicant has to provide that information. We have not adopted the approach that has been suggested by Senator Powell because situations arise where a person who chooses not to provide that information, having had his claim rejected, can provide information at a subsequent Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) hearing. Obviously, we would rather have all the information made available at the time of the first consideration of the application for pension. The mechanism that we have chosen is more appropriate to attain that objective. I also ask Senator Powell and the Committee to recognise that the normal appeal mechanisms through the SSAT and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are available if a person wants to have reviewed the decision that he or she has failed to provide information as required. We maintain that there are sufficient protections in the system but, at the same time, we need to have in place sufficient incentive to ensure that all the information is provided at the appropriate time.

         —I am concerned about the constant reference to the rights of appeal in respect of a claimant who is deemed to have failed to have provided information. The failure to pass our previous amendments means that that information is information that might be relevant as determined by the Secretary or the Secretary's delegate. This clause does not talk about failure to provide information. It says that if the information is not given to the Secretary within 14 days after the notice has been given, the claim will be deemed not to have been lodged. I am at a loss to know how a claimant can appeal on the basis of a claim which the Department will say has not been lodged. That is the problem that I have. I do know that a claimant could appeal if that person had a claim rejected. That is why we want the words changed. This clause does not talk about the claim not being approved because of a failure to provide information. The Minister may need to direct me somewhere else. I thought I had looked fairly closely at this. But that is a major concern of ours, together with the consequent concern about how, if there is a right of appeal-and the Minister is trying to persuade me that there is-any payment in arrears would be affected by the terminology of this legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Before the Minister informs me about that matter, I want to make it clear why I am particularly concerned. We are told that this bit of legislation means that everything can be administered clearly and cleanly, that there will not be any snooping and that there will be much less intrusion into the privacy of sole parents who may be living in joint arrangements with members of the opposite sex. Yet, we also know that a system is operating whereby one can phone the local Department office, or any Department office, and say, `I live next door to Mary Smith. I think she is shacked up with this fellow. She is his de facto and I know that she gets the benefit. I think you ought to check her out'. If it is established that this person has in fact had a continuous period of shared residence for eight weeks-we have been through that matter already-a whole series of information has to be provided. As Senator Bolkus has said, there are two stages of contact. It is quite disturbing to be dealing with what is landmark legislation-this is the first time that a definition of a de facto relationship of any form is to be put in a statute-without having seen the forms that people will have to fill out. I have a couple of things that have fallen off the back of a truck. Clearly, some of the forms that I have seen are pretty outdated and have had bits crossed out and so on. But we, the legislators, have not had the benefit of seeing what it is that these people are actually going to have to fill out.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have here the broad terms of the information. A form has to be filled out about things such as the nature of the relationship with friends and regular associates. This is going to enable the Department to make an assessment. This is set out at the beginning of clause 25. People are going to have to fill out forms. We have not seen those forms, so we are very much at the Minister's mercy when he says that it will be all right. In the context of having to satisfy the Secretary at all stages of this process, let us assume that a Department office receives information by phone, not from the applicant but anonymously from someone out in the wider community. The clause provides that the Secretary or the Secretary's delegate, the person in the office who is making the decision, has to be satisfied.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that under this clause the person responsible for making this decision can remain unsatisfied even if all the forms-forms which I have not seen yet-have been filled out. The people I have spoken to who are likely to be assisting people to fill out those forms also have not seen them yet. Maybe one or two people have seen them, but certainly the forms have not been broadly seen. People filling in those forms could be unaware that informal information causes the person making this decision in the Department not to be satisfied and, therefore, to deem that application not to have been lodged. That process could go on and on until the applicant says, `This is all too much trouble, I will not apply for the sole parent benefit'. Frankly, I think that sort of outcome would be a disaster and totally unjust. It is really for that reason that we want the decision makers, acting on behalf of the Secretary of the Department, not to say that the application has not been made if they reject it because they are not satisfied.

The decision that is not subject to appeal is that the person sitting behind the desk at the Department of Social Security is not satisfied with the case that the applicant puts to him. As I say, that is the trigger decision. If it is proved that the information required has been provided, the claim can be reactivated on the basis of that appeal.

         —The Committee is about to embark upon another subject area in the legislation; that is, evidence and the weight thereof. It appears to me that amendments 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 all go to this particular point; as amendments 17 to 20 go to the point on the review process; and as amendments 21 and 23 go to the question of direct deposits. I suggest, in order that we do not have to go over debate-and I know that in the previous debate Senator Powell was merging from one amendment to another-that we take amendments 11 to 16 together.

        I accept the Minister's view that amendments 11 to 16 can be moved together. As the Minister has said, the bulk of the concern in this group of amendments goes to the question of the weight of evidence, the sort of evidence that is provided and the response to that. These amendments include a particular phrase. In proposed new subsections 43a (6) and 43a (8) we seek to remove the phrase `the weight of evidence' and just have `evidence supports the formation of the opinion'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two previous amendments relate to the question of whether the evidence satisfies the Secretary, or the Secretary's delegate, and all the information is relevant. What we really are concerned with in this group of amendments is that concern which has been broadly expressed about this particular section of the Bill relating to the onus of proof. We accept that this legislation does not literally transfer the onus of proof, in strict legal terms, but, in practice, we contend this is what is really happening by this legislation and, in particular, this clause. There are already many unreasonable, in our view, suspensions and cancellations under the current situation. We believe that these provisions actually make that situation worse. In doing so, they are unreasonably restricting the choices of sole parents in sharing accommodation which might in fact be very much in their interests and, in particular, in the interests of their children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The change, we believe, puts the claimant on the back foot rather than it being the case that it is the Department which has to show that the person is in fact not complying with the necessary provisions. I will add that the proposed new subsection (6), referred to in amendment 13, is a particularly convoluted piece of drafting with a triple negative in it on which again the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills commented. I think the comment made at that point was that this proposed section could be more clearly expressed. I thought that was a fairly gentle conclusion of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The clause certainly is not clearly expressed and yet it is the key clause in the whole of this section of the legislation because it says that the Secretary must form an opinion. It is the determinative clause.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that that opinion should be formed on the evidence as it is brought forward although we have expressed concern about how the applicant will satisfy the Department that the evidence really provides the appropriate information, particularly against the background of the existence of the point of view that sole parents who share accommodation are trying to rip off the system and are not deserving of support via taxpayers' funds. Therefore, there are situations in which they may find it very difficult to satisfy the requirements, particularly, as I said, if some counter-information comes into the Department office which they might want to challenge. They may find it very difficult to do so under the terms that are written into this legislation.

         —The Opposition will not be supporting Australian Democrat amendments Nos 11 to 16. Amendments Nos 11 and 12 refer to the procedures involved in making the actual claim and the provision of information required. We believe that it is necessary for the Secretary to have the information required to make the informed decision. Thus the following amendments, which would take away the provisions that set down some of the things that the Secretary must take into consideration, do not help the functioning of the Bill. Accordingly, we will not be supporting those.

        There is also the question of the balance of probabilities versus the so-called onus of proof argument. Senator Powell acknowledged that the question of onus of proof is not the correct term; it is a balance of probabilities. That flows because we are dealing with a benefit and not a right. We are dealing with the conferring of a benefit for which an applicant has made application. Amendment Nos 15 and 16 which the Democrats have moved refer to the way in which information is supplied. We believe that the requirements for the provision of information in the Bill as it stands are acceptable. Accordingly, we will not be supporting any of the amendments.

         —The Government will also oppose the Australian Democrats amendments. In effect, the structure that the Bill embodies would be damaged by the amendments moved by Senator Powell. The objective is to ensure a situation where a claimant or pensioner must establish ongoing eligibility in the same way as other social security clients-unemployment beneficiaries or others. In effect we would have here a major detraction from the Bill, and probably some unforseen consequences, if we were to adopt the amendments suggested by Senator Powell. For instance, the Department might have information casting doubts on the veracity of information given to it by the claimant but would have the obligation to make a decision on the basis of what it is told by the claimant if amendment Nos. 11 and 12 were adopted. We also need to acknowledge the importance of the interview being held with the delegate of the Secretary to discuss with the claimant information in the notice. The relevance of that information is also excluded by amendment Nos 11 and 12.

        In relation to the weight of evidence argument, I think it is fair to say that any assessment needs to be made on the weight of evidence rather than, as suggested, on whether any evidence at all supports a particular conclusion. One can always find evidence to support a particular conclusion but the appropriate degree of proof required in this area is essentially the civil standard-that is, the weight of evidence, balance of probabilities or preponderance of evidence. Where all the relevant evidence is available the decision will be taken on the weight of that evidence. As Senator Bishop mentioned, that principle is consistent with other areas of law and is the most appropriate principle on which to make a decision based on all the evidence available.

         —In the absence of detailed information about the sorts of forms which sole parents who share accommodation fill out in the two-stage process and in the knowledge, as the Minister said earlier, that an applicant will have to rely upon the process for appeal rights in certain circumstances, could the Minister give us some information about the approach taken to any information that comes from people other than the applicant-in particular, as I have referred to before, information about the applicant and his or her lifestyle and living arrangements from anonymous sources? In particular, can the Minister confirm that information is taken from anonymous sources? If so, is that anonymous information then conveyed to the applicant? If so, in what way is that conveyed and how is it followed up with the applicant? Is there a place on the form for this to be dealt with or is it just dealt with verbally?

         —Senator Powell has asked four questions. In relation to whether information can be received from anonymous persons, the answer is yes. That information is conveyed to the applicant and the normal way of doing so is in person at the time of interview. In terms of how the applicant would fare at later stages, it is quite apparent that proceedings at later stages go to merits of cases and any information that is provided has to stand up and be tested at those stages. The Government recognises its responsibility. The applicant has a right to know of the information and to have it discussed with him. Obviously one would not make decisions on the basis of spurious anonymous correspondence or other information that might be received. That information has to be tested and the process allows for sufficient oversight to protect the applicant's rights against excessiveness either by vindictive anonymous people or by the bureaucracy.

         —In that process is documentation available for the applicant to use at a later stage if he or she needs or wants to go to an appeal process? I ask that because concerns have been expressed to me about this kind of process as it exists currently. There will be a whole series of indicators regarding the nature of people's commitment to each other, including the length of the relationship and the nature of any companionship and emotional support provided by people to each other, not to mention the sexual relationship which is also referred to in proposed section 3a, the question of assessment of friends and regular associates, what sort of arrangements are made for joint social activities, and so on. We are told that the administration of this whole process relies on two separate stages and documentation. When a further source of information intrudes on, and is being dealt with in, that process between the Department and the applicant, does the applicant have that particular information documented? Is there any documentation of the approach taken to that information for the decision making process by the delegate Secretary?

         —I would prefer to deal expeditiously with amendments 17 and 18 and then to take the others together. The substance of the amendments, particularly of No. 17, relates to the Secretary having to give a reminder notice if information required is not provided within 14 days. I am moving this amendment because earlier in the Bill, in proposed subsection 9, existing pensioners are given a reminder notice. This clause relates to new applicants in the same situation, and we can see no reason whatsoever why new claimants should not receive a reminder notice in the same way as pensioners currently do. That is the substance of amendment No. 17.

       <para>
        Amendment No. 18 simply takes that a stage further and goes back to the point that we were making before about whether a claim can be deemed not to have been lodged. In other words, we want to change the words in the Bill, as we did previously, so that once the reminder notice has been given and that time has expired, the claim should be seen as rejected rather than as not having been lodged. That is the substance of those two amendments. We cannot see why a new claimant, in particular, should not be provided with a reminder notice after 14 days in the same way as an existing pensioner is.

         —The Government also opposes these amendments. We do not think it is appropriate that in all circumstances there be a requirement for such a notice. The arrangement will be that where those applicants have made arrangements for an interview, if they do not respond in the time as arranged they will be followed up. But there are categories of people who may decide that they are not eligible or who may reconsider for other reasons-reconciliation for instance. In two of the categories that I have mentioned, the requirement for a reminder notice would be totally inappropriate. Given that there will be procedures in place to ensure follow-up where appointments are not met, I am sure that Senator Powell's concerns can be met without having a rigid system which may not be appropriate in all the circumstances.

         —I made a comment, I think when speaking in the second reading debate, and possibly also during the committee stage, that one of the concerns of the Australian Democrats about this legislation and other legislation passed in recent years-perhaps most graphically the abolition of the class B widow's pension-is the position in which sole parents are being placed. There is a very obvious change in approach-`Let us be as stringent as we possibly can and limit to the nth degree the number of people who are taking a sole parent pension'. In our view, this has far too little to do with whether these people really need support on the basis that they are parents and that they are bringing up children. As a group, they do not stay on this benefit for very long. They tend to want to get into the paid work force; they want to be independent; and they are building their own future. They simply need community support for a time, not because they want to be on the gravy train but because they have often had considerable problems in the relationship from which the children sprang, whether the relationship was a formal marriage or not. I have already given some examples, and I could give plenty of others of where that has happened.

       <para>
        I was particularly disturbed by one of the reasons which the Minister for Consumer Affairs gave for not supporting our amendment in which we propose that for new applicants a rigid system should be in place. We are not particularly concerned about the rigidity of the system, in this case, but we are concerned that they get a reminder notice. The Minister said that one of the reasons for not setting this in place is that many people might reconsider or not proceed with their application. In our view, that is precisely what the Government hopes will happen, and regrettably that is precisely what will happen time and again under this legislation. The process is intimidating. It is there to discourage people from applying for a benefit which ought to be seen, contrary to Senator Bishop's comments on behalf of the Opposition, as something which the community provides as a natural support for those who may need it for a while.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process should not be some kind of exercise in which applicants have to go through hoops backwards and all sorts of convolutions in order to prove that they are not going to rip off the system for the 15 or 16 months that they might be receiving this benefit. I am very disturbed that one of the reasons for rejecting this amendment might be a hope that people would reconsider their application once they have been through that part of the process which puts before them a whole lot of questions about the sorts of relationships they have with all the people they are living with who happen to be members of the opposite sex. They might find this information quite difficult to provide in that 14-day period. Questions about the sort of shared living arrangements of people living on incomes below the poverty line are put before the applicants. Women who are looking after their children on their own who have to make all the family decisions, and who have these responsibilities while living on a subsistence level of finance, have to provide answers to questions of this nature. They must provide answers about the relationships that they have with the people with whom they are living, about what they think the state of the relationship will be in 12 months time, about how they distribute the housework, about how they share day to day household expenses, and so on. For some people, it could easily take 14 days before they could answer this range of questions. Many people would be seeking advice from community groups in this process. A range of community groups, themselves very strapped for resources, are not necessarily able to jump through these hoops with the applicants in a very short space of time because they do not have the resources and the personnel to cope.
       </para>
       <para>
        The intimidatory nature of that process ought to be taken into account, particularly for new applicants. One of the women described in Jenny Trethewey's book had just left a violent situation which eventuated in her losing the sight in one eye. Having left her domestic situation and made joint living arrangements, the woman is faced with this process and does not get her answers back in 14 days. We say that she should get an automatic reminder notice, in the same way as do existing pensioners. She is not accustomed to dealing with the Department of Social Security. She may be quite intimidated by that in itself. She may be unsure of whether she should or should not apply for this benefit. She probably does not want to in the first place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, I refer to the case histories in this book where all the women expressed the desire to be financially independent. It is not a desire to rip off the system or the taxpayer. That is demonstrated by the statistics which show that women do not stay on these benefits for very long. Women with younger children are paid the benefit in larger numbers. Fourteen days is not a long time for that sort of person. If a woman is to reconsider her situation, that is all the more reason to give her an automatic reminder notice so that her reconsideration might be in the context of another chance to provide that information and to receive financial support instead of the situation being reversed, which seems to me to be the obvious desire of this clause of the legislation.

        In amendment 19 the Australian Democrats seek to change a number of words in paragraph 43a (14) (b) of clause 28. I summarise by saying that we are concerned that the subsection as set out in the legislation is likely to set off a routine procedure of the Department sending out notices under the earlier clauses of the legislation requiring the pensioner to provide information to show that he or she is not in a de facto relationship on a regular 12-week basis. We would find it grossly unfair and intrusive were that group of pensioners to have to justify their position on a pension on such a constant basis. There are sickness benefits and invalid pensions for which recipients have a set of regular requirements to meet because eligibility for those pensions is based on diagnosis of the health and physical capacity of those pensioners and beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        We see no reason why we should run the risk in legislation of having that kind of regular intrusion into people's lives in the case of the sole parent pension. Our proposed amendment would require the Secretary to the Department to have good cause before deciding to send out another notice within 12 weeks. Subparagraph (c) in the amendment would make a routine review permissible every year. We do not see an annual routine review as a problem. We simply would not want to see a review for this particular group on a quarterly basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment 20 is quite long because it includes a number of consequential paragraphs. The effect of the amendment is to require continuation of payment where a review under section 43a (5) or (7) of a decision is sought within 14 days. A general discretion to continue payment applies currently when a review of any adverse decision is sought within three months. We welcome that. But we think that the general discretion should continue to apply to all adverse decisions, including those made under section 43a. Further, we feel that, because there are so many situations within which a pensioner or claimant could reasonably dispute issues relating to this legislation, it is important that the continuation of payment under the appeal provisions take place as a matter of course. We think that this amendment is particularly important to this part of the legislation which, I remind the chamber, we would prefer not to be dealing with anyway.

         —Again, the Opposition will not be supporting these Democrat amendments. Specifically, as regards amendment 19, we believe that the 12-week period specified in the Bill is adequate. I stress that the Opposition has said that it will monitor the operation and administration of the Bill with a view to taking any action in government that is seen to be necessary. Amendment 20, which is more complicated, deals basically with a guaranteed payment being provided for a sole parent. This is treating a sole parent differently from other pensioners, if you like, and giving him or her an additional benefit. For other pensioners the benefit is paid at the discretion of the Department. We could say that all pensioners should be treated on a level playing field, because of the circumstances, we support the provision that is set out in the Bill in this instance.

         —I have seen some ridiculous and ludicrous amendments moved in this place, but these amendments top them all. Despite the honest intention of Senator Powell, amendments 19 and 20 would, in essence, make the whole system laughable. We have to take the Australian Democrats seriously on this matter. To that extent, at the end of the day they will probably wish that we had not. The effect of amendments 19, if adopted, would be that if a claimant's domestic circumstances were reviewed and she or he were found to be eligible, and then married the next day or a week later, she or he could continue to receive a sole parent pension for 12 weeks. That is the strict effect of the amendment that the Democrats are asking us to adopt.

        Further, under a program where most pensioners receive a pension for less than 16 months-half of those who go off a pension do so because of reconciliation or repartnering-pensioners could be reviewed or asked to consider their relationship only once a year. Now, I think I know Senator Powell. I am quite sure, as she is a reasonable person, that that is not her intention. But there is a responsibility on us all when we consider legislation to be sure that what we are putting up makes sense.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of amendment 20, let us recognise that the Government has come a long way. At the moment a discretionary power is in place that would allow the granting of a benefit. That power has hardly ever been used. We have said that it would be mandatory on appeal of the actual decision as to whether that benefit should be paid for continuation of payment. Senator Powell is asking us to grant mandatory continuation of payment pending review or appeal of any procedural matter, such as the provision of information, for instance. Senator Powell is asking us to open up the system totally and to encourage appeals on preliminary procedural matters rather than to preserve the integrity of the system. I have just spelt out the direct effect of amendments 19 and 20. It does not fit with the rhetoric that Senator Powell has put up. I am sure, given the effect of these amendments, that they would not fit into any responsible legislation in any parliament.

         —I am still concerned about the thinking process behind the Government's amendment, which we in turn are seeking to amend. The Minister for Consumer Affairs mentioned, for instance, a pensioner who might be perfectly qualified for the pension on one day, is married on the next and is then able, under this amendment, to continue to receive the benefit for the next 12 weeks. That assumes that that person will not take herself off the benefit. Marrying, repartnering, or going into a long-term supportive relationship is a decision that people make. But the Minister is suggesting that where couples make this decision, the pensioner involved will not take herself off the pension. Our amendment does not prevent that pensioner from providing the information which we contend that most would provide. Again, this is the sort of provision which assumes that everybody who is on the pension is ripping off the system; therefore, we have to put everybody on it through the 12-week treadmill just in case Senator Bolkus's pensioner example occurs time and time again-just in case people get married or form a genuine stable de facto relationship the day after the beginning of the 12-week period. It is that view of the approach of women, in particular, receiving a sole parent pension which is revealed by the Government's attitude to our amendment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I can understand that some of the strongest words in this debate have come from Senator Bolkus on these amendments, because they are amendments which are based on an assumption that the people who, having gone through the process to this point, are receiving the pension and are entitled to it, not the assumption, which is coming from both sides of the chamber, that if women are on the pension they are probably ripping off the system so we had better set these automatic mechanisms in place to make sure that we are on their heels the whole time and make sure they do not shack up with someone and get that person to support them, and so rip off the taxpayers. These are the taxpayers at the top end of the scale who are having their tax rates decreased, and many of them at the executive level are getting vast salary increases. The motivation of these beneficiaries as we have seen, is that they want to use what the community provides-and increasingly less-by virtue of this and other legislation so they can parent their children, albeit on their own, for the necessary period of time while they, as many of them do, educate themselves and often relocate or repartner themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred to some of the case studies in Jenny Treathewey's Aussie Battlers. This particular comment made by the Minister moves me to talk about Tania Parry who was keen to establish her independence when she left her marriage. She had no money in that marriage and the husband provided no money for clothes for the children and so on. She felt she was better off when she left the marriage even though, as with many others in these case studies, her income was quite minimal. She got some maintenance from her former husband on a sporadic basis, but this was before the child support scheme, which has been a major contributor in these situations where the former spouse can be found but has no money. In the case of Tania Parry, amongst the support group around her-a support group which, as I outlined before in some of the other cases, includes friends, parents, grandparents, and family generally-is a person referred to in this case study as Tania's boyfriend who helped with the amount spent on food by taking the family out to eat for meals. He loaned her $50 in one month in which she was having trouble meeting the rent payments because her small amount of maintenance had not come and, when Tania decided that she must buy a home because she wanted to be in the mainstream of home ownership for her family, he paid a $200 holding fee when she was liaising with the Minister for Housing for a loan. He later lent her $1,500 to cover solicitors' fees. During this process, in the interviews in this case study, Tania makes the point:
       </para>
       <para>
        I don't mind him making it possible for us to get out of the flat a bit. He offered to set us up in a flat. I knocked him back because I won't be beholden to him.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a woman expressing her desire to be independent. The view is expressed in the end of the case study that, having gone through a whole process of purchasing a house, relocating and finding it unsatisfactory and then moving back to the city, she saw that the long-term, future security of her family lay in her finding full-time work and entering into a new relationship with someone who could help her support the family. When I read that, I thought that she had better form that new relationship in under eight weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The whole process of the redevelopment of relationships and repartnering is a very fraught process for those kinds of women in particular, who are bringing up children on their own on very low incomes. It often begins as it did in this case, with the woman actually wishing to establish her own independence. It can be part of the goal for the future, as expressed in this case. Assuming that if that kind of repartnering does take place the Department of Social Security will not be notified is to assume the worst of people who are on sole parent pensions, rather than assuming the best or taking even some kind of average approach to their right and expectation of some kind of financial support from the community as they bring up their children. As far as amendment No. 20 is concerned-and I concede Senator Bolkus's point in part-we are attempting this change because we believe that the process which has been set up to this point in this clause of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 is wrong. It discriminates against sole parent pensioners, or applicants for the sole parent pension. Because of that fact, we are moving an amendment, quite openly, which if passed would actually place those people in a better position with regard to appeal mechanisms. We do that because we believe that by virtue of this legislation and by virtue of the attitude taken towards those people in the community-which is fostered by our political leaders; our Government and our alternative government, regrettably-they need the extra consideration which this amendment would give them. I conclude my remarks on this amendment and on that point by quoting from a paper by a sole parent in which she concludes by saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        These two problems-inadequate levels of basic income support, and traps which lock sole parents into poverty when they undertake paid work-are difficult enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exploitation of these women in the work force is as a result of the whole thrust of the labour market orientation of government policy which is pushing women who are mothers on their own into the work force in a way that does not happen if they have a partner. I have made the point several times that that is difficult enough. I also make the point that most of them wish to be independent, but are conscious of the needs of their children to have a parent there for them. This has been expressed several times in the case studies that I have quoted. This paper goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        When social isolation, and prejudice and antagonism from the community are added to, the lives of sole parents and their children become not only impoverished but alienated. The Government also needs to take action in this third area: instead of following, or even aggravating, negative community attitudes through its policies-

        These amendments relate to the direct payment of social security benefits and pensions into banks. This system was put in place several years ago by the Government. It has been possible-if one can argue the case sufficiently-for a person to have an exemption and receive payments directly, but the vast majority of payments have been paid directly into the banks. There has always been a question mark over whether the Government actually had the power to do this on a compulsory basis. The Government has now decided-or discovered; I am not sure which-that it did not have the legislative base to have been doing this all these years, and this legislation provides that legislative base.
       </para>
       <para>
        We wish to move an amendment to clause 48 in order that this payment might be made compulsorily only if it does not cause financial hardship or detriment to the pensioner or beneficiary. That is the subject of amendment No. 21. During the time these payments have been paid directly into the banks, the banks have engaged in the process of automatic, if you like, garnisheeing of the funds of pensioners and beneficiaries wherever there has been some overpayment and, therefore, some debt owing to the bank as a result of overspending, at least on the surface, by the pensioner or beneficiary. It is the sort of process that takes place in the normal course of events between banks and their customers but one which many of us have been concerned about in regard to pension and benefit payments. We have taken the view that under the Act those payments are absolutely inalienable and, therefore, ought not to be available to banks in order to fix up the arrangement they have between them and their pensioner customers. We have also been concerned that this garnishee approach has been taken without the need for the bank to prove the debt that it says is owed to it by the pensioner or beneficiary and, therefore, to use pension or benefit money for the purposes of balancing its accounts.
       </para>
       <para>
        That leads me to the second of this pair of the amendments, amendment No. 22, which seeks to add a subsection to ensure that a pensioner who wishes to change the nominated account into which his pension is paid must do so within seven days of the next payment being due. We want to put that new subsection into the Bill because one of the defences that pensioners have against a garnishee by their current financial institution is to ensure that their next payment does not go to that institution. We want to ensure that there is no possibility for collusion between the Government and the banks-and, goodness knows, we see enough of that going on around the place. The banks have a very favourable position under this Government. Indeed, they get buckets of money whenever they ask for it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We want to see that the interests of pensioners and beneficiaries in this situation are met, especially as the banks have no responsibility to prove their claim that a debt is owed. This would give the pensioner or beneficiary an opportunity to maintain his or her pension payments while pursuing the matter with the bank. Both of these amendments are put in the context of compulsory payments being made, now with a legislative base, but in the interests of protecting those payments which we think are inalienable anyhow, under the Act.

         —The Opposition will not be supporting amendments Nos 21 and 22 as moved by Senator Powell. The Opposition does not believe that those amendments in any way enhance the Bill. Indeed, some of the arguments that Senator Powell puts forward in support of the amendments stretch credibility somewhat.

         —I would like to set the record straight. We believe that these amendments enhance the legislation in that they would provide discretion in the financial interests of the pensioner with regard to what is a compulsory payment. That compulsory payment has been happening for some time but is being set up here with a legislative base. We are also trying to implement the wishes of pensioners. I do not know about enhancing the Bill-this Bill is not exactly a work of art-but we have certainly moved these amendments in order to enhance the rights of pensioners.

        Before I discuss the substance of these amendments I would like to say that there are a number of aspects of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 which the Australian Democrats are pleased with. Several of those relate to the extension of eligibility for homeless person's allowance, the provisions for payment for the spouses of deceased pensioners and a number of other areas of that nature. This Bill also includes the increased indexation provisions which have been pursued by the Government in the Budget and during this year in general. The earnings credit applies to pensioners, but not to other beneficiaries, and there are a number of other issues that one should note.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, the Democrats have other areas of extreme concern. The first of these is embodied in the first six amendments. They relate to the initial change, and the consequent changes throughout the Bill, to the definition of a dependent child. We are concerned about the exclusion of a child who earns $100 per week from this definition of a dependent child. We are concerned about this because, amongst other things, it is expressed in terms of weekly income. In social security legislation generally, the whole question of assessment of income is fraught legislatively and administratively-particularly administratively. We think that to insert a weekly income figure here will make the situation much worse. In particular, it will make it worse and inappropriate for a particular group of people. The effect of this is that a child who earns $100 a week is now no longer considered to be a dependent child. The consequent effect on the family is that it is now no longer eligible for family allowance payment in respect of that child. The child that we are talking about here is a 15-year-old child who is not a full-time student, because the provision does not relate to full-time students.
       </para>
       <para>
        The removal of eligibility for the family allowance would mean, to a family at the top level of income where eligibility for family allowance applies, a loss of $9 a week if the child has earned $100. Basically, that family is $91 better off. However, again I stress that we are looking at a provision which will definitely affect sole parent families much more significantly than other families. If a 15-year-old child earns $100 at the award rate of $3.38 an hour, that child has to have worked 33 hours in the week to earn $100. If that child resides in a single parent household, $65 goes from that household's income. In other words, that 15-year-old child is working a minimum of 33 hours a week for $35.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government says that this provision will save $11m in a year. I point out to the Committee that that $11m will come from households comprising a single mother and a child of 15 who is working for 33 hours a week in order to earn $100, and $65 is going into that household from the child working to substitute for the $65 which was previously going to that household from payment of the pension and various other allowances such as mother's guardians allowance and the child payment rent allowance. We have used the figure of a pensioner who is eligible for full rent allowance in determining our figures in this instance. That is the case with a family on maximum benefit income. Another $20 could be taken off that figure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Low income working families, on our calculations, would suffer a loss of some $43; so a child from that family would be working a 33 hour week for $57. This does not leave us with a very nice taste in our mouths. It might be nice for the Government and the Opposition to say in the next election campaign, `We have cut welfare to the bone'. We know the Government has cut welfare to the bone. It is putting out less in welfare payments than the Fraser Government did. We know that it has targeted particular areas and there are poverty traps as a consequence.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is really important to us that we do not save taxpayers' money in this way, by having a 15-year-old child going out to work for 33 hours a week, actually receiving $35, in his or her hand and the remainder going to compensate for the payments that are lost. The other consequence of course is that another woman is not receiving a sole parent's pension and is not getting a payment for being a parent-something that we are supposed to value. The Government and the Opposition will be saying during the election campaign, `Motherhood, motherhood, motherhood' unfortunately much more than they will say, `Parenthood, parenthood, parenthood'. They will say that they believe in parenting, that it is good and that the institution of the family is wonderful. But it has got to be the right kind of family, otherwise if a 15-year-old child goes out to work and brings in $100 the sole parent will go onto the unemployment benefit. The mother will go into that wonderful labour market which is problematic for women, particularly women of the age that a woman with a 15-year-old child would be. Look out if she happens to live in the country, her child is earning money by fruit picking and there is no job there for her. The Democrats believe that this has a very Dickensian flavour. We are not happy about saving the taxpayers' money if a 15-year-old child has to go out to work for 33 hours a week for a net gain in the household of $35 between that child and its mother.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hence we move this series of amendments. We do not see how this legislation fits with the social justice approach proposed by the Government or with the family support approach proposed by the Opposition. All our amendments ask is that we put an annual figure into the legislation. We accept that if a child goes out to work full time we are not sure what the figure is. Because it is a weekly figure we do not know whether we are talking about full-time employment. We want to put an annual figure into the legislation to ensure that at least the current administration of income testing which applies in the social security system can be applied here also. We would prefer not to see it happen at all because it impacts on a very small number of people. It seems to us that this is part of a goal that seems to be abroad virtually to eliminate payment of sole parent pensions as far as possible and to make sure that as few people as possible can receive the sole parent pension, again something that runs counter to all that we say we believe in about the value of parenting in this community.

         —The speech we have just heard from Senator Powell sums up the mentality of the Australian Democrats. They make a value judgment as to whether it is worth working; to them, work is an option. Senator Powell gave the example of a 15-year-old child, working for 33 hours a week, who received $100 a week and said that the family would lose $65 a week as a result. Senator Powell said that the family was being done in the eye for $65 a week, so the child was working for $35 a week. That is the mentality of the Australian Democrats.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Powell said that the mentality of the family and the child should be to ask what they can get if nobody works, if they stay at home, and what they lose if they go to work. No consideration was given to seeking self-esteem, dignity, pride or satisfaction from going into the work force. No consideration was given to going into the work force to seek to make a contribution and to earn a living instead of living on other people's endeavours and taxes. There is something intrinsically wrong with that attitude. If I did not hear it every day, I could not believe that that is what the Australian Democrats reek of. They espouse an attitude of working out what is in it for those who choose to stay at home; of working out what people can get from ripping off the system, from bludging; and then people measure that against what they will earn if they go to work and make a judgment on the difference. If the difference is modest, people choose to stay at home, but if the difference is very significant, they might be persuaded to work. Honourable senators should ask themselves what group of people the Australian Democrats are trying to get with their carpetbagging.

         —I heard exactly what the Democrats said. That is the great tragedy for society. The Democrats seem to have no regard for those who have to provide the income, who provide the taxes and social welfare benefits for those in need from the very sweat of their brows. There is a clear distinction to be drawn between those in need and those in greed, and those who are prepared to work and those who are disadvantaged beyond their capacity and are unable to work. There is a clear distinction to be drawn between the two.

       <para>
        Of course, there is enormous poverty within Australia at present, notwithstanding the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tells us that no child will live in poverty by 1990. Depending on the measure used, in 1981-82, 590,000 children were judged to be living below the poverty line. Now, five or six years further down the track, 810,000 children are judged to be living below the poverty line. Those children need assistance, but they also need encouragement and incentive. But there is just so much of the cake to go around. If it is dissipated on those who do not need it, it simply means there is less for those who desperately need it. The Democrats do not understand economics too well. They imagine that we can just keep doling it out wherever the votes are. It really says something about the Democrats that they say that because this child can get $100 a week, it is a shame that the family will lose $65.

I suspect that it was at least partially facetious, but I cannot be sure of that. I really do not know the answer to the other parts of the question about the level of bankruptcies. If Senator Stone is really serious about my trying to get a definitive answer to that, I will. However, it is a fact of life that if Australian private borrowers default on their overseas borrowings that does reduce the national debt once the debts have been written off. That is likely, as Senator Stone suggests. I think that if it were to happen to any significant extent it would have some other repercussions. It is a matter of regret that some highly viewed companies appear to be in trouble; indeed, I think it is beyond dispute that some of them are in trouble. If Senator Stone wants a more considered response from the Treasurer, I will be happy to provide one.

I note in that connection that the Treasurer continually affirms that, in order to solve Australia's serious current account problem, private sector investment must be maintained and increased. How does the Minister reconcile that view-with which I take it he agrees-with the Treasurer's apparent welcoming of the fact that business bankruptcies will help to wipe out our foreign debt obligations?

         —I would have thought that it is an indisputable fact that private sector investment needs to be increased, especially private sector investment in the internationally tradable sector-private sector investment of the type that earns income and, more importantly, earns income overseas. That sort of private sector investment can be investment in manufacturing industry, investment in tourism, providing it is oriented towards the overseas tourist business, investment in mines and, to some extent probably-the scope is probably more limited here-investment in farms. Such investors expect to get income on their investment and they know that they will pay tax on that income.

        There is an alternative form of so-called investment which does not do anything for the international account; that is investment in speculative activity, in real estate, works of art, and so on-the sort of investment that would be encouraged by the Opposition's policy on capital gains tax. People who invest in productive enterprises expect to get an income and they know that they will pay tax on the income. When the ore body, if it is a mine, is mined out, or the plant and equipment, if it is a factory or a farm, is worn out, it is worth nothing. They pay tax on the income that is generated throughout its working life.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, if people choose to speculate in real estate or works of art, that generates no income whatsoever that helps our international account and, in most instances, they deliberately arrange their affairs so as to generate minimal income, with the expectation of selling the asset a few years down the track and getting a capital gain on it-on which, if the Opposition's policy were to be implemented, they would pay absolutely no tax. Therefore, the Opposition's policy on capital gains tax provides a very substantial disincentive for the investment in productive enterprises of the type that will help to overcome our foreign debt and continuing current account deficit problem but an incentive for `investment' in works of art and speculation in real estate. I mentioned this yesterday, but it is worth mentioning again: it is an incentive to do things such as Mr Bond did some years ago, although not for this reason. He bought a painting from overseas, paid $5m for it and sold it for $19m at a profit of $14m which was totally untaxed under the Opposition's policy. There is a massive incentive to indulge in that sort of thing which hits the current account and the foreign debt in the wrong way, in two different ways, because of the direct effect of the imports on the foreign debt and the foreign account and the investment disincentive--

         —The situation in the Philippines following the coup attempt which began on 1 December is still quite volatile and certainly has not been fully resolved. Forces loyal to the Philippine Government which are now in control of all major military facilities are still engaged in mopping up residual rebel elements in the Manila area, and in particular the area which is the main centre of rebel activity-the Makati commercial district-where retreating rebel units have occupied a number of key apartment buildings and international hotels. That is what I indicated yesterday. Honourable senators will know that our Embassy is also presently located on the upper floor of a high rise building there, and it has been in the middle of quite a lot of gunfire and other action over the last few days.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        An unknown number of Australian nationals are in hotels held by the rebels. According to one unconfirmed report, one Australian has been wounded. There are reports of casualties among other foreign civilians in the same situation. It is difficult to get precise information because telephone lines are, ironically, working well. This means that people are not dealing directly with the Embassy; they are giving information about their safety and whereabouts directly to their friends and relatives in Australia, so it has been difficult to keep track of precisely how many Australians are there.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly we are seriously concerned over the safety of Australian citizens who are caught up in the fighting. In order to ensure the safety of those Australian nationals, including Embassy staff and dependants who are living in and around the area of the present activities, steps are being taken to evacuate them to safer locations to the extent that we can. There are only five Embassy staff now left on the Embassy premises, and we will keep under close review what we might need to do in so far as further steps in that particular location are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have just two further specific things that I want to mention. I directed the Ambassador to make representations to the Philippine Government to do all in its power to ensure that the lives of Australians, and other nationals for whom we have some responsibility, and who are innocent civilians, are not put at risk and that their safety is assured. Those representations have been made at a very senior political level within Manila just in the last few hours.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was also advised, just before coming into Question Time, that there are intensive negotiations now going on in Manila, in which our embassy is actively involved, over arrangements for extricating foreigners from the main rebel stronghold in the Intercontinental Hotel. All I can say is that we are obviously doing everything possible to ensure the safety of the civilians concerned. The embassy is doing a fine job under very difficult circumstances in Manila and we can only hope that these various efforts will prove successful.

Honourable senators have been quoted as being rather cynical about this statement.

In your written reply the next day you indicated that the cost of electricity for Parliament House was running at approximately a quarter of a million dollars per month. In view of the reply of the Minister for Local Government a moment ago, it is interesting to note that $3m a year compares with some of the figures that she has just given us on spending in the women's area.

          —By way of background, I advise that the management of energy costs in the building is largely dependent on the building monitoring system (BMS), which is operated by the engineering services section of the Joint House Department. In my response of 21 December last year to a question from Senator Coulter about this matter, I advised that the BMS was due to be operational in late January 1989; the BMS being an essential prerequisite either to energy management or to an energy audit. The BMS did not become operational for lighting until March 1989 and for air-conditioning and other services until August 1989.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The Joint House Department has been addressing the question of energy management since it accepted responsibility for maintenance. With the agreement of the other parliamentary departments, operating hours of lights in areas such as corridors, committee rooms, chambers, the members, hall and public spaces have been progressively rationalised and reduced since 16 March 1989. An extensive program of recommissioning and balancing of air-conditioning and ventilation systems has been undertaken and this has enabled a more cost-effective use of the systems. The use of the BMS has enabled further savings by the lowering of maximum demand during peak energy charge periods. The above initiatives have so far resulted in a 9.4 per cent reduction in electricity consumption for the spring of 1989 compared with the spring of last year. Programs to reduce consumption during the forthcoming summer and winter months are in hand. The Department has advised that the conduct of an energy audit has been dependent upon the full implementation of the BMS and the proper working and balancing of air-conditioning and ventilation systems. An audit is planned during the latter part of 1990. In the meantime the Department will continue to refine and streamline existing energy saving measures.
        </para>
        <para>
         With regard to office lighting, in the main, the Department does not have any centralised control mechanisms. The lighting design provides for individual occupant control in most instances. Some reduction in lighting has been achieved by occupants turning off lights when leaving and by attendants turning off lights in unoccupied areas during recess periods. Further savings can be achieved with the cooperation of all occupants of the building.
        </para>
        <para>
         While there are no mechanisms which separately identify the consumption of electricity on lighting, based on approximate data relating to the total lighting capacity of the building, the Department estimates that savings in excess of $100,000 per annum have been achieved so far. With the continuation of present measures and the cooperation of building occupants we believe that this figure can be doubled. Honourable senators can be assured that I fully support the Department's initiatives in the area of energy conservation and I urge senators and other users of the building to help conserve energy by turning off lights whenever possible, particularly when leaving in the evenings.

        But in answer to a question asked by Senator Chaney, I think a week or so ago, I referred to the importance of performance at the firm level. In answering Senator Maguire's question I just want to say something about that because management and work practices and other things are vital to performance at the firm level. The Government, in partnership with both the State and Territory governments, introduced a program three years ago to provide private sector management skills to a variety of firms that were perceived as being in need of that consultancy assistance. The national industry extension service is such a program and that program helps firms to make use of the array of private sector and government organisations with resources that can benefit the international competitiveness of firms. Of particular importance are the enterprise improvement programs to help firms develop skills in strategic and business planning, marketing, manufacturing operations, innovation and design, and quality.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article in the Australian Financial Review, to which the honourable senator referred, emphasised that of most importance is sound strategic planning. In this area the national industry extension service developed the world competitive manufacturing approach so that firms can develop strategic plans to sustain expansion in domestic and export markets. More than 200 firms, represented by over 1,600 senior managers, have now participated in workshops relating to world competitive manufacturing and 160 consultants have been trained and licensed to deliver the program.
       </para>
       <para>
        Right now a model program for the implementation of total quality management in firms `How to Approach Management for Improvement' is being developed by private sector experts. This is not just a matter of the quality of the end product; it is how well a company manages its operations and the production line. Further improvements will be made on the basis of advice from the private sector and elsewhere on these needs of firms. In this process the Commonwealth will play a key role in coordinating the advisory mechanisms and developing new services. I must emphasise that this is a collaborative arrangement between State and Federal governments in which all governments are agreed.

Let me first say, lest this excitement over the Prime Minister's alleged actions be pursued in Question Time, that Senator Chaney asked me about this and I am advised that the Prime Minister did not phone Mr Easson as suggested by both Senator Chaney and Senator Reid. The Prime Minister was phoned by Mr Easson, who made numerous efforts to get in touch with him, the Prime Minister being in Victoria at the time. Mr Easson phoned the Prime Minister to express his regrets concerning the accuracy of those statements which were made. The point which I seek to make is simply that these two questions are very much dependent on the allegation that the Prime Minister phoned Mr Easson and sought some sort of retraction or apology from him. That is quite incorrect, and if Senator Chaney has farmed out further questions on this issue to other members of the Opposition, which is the normal procedure in the Opposition, then I suggest that the two neurons be rubbed together and that the questions be phrased differently for later in Question Time. That event did not happen.

If Senator Lewis were familiar with the Budgets of the time, he would know that the Opposition was spending enormous sums as a government on unemployment benefits. The fact is that employment growth has been very steady under the life of this Government, and that is, in the Government's view, directly related to the accord, as the accord is directly related to the share of profits. There is deathly silence now on the other side of the chamber, but that is absolutely correct. So, if I may say so, Senator Reid's question, not surprisingly, displays a degree of confusion, as do all questions which have been written in Senator Chaney's office and handed out to people who do not understand them to ask at Question Time.

         —I am not aware of what may have transpired in the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade last Friday. I will not say may I forever remain oblivious, but I will no doubt find out in due course. However, turning to the substance of the question, there have been numerous reports over the course of this year suggesting that North Korea is making efforts to construct a nuclear fuel cycle base from which a nuclear weapons program could be developed, with the possibility that a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility is being built near the existing reactor at Yongbyon, which is about 100 kilometres north of Pyongyang. Australia is concerned about these reports, especially as North Korea has failed to conclude the fullscope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) required by its adherence to the International Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1985. Such an agreement would allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities.

        Australia is opposed, as the Senate well knows, to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and we are strongly committed to the NPT. We have on a number of occasions, through direct contact, through other countries and in meetings this year of the IAEA board of governors, urged the North Koreans-the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-to conclude promptly their safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and we will continue to make every effort to convince the DPRK to do that at the earliest possible date.
       </para>
       <para>
        We would certainly be very concerned if the Soviet Union and China-or, for that matter, any other state, whether or not a party to the NPT-were to assist North Korea or any other non-nuclear weapons state to develop nuclear weapons. I am not aware, however, of any evidence to suggest that the Soviet Union or China has assisted North Korea in this manner. If there were any suggestion, of course, that they were minded to do so, we would find opportunities to express very directly and vigorously our concern about just that.

I partly agree, although job growth is not meaningless for people who did not have jobs when the Opposition went out of office-not meaningless at all; it is very meaningful.

       <para>
        Senator Panizza went on to ask whether job growth in those sectors which provide high quality jobs has been slow and stagnant and in other areas of less rewarding employment, both financially and in terms of job satisfaction, has been more dramatic. It is not possible to answer a question like that without looking at some sectors of the Australian economy. For example, there has been very high job growth in tourism. It is a matter of judgment whether those jobs are rewarding or not. Some people would take the view that they are less rewarding than other jobs; I do not know. That is a matter of judgment. I am sure that Senator Panizza would personally be in favour of job growth in the tourist industry because of its economic implications for the country as a whole, and there can be no cause for regret about job growth in that industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as other sectors of the economy are concerned, there has been a high job growth rate in the employment of engineers, scientists and research and development personnel of one kind or another. There has been job growth of some 200,000 in the manufacturing sector, something which never happened under the previous Liberal-National Party Government prior to 1982. Of course, the highest level of job growth has been in the services sector. The services sector embraces many things other than tourism, to which I have referred. It also embraces job growth in areas such as information industry technology, a whole range of financial industry occupations and so on. I would not have thought that they were jobs which had a low quality about them at all.

Of course, the answer to that question is yes, there are plans contemplated to do that. The fact that those may never reach fruition is an edifying side of that conundrum. The plans are advanced under the guise of the document entitled Economic Action Plan, released by the Opposition, which purports to find savings in Government expenditure. One of the savings it purports to find is to cut the Countrylink service, a service provided by this Government to rural and regional communities, particularly those communities that do not have ready access to or availability of the range of Government services that might be available in the major metropolitan areas. It provides a one-stop shop for country people to become familiar with and be able to use the services offered by the Federal Government. It is the Countrylink plan which is one of the things that the Opposition, in its Economic Action Plan, proposes to cut out.

        The Prime Minister stated last Friday that the Government intends to enhance that service to country people because we do not wish, as a government, to distinguish between or discriminate against people simply because of where they live in terms of their access to the services that this Government offers. As a consequence, the Prime Minister announced the rural and regional plan. Senator Reynolds has adequately canvassed many of the aspects of the Prime Minister's statement. I do not propose to repeat those aspects. The direction of this plan is to provide, as the Prime Minister has said, options, opportunities and access to information. This reflects our understanding of the effects on sparse populations of access to those services, of the narrower choices that befall country residents, of higher transport costs attending many of the services delivered, and of the substantial personal inconveniences that sometimes befall country people. We see as our role a need to bring those services more closely to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The context in which the Prime Minister made that statement is, of course, a background of major macro-economic reform in this country and, in particular, a successful and vigorous pursuit of micro-economic reform that has brought down tariffs and continues a program of tariff reduction that has caused Australia to lead the world in trying to open markets for rural products and unlock the doors of protected economies so that Australia, as a free trading nation, can enter there, be more competitive and win extra markets. It is in the context of an extra 1.6 million jobs created in Australia since we took office and of major restructuring.

        The significant and final feature which I will touch upon to provide a complete answer to the question from Senator Burns is a paragraph from the Prime Minister's speech which states:

That is some of the most typical 1950s and 1960s bunkum I have ever heard.

The Library has, however, outlined one possible way in which such a centre could be established if it were provided with adequate funds. The National Library has some ongoing programs, particularly in oral history, which include folklife. Any extension of those activities obviously would require additional resources and would have to be addressed in the Budget context. In the last couple of years I have not sought to raise those matters in the Budget context. In times of financial constraint it is not possible to attempt to deliver on every item that is on the agenda. When I see a more benign look in the eyes of my colleague Senator Walsh I might give it a go.

        I have received a number of questions on this from Senator Bishop and Senator Short and I think it is appropriate to look at the way in which governments and political parties handle these things. It is not the case now-nor has it ever been-that an agency which has the account of a political party which is in government should be banned from receiving government advertising. The best way to consider what the ministerial committee did in this situation is to look at analogous situations. When Senator Bishop was the President of the New South Wales Liberal Party-and that is not very long ago-the New South Wales Liberal Party accounts were moved to the Campaign Palace under the stewardship of a Mr Greg Daniel. I might say that that is a 100 per cent overseas-owned agency. When Mr Daniel moved to John Clemenger, which was 50 per cent United States of America-owned, the Liberal Party account moved there as well. That agency won the New South Wales Government's $20m Lotto account. One wonders whether there was anything untoward in that. I suspect not because I do not think an agency is banned from receiving government work simply because it is getting the work of a political party. There is nothing to suggest that, because the agency had the Liberal Party account, it was not entitled to the Lotto or the lottery's account, which it won. It is also, I might say, purely coincidental that that same agency was the one that Senator Bishop chose to do the videotape for herself when she was running so successfully against Senator Puplick in the recent preselection.

        The Federal Liberal Party's advertising agency is George Patterson Pty Ltd. I want to say a couple of things about that agency. It gets to pitch for a lot more work with this Government than does John Singleton. Of all the government advertising handed out, John Singleton has only ever pitched for one, and that is because he rang and asked to be able to pitch for it. George Patterson Pty Ltd has pitched for a number. It is also worth noting that this agency got the New South Wales Government's breath testing account. One assumes that that was based on merit also.

       <para>
        Employers making deductions of maintenance payable by employees are required to pay these moneys to the Child Support Agency (CSA) by the 7th day of the month following the month in which the payments were deducted, similar to the employer's obligation in remitting tax instalment deductions made under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) taxation system. Payers who are not employees are required to pay directly to the Agency on the same basis. Under the legislative scheme these payments are then made to the custodial parent on the first Wednesday of the month following the month that payments were due to the CSA.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 as introduced into the Parliament, identified a collection system which would be calendar monthly and a payment system which envisaged payment no later than the first Wednesday of the month after the payment was due to the Registrar. In other words, there is, and always have been, a clear timeframe between the liability to make the first payment and the date of the receipt of that payment. Thereafter, the legislation contemplates the regular and timely payment of maintenance calendar monthly by all payers. This Bill received bipartisan support from all in the Parliament and was passed without amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The population that is affected by the arrangement is, therefore, every individual who registers with the Child Support Agency. Registration is not compulsory for persons other than those in receipt of an income-tested pension, benefit or allowance. To the extent that the custodial parent was receiving regular maintenance before registering with the Agency, there will be a ``hiatus'' in the receipt of payment for such individuals. Senator Messner should be aware that the Australian Institute of Family Studies in its publication ``Settling Up'' found that in the great majority of cases parents liable to pay under the old system, if they paid regularly, did so for a relatively short period. The ``hiatus'' is the small cost, if you like, for the custodial parent joining a national and effective enforcement scheme. The benefit is the security of having the Australian Taxation Office as his or her ``cost free'' enforcer of maintenance in the future and subject to their other income, eligible custodians are entitled to full pension or benefit in the interim.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the scheme, payments received by the Child Support Agency are placed in the Child Support Trust Account from which the Department of Social Security draws equivalent amounts and is required to pay to the custodial parent on the first Wednesday of each month. Depending on the time the payment is received by the Agency, payment to the custodial parent could be made as early as 7 days after receipt or as late as 28 days.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prior to the introduction of the Scheme, evidence indicated that approximately 7 out of 10 persons with liabilities to pay child maintenance failed to make that payment at all, or if they did, they were irregular, both in quantum and in time. After 18 months of Agency operations evidence indicates that 61 per cent of liabilities are met on time and after enforcement action by the Australian Taxation Office some 75 per cent of liabilities are met. The Child Support Agency expects this figure to continue to improve as more payers become subject to employers making deductions on their behalf, a system proposed by the Parliament to be the cornerstone of the maintenance collection system.

Australian racing interests have held discussions on possible involvement in the development of a horse racing industry in Taiwan over the past year or two. This is precisely the type of commercial cooperation with Taiwan which the Australian Government seeks to encourage. I understand that the Australian commerce and industry office in Taipei has provided assistance to the Australian interests concerned. The Government would have no objection to visits to Australia by the Taiwan commercial interests involved to discuss cooperation in this area.

        The question about Taiwan beef may be responded to as follows: On 18 September 1989, without warning or consultation, Taiwan announced the temporary suspension of licences for Australia's exports of shin, shank and intercostals to Taiwan. Taiwan is Australia's fourth largest market for beef exports with a value of approximately $100m in 1988-89. Although the ban was partially lifted, 60 per cent of Australian beef exports to Taiwan remain affected by the continuing suspension of licences. The Australian Government is deeply concerned about the action taken by the Taiwan authorities and has given its strong support to the efforts of the Australian beef industry to negotiate a full lifting of the ban. While we are aware of the pressure that the Taiwan domestic beef industry faces in competing with imports, we do not consider that the solution lies in trade restrictions such as those imposed by Taiwan. The Australian industry is continuing to make representations to the relevant Taiwan authorities with the assistance of the Australian commerce and industry office in Taipei and the full support of the Australian Government. It is my hope that the ongoing industry discussions will result in a lifting of the suspension in the near future.

         —I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the eighty-second conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in London from 4 to 9 September 1989. The leader of this delegation was the Hon. Tom Uren, the honourable member for Reid. The deputy leader was Mr Roger Shipton, the honourable member for Higgins. My co-delegates were Senator Janet Powell from Victoria, the honourable member for Berowra, Dr Harry Edwards, the honourable member for Greenway, Mr Russ Gorman, and the honourable member for Streeton, Mr Tony Lamb.

        The IPU conference in London was significant as it represented the centenary of the co-founding of the IPU by a British and a French parliamentarian in 1889. The Inter-Parliamentary Union has, as one of its central aims, the strengthening of representative political institutions. It was highly symbolic that the opening ceremonies for the conference were held in historic Westminster Hall of the Palace of Westminster. The Australian delegation was active at the conference and the official duties undertaken by each of the delegates are noted in the report, which I invite honourable senators to peruse.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of human rights, the Australian delegation introduced a resolution-in-council calling on parliaments of all member countries to establish, within their parliaments, groups for the promotion and protection of human rights. This resolution was not directed against any particular country or region; rather, it was based on goodwill and the desire to support and strengthen individual human rights everywhere. The IPU council finally adopted the resolution by 86 votes to six, with 21 abstentions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The IPU committee on human rights of parliamentarians reported on the situation of 22 parliamentarians from eight countries. Of particular interest to this region, it reported that a former parliamentarian of Indonesia, Mrs Sundari, who had been given a life imprisonment sentence in 1968 for her alleged role in the 1965 attempted coup in Indonesia, had been released on 17 August 1989. Similarly, in Malaysia, restriction orders against seven opposition parliamentarians were revoked on 20 April 1989. By contrast, one of the most publicised and brutal violations of human rights which had occurred since the previous conference did not even make it on to the agenda of the conference. The rules of the conference enable a supplementary item to be included on the agenda, provided that any such proposal receives the necessary support as set out in the rules. The Federal Republic of Germany group proposed the following supplementary item:
       </para>
       <para>
        Repression by force of the peaceful protest made by the citizens of the People's Republic of China.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a rollcall vote, the request presented by the Federal Republic of Germany group was rejected by 393 votes to 335, with 509 abstentions.
       </para>
       <para>
        IPU conferences are often seen as more important for the opportunity they present for contacts and discussions between delegates outside the official sessions than for the resolutions which emerge from the official sessions. As a member of the executive committee of the Australian national group of the IPU, I, together with other members, need to reflect on whether the benefits of these contacts and discussions warrant the financial outlays which we have to make or whether other forums can equally serve this purpose. In particular, the question of the usefulness of twice yearly IPU conferences must be raised for consideration, particularly if major questions of human rights violations such as the Tiananmen Square massacre are to be excluded from the agenda or if non-parliamentary groups attempt to unduly influence resolutions of the IPU as part of another agenda.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the London conference, the population control lobby attempted to influence the outcome of the agenda item entitled `The population and food equation and the search for rational and efficient solutions to the problem of Third World debt to ensure that the world can eat'. Their fatal diagnosis is that people growth in developing countries is the problem and that population control is the solution. This diagnosis is deceptive, simplistic and distracts attention from the real problems and their solutions. The population control lobby cannot trust parents to make responsible decisions governing their intimate relationships and the size of their families. It says that these decisions must be heavily influenced by the population policies of politicians at the behest of outside agencies and by governments no matter how dictatorial.
       </para>
       <para>
        As parliamentarians, we must be ever wary of the attempts by non-elected bureaucratic elites to steer meetings of parliamentarians in their predetermined direction. Over many years, the population control lobby has sought to use international fora to promote a so-called `consensus' on this issue and to use it to promote their ideology of population control imperialism. As parliamentarians with both rural and urban constituencies, we are conscious of the need to acknowledge the great advances in agricultural production that have taken place in recent decades despite, or perhaps because of, increases in population and the role that innovation and optimism have played in this process. The bleak yet appealingly deceptive assertion that population growth is outstripping food supplies and ravaging the environment had its origin in Western-based population control lobby groups and academics like the recycled Paul Ehrlich. While history has savaged their pessimistic forecasts, these prophets of doom continue to capture the imagination of governments, which clutch at the straws of simple solutions to the world's problems and refuse to face the facts. Despite frightening predictions in the 1960s, we now live in a world of food abundance. Yet many people go hungry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fertility of poor women in developing countries has been made the scapegoat for a range of problems from environmental damage to famine, the primary causes of which are war, political instability and man's inhumanity to man. To propose population control as the panacea is to succumb to the pessimism of our age. To point the finger of guilt at the fertility of poor women is to set the stage for policies which discriminate against the families of less developed countries and to open the way for gross violations of human rights. The present unhealthy fixation on population control is economically and socially naive and dangerous. It diverts the attention and efforts of governments in both the developed and developing world away from the real and pressing measures required.
       </para>
       <para>
        The global food outlook is not a problem either now or in the long term; distribution is. As parliamentarians, we need to shed pessimism and exude hope to work for a fair world trading and exchange system, to reduce indebtedness and unemployment, to assist with making fisheries and farming more attractive, to exchange technologies, to promote the environmentally sound and efficient use of resources, to reform inefficient or corrupt economic practices, to promote human initiatives to feed the poor; in short, to strive for an authentic socioeconomic development based on social justice and respect for human life. Faced with evidence which has destroyed the pessimistic forecast of the population control lobby, it is now using world concern for the environment to promote its viewpoint.
       </para>
       <para>
        Parliamentarians and the IPU must take measures to ensure that the population control lobby and associated outside groups, such as the Global Committee of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, do not set the agenda or influence our work, including the work of the ad hoc committee on the environment. The Inter-Parliamentary Union was established for parliamentarians. It is important to note that this is a group not of governments but of parliamentarians. Parliamentarians are the delegates to the conference. However, it was very disconcerting to many parliamentarian delegates to the conference that in the discussion of the agenda item to which I have referred no fewer than 14 outside organisations spoke at the conference. Not all were from the population control lobby. One of them, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, had two bites at the cherry. Because these organisations ate up so much of the time of the conference for the discussion of this agenda item, many parliamentarians' speaking time was reduced to a period of only 3 1/2 minutes. To travel all that distance to speak for such a short time is also something to be questioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I take this opportunity to thank my co-delegates, our secretary, Mr Rob Diamond, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade adviser, Mr Fred Peppinck, for a harmonious week of hard work at the conference. I also thank the Australian High Commissioner, the former President of this place, former Senator Doug McClelland, and Mrs Lorna McClelland, for the assistance they were able to provide in London and for their generous hospitality in co-hosting a function at the Australian High Commission for the Asia-Pacific Group. Last but by no means least, I gratefully acknowledge the splendid organisational skills and the warm hospitality of the United Kingdom Group, whose Chairman, Mr Michael Marshall, was aptly elected as President of the IPU at the London conference.

         —Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch, on this group of amendments some heat was being generated by discussion from the Opposition side, in particular from Senator Crichton-Browne, who seemed to be outraged that we should be concerned about a 15-year-old child from a sole parent family going to work for 33 hours a week to the net benefit for that household of $35 or thereabouts. He raised the question of need and greed. I thought that it might be useful to clarify our position on the question raised by Senator Crichton-Browne. A number of things occurred to us. Given that the weekly figure in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) is $100, we are concerned about the effect of that figure. We ask ourselves why that child is working. Clearly, Government policy is to encourage young people to stay at school as full time students. If they were still full time students, they would be exempt from this provision even if they earned $100 a week. They would still be classified as a dependent child.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        So why is a 15-year-old child having to do this against the whole thrust of government policy? Being virtually a drop-out from school can in many ways go against the child's own future interests. We do not have to look too much further than at the documentation of the lives of these families-I have already put some details on the record-to see why a 15-year-old might do this. We were accused by Senator Crichton-Browne of not wishing to build any incentive into the system. Apparently $35 a week for 33 hours work is an incentive in Senator Crichton-Browne's terms, but that is not the way we see it.
       </para>
       <para>
        These children could be motivated to work by a number of factors which show up in the case studies of such families-factors I mentioned earlier-such as where a sole parent has taken on education, perhaps having been an early school leaver, as the mother of a 15-year-old is most likely to have been, and has difficulty finding money to purchase books or getting transport to the educational institution with which she is involved, or where the child itself is suffering from the social deprivation that is involved with poverty for young people and their families, such as not being able to go on school excursions or having to wear a school uniform to a party and, after having been ridiculed, saying, `I won't go to any more parties'. That happened to the 10- or 11-year-old daughter of one of the people in Jenny Trethewey's Aussie Battlers-Rosemary Young. Those pressures are at work because the benefit paid to those families is at the subsistence level or in many cases is almost below the subsistence level.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another example is not being able to use a heater in the winter because heating bills cannot be met. One of the case studies in the book refers to a visit made to a house in the middle of winter where the temperature was freezing. There was an oil heater in the house. I think that at the moment oil heating is the most expensive form of winter heating. These families are not able to choose to live in a house with natural gas, which is cheaper. They have to take the accommodation that is available, which may be the most inexpensive-if they can get it. They have very little choice about what kind of heating is in the house and how much it will cost. We are not saying that the children of these people should not work. What we are saying is that we should be in a position to acknowledge the pressures on them and, as I have often said in the debate, the parenting that is taking place individually in a sole parent family.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are trying to amend the legislation by making the figure an annual not a weekly one. We are concerned that the pressures imposed on such families force a child into the work force for socially generated economic reasons, such as the way they feel about not being able to participate with their peers or simply trying to bring more money into the household, perhaps being a partner in their mother's goal to educate herself and become independent of benefit or pension. The decision to work may not be a permanent one. We would go so far as to say that we would want it not to be a permanent decision. I believe that that is the Government's policy also and that it wishes to see the retention of children in school.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are trying to break a poverty cycle-at least, I hope we are-and in that event it is bad for this figure to be a weekly one. Surely we want to reduce the pressures on these families to the greatest possible extent. I have a 15-year-old son and I can imagine times when he would probably say, `Gee, I don't want to go to school any more', because the pressures were all too much or whatever. When he goes through the bottoms of his basketball shoes one has to find the money for new ones. I have not seen any basketball shoes for under $65; they are more like $95 or $120. The families I have referred to are unable to do that. A kid in such a family is more likely to say, `It is easier for me to distance myself from that group of peers and to go out and earn some money'. It is quite a lonely decision and, as I have said before, it impinges on his future.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the very least we are asking the Government to amend this legislation so that, if the decision to work is temporary, a parent can encourage a child to go back to school and look for ways to make that possible. That probably means going to families and friends for support. However, given the passage of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), I am concerned about what sort of support such a person might get if he happens to be living with those people. The situation is fraught with stress and we want to see a more long term approach taken. At the very least we want the Government to accept our amendment and make the figure an annual one so that, in an administrative sense, we might expect that a longer term view would be taken of such a family.
       </para>
       <para>
        I feel quite distressed, not for myself but because I am a human being, at the concept of any of my colleagues in this place believing that to be concerned about this group of people is wrong and that in some way we are encouraging such people to be greedy, especially when I read newspapers and see headlines, as I did last Friday, which read, `Millionaires enjoy a better tax deal than poor'. That article told us that the Australian Taxation Commissioner's statistics for the 1987-88 financial year showed that people who declared taxable income of more than $1m that year paid only 29.1c in the dollar in tax. Think of the effective marginal tax rate of the kid who is working for 33 hours a week to increase his family's income by $35. Millionaires are paying a lower tax rate than people earning a fraction of their income. The point is made later in the article that that taxable income of $1m is only what is left after the accountants have exhausted all the possibilities of income splitting and various other, shall we say, creative accounting measures, all of which are quite legal of course. The statistics which we saw last Friday showed that the 267 income millionaires received more tax credits and rebates between them than the almost 1 1/2 million Australian taxpayers with an income below $10,000.

         —It seems to me that the Democrats dwell on the misery of the symptoms but they are incapable of understanding the causes. The truth of the matter is that the level of benefits receivable by those in real and genuine need who, as a result of circumstances beyond their capacity, find themselves disadvantaged depends very much on the aggregate wealth of society. We can try to spread the butter as thin as we like; the wise money in town tries to make sure that there is more butter. The Democrats do not understand that. They are not about incentive; they are not about reward; they are not about endeavour; they are not about effort. They are all about misery and trying to dissipate whatever taxes there are amongst everybody. That is not equality; it is inequality.

        I do not give myself credit for being the most intelligent senator on our side of politics, but having listened with a great deal of care to Senator Powell I have to say, with respect, that I find her explanation about the $100 to be total gobbledegook. Senator Powell did not address any question and left us with the argument that she put to us before lunch: Senator Powell encourages those in the community to measure the value of working as compared with the value of staying home and the appropriate rewards and benefits that flow from those two determinations. There was no discussion about incentive to do better. We only heard about whether it was actually worth going to work today.

         —Senator Powell, that is totally irrelevant. Your complaint to the Committee was that if a child receives $100 benefit, the family loses $65. That was your proposition. Your are saying that if a child in a family currently receiving a benefit works, that person works for $35 a week. You are saying that the family is better off living on welfare and then there would be no people in the work force seeking to improve themselves.

         —I usually do, Mr Temporary Chairman. I should know better than to be tempted by the inconsequential interjections of Senator Powell. The tragedy of this debate is, like so many put before us by the Democrats, that it is intellectually barren. We really are not arguing about who in this chamber cares or who has compassion. We are addressing how we will solve the problem. In other words it is only a question of from which direction we travel in seeking to solve the problem. The Democrats cannot agree with that. The Democrats have put to us that they have a mortgage on compassion, care, understanding and empathy for those in the community who, for circumstances either beyond their control or in their control, deserve, in the minds of the Democrats, to be the recipients of taxpayers' money. That is the beginning and the end of where the Democrats stand.

       <para>
        The record of the Liberal Party of Australia is unparalleled in terms of offering safety nets and providing benefits to those who are unable to achieve a reasonable standard of living as a result of circumstances beyond their control. I refer Senator Powell to the Parliamentary Library background paper entitled `Commonwealth social security payments for children' in which she can read the litany of contributions that the coalition governments from 1946 or thereabouts until about May 1983 made to ensure that the standard of living of all Australians was at an acceptable level. At the end of the day, this matter is about the level of the community's capacity to maintain those in poverty. That level of capacity dictates the level of poverty in which the disadvantaged will live. It is quite simple-even the Democrats will be able to understand that if they read the Hansards. Yet they just do not seem to be able to grasp that that is the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by noting the rather cheap comment that Senator Powell made when she first rose to her feet to say that unlike the last vote when the Liberal Party and the National Party had a free vote, on this occasion they have not. Mr Temporary Chairman, with respect, this place is not the place to misrepresent the truth in a wilful and knowing way. The Liberal Party senators have a right to cross the floor whenever they like. My history of doing so is almost unparalleled. But I do not find the Democrats having a free vote. Do honourable senators know where the Democrats vote is? Their vote is where they think their electoral votes will come from. The reason that we have gone through this charade of division after division after division today is that the Democrats want to be able to put in their next newsletter, `We are the independent souls. We are the free souls of the Senate chamber but the Liberal Party and National Party senators voted with the Government. But we are the conscience of the community.' It is a cheap trick and it will get them nowhere.

         —It was acknowledged in the second reading debate but that was some time ago. Today we seem to have been debating those points somewhat in isolation. The depiction has been that only the Democrats seem to have an interest in and care for the plight of low income earners. I appreciate that Senator Powell has acknowledged the extent to which that is not so. Let me also make a threshold point about Senator Powell's amendment. It seems from Senator Powell's contribution in proposing the amendment that the principle of what the Government is seeking in this area is okay. It is the administration of the proposed legislation that Senator Powell seems to be concerned about. When one takes that into account when analysing what Senator Powell said, it occurs to me that we should not have spent as much time as we have on these provisions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The amendments to the definition of `dependent child' are intended to exclude payments for children who are independent of their parents because they are employed. The provisions are drafted so that they will not apply to a child who continues to be a full time student. Consequently, casual, part time or vacation jobs for full time students will not be taken into account when assessing parental entitlement. The Government undertakes that the provisions would be administered as follows. The provisions would apply to a child who is in permanent or in definite employment when the wage for that work is $100 or more each week, or averages that amount or more per week. The provisions would also apply to the child who has a history of at least four weeks regular and ongoing casual work, bringing in at least $100 every week. However, when there is no promise and little likelihood of further earnings at that level in the immediate future the provisions would not apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        The underlying philosophy is that family payments will not be made if, through employment, the child is in a financial position which allows for significant independence from parental support. The Government acknowledges that to achieve this policy the legislation might be more felicitously expressed. However, the Government does not accept the Democrats amendment. The legislation as drafted is not inconsistent with what I have just indicated is the policy that will be implemented; but the concept of $5,200 per year at the centre of the Democrats amendment is a new concept of unclear meaning-perhaps Senator Powell meant an annual rate of income of $5,200, which is a concept familiar in the pensions system. Her amendment, however, does not say that. In any event it would not clearly specify the policy which the Government and the Democrats both wish to achieve. The Government proposes to introduce a Bill for a completely rewritten Social Security Act in the first weeks of the next sittings of the House of Representatives. We undertake to address in that Bill the drafting issues involved to reflect more accurately the policy I have just spelled out.

       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment relates to changes in the qualification for the invalid pension. This issue was canvassed fully by my colleague Senator Jenkins, who carries the Australian Democrats portfolio of immigration and ethnic affairs. We are proposing this amendment because we are concerned that the Government is putting in place a provision which will disadvantage a small but significant and important group of people: that group of people who became eligible for an invalid pension after they reached this country and who knew that they would not qualify for an age pension until they had lived in this country for 10 years clearly intended to be working for that period of time, but who have become invalided for one reason or another since their arrival in this country. But under the provisions of the Bill they would not be able, at the age of 60 for women and 65 for men, to transfer, as the Bill would then require them to do, to the age pension. They would have to go onto special benefits which would be repayable by their families or those who had signed an assurance of support when they came to this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that this is a small group of people and we believe that that actually gives weight to our amendment in that it does seem discriminatory because it is only that small group of people. It is also an approach to the working lives of people which we do not find consistent. It is really saying that one's working life is over if one is a woman of 60 years of age or a man of 65 years of age. Even the Government's own operations do not work that way. Government appointments allow for people to continue work until they are 70 years old. So this is discriminating specifically against a particular group of recently arrived migrants.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not really want to canvass the issue any further. As I said, it has been very well put by my colleague Senator Jenkins. We believe that it is an amendment which removes that discrimination and removes that anomaly in the attitude towards the age at which people will or will not work. To take this kind of attitude in legislation at this point with an ageing community seems to be counterproductive. If we were to extend that concept broadly then we would be in some economic strife into the future. I understood that what we should be trying to do into the future is encourage people to extend their working lives in one way or another as our community ages.

         —The Government opposes the amendment and asks the Committee to note two related facts in respect of it. We should take into account the fact that the invalid pension is a work related payment. This is generally acknowledged. To date it has been the only one of three work related payments in the Social Security Act which does not have an upper age limit. It is all right to highlight one aspect of it and say we are being discriminatory but, in reality, if one looks at the legislation and at the discrepancy and the fact that one could mount the same sort of argument about any work related payment under the Act, one sees that those arguments of discrimination have no legs. That has been recognised not only by the Government; the fact that this is treated differently from the other work related payments has been recognised by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal also, which noted in the case re Blando that an absence of any upper limit for invalid pensions is `a curious feature of the Act'. So as the Act has that curious feature, the Government is doing what a government should do and that is to rectify it. That is why we will not accept the amendment of the Australian Democrats.

         —With regard to the general principle of work related payments having an upper age limit which coincides with the pensionable age-which I suppose is what Senator Bishop refers to when she says `retirement age'-certainly in respect of social security legislation that is what we would be implementing. I mentioned the ageing community, and it seems to me that if we are going to move, we ought to move in the opposite direction. We have to bear in mind that the invalid pension, the sickness benefit and the unemployment benefit all have particular tests applied to them. They are very stringent tests; tests which have been made more stringent, particularly in recent years. The work test at the moment for the unemployment benefit could scarcely be more stringent. The test for sickness benefit has been tightened up-I think in the last batch of social security Bills that we had or in the Bill at the end of last year. Clearly people who have a choice would exercise that choice to go onto an age pension when they, as women, reach 60 or, as men, reach 65, because for the age pension-apart from the assets test provisions and more general tests of that kind-they do not have to undergo the regular and stringent testing of the work related benefits to which Senator Bolkus referred. This amendment is proposed in that context and in the context that most invalid pensioners, having reached the age of 60 or 65, have been transferring to the age pension for that very reason. The people who have not been transferring have been the recently arrived migrants who, because they have not been here for 10 years, do not qualify. That is the reason for this particular part of the legislation. We are saying that those people do not have a choice. Those in the community who do have a choice have been transferring. If we are going to move in any direction in an ageing community, surely we should move up in age in the work related benefits area, not down. I am not saying that because it costs more, as I do not think it would. Where it is discretionary, as it is for the vast bulk of Australian working people, people have been transferring in any case because of the stringent testing which is required for those work related benefits.

Senator Bishop, by not supporting the Australian Democrats' amendment to this clause, is not following through what she has just stated; that is, that if people who are encouraged to work beyond the present pensionable age become incapacitated as far as work is concerned through no fault of their own-they may be injured or contract an incapacitating illness-they will not be eligible for the age pension. Senator Bishop is suggesting that they should fall into limbo while they wait out those years until they are eligible. People who have been receiving an invalid pension will simply fall into limbo until they can receive an age pension. On the other hand, if the Democrats' amendment is supported and these people continue on the invalid pension until they are no longer incapacitated, it may well be that they can continue their working life until they are eligible for an age pension.

        These amendments relate to the issues canvassed in regard to the previous Bill-the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989-as a result of the Government moving to legislate for the payment of pensions and benefits directly into bank accounts. They mirror, both in argument and in substance, because of the nature of this Bill, the amendments that we moved to the previous Bill. The amendments seek to make it possible for pensioners to have some discretion if payments going into banks are likely to cause financial hardship or detriment. Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 would enable pensioners to move their bank accounts and ensure that the Repatriation Commission, in this case, acted speedily when they decided to change the location of their bank accounts into which the pension is paid.

        As I said, we are concerned that the Government has made the payment of pensions into bank accounts mandatory. It has done this for several years without a legislative base. It is legislating for it now. We believe that, in doing so, it should at least support these amendments and ensure that the payments are not forcibly made into accounts if that is against the interests of the pensioner. In the case of the last two amendments, the Government should ensure that an account can be changed expeditiously if that is the wish of the pensioner whose payments are being made directly into that account.

         —I say at the outset that the coalition parties oppose the Industry Commission Bill. We oppose it, among other things, for the cant which the Government has given vent to in introducing it; for the hypocrisy which it represents and symbolises as to this Government's attitude towards micro-economic reform and for the panic which in one sense it also represents as part of the budgetary processes; and, perhaps above all, for the lack of imagination which it represents in terms of the presentation of it by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris).
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall very clearly that at the time of the last Federal election in July 1987 this Government, of which you have the honour-I presume that is the word-to be a member, at least a party member, said that the hallmark, to use its word, of the third Hawke-Keating Government was to be micro-economic reform. That was to be the theme of this Government. What have we actually seen? I will not weary the Senate this afternoon, particularly given the time constraints upon us, by reciting the litany of failure on the Government's part to live up to that promise, but I will just mention the failure in the area of privatisation of government business enterprise on which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) embarked shortly after the election and for which he was finally brought to heel and told to go and stand in the corner and put on the dunce's cap almost a year later at the Australian Labor Party biennial conference in Hobart in June 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen the virtual lack of movement-not total lack of movement, I should say-in the area of tariff reform. We saw some minor stumbling steps in the May 1988 economic statement by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), but not much more than that. We have seen the arrant failure of the responsible Minister-if that is the way to describe him-the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, in relation to waterfront reform following the very good report of the Inter-State Commission (ISC), one of the institutions whose future and fate is to be determined by the Bill before us this afternoon. What we have seen as a result of that on the Government's part is simply a retreat, beaten in all possible haste, from the wrath of the Waterside Workers Federation and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), who declared that there was no way in which they would accept the recommendations of that report.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen the equal failure-and by the same gentleman-in the area of coastal shipping reform where once again we have the Seamen's Union of Australia benefit process going on whereby almost no competition is permitted on the Australian coastal shipping area from foreign ships: a closed shop against foreign competition. Instead of any real program, therefore, of micro-economic reform, we have from the Government by way of substitution what we always get from this Government-talk.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industry Commission Bill before us proposes to amalgamate two bodies which, in their respective ways, are very effective proponents of micro-economic reform: the Industries Assistance Commission, which has a long and very honourable history beginning under its original title, the Tariff Board, from which it was transformed in 1973, if I recall correctly, into the IAC; and the Inter-State Commission which is provided for in the Australian Constitution but which, I have to concede, we managed to get along without for about 60 years or so in that interregnum until it was finally brought back into being by the present Government. I should perhaps not fail to mention a third body, the Business Regulation Review Unit, which is presently attached to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. The Bill seeks basically to roll those three entities into one and have this new mega-quango doing the job of all three.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have to say that on one view of the matter there ought perhaps be no particular objection to that. In a sense, one body no doubt can do the job of all three, but the Opposition particularly objects to the hype, the cant as I called it before, with which what might otherwise be termed a rather minor administrative change has been introduced by the Government as being its contribution, the thing which will actually make a difference to the program of micro-economic reform in this country. It is typical, as I say, of the Hawke-Keating Government that it should baulk at true reform and simply offer us talk in its place. We are seeing that-and I do not want to digress long on this point-quintessentially at the present time in quite another area of micro-economic reform, namely, reform of the labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday the Leader of the Government in the Senate described as junior clerks employees of the New South Wales Labor Council who had the intellectual capacity and intellectual courage to write a most interesting and insightful report to the New South Wales Labor Council in effect saying that the policy of the Government and the ACTU in the area of labour market relations is wrong, has failed, and will continue to fail. The report stated also that the only policy which is being put forward by any part of the political quarter in Australia today in that area is that which forms part of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan-its industrial relations policy. I mention that the two gentlemen in question had the goodness to say that the H. R. Nicholls Society, of which I had the honour to be the founding president and from which position I only recently retired, has won the intellectual and political debate in this country on that topic. I thank them for that compliment. I think that they are right. I will not digress on that matter now. I just want to point out that that is another area in which this Government is bereft not only of actions, but even of ideas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industry Commission Bill, heralded by the Treasurer and his Government as a key step in their program of micro-economic restructuring, in fact, as I have already said, does nothing more than amalgamate two major and one lesser body-the Industries Assistance Commission, the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit. It is patently clear that this amalgamated body will do nothing more than continue the work being done by its three constituent units. How on earth the Treasurer can possibly hope to persuade us that that is making a contribution to micro-economic reform in this country is beyond me. Even by the Treasurer's standards of audacity in debate, that is rather a large claim. As a matter of fact, referring to the amalgamation, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:
       </para>
       <para>
        There should therefore be no net financial impact.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not contest that claim, of course, but I point out that the claim gives the game away; there is no change. In his second reading speech in introducing this Bill in the other place, the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        As an institution, the Industries Assistance Commission has been an important force in economic policy in Australia, building community awareness of the need for Australian industry to be outward looking and internationally competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not differ from that judgment for a moment. But the question it raises is: in that case, why abolish it? Again, the Minister noted in his speech:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission has been at the forefront of inquiry and analysis of transport issues. It has been a dispassionate, objective and expert source of analysis in this area and has established a high quality network on transport issues which can be integrated into the Industry Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the whole that is well deserved praise but it raises, again, the question: why abolish the Inter-State Commission? If it is doing such a good job, what is the point? Is it change for the sake of change? Is it reorganisation for the sake of reorganisation? The answer to my two rhetorical questions is simple enough, and we all know the answer. The answer is that in putting the finishing touches to the most recent Budget-the 1989-90 Budget-it suddenly became obvious to a tired and listless government, stunned by Opposition calls to actually do something about structural economic reform, that there was nothing in the Budget on that subject despite the many hollow claims that the Government had been advancing for the previous two years. So the Treasurer quickly brought before Cabinet a revenue neutral proposal-in other words, one which would not in any way affect the Budget figuring-that could easily be slipped in at the last moment and which could at least give him something with which to try to fend off or, if you like, counterattack the Opposition's condemnation of his total failure in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer's own failure in this area is particularly paramount because for the past two years the Industries Assistance Commission has been within the Treasurer's own portfolio of responsibilities. Prior to that time it was within the portfolio of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, and there was a stand-up, knockdown, dragged-out fight in Cabinet just shortly after the last election when the portfolio responsibility was transferred from Senator Button to Mr Keating. I should say quite frankly that at the time I rather welcomed that change. The handling of the Industries Assistance Commission by Senator Button had been-I should not use too strong language-poor. Little had been achieved after, at that stage, nearly five years under the aegis of Senator Button. I did hope that the transfer to the portfolio responsibility of the Treasurer might result in a major improvement. I thought that perhaps with the wind in the sails of the Commission-applied by the full strength of the Treasurer's Cabinet standing and, I might also say, by a good Department, the Treasury, instead of a rather second rate one behind it-there would be a lift in its game. But there was not a bit of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Few things have been more disappointing in the performance of this Minister in that past two years than the way in which he has neglected this body, the responsibility for which he actively sought and fought in Cabinet just following the last election. I suppose that we have become used now to Mr Keating's substitution of rhetoric for performance. What we have in the case of this Bill is rhetoric.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that we have to start looking at what we are actually about with this piece of legislation. In 1987 Mr Keating said that he had solved the macro-economic problems of Australia-I think that was just before the last election-and that micro-economic reform was to be the hallmark of the third Hawke-Keating Government. He was reported-only a fortnight or so ago-in the Australian on Monday, 22 November, in an interview with Laura Tingle, as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        The most important continuing reform is maintaining the macro-economic policy discipline. That's number one. Macro policy is king, always was king, always will be king.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not `micro'-`macro'. Earlier, in the same article from which I am quoting, the Treasurer is also quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Look, the waterfront has been done to death and overdone. It's small beer compared with macro-economic changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from the fact that we have not had any macro-economic changes from this Treasurer for longer than I care to remember-all we have had is simply the pushing up of interest rates by one notch after another; I suppose we can describe that as a macro-economic change, but it is hardly structural reform through the macro-economic instruments-he is also claiming that the waterfront reform question is small beer. He can go out and tell that to the farmers of this country and, indeed, all the other exporters and the importers of this country whose goods have to pass across waterfronts. They have to pay their tolls to the people who have been extorting tolls from them for decades past; namely, the Waterside Workers Federation and other friends of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, in the words of the Treasurer, we have a back flip: micro-reform is no longer important-small beer. The Treasurer is becoming notorious for what I might call selective interpretation. He fails to mention, in even the most general terms in his recorded interview, that the Industries Assistance Commission-a body for which, I repeat, he is directly responsible in a portfolio sense-on the first page of its annual report for 1988-89, which will be the last report that this body will make if the Treasurer has his way with this Bill, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Information collected by the Commission for its inquiry work and drawn together using the ORANI model, indicates that the removal of major inefficiencies in domestic water transport, international liner shipping, the transport and handling of bulk commodities, domestic and international aviation, road and rail transport could collectively increase gross domestic product (GDP) by around $9 billion annually.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is small beer, as far as the Treasurer is concerned. That is in real terms, of course, not just money. Improved efficiency in the postal, telecommunications and electricity sectors could provide a further stimulus to gross domestic product (GDP) of around $3 billion annually. As a matter of fact, the Industries Assistance Commission has had a great deal to say, in its latest annual report, about the need for micro-economic reform, which the Treasurer now describes as small beer. In all, it calculates that the projected long term impact of various reforms would result in annual gains in real GDP of almost 5 per cent, or $16 billion a year in total. That is not small beer. That would mean a great deal to ordinary Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can talk in these technical terms about GDP and $9 billion a year or $16 billion a year, but what it comes down to in the end is the impact on the average Australian family. The IAC has actually done that calculation for us and calculates that this would amount to over $1,600 a year in real terms for every household in Australia. In addition, it would lead to employment gains equivalent to about 35,000 jobs-jobs which we might be grateful for next year, if the two authors of the New South Wales Labor Council document are correct. They foreshadow the onset of what they call the growth recession and the unemployment they believe that is likely to lead to in the very near future. As well as noting the potential gains from reform of the kind I have referred to, the Industries Assistance Commission has also made a great number of explicit criticisms of the present Government in its annual report. On page 2 of the report it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        If we do not act now-
       </para>
       <para>
        on micro-economic reforms, that is-
       </para>
       <para>
        our competitive position and standard of living are in danger of decline.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our standard of living has been declining in any case, but the report is pointing to the future. Despite views to the contrary from the Government, particularly from perhaps the least adequate Minister in that Government, Mr Willis, the IAC nominates the areas of coastal shipping and privatisation as needing urgent attention. That is its word-urgent. On the second page of its report it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the continuing exclusion of foreign competition means that there is little ongoing incentive for domestic ship operators to keep pace with efficiency improvements abroad.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, the absence of foreign competition removes one of the disciplines for ensuring that the cost savings from reduced crewing levels-
       </para>
       <para>
        and there has been some progress in reducing crewing levels, although the progress has been minuscule-
       </para>
       <para>
        are passed on to users and the community generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, instead of being passed on to the Seamen's Union of Australia and to the shipping companies, which is what happens at the present time. With regard to government business enterprises, the Industries Assistance Commission report notes on page 3:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the absence of competition, the benefits of recent administrative reforms-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, of government business enterprises-
       </para>
       <para>
        are likely to be dissipated as new inefficiencies emerge. Opportunities for efficiency improvements are likely to be overlooked.
       </para>
       <para>
        It continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of the process of increasing competition in services industries, the need for government ownership of enterprises should be reassessed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We all know what the process of assessment of the case for privatisation has resulted in under this Government. It has resulted in handing over the whole process of privatisation, or rather the non-process of privatisation, to the Caucus committee-to Mr Saunderson and others. They will determine whether any such progress should be made and, by and large, their answer to date has been no, there will not be. Again, their trade union affiliates will not let them. They do not care about the consequences of that, as far as costs to the Australian people of the services being provided by the government business enterprises are concerned. What they care about are the people who pay the bills for the Australian Labor Party-the trade unions-particularly now that some of the Labor Party's great and powerful friends are looking a little less great and powerful. If all this is beginning to sound a little familiar, in other words, to sound like the coalition's policies, I simply direct the attention of the Senate to this additional comment on page 28 of the IAC's annual report:
       </para>
       <para>
        The success of many of the reforms discussed so far-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, reforms in relation to coastal shipping, the waterfront, government business enterprises, privatisation and so on-
       </para>
       <para>
        is predicated on a degree of labour market reform. The removal of many restrictive and inflexible work practices is likely to require changes to union structure and coverage in the affected industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, this is not an area on which this Government is ever likely to embark. It sounds familiar because that call parallels almost exactly the call for micro-economic reform to be found in the coalition's Economic Action Plan. That is the only document from either side of this Parliament which has put forward policies as distinct from mere talk from the Government about how much better things will be if the Australian people are so unwise as to re-elect it; just as things have been so much better for the past two and a half years after the equally false promises which were made to the people in July 1987: reform on the waterfront; reform of coastal shipping; privatisation; and labour market reform. These are the policies of the coalition. The Government has no policies in these areas-none.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are, of course, all crucial elements of a strategy which will drag Australia out of the $110 billion foreign debt hole into which this Government has driven us. From a point at which when it took over we had a foreign debt in net terms of $23 billion, we now have one-as at the end of September-of $110 billion. The only way we will have any chance of pulling ourselves back from that abyss is if we raise productivity in this country and make the reforms which are essential to that process, without which that will not be achieved and without which we will never get rid of the high interest rates this Government has imposed upon us as its only weapon, its only economic policy instrument.

        I want to come back to the point where I began on the Industry Commission Bill, namely, the Government's hypocrisy in advancing a Bill of this kind on the ground that it is going to make a significant contribution to the micro-economic restructuring process. I have already pointed to the fact that the Minister assisting in the other place has praised both the major constituent bodies which are to be amalgamated and I asked why, therefore, they should be abolished if they have been doing so well. What is the point of abolishing them? It is just reorganisation for the sake of reorganisation. It is particularly ironic that this is the same Minister, Mr Morris, who actually introduced the Inter-State Commission Bill in 1983. He said at that time:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have great pleasure in bringing before the House-that is the House of Representatives-this Bill which will finally . . . enable us to establish the Inter-State Commission . . . We see the ISC as an important vehicle for promoting the rational development of the national transport policies. The Government's action today fulfils an important election promise in the transport field.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission will be required to carry out wide-ranging investigations covering economic, social, institutional and legal-constitutional issues affecting interstate transport.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister said finally:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no other existing organisation that is equipped, or empowered, to carry out such inquiries. The ISC meets the need for an ongoing independent body that performs theses functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        My, how times have changed. The Government is now going to abolish this essential body and wrap it up in a megalith or, sorry, megabody. Perhaps `megalith' is the right word, as a matter of fact, but I will not stop on that point. The fact is that this Bill is a waste of Parliament's time. The amalgamation of the two existing commissions achieves no real purpose except to allow Mr Hawke and Mr Keating to go out and prate around the country about how they are really doing something about micro-economic reform when, as we all know, in order to do something about micro-economic reform they have to do some hard things and not merely re-arrange the deckchairs on the Titanic. Of course, we have-and I have not referred to it-the constitutional consideration which might be thought to bear upon whether we should be abolishing the Inter-State Commission. I could spend some time on that but I do not propose to as I do not have time to do so now.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said before, it is true that for 60 years or so we have got on without the ISC; I suppose we would have to say that we could not argue too strongly that that in itself is a reason why it should not now be abolished. But I happen to think that the real danger we have is that we will put both these bodies in the portfolio of the Treasurer who has already shown by his performance in handling one of them for the past two years that he does not care a straw about micro-economic reform. He has failed in his administration of the IAC and I predict that he will fail in his administration of the Industry Commission.

         —The Industry Commission Bill 1989 represents, as Senator Stone has said, the amalgamation of the former Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and the Inter-State Commission (ISC) and also reconstructs the new body along somewhat different lines. In that sense, while it may be true, as Senator Stone has said, that it may be merely rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic, one expresses the hope that this body will go somewhat further than that. At least in outline it has that possibility but I will indicate as I go along that we have some concerns about the way in which the body is constituted, the sorts of references it has, and the way in which those references will be put before it. Of course, the term `assistance' has been dropped from the title. I guess that this in itself indicates, to some extent, a broadening of the approach.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Treasurer (Mr Keating), in a press release on 15 August, indicated also a broadening of the functions of the Industry Commission compared to the IAC. He said that he seeks for the new Commission to be restructured `to make it an effective catalyst for change'. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Its charter will be greatly broadened and it will become the Government's major review and inquiry body in industry matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in the view of the Australian Democrats, the charter is unnecessarily restrictive and there is a certain incestuousness about the construction of this body, as I have indicated already, particularly in relation to the appointment of the Commission-its members will be appointed by the Government-and also in relation to setting the terms of reference. For instance, if we look to clause 6 (1) of the Bill we find:
       </para>
       <para>
        The functions of the Commission are:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) to hold inquiries and make reports to the Minister in respect of such matters relating to industry as are referred to it by the Minister . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, there is a narrowness in the way in which references can be put before this body. If we look then at clause 8 we find:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the performance of its functions, the Commission must have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        That may be interpreted as constraining the Commission to frame any report that it might make in terms of the desire, the direction, the philosophy and so on of the Commonwealth Government. Should this Commission see a necessity to report to the Government that perhaps its direction is wrong and that it should take a different direction, I am not sure whether clause 8 (1) does not constrain the Commission in some regard which would prevent that from happening.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the danger is that the Commission may simply become an arm of government policy formation and not, as I and the Democrats believe it should be, an instrument by which there could be a wide-ranging and independent assessment of various aspects of industrial policy and direction, economic policy and the various social and environmental factors which impinge on that. It may recommend directions and policies to the Government which, in some instances, may be quite contrary to the `desire'-to use the word in the Bill-of the Commonwealth Government. We believe that there may be many instances where the Commission should be recommending directions and policies which are quite contrary to those which the Government has taken in the recent past.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that the Government has taken a very anachronistic view of industry. It seems to think, in the broadest sense, that the pattern of the 1950s and 1960s in some way can be recaptured; that that period of rapid growth in the economy, of full employment and rising material consumption, can be reinstated; that the parameters that determined that period in Australia's rapid industrial development can be reinstated and those same conditions re-formed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The directions in which we need to go as we enter the 1990s and into the next century are entirely different. A whole range of factors needs to be taken into account. The Government's pattern in the years since 1984 really has not taken that properly into account. I could instance, as I have on a number of other occasions, the much vaunted Button car plan which, in my view, merely looks at the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country in terms of getting the most efficient production of a limited range of motor vehicle models. Nowhere in that plan was any consideration given to the resource use of motor vehicles and no emphasis was given to the desperate need to come up with efficient motor vehicles, in terms of their fuel consumption, recognising that Australia is becoming less and less self-sufficient in fuel and that we will need to import more and more of our hydrocarbon fuel from overseas which will add to our foreign debt. No consideration was given to the environmental effects of car use-things such as the greenhouse effect and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        So one finds as a consequence of the Button car plan that the most efficient model, in terms of petroleum consumption, manufactured by Mitsubishi-the Mitsubishi Colt-is the one that is likely to go out of production because, under this plan, insufficient Colt models have been sold; whereas the larger models, the gas guzzlers, the ones that will add significantly to our need to import more petroleum, and the ones that will add significantly to urban pollution and greenhouse emissions, will continue to be manufactured. So, if you like, that is a practical example of the way in which this Government, in looking backwards and in instituting the patterns of the past, has failed to recognise some of the important parameters that need to be taken into account in restructuring Australian industry for the future. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris), one also finds these words:
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, Australian industry has been forced to face squarely the imperatives of doing business in an international environment-and it is only in that environment that Australia will be able to provide the basis for sustained and rising living standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, the assumption there is that rising living standards is precisely the same as increased material consumption. Surely it is time to explode the equation that we can in fact have a better quality of life with reduced material consumption. Those things cannot be equated. The Minister further says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Those realities include the need to be more competitive and the need to be more hard-nosed about the use of Government resources. That debate is to be warmly welcomed-and the establishment of the Industry Commission and the transfer of the functions of the Inter-State Commission to that body will allow the Commonwealth to continue to play its major role in the development of sound industry policy in this nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That indicates that, in our view, the Government is really not properly aware of the conditions which will obtain in the 1990s and beyond and is simply ignoring those. The danger is not so much that the Government is not aware of those conditions but that it is now creating a Commission which will be too constrained and unable to take into account those conditions, thereby becoming a catalyst for change and being able to feed into the Government, or report to the Government, in ways which will bring the Government around to recognising the need for change.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to us to be absolutely clear that the disregard in the last three or four decades of the environmental factors in industrial development has resulted in severe and exacerbating damage to the environment on a global scale and that to tackle these matters will require more than merely putting an environmental gloss over business as usual. It is not to be solved by competition. In future we surely must become far more cooperative. Indeed, in recent times we have seen such things as the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. A meeting in Canada earlier this year called for a 20 per cent reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. If the world is going to proceed on a competitive basis, clearly those industries and those countries which can see some short term advantage will not be properly taking into account their environmental responsibilities, and the idea that one should establish industries to be more competitive rather than more cooperative, taking into account the welfare of future generations, again seems to be looking back to the past. But so far this has been the direction of this Government. In our view, it has looked to the past rather than to the future. The restructuring of this commission does not give us a great deal of hope unless the Bill is amended so that the Commission will be able to report more broadly.
       </para>
       <para>
        One could also find examples of the failure of this incestuous relationship with respect to previous inquiries. When the creation of the Fitzgerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies was the subject of debate in this place, I pointed out that I had approached both the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), pointing out that it was necessary that there be a demographer and somebody with a biologist-ecologist type background to sit on that committee so that the committee itself would be aware of when it needed that expertise. That recommendation was rejected by both Ministers. Indeed, as a consequence, we saw the Fitzgerald inquiry into immigration totally ignore the environmental consequences of immigration and come up with a highly suspect conclusion in relation to the economics of immigration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The assumption that economists are jacks of all trades seems to lie behind much that this Government has done. In view of their inability to predict what will happen next week and, indeed, the observation that economists very often-in fact, usually-disagree over explanations of what happened last week indicates that their expertise very often is merely a confident assertion of bias. When one looks at the proposed references which the Government is thinking of putting before this new body, one is also aware of the strong desirability of a wider representation on the Commission and the requirement in the Bill for consideration of environmental and consumer interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        The press release from the Treasurer of 15 August outlines the forward work program of the Industry Commission, the first one of which is `Energy Generation and Distribution'. We should note the words `Energy Generation', because it is abundantly clear to anybody who knows anything about this matter that one cannot generate energy; all one does is simply re-form one form of energy into another. One turns coal into electricity, but energy can neither be created nor destroyed. So the use of the term `energy generation' as though human industry in some way generates energy is itself an indication of the way in which economists understand only the first law of thermodynamics, have no understanding whatsoever of the second law and, indeed, believe in perpetual motion. If one wants two words which more than any others indicate the need for a different input to this Commission, they are the words `energy generation'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Leaving that aside for the moment, this undoubtedly is an extremely important reference. I think Senator Stone mentioned it also in his speech a moment ago. I guess that the Treasurer was really referring to electricity generation rather than energy generation-a common mistake, but again indicative of certain unfortunate attitudes. While electricity generation is in the hands of the States, perhaps the Commonwealth Government is rather loathe to get strongly involved in and to control this area, although I note that placitums (i) and (xx) of section 51 of the Constitution are explicitly written into the Bill. So clearly the Government is recognising that it does have power in those areas if it wishes to use it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nonetheless, one of the major sources of foreign indebtedness in this country at the present time relates to the way that the electricity utilities in the States have gone ahead and built an excess of generating capacity. It has happened in every single State. As a consequence, the States have built up an enormous debt. Some 25 per cent of the cost of any new electricity generating station immediately goes offshore because we do not build heavy generating equipment in this country. As a consequence of that indebtedness, we have had to artificially stimulate the consumption of electricity to generate a cash flow to deal with that problem of very large debt. Electricity is a very expensive form of energy in an absolute sense, and should be reserved for those uses for which other forms of energy are not available.
       </para>
       <para>
        For instance, if one looks at the way in which the Electricity Trust of South Australia has misused the energy which it generates, it is clear that there is the potential for an enormous saving in this area. Some 40 per cent of the electricity generated in South Australia is used in private homes and for residential use-and some 40 per cent of that is used for space heating and water heating. That is an incredibly wasteful way of using electricity and using our primary resources. There are better ways, much more efficient ways, of heating that water. If one looked at the total economics of that generation, one would see that the end use, namely, warm homes and hot water, can be achieved far more cheaply than by using gas to generate electricity, as we do in South Australia, with about 30 per cent efficiency, and then using that electricity to heat water. For instance, using gas directly would achieve about a 60 per cent efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the past, the Federal Government seems to have been unwilling-although I believe it has been able-to direct the States with respect to their management of utilities. It is pleasing to see that this reference will come before this new Commission. Again, I express the hope that this Commission is sufficiently unfettered to recommend firmly to the Federal Government that, indeed, there is a great deal it could do. For example, it could limit the amount of borrowing which the States could undertake to build further generating capacity. In view of the overcapacity that we have in this country, that in itself could substantially delay the building of more power stations and could lead to very substantial increases in efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have indicated already that, in this area of electricity use, one could achieve significant conservation of primary energy-coal, gas or whatever-and improvements in the environment because one is not burning so many resources. At the same time, the cost of this energy delivered in the end use would in fact fall. What concerns me is that one finds in this Government the attitude that conservation-and attention to addressing problems like the greenhouse effect-will necessarily lead to more expensive industries. That is simply untrue. One can achieve improvements in efficiency with present technology; one can achieve reductions in greenhouse emissions; one can achieve reductions in the resource depreciation-and at the same time do that with decreased cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress the point that, if this Government has too close control of the commissioners, the references, and the terms of the reference, then it is possible that that same false attitude, that false assumption, will come through because the Commission will not be in a position to take a wider view of the situation. By way of example, I point out that in the Australian of 8 November 1988, in an article by Lenore Taylor, we find that both Mr Kerin and Senator Cook say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The cost to the economy of saving the environment will be assessed industry by industry under a plan developed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, as part of the campaign to counter the undue influence of the green movement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ministers have asked their departments to undertake a 12 month industry by industry study to put economic value on environmental goals such as clean air and water, or preserved native forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an assumption that it is actually going to cost more to look after the environment. We find in the Australian of Tuesday, 5 December 1989 Mr Kerin saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot afford to wait for conclusive scientific evidence of climate warming.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is talking about the greenhouse effect. To continue:
       </para>
       <para>
        But unlike the Minister for Science, Mr Jones, Mr Kerin was cautious on the desirability of a `carbon tax' on the energy forms that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide.
       </para>
       <para>
        The implication is that these measures would actually increase rather than decrease the cost of industry in protecting the environment. We find also that Mr Barry Jones, an economist with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, speaking at the current conference in Sydney on greenhouse changes in Australia, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Changes in Australia's pattern of energy consumption should be avoided unless the social benefits outweigh the costs . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I could not agree more with that. The implication of what he is saying is that the costs will be excessive. The point that is becoming absolutely clear is that the costs need not be excessive at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also implicit in the economic analysis which is often implicit in these considerations that the conventional economic model can deal adequately with questions such as long term environmental damage. As I have indicated already, economists seem to be aware of the first law of thermodynamics but totally ignorant of the second law. As a consequence, they tend to use discount rates when looking at future environmental damage and bring them back to the present time. The consequence of that is that over any reasonably long period of time-like 40 or 50 years-the future is essentially discounted. Of course, as we now know, that is a totally inappropriate way of addressing those future costs. The assumption behind that discount model is, of course, that the world is infinite and one can always find other resources in which one can invest; and one can then exploit those other resources and continue to have an expanding and growing and more consuming economy. Again, that is totally out of keeping and ignorant of the second law of thermodynamics.
       </para>
       <para>
        The references which the Minister then goes on to give are interesting. Railways, passenger motor vehicles, product liability, and the economics of recycling are all very important and very significant references in which it is important to have an environmental and consumer emphasis. Without that, it is quite possible that, with those references put by a government which is orientated in the way this Government is and which is determining the terms of the reference, the Commission will not be able to report to the Government in ways which will steer the Government toward the new directions which are necessary to face the 1990s and the next century.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a consequence, the Australian Democrats will be moving to amend this legislation. The amendments are to alter the Commission to the extent that, where a matter is referred to the Commission for inquiry and report, the Commission must also inquire into and, in the same report, report on the social and environmental consequences of any recommendations it makes. Interestingly, the Treasurer in his press release No. 96, which is undated, said, among other things:
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed the Commission will be taking into account the Government's social and environmental policy objectives in respect of its inquiries.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is nothing in the Bill which gives effect to that. We will be seeking to write that amendment into the legislation. Moreover, in relation to the Commission itself, we feel that it is desirable-indeed, necessary-that there be commissioners who have knowledge, expertise and experience in the area of consumer and environmental matters. Accordingly, we will be seeking to amend that section of the Bill when we get to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the few moments left to me I want to deal briefly with the Opposition's concern over the Inter-State Commission. Although the Inter-State Commission is mentioned in the Constitution, I understand that it did not come into existence until 1913. Indeed, it fell into disuse again around about 1920. In about 1975 a Bill was passed to reinstate the Commission and it was re-established only in 1984. It seems to me that, under those circumstances, one cannot rest too heavily-and the Opposition, particularly-on the Constitution as a plank for the retention of the Inter-State Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone also mentioned that the Inter-State Commission had been charged with looking at transport. In the last five years I have not seen any marked improvement, particularly in interstate transport. The railways have continued to fall into disrepair and disuse and the highways have been inadequate and dangerous while carrying increasing loads. I see no difficulty in putting that sort of reference into the new Commission and incorporating those matters where they rightly belong-with industry.

         —The Industry Commission Bill 1989 will establish an Industry Commission for the purposes of holding inquiries into matters relating to industry and for related purposes. The Bill also seeks to make other provisions in connection with industry and to repeal the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) Act and parts of the Inter-State Commission Act. Its effect will be, of course, that instead of three bodies-the Industries Assistance Commission, the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit-looking at these matters, there will be one. Why is the Government merging them into one? Senator Stone suggested-and I am sure that this was a strong factor in the decision-that this is in order to give some credibility to the Government's micro-economic campaign. In fact, it is doing nothing about micro-economic reform; it is just talking about it. Nevertheless, this Bill has given the Budget statement something, just something, to indicate that something, just something, is happening in the area of micro-economic reform. We all know that nothing is happening. I do not want to use the terrible analogy about the Titanic but the Government is just reshuffling the pack of cards and not getting anywhere. This Government is just running on the spot, and it is not even doing that very fast. That is one motive.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think there is a second motive. I think the Government has been upset by some of the inquiries and conclusions reached by bodies such as the IAC and the Inter-State Commission and wants them under tighter control. The Government does not want them to make reports which are critical of Government behaviour and performance. I think the Government has worked out that probably one body or commission is easier to control than three. I think that is the second leg of its motive in establishing this single commission. After all, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has boasted that the Reserve Bank of Australia does what he tells it to. I suppose he will now boast that the Industry Commission does what he tells it to. I am sure he would tell it not to come to any conclusions critical of total inaction by the Government. Anyone who examined what was going on in our industry and in our attempts at micro-economic reform would have to say that this Government is doing almost nothing except talk. It does a great deal of that, but there is no serious action.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we approve this Bill, three bodies will be merged into one. Two of them are really very small. The Inter-State Commission has a staff of 18 and the Business Regulation Review Unit, which has already been absorbed into the IAC, had a staff of only 6. The IAC is by far the largest of the three bodies, with a staff of over 200. One matter must be dominant when one looks at this-the urgent need in this country for micro-economic reform and the need for that to happen quickly. People must not just talk about it. A few months ago the Treasurer said that every galah in the pet shop was saying `micro-economic reform'. Maybe the galahs were saying it. I will not be too rude about the members of the Government by comparing them to birds-they may be talking about it but they are not doing anything about it. If we wish to get out of our current economic crisis we must have rapid movement in the area of micro-economic reform. We just cannot go on as we are, with living standards declining nearly every year under this Government and with a debt which has increased by $80,000m since the Hawke Government came to power.
       </para>
       <para>
        By any standards, this is an economic disaster. We are not taking action to get ourselves out of this situation. The need to take action is urgent. We must improve the productivity of our work force. Australians can be very productive. Our agricultural sector is per capita one of the most productive in the world. It is in the areas where we have high union control and centralised management of almost the eastern European model where we are doing very badly, and they are the areas the Government will not tackle. Every time there is a suggestion for reform to eliminate featherbedding it is, I regret, very badly presented by the media. For instance, there is a suggestion that we should get rid of several thousand people on the waterfront who have been doing nothing, or nothing effective, for generations. That is headlined `4,000 Jobs Lost'. But that is not what happens in the economy. If we run a highly inefficient economy we destroy jobs elsewhere. If we can get our waterfront effective by eliminating redundant jobs, we may destroy 4,000 unnecessary jobs on the waterfront but we will create 8,000 or more jobs somewhere else. We must get over the idea that we must give everyone the right to continue forever in his job even though it is no longer necessary or relevant. That is Third World thinking. If we want to run a Third World style economy, which we have on the waterfront and in coastal shipping, we will have Third World living standards, and that is not what the Australian people want.

        I do not want to say too much about Senator Coulter's statement. I thought he said a number of things that were true but they were interspersed with a great deal of rubbish. I do not think I will go down that track, though, no doubt, it will be debated when he moves his amendments at the committee stage. I want to give one example of the Industries Assistance Commission saying things that angered the Government and that may well have been the cause of the decision to merge it with other bodies. It is in a way the Commission's epitaph. The IAC was established to replace the Tariff Board back in 1973. Since it was established it has made over 400 reports on assistance arrangements for various industries. In its latest and final annual report, the IAC has been critical. As I said, I think this attitude might have been the cause of it being closed down and brought under tighter control of the Treasurer. The annual report said about government policies:
       </para>
       <para>
        if we do not act now on micro-economic reform our competitive position and standard of living are in danger of decline and only significant domestic reform can prevent this.
       </para>
       <para>
        Change is too slow. Change is often undermined by misguided attempts to ameliorate the effects of these changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those remarks are absolutely true but I do not think the Government will welcome them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to turn to a particular example of a report by the IAC and its reception by the Government. In July last year the IAC produced its final report on coastal shipping, in my view an excellent report, which clearly described the problems for this country-overmanning, over-generous leave entitlements and first-class accommodation on board. On one of our new ships, for example, every sailor has a single cabin with an en suite bathroom. No other nation offers that standard of accommodation on a modern ship. The result is that it costs $50,000 per person to raise, say, a Swedish ship to a standard acceptable to our sailors. This is absurd. Our seamen also get first class air fares, first class shore accommodation, unwieldly roster systems, an unwieldly employment system through the Seaman's Engagement System, and extraordinary sick leave entitlements. By international standards, a very low level of maintenance and repair work is carried out on board.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these rorts and restrictive work practices were very carefully tabulated by the IAC. It made a strong case for the high costs of Australian shipping to be tackled urgently. It claimed that the excessive costs and poor quality of service jeopardised growth and employment prospects elsewhere in the economy. That is undoubtedly true. We must get that through to the Australian people. If we allow these rorts to go on in key areas of the economy such as the transport or waterfront sectors, jobs elsewhere will be destroyed. Do not talk about jobs lost in coastal shipping; talk about jobs created elsewhere in the economy, because they greatly outnumber the featherbedding jobs in sectors such as transport and the waterfront.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its report the IAC also claimed that the major reason for the high costs and inefficiencies was the lack of competition from foreign flag vessels on the coast. I do not necessarily agree with that. We want competition, and I would like to see the Australian ships providing effective competition. We have to provide competition. We have to provide competition somehow and if we cannot do it ourselves, we have to bring in someone else who will do it. What was the Government's reaction to this report? All the remarks are undoubtedly true. The Government's first reaction was scorn. Senator Robert Ray called the report `a disappointing document, short on independent analysis and riddled with minor factual errors and inconsistencies'. He claimed the report's `simplistic embracing of sectional criticisms' could poison the atmosphere of cooperation the Government had fostered in the industry. I suppose in a way the Government had fostered cooperation in the industry. But that cooperation had the effect of an extortion racket on the remainder of the Australian economy. I suppose that could be described as cooperation, but it is a very odd use of the word.
       </para>
       <para>
        After being scornful of the initial report, guess what the Government's next course was? It called for another report. It set up a task force headed by Mr Deveson. It was carefully organised. No doubt the members of the task force are excellent people but they are all people in the shipping game. As Senator Coulter said, there were no people outside the shipping industry-no shippers, no users of the services, no consumers--

         —Yes. The Chairman was Mr Deveson. But I am talking about the members of the task force, not Mr Deveson, who was in the car manufacturing business. The members of the task force were all members of what might be called the `coastal shipping club'. What we really wanted on the task force were representatives of the users-the shippers or the people in the community who are suffering from the inefficiencies of the coastal shipping system, but we did not have that. Bearing that in mind, it is not surprising that one of the task force's key statements was:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        No member of the Task Force recommends the withdrawal of the cabotage policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the reservation of Australian coastal trade to Australian flag ships. As I said, that is hardly surprising, bearing in mind the composition of the task force. The Government's criticisms have been responded to by the IAC in its final annual report, by pointing out that the Government really wants to keep its friends happy. Yes, it would like to improve efficiency in coastal shipping, but it wants to reserve coastal shipping for Australian ships. The IAC response to this is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Continuing exclusion of foreign competition means that there is little ongoing incentive for domestic ship operators to keep pace with efficiency improvements abroad.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not talking about flag of convenience ships or ships from low wage countries: we are not matching up to the performance of ships from countries as rich or richer than we are with as high, or higher, standard of living than we have. We do not effectively compete with them. Because of that they are not allowed to operate on the Australian coast. The IAC report goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, the absence of foreign competition removes one of the disciplines for ensuring that the cost savings from reduced crewing levels are passed on to users and the community generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone mentioned that. The reduced costs go to the shipping company or perhaps the seamen's union; they are not passed on, as they should be. If we want to be competitive in a competitive world-the great majority of Australian people do want us to be competitive-we cannot afford to go on like this. Our freight rates must compete at an international level. We have a very difficult economy to run based on a long littoral, with great distances between centres of production. If we do not have efficient transport by international standards this economy will not thrive. To allow it to be held to ransom by the people who run coastal shipping is just not acceptable in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The IAC has achieved a great deal, not yet in results but certainly in public awareness. It has shown people, for the first time I think, what really goes on in coastal shipping and what the costs are for the community as a whole. Business communities and Parliament had real information with which to press for real reform in Australian shipping. Even the press, which hardly ever talks about shipping matters, has been calling for reform in this area since the IAC has started to tackle the subject. For instance, the Sydney Morning Herald stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Thanks to the IAC, the extent of the inefficiency in coastal shipping is now properly documented; the obvious, if difficult answer to the problem is set out for all to see. The pressure will build up until genuine reform occurs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ever since, commentators in other papers such as the Age the Australian and the Australian Financial Review have called for urgent attention to micro-economic reform in the shipping area by this dilatory Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the Government doing? It would claim, I am sure, that it has set up a shipping industry reform authority. It will tell people that it is beginning to reduce manning levels on new ships. But at the beginning of this year one ship out of a total coastal fleet of 43 had reduced manning levels. Despite the fact that the Government has heaped scorn on the IAC report, it will say that it is about to extend single voyage permits and perhaps even reintroduce continuous voyage permits to allow some foreign ships, in special circumstances, to operate on the coast. That is only toying with the problem. Through the Maritime Industry Development Committee proposals, the Government hopes to bring manning levels down to 21. There is little magic in this number of 21. As I said, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries which are richer than we are now regard crew sizes of less than 18 as mandatory. At least 23 foreign flag container ships are operating with crews of 16; crews of 14 and even 11 have been trialled. Regrettably, this Government just twiddles its thumbs and talks big about what it has achieved by bringing crew levels down to 21. It is not just a case of running hard to stand still but a case of running slowly and continually falling further behind.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not only a matter of crew numbers, but in Australian ships 2.3 people are required to man every crew billet. This is a matter the Government will not tackle or even discuss as far as I know. Not only are our crews larger, but we must not forget that each crew member costs $150,000 a year. Therefore if a ship has a crew of five, or six more people and 2.3 people are required for each crew billet, the costs are very much higher. That is why our ships are not competitive. The reason we need 2.3 people for each crew billet is that for each year worked Australian seamen have 338 days of holiday. That might sound not unreasonable, but do not forget that we are an internationally competitive economy now. If we are going to give our seamen 338 days leave, we have to look at leave entitlements in comparable countries. Honourable senators must remember that Australian seamen are entitled to 338 days leave for each year worked. In West Germany, with a substantially higher standard of living than we have, the leave entitlement is 174 days. In Japan, which is very much richer than we are, the entitlement is 90 days; in the United Kingdom, 184 days; in the United States, 216. Those are the leave entitlements that their seamen have; ours have 338. Not only are our crews bigger, but 2.3 people are required for each crew billet. If we go on like that, a key area of our economy will never work competitively by international standards. That affects our performance right across the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is only one way that this can be overcome, and that is through genuine competition. Our coastal shipping is a perfect example of exploitation of a labour monopoly. Seamen have used it ruthlessly. They have pared the industry down so that all sorts of cargoes that should go by sea go by land. This is an absurd situation by any rational transport standards. Again, I agree with part of what Senator Coulter has said. We have to use our resources economically. The way to do this is to send cargoes by the more efficient transport means-by sea. This has the secondary effect of not exacerbating the greenhouse effect. We see single containers travelling across the Nullarbor Plain because our shipping industry and ports are too inefficient. That is an absurd use of our transport resources. This is an area which we have to tackle for all sorts of reasons.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the long run, the only way we will get people to be efficient and to stay efficient, and stop the use of a labour monopoly, is to introduce effective competition. I would like to see that competition happen between Australians, as long as it is effective. It will be very difficult to achieve effective competition between Australian firms. If we cannot get it, we must be prepared to introduce international firms in the interests of the whole economy and the Australian community. The IAC, in its final annual report, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Exposure to competition is the most certain means of ensuring that production and distribution are efficient and that the benefits of improved efficiency are passed on to consumers. Reforms which do not embrace the discipline of competition cannot promote efficiency to the full.
       </para>
       <para>
        Seven years of this Government have got us into an economic mess, and we have to tackle a few things seriously. Competition is one thing. Another matter which the Government will not tackle is privatisation of inefficiently run government organisations-not because private monopolies are better than government monopolies; although I think they are a bit, but not much. We must privatise to improve competition. That must be the purpose. We urgently need a total reform of our industrial relations system and work practices. As I said, Australians can be the most productive people in the world per capita, but in the areas which the IAC has been looking at, particularly the waterfront and coastal shipping, our performance is dismal. It is in the interests of all Australians and of the whole Australian economy that these should be tackled quickly and effectively.

         —The Senate is debating the Industry Commission Bill. Over the past 16 years, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) has produced some 400 reports for governments on restructuring arrangements for individual industries in the primary and manufacturing areas. It is now the present Government's intention, via this legislation, to have the functions of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) and the Business Regulation Review Unit absorbed into the Industries Assistance Commission, putting three bodies into one. This amalgamated unit is to be known as the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission, as we are informed, is to become the Government's major review and inquiry body in industry matters.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not support the Government's Industry Commission Bill for three reasons. First, I believe it would be constitutionally incorrect to incorporate the Inter-State Commission into what is essentially a government-controlled body. Secondly, the Government has failed to consult at any stage with the Inter-State Commission with regard to the amalgamation. This matter is referred to in the annual report of the Inter-State Commission. Thirdly, I am of the opinion that it is not in the best interests of Australia's economic development that this amalgamation proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the first point, the Constitution says that there shall be four arms of administration: the Parliament, the Executive Council, the High Court, and the Inter-State Commission. The details are spelt out in section 101 of the Constitution, which charges the Inter-State Commission with `. . . such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder'. Specific functions are given to the Inter-State Commission in respect of transport and commerce under section 102 and 104 of the Constitution. Section 103 gives members of the Commission the same privileges concerning appointment, tenure and remuneration as are given to judges of the High Court of Australia and other Federal judges. Thus, the Inter-State Commission is established by the Constitution and its members have constitutionally guaranteed tenure and remuneration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst the Industry Commission Bill does not repeal those sections governing the salaries of commissioners, their pensions, their right to resign and the provision which says that a member of the Inter-State Commission has, in the performance of his duties, the same protections and immunities as a judge of the High Court, it does repeal the duties of a commissioner and that is where the subtlety lies. The whole structure of the Inter-State Commission is removed by this Bill, including its primary power to conduct inquiries and report to the Government. All the moneys given to it in the present Budget are taken away and given to the Industry Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        I warn the Senate and the people of Australia that if the Government is allowed to do away with the Inter-State Commission by the mere passing of a Bill, all does not augur well for other constitutionally established bodies-perhaps in the most extreme case, even the High Court. If this sort of logic were applied, such a decision could be determined by the whim of a government Bill. The Bill sets a bad precedent and is a bad Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        My second reason for objecting to this Bill is that it was proposed and drafted without any consultation with the Inter-State Commission. The structural adjustment committee of Cabinet was given a brief to look at the future of the IAC. The committee decided to revamp the Industries Assistance Commission by creating a new body, the Industry Commission. This decision was made without any briefing on the potential role of the Inter-State Commission and without any advice from the ISC itself. Only after repeated representations by a commissioner of the ISC to the Government on the matter of a continuing role for the Inter-State Commission did the Government ask for a detailed memorandum addressing the future role of the Inter-State Commission. This memorandum was completed by 21 September 1989 and represents the first opportunity given to the Inter-State Commission to make its case to the Government in relation to the merger with the IAC. So there was not much consultation by the Government with an interested body. I cannot imagine anybody in this place, nor the people those in this House represent, accepting the way that business has been conducted by the Government in this instance.
       </para>
       <para>
        My third reason for objecting to the Bill is that I believe that amalgamation of the Inter-State Commission with the IAC will prove detrimental to the economic development of Australia. The amendment as proposed by the Australian Democrats will not help in this direction. While the Parliament has specified the functions of the Commission from time to time, the constitutional provisions were designed to give the Commission a significant degree of independence, an independence which cannot be conferred on any other body, particularly one designed by this Federal Government as an advisory body.
       </para>
       <para>
        The special role envisaged for the Commission in Federal-State relations, along with its constitutional independence, has led to the Commission's winning the confidence and obtaining the cooperation of the States in Inter-State Commission investigations. For example, the Commission was asked to investigate the efficiency of the handling, storage and movement of cargo through Australian ports and to formulate an integrated industry plan for waterfront reform. This report, which was compiled earlier this year, would not have been possible without the active cooperation of the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other positive attribute of the Inter-State Commission is the fact that it is not purely an economic research body, nor is it subject to following any government policy. It is an independent, investigative body, with a blend of economic, legal and practical business expertise which prides itself on giving practical rather than theoretical advice. In other words, the Commission has been a source of advice of a different kind from that provided by bodies such as the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics and the IAC.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission is able to take the view that some matters are appropriate for uniform Commonwealth legislation, whilst in other matters diversity is the best option. It is its independence from party policies which allows this to happen. The Government's decision to abolish the Inter-State Commission is based on Treasury's attempt to wrap up all the significant advisory bodies with an economic input into government thinking, and thus control and dominate them centrally. The writers of the Constitution saw the need for a qualified, independent body to deal with economic matters in a non-political manner. This need has not changed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the Government and honourable senators that the Inter-State Commission has an important role to play. In essence, that role is to be an objective, arm's length body to examine and advise on matters of trade and commerce that require a balance of national and State interests or of competing State interests. It is to the country's advantage to have a well-qualified, independent body in this role. For that reason, I cannot support the Bill.

        The purpose of the Industry Commission Bill is to bring together into one body what comprises three bodies-namely, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), the Inter-State Commission (ISC) and the Business Regulation Review Unit. The Opposition opposes the Bill for several reasons. Although they have been outlined by other speakers, I think they are of sufficient importance to restate them. The first point to be made is that the amalgamation of these bodies, particularly the IAC and the Inter-State Commission, into the Industry Commission is totally unnecessary. Indeed, it is damaging because it will almost certainly detract from the very important work that each of those bodies is doing. The Industries Assistance Commission, over the 16 years of its existence-and for many years in the form of its predecessor, the Tariff Board, for which I had the pleasure to work for two or three years in the early 1960s-has played a very important role in its existing structure, as has the Inter-State Commission. The move to merge the Inter-State Commission with the IAC is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution-if not actually unconstitutional.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Inter-State Commission were abolished it would, I believe, pose dangers to the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States because many of the Inter-State Commission's functions relate to the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. It is one of the very few Federal bodies that have the very important role of looking at the whole structure of competition and efficiency in State government organisations and instrumentalities, particularly business commercial enterprises. If the Inter-State Commission were abolished, the question we must ask is: What would take its place in the area of the functions of the States and the relationship between the States and the Federal Government?
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent times the Inter-State Commission has played an extremely important role in the transport industry. Its main functions and work in 1988-89 have related to that industry. In that and in other areas the role of the Inter-State Commission is very important to the process of micro-economic reform. I find it incredible that the Government took the decision, as outlined in the Budget Statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to do away with the Inter-State Commission-a body created under the Constitution-without any consultation with the Commission beforehand. The Commission, in its 1988 annual report, which was tabled in the Parliament in the last two or three weeks, made it very clear what it sees as the likely impact and effect on the work it is doing if it ceases to exist and if that work is brought somehow or other into the larger expanded body of the Industry Commission.

        It is a very unusual body. The Inter-State Commission is a unique body which was established by section 101 of the Constitution, which makes the following provision:
       </para>
       <para>
        There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provision of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 103 provides, among other things, that members of the Inter-State Commission shall have tenure and remuneration for seven years and they cannot be removed within that time except on an address from both Houses of Parliament for `proved misbehaviour or incapacity'. In other words, as the Inter-State Commission in its recent annual report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the intention was to establish a body not only with a significant degree of independence but specifically with that independence guaranteed in the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Inter-State Commission ceased to exist between 1920-I think it was-and its revival in 1984 that in no way is a reflection on the nowadays importance and role of the Inter-State Commission. The annual report further states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Since its revival in 1984 . . . the Commission has advised the Federal Government on matters that have had as their central theme the improvement of the efficiency and equity of interstate transport arrangements and the development of a balanced national transport strategy and the infrastructure for implementing that strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its annual report the Commission also makes its view pretty clear on what has been referred to as a merger decision-in other words, the merger between the Commission and the IAC. The report points out that it cannot be regarded as a merger because:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the constitutional position of the Inter-State Commission cannot, of course, be replicated; the institution either exists as the Inter-State Commission or it does not. Although another body could be established to advise on matters relating to interstate transport it would not be the Inter-State Commission, its members would not hold office under the Constitution, and it could not exercise the constitutional powers or functions of the Inter-State Commission, such as those under ss 102 and 104 of the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report also makes the point that the Bill to establish the Industry Commission:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . ignores a number of differences between the Industries Assistance Commission and the Inter-State Commission. Among the distinctive features of the Inter-State Commission are
       </para>
       <para>
        its constitutionally guaranteed independence,
       </para>
       <para>
        its blend of expertise, spanning business, economics and law-
       </para>
       <para>
        in relation to the IAC I believe that there is a blend of experience as well; nevertheless there is a very unusual blend within the Inter-State Commission-
       </para>
       <para>
        its orientation towards practical solutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report makes a point that I think is very important. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission has provided the Federal Government with advice of a nature different from that provided by the various economic research bodies. The location of the Industry Commission in the Treasury portfolio will give that body an essentially economic policy-making focus.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course it will. Therefore, the blend of different experiences and qualities that are now existent in the Inter-State Commission will naturally, if not on day one, with the early effluxion of time, be lost in the larger proposed Industry Commission. It is absolutely clear from the report of the Inter-State Commission that it believes that the Government's proposal contained in the Industry Commission Bill, the subject of this debate, is a bad decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Appendix II to the annual report of the Inter-State Commission is a summary of a lengthy memorandum that the Commission prepared earlier this year exploring the possible future role of the Commission. It is worth quoting paragraph 10 of Appendix II which sums up the Inter-State Commission's view. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The conclusion of the memorandum is that the Inter-State Commission is a unique body whose constitutional status and potential has not been well understood. Since its revival in 1984 it has won a reputation for making balanced and practical assessments of socio-economic problems facing government. Having the confidence of industry and the States, it has considerable potential to develop its intended role in enhancing the functioning of the federal system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the case against the Government's proposal contained in the Industry Commission Bill which we are debating almost rests with that paragraph. I have heard not one significant criticism of the Inter-State Commission in the last two or three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that a few years ago people on this side of the Parliament had very considerable doubts about whether the Inter-State Commission should be revived. I remember being part of that debate in the mid-1970s. The experience that has been gained since the revival of the Inter-State Commission in 1984 has been very positive and worthwhile. Because I think it is a retrograde step, I very much regret that the Government is now proposing in effect, to wipe out the value that has been so clearly demonstrated by the activities and the work of the Inter-State Commission in the last five years. That Commission still has very important work on its plate in the transport area and especially in the area of waterfront reform. From my understanding there seems to be no obvious surety that that very important work will continue if this Bill goes ahead.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes to merge the Business Regulation Review Unit with the IAC. In the Opposition's view that also would be a retrograde step. The Business Regulation Review Unit, very ably led by Dr Allan Moran, has done an excellent job in reviewing and reporting on business regulations. It has a very healthy approach to its tasks. It, too, is a most important part of the machinery to resist the excesses of regulatory government and to assist in fostering a more competitive environment for business to work within by helping cast aside the bureaucratic, regulatory red tape with which we all seem to be near terminally afflicted nowadays. It is no wonder that the long-suffering business sector of the economy is struggling, no wonder its efficiency is not what it should be; no wonder productivity growth in this country is amongst the very lowest in the Western world when we look at what we do to impose regulations, restrictions and hobbles on the business sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Business Regulation Review Unit is one of those very special units of government that has played a very important role and that has a great potential future role to play in helping fight the tide of government regulation. The Bill proposes, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said in his second reading speech, that we would not lose the Business Regulation Review Unit because there would be an office of business regulation, or something like that, created within the Industry Commission. There is no doubt in my mind, and in the Opposition's mind, that to submerge the Business Regulation Review Unit within a much larger organisation would be to guarantee almost certainly the crippling of its capacity to carry out its important role efficiently. For these very good and valid policy and administrative reasons, the Liberal and National parties are opposing the Industry Commission Bill 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are very few sensible rational arguments that can be used to justify the Government's proposal. One is left with the almost inevitable conclusion that the real reasons why the Government has brought forward this Bill is to divert attention from its abject failure to institute meaningful micro-economic reform during its period of government. Despite all the rhetoric and despite all the ballyhoo, when one asks what has actually been achieved in the area of micro-economic reform, the answer is virtually nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The failure of the Government to institute meaningful reform in those areas, which we all know and which the Government itself said in 1987 is the key to the future of the economy, has been a vital reason for the failure of the Australian economy to come to grips with its role and necessary functioning in an increasingly competitive world. At the time of the 1987 election, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) went around trumpeting that micro-economic reform was going to be the task for the new incoming government. The Treasurer was going to be the superman of economic reform. He rolled our friend Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, who held the IAC under his wing, where it had been for a long time.

         —He had not done much with it, that is absolutely true. But we were going to have superman Keating come along and grab the IAC and shake it up. It was going to be the major vehicle for micro-economic reform. It has not been. In saying that, I am not being critical of the IAC as much as I am of the Government, because I think the IAC, in its present form, has played an important role over the last 16 years. It has provided some 400 reports on assistance for particular industries. More recently, and more productively, IAC inquiries have extended to measures impelling adjustment on all sectors of the economy. The annual reporting of the IAC has been a very important function, because through it the Commission has indicated the trends it has monitored in the overall structures of assistance, particularly in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The latest annual report of the IAC provides an excellent example of the work that it has been doing in identifying industry performance measures which would increase gross national product by at least $16 billion, or something like $1,600 per household income per annum. I will come back to this a little later if time permits. That work being done by the IAC cannot, as I said, mask the Government's complete lack of intestinal fortitude when it comes to taking the tough decisions in the key areas of micro-economic reform: transport, shipping, the waterfront, telecommunications and the labour market, to name the most important-although this is by no means a complete list.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One has to ask why there has been such a lack of progress. Two overwhelming reasons seem to stand out. The first reason why there has been such a lack of progress under this Government is that this Government is unequivocally a captive of the leadership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). This is not a Hawke-Keating Government; it is a Hawke-Keating-Kelty Government. If recent events are any guide, we can now add another name to it-it is a Hawke-Keating-Kelty-Abeles Government. That is something that is of very considerable concern, because some of those main players are not elected representatives of the people. If we are going to have a situation in which government in this country-including the whole question of economic policy and economic reform-is dictated to by the ACTU, as it has been now for seven years, it is no wonder we are having the continuing and deepening problems that we are facing as an economy in an internationally competitive and difficult world. No wonder we are not getting anywhere with measures to produce efficiency in government business enterprises; for example, looking seriously at the sale of those enterprises to the private sector. No wonder we are not doing anything about Telecom's first phone monopoly. No wonder we are not doing anything about allowing some foreign competition into our coastal shipping arrangements. One could go on and on with what we should be doing in those areas and what is abjectly not being done.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week the IAC produced three excellent reports on the situation in some of the major industries at which it has been looking. The headlines that those reports occasioned in the press provide very salutary reading because they are fairly accurate reflections of what those three reports have been saying about the whole of the service industry sector and other sectors as well. The services sector collectively occupies something like three quarters of our total economy. The headlines state, `IAC hits Keating's ``faltering reform'' '; `IAC says competition is key to rail, electricity efficiency', and the article says the IAC finds that precious little is being done in those areas; `Public-sector inefficiencies costing billions, says report'; `Competition the lifeblood of future prospects for this country'; `Competition being stifled by lack of movement in micro-economic reform'; `Shake-up for Government enterprises urged, says IAC report'. The report draws attention very interestingly and importantly to the failure of this Government to make virtually any moves to shake up Government enterprises through the privatisation route.
       </para>
       <para>
        One can go on with those headings, but they are all of a very similar nature. The problems are all summed up extremely well in the 1988-89 annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission. I would like to conclude my remarks by quoting a few paragraphs from that report, because I think it is essential reading for all economic policy makers, for the business sector and indeed for the Government which obviously has not been aware of some of the fundamental problems in our community if it is going to go ahead with such ill conceived proposals as the Bill that we have before us, which will subsume the IAC, the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit into some large body which will achieve none of the results that the three have done individually.
       </para>
       <para>
        Chapter one of the annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission says in the first paragraph:
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are to prosper, the economy must become more productive. The search for better ways of doing things must extend to all aspects of economic life. A start has been made in a number of areas but there is still much to be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the services sector the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Within the services sector-
       </para>
       <para>
        which accounts for three-quarters of total economic activity-
       </para>
       <para>
        some priority areas stand out. For instance, an efficient transport sector is essential because of our global isolation, the location of our natural resources and the dispersion of our major population centres.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report also states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Information collected by the Commission  . . . indicates that the removal of major inefficiencies in domestic water transport, international liner shipping, the transport and handling of bulk commodities, domestic and international aviation, road and rail transport could collectively increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by around $9 billion annually. Improved efficiency in the postal, telecommunications and electricity sectors could provide a further stimulus to GDP of around $3 billion annually . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Although services sector reform should be given high priority, continuing action in other areas is also required.
       </para>
       <para>
        It mentions the passenger motor vehicle, textile, clothing and footwear industries and other manufacturing and agricultural industries, saying that if the assistance `which will exist in the mid-1990s at the end of the current program of reductions were removed, GDP would increase by nearly $4 billion annually'. The report points out, as we all know:
       </para>
       <para>
        Reform in many areas of the economy will not be easy or achieved without adjustment costs. But we can no longer allow these costs to unnecessarily slow down the process of change. Microeconomic reform is proceeding apace in other countries. If we do not act now our competitive position and standard of living are in danger of decline. Significant domestic reform can prevent this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The words of the IAC annual report are words that we should all listen to. They are the most damning indictment, in my view, that we have seen for a considerable time about the Government's inactivity and inability to cope with the process of micro-economic reform.

         —The Government has no policies, as my colleague Senator Stone says. It is interesting to note that this is the second major statutory body that has made damning indictments of the Government's approach to economic policy in recent times. The annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia, which was brought down two or three months ago, attracted much debate and attention in this chamber. We are seeing a government that has said one thing-in this case that micro-economic reform will be the salvation of the world-but has failed abjectly to institute any reform in that area. The Treasurer himself, having two years ago placed it at the top of the requirements for the future of this country, is now saying that it is small beer. Nothing could be a more accurate description of the Government's inability to tackle the tasks really facing this country. The Industry Commission Bill, in my view, will make the tasks, which we all accept to be very difficult, much more difficult to tackle and to deal with. For that reason I join other speakers in opposing this Bill.

         —I rise to support my colleague Senator Short and my colleagues on this side of the chamber generally. Senator Short has given an outline of the reasons the Opposition is opposing the creation of this new body, the Industry Commission. I want to add what I believe to be some significant points. It seems to me clear that the creation of the Industry Commission is a stunt by a Government which set out clearly to destroy the capacity of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) to carry out its proper functions. This Government had a total lack of coherent micro-economic measures aimed at fixing the very basis of the problems that are besetting Australia, problems that this Government has, in fact, helped create. It is in this environment that the Government has studiously ignored the great bulk of the recommendations in the Inter-State Commission report into wharves, transport to and from the coast, and so-on. In this sort of environment the Government has pulled a stunt out of its hat to be seen to be doing something about micro-economic reform. This sort of total facade is encapsulated in the nonsensical proposal to create out of various bodies one body which will be-surprise, surprise-under the direct control of the Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission was independent. It had a responsibility under the Constitution. It had a capacity to inquire into things. In fact, as I said, it conducted a very useful inquiry into the waterfront. Of course, we all know the ludicrous response this Government has made to that inquiry into the waterfront. It has agreed to pay out multi-millions of dollars to the unions and the workers involved in the waterfront, without any effective guarantee, as required by that inquiry, that the productivity gains that are so urgently needed will be delivered. The case clearly emerges that this proposal is a stunt to resolve some problems-and I will go into what these problems were-that were developing in various internecine wars within various Public Service departments in this capital, to resolve the Government's total lack of any basic micro-economic policy reforms, behind some sort of veneer of respectability by claiming to be seen to be doing something. It represents yet another attack by this Government on the Constitution of this country. I do not want to go over the top about it, but I must say that David Solomon wrote a very interesting article in the Australian on 15 November which dealt with the constitutional propriety of this kind of move. He asserted:
       </para>
       <para>
        But abolition of the Inter-State Commission and the creation of an awesome precedent is intended to occur before the end of the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was, of course, referring to this legislation that we are now dealing with. He said it was an awesome precedent. Mr Solomon noted:
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the constitutional provisions, the legislation purports to abolish the Inter-State Commission. It repeals, apart from 3 1/2 sections, the whole of the Inter-State Commission Act 1975. This was the law under which the present commissioners were appointed to their office.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a sort of rerun of the Justice Staples situation where, in order to get rid of people, we wipe out the operation. Is there a net benefit? What are the costs and benefits of doing this? It seems to me that the benefits are political only and the costs are economic in the sense that they damage the prospects of micro-economic reform. They damage the prospects of getting State cooperation in a situation where the Inter-State Commission was independent and had the confidence of the State governments, a confidence that is required if the Inter-State Commission is to be able to report on matters which, of course, affect the States as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation seeks to abolish all the duties of Inter-State commissioners but maintains, theoretically, the commissioners. This is just a stunt. Obviously, the purpose is to get them all to resign, to go away. As I recall, they are appointed for seven years. But if the whole structure of the Inter-State Commission is removed, including its primary power to conduct inquiries and to report to the Government, what is the purpose of it? The Commission itself, allegedly an independent body, cannot complain about it. It cannot take any action in the High Court to try to preserve its presence, its status, because the Government in this legislation has taken all its money away from it. Under the present Budget, all the funds are given to the new Industry Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I noted when reading David Solomon's article, the Inter-State commissioners wrote to the Government when it first announced its plans, pointing out the position they appeared to have under the Constitution, but their submissions were rejected out of hand and with little explanation. Obviously, the politics of this matter are that it does not matter a damn what the rights and wrongs of the issue are, whether or not the Inter-State Commission is good or sound or has the confidence and support of the State governments and, in fact, the confidence and support of those people on this side of the House who welcomed its waterfront report. The political necessity for this Government to be seen to be doing something positive overwhelmed all these other considerations, including, as Senator Watson pointed out, the decencies that one would have expected when the commissioners sought to have their point of view at least taken into account.

        One could hardly accuse David Solomon of being a friend or supporter of the coalition, but here he is saying that this legislation demonstrates that the apparent, if not real, meaning of the Constitution can be subverted by a government that has sufficient will. Quite frankly, the Opposition will not be a party to subverting the Constitution in this way. I will not go to the extent of saying that it will be the Inter-State Commission this year and the High Court next year, although some people are making that point.

         —Yes. What is happening now is, clearly, a subversion of the Constitution. No doubt that is one of the reasons the Democrats might find it a useful thing to support. David Solomon says in this article:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission could have, and probably should have, a continuing role in investigating federal issues such as transport and interstate trade. To date, it has suited the Government to ignore its recommendations, including those proposing national drivers' licences.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Government's decision to abolish the commission is not based on what it has done or might do. It seems, rather, to be based on Treasury's attempt-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the Department of the Treasury-
       </para>
       <para>
        to wrap up all the significant advisory bodies with an economic input into Government thinking, and to control and dominate them.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a matter of major concern. It is vital that governments have a range of independent advisory input as well as the sort of input that should come from a proficient, competent bureaucracy. We can see what this Treasurer (Mr Keating) has done to the IAC in the years that it has taken over the IAC from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. It has not simply blunted the IAC as an instrument, as a weapon, of economic reform. It has darn near destroyed the IAC. What sorts of internal battles were involved we can only speculate about, although many journalists have written of the heat in Cabinet discussions and of the warmth of the personality battles, that have gone on, in particular, as I understand it from reading the media, personality battles between Senator Button, for example, and the Treasurer. There is no doubt that this Government's inability to come up with coherent micro-economic reform is because of these internal wars for which the Labor Party has been famous for years but which, by the way, it seems to have been able to sweep under the carpet in recent times to give a veneer of respectability and unity. What has happened to the IAC demonstrates the consequences of these internal battles within the Labor Party. It set out, apparently, to destroy the IAC's effectiveness.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very keen, indeed, to see some kind of genuinely independent advice come to the Government. The Inter-State Commission clearly is independent, and it is intended to be independent. But under this Government, bearing in mind the way in which the IAC has been attacked by this Treasurer, the IAC has not been independent and the Industry Commission is not to be independent. David Solomon makes the point that the Industry Commission will clearly be subject to strong government direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not simply David Solomon who makes this kind of point. In an interesting article in the Business Review Weekly, Chris Wallace points out that, while the Budget is bringing the IAC back from the dead, it is interesting to note the different way, in this legislation, the vital review of micro-economic reform proposals is being handled by this Government.

         —Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was outlining the way in which the Government has created this new structure, the Industry Commission, in order to create an image, an impression, of doing something about micro-economic reform as a way of papering over its hopeless and incompetent failures to do anything constructive about this vital requirement of micro-economic reform, which is central to any economic recovery from Australia's present crisis, particularly its balance of payments crisis. The enormous debt that now hangs over Australia is dominating all our economic activity.

       <para>
        Before dinner I was pointing to an article by Chris Wallace in the Business Review Weekly in which she made some significant points. I want to state them because they support what I was saying before about the Government's deliberate diminution of the status and significance of the Industries Assistance Commission ever since it came under the control of the Treasurer, Mr Keating. The article, by the way, is generally favourably disposed towards the new Industry Commission. She states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The IAC suffered a prolonged period of drift after Keating took it from Senator John Button's Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce . . . after the 1987 election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Tony Cole is the new head of the IAC. In that context the article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        His predecessor, Greg Taylor, now secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, lasted less than a year in the job, during the worst of the IAC's period in the bureaucratic wilderness.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress that the Industries Assistance Commission, a commission with a vitally significant role to play in restructuring this country, as a result of deliberate Government policy has been in the bureaucratic wilderness for the last two years. Is it any wonder that the Government is so hopelessly incompetent in the area of micro-economic reform when its major instrument has been deliberately sabotaged by this Government and is only now being resuscitated by the creation of this new body so the Government can be seen to be doing something about micro-economic reform when, in fact, it has not only done nothing, it has also destroyed the effectiveness of one of its major weapons. Chris Wallace further states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Initially, Keating pursued his micro-economic reform program without much recourse to IAC resources. Perceptions of the Commission's power and significance slid as it was obviously bypassed in the policy-making process, and many good staff left.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It was a text book example of bureaucratic infighting. One can ask why the Treasurer set out to do this. It may have been because the recommendations that the IAC was making were embarrassing not simply to the Government, but also to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which controls the Government-that is the essence of it. If we look at the recommendations in its report on coastal shipping, we see that the ACTU would obviously not like them.

         —It is exactly as Senator Stone interjects. The clear and worrying question is: Why did the Government set out to sabotage the IAC when, theoretically, it was what the Government desperately needed if it was fair dinkum about micro-economic reform? We get the answer again and again-it covers so many areas-`Because the ACTU didn't like it'. What will we have in its place in this new Industry Commission? We will have something that will do as it is told. That clearly emerges. In fact, in Chris Wallace's article, which emerged out of an interview with Mr Tony Cole, who is the new head of this body, the following point is made:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Keating lost the battle to fold into the new body more of his Cabinet colleagues' departmental research bureaus,-
       </para>
       <para>
        but this is the important bit-
       </para>
       <para>
        but he won the war by ensuring that all big research projects would need prior approval from Cabinet's structural adjustment committee. Cole believes that the approval mechanism will keep the various departments from counter-productive duplication of inquiry efforts.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, it will be under simple and direct control; so much for the independence that is required of proper examination and proper advice to a government on this major matter of departmental restructuring which is so essential. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Cole believes that the approval mechanism will keep the various departments from counter-productive duplication of inquiry efforts.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, it is to stop people and other departments from disagreeing with Paul Keating. The article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        As one government source puts it, the IC has to be prepared to fashion the bullets for reformers to fire at vested interest groups: `It has to package its message in a way that is acceptable to politicians, and can be used by them in public debate.'
       </para>
       <para>
        The only politicians who are getting their advice under this Government's proposals are Government politicians. What is being admitted here is that this new body is simply to fashion bullets that the Australian Labor Party particularly wants to serve its own purposes. They generally are purposes that must fit in with what Simon Crean of the ACTU says.

        Cole is acutely aware that he must stimulate the IC to evolve in that direction. `The IAC has been criticised over the years for being too pure, effectively taking a view that as soon as they'd signed off a report that was the end of it . . .
       </para>
       <para>

        That is to Mr Keating. I quoted from those articles to indicate how clearly this Government has set out to damage the IAC, to limit its capacity to be a useful contributor to the micro-economic reform debate. Honourable senators will notice that whenever any organisation such as this comes up with clear attacks on the Government it gets either killed off or massively restructured. We have an article in today's Australian Financial Review headed `Willis labels IAC shipping criticism as ``unfair appreciation'' '. Naughty IAC. It has been vaguely critical of the Government.

It has to package its message in a way that is acceptable to politicians-to Labor politicians, to the Government. That is simply not good enough. Mr Willis's attack on the IAC is ludicrous. I understand that his own Department, or at least government bodies of some kind, held up this IAC report for some months, so naturally when the report eventually came out it was a little behind the times in what had happened in some aspects of Australian shipping. But there is no doubt that the progress already made by the industry, which Mr Willis is boasting about, is massively inadequate if we are going to match what is happening overseas. It is interesting that the annual report of the IAC quite strongly outlines the failure to go far enough. The Australian Financial Review quotes Mr Willis as saying:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . if the Government had opted to allow foreign shipping into Australia, shipping would have been less costly-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is a great concession-
       </para>
       <para>
        but disruption of Australian shipping and transport would have resulted, ``and there would not have been the kind of growth in the Australian shipping industry that we are now seeing''.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are having growth in an industry which is relatively inefficient, which adds massive costs to Australian producers, which helps worsen our balance of payments, why on earth should we be welcoming this growth? It seems to me that Mr Willis has not the faintest idea about what is in Australia's best interests. He certainly does not understand the benefits of micro-economic reform as pointed out in the annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission. This report outlines the extent to which the IAC has done inquiry work that has revealed major inefficiencies, particularly in the services sector, for example shipping. The report says:
       </para>
       <para>
        As services account for three-quarters of economic activity and are embodied in all of our internationally traded goods, removal of these inefficiencies should get very high priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . an efficient transport sector is essential because of our global isolation, the location of our natural resources and the dispersion of major population centres. It will be much harder to improve our trading performance if we maintain transport systems which unnecessarily inflate costs or delay the delivery of goods and services.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the removal of major inefficiencies in domestic water transport, international liner shipping, the transport and handling of bulk commodities, domestic and international aviation, road and rail transport could collectively increase gross domestic product by around $9 billion annually.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, of course, to the benefit of all Australians. It goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        Improved efficiency in the postal, telecommunications and electricity sectors-
       </para>
       <para>
        all basically Federal or State government monopolies-
       </para>
       <para>
        could provide a further stimulus to GDP of around $3 billion annually.
       </para>
       <para>
        Collectively, reforms in the areas that the report outlines could increase gross domestic product by around $16 billion and average household income by more than $1,600 each year. In other words, there is massive benefit to emerge from micro-economic reform. This Government has destroyed the effectiveness of one of its major bodies-the IAC-over the past two years in allegedly having a concern about micro-economic reform. Obviously it has no such concern, otherwise it would not have destroyed the IAC. What it is doing now is simply a public relations stunt. It is creating a new body to give the appearance that it is doing something new. As I have said, what it has done over the past few years is destroy the effectiveness of the IAC. I believe that it is now seeking to destroy the effectiveness of the Inter-State Commission.

         —This legislation, the Industry Commission Bill 1989, typifies this Hawke Labor Government's attitude to the crucial requirement in Australia for so-called micro-economic reform: `Change the name of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) to the Industries Commission'; that is this Government's definition of micro-economic reform. This Bill is simply another bandaid measure by the Hawke Labor Government to cover up the fact that it has made no significant progress with micro-economic reform, which even the Government itself admits is so urgently needed. The amalgamation of the Industries Assistance Commission, the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit into a single Industry Commission is only changing the deckchairs on the Titanic of our economy which is sinking in the sea of world competition. If this Government refuses to act on the recommendations of this new body, as it has failed to act on the recommendations of its three preceding constituent parts to introduce real competition into Australia's product markets and to deregulate our labour market, it will achieve nothing.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has failed to provide an adequate or valid rationale for this initiative. In the light of this its real motivation must come under severe suspicion. The Industries Assistance Commission, the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit have all criticised the inadequate pace of change under this Government towards a freer, less regulated economy. They have roundly criticised the Government for its failure to implement their recommendations for reform. Could it be that the Government sees this amalgamation as a way to mute the criticism? If there is only one body from which to cop criticism-and that a body under tighter government control-the criticism will be less in quantity and less publicly visible than with three separate bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Instead of tackling the hard issues of reform, as recommended by the IAC and the Inter-State Commission, the Government prefers to give large hand-outs of taxpayers' money to prop up ailing industries like Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, the airlines and the waterfront. When the Government reintroduced the Inter-State Commission six years ago it extolled the benefits and virtues of such an organisation and there is no doubt that it has performed its job very well-too well for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) who does not like what the Inter-State Commission has had to say about his economic policies. Now he wants effectively to abolish it and replace it with another organisation over which he will have much greater control. Perhaps his own pique with the Inter-State Commission has been reinforced by Tas Bull of the Waterside Workers Federation who, no doubt, instructed the Government to get rid of it after its report on the waterfront recommended measures to get rid of the cosy union-dominated cartel which costs Australians billions of dollars.
       </para>
       <para>
        So make no mistake; that is what this Bill is all about. It is about dismantling organisations with reputations for fearless and independent analysis. Indeed, the independence of the Inter-State Commission is guaranteed by the Constitution. These bodies have shown themselves to be more interested in guarding the national interest than in stroking the Government's ego. The real danger is that the replacement proposed under this legislation will not be able to do anything that will rock the Government's boat.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Inter-State Commission was specifically required and established by section 101 of the Australian Constitution with:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a constitutionally independent body, the Inter-State Commission has been able to assess the views of everyone concerned and to make balanced and unbiased recommendations which, to use its own words `are sensitive to both industry and community concerns and to the more abstract demands of efficiency and equity'. But the Treasurer, in a statement made on 15 August this year, has made it clear that, through this legislation, the Inter-State Commission is to be absorbed by the new Industry Commission and that that body will absorb the staff and functions of the Inter-State Commission. Of course, he chose not to tell us that the new Industry Commission, unlike the Inter-State Commission, is not a creature of our Constitution and will not have the same constitutionally guaranteed independence as the Inter-State Commission. In fact, the new Industry Commission will be firmly under the control of the Treasury. Furthermore, this amalgamation ignores a number of differences between the Inter-State Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission and was initiated by the Government without any consultation with the Inter-State Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effective abolition of the Inter-State Commission also warrants the strongest condemnation, because it exemplifies the manic determination of this Government to concentrate further power in the hands of the Executive. It is typical of the corporate state mentality of this Government which recognises only big government, big unions and big business. The abolition of the Inter-State Commission flouts the Constitution, which is the very basis of our parliamentary democracy. This sets a dangerous precedent and raises real concerns about this Government's intentions for other institutions established under the Constitution. Will the High Court of Australia-the ultimate protector of our freedoms-be the next to go? The evidence for this is clear. The Inter-State Commission is established under section 101 of the Constitution, as I mentioned earlier. Sections 102 and 104 of the Constitution specify its functions with regard to transport and commerce, while section 103 lays down the same tenure, remuneration and privileges of appointment for members of the Commission as those extended to judges of the High Court and other Federal judges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's proposals strip the rest of the structure of the Commission by repealing those sections of the Inter-State Commission Act 1975 which give it the power to conduct inquiries and report to the Government. This would effectively mean that the commissioners would be without a job-a repeat of the Jim Staples fiasco with regard to the former Conciliation and Arbitration Commission being absorbed into the Industrial Relations Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it seems that the Government will no longer brook any criticism from the Inter-State Commission; likewise with the Industries Assistance Commission, which has been hamstrung in its inquiries as a consequence of its unpalatable recommendations to and criticisms of this Hawke Labor Government. To quote from the recently tabled 1988-89 annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission, `The past year has not been easy for the IAC'. In particular, the IAC expresses concern about matters such as the absence of a forward inquiry program, the referral of industry policy questions to departmental research bureaus and ad hoc bodies, and delays in making appointments needed to meet the Commission's statutory minimum membership requirements. All of this fuelled uncertainty as to the Industries Assistance Commission's future role and its contribution to the micro-economic reform program under this Government's administration. The IAC was also concerned about a proliferation of ad hoc groups and permanent agencies advising on policy, each concerned with a particular part of the micro-economy and not always apparently bringing an economy-wide perspective to bear.
       </para>
       <para>
        So this Government is giving the chop to a body which has provided some 400 reports on assistance arrangements for individual industries in the primary and manufacturing sectors over the past 16 years. A distinguished feature of those reports has been the exceptional clarity of argument which they have contained and their general high quality. That high quality was again evident most recently in the IAC's report on government non-tax charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the real agenda of the Government in establishing the Industry Commission is open to question. It is further open to question because it has failed to give this new body a very important power which was earlier taken away from the IAC, and that is the power to initiate its own inquiries. The earlier removal of this power from the Industries Assistance Commission reduced its independence. When I questioned Minister Button in the recent Senate Estimates Committee A about this, in regard to the forthcoming establishment of the Industry Commission, he confirmed that the Government would not give the new body that independence. This confirms my earlier remarks that the Industry Commission will be more tightly controlled than even the IAC has become.
       </para>
       <para>
        If more sectors of the Australian economy are to become internationally competitive, and thereby develop their export potential, more effort must be devoted to achieving real reductions in protection. This will require greater independence being given to the new Industry Commission. It should have the power to initiate its own inquiries. The provision of this degree of independence to the Industry Commission, by enhancing the transparency of our protection regime, will also strengthen our arguments against those countries such as Japan, the United States of America, and the European Community whose current behaviour with regard to international trade is both irrational and undesirable. Indeed, those countries would be hard pressed to avoid instituting similar independent analyses of their own policies if we did give the capacity to the Industry Commission to initiate its own inquiries. The Government's failure to do so merely underlines that the Hawke Government's attempts at reform of protection are half-baked and timid. The Government's statement in May of last year on micro-economic reform has been falsely touted as fundamental and far-reaching change. Unfortunately, for the people of Australia it has now been shown to be sadly failing in its original agenda.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's so called tops down tariff reform has made industry protection even more haphazard and contradictory. It involves an average cut in protection of 20 per cent stretched out over four years. The Government lacked the nerve to slash tariffs across the board. Perhaps it was chastened by the Whitlam Government's experience when it slashed 25 per cent of tariffs in 1973 and was wrongly blamed for creating unemployment as a result when really the unemployment was created by a wages explosion. The resulting tentative and inadequate attempts at reform have resulted in the creation of at least as many unjustified anomalies in the system as has been rectified. There was a strong case for cutting the protection of highly subsidised industries. But this is not what the Government did. To the contrary, it specifically exempted the worst example of protection and featherbedding from its cuts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Government's attempts at tariff reform have done far too little and have done it far too slowly. Just as protection should never be given selectively, so it should never be taken away by the same method. The best way to help industries become more efficient and assist marginal producers to become more efficient is to cut across the board-not selectively. Most recently, the Garnaut report reinforces all that the Industries Assistance Commission and the Inter-State Commission have said. Garnaut has made it clear that the pace of reform must move far more quickly if Australia is to take advantage of its geographic position in relation to Asia. His report challenges Australia to take up these geographic and economic challenges for the benefit of all industries and, of course, all Australians-in particular, for the benefit of industries, whether they are protected or not.
       </para>
       <para>
        Adoption of the Garnaut report could prove to be Australian's trading lifeline. It will not be an easy one to grasp and, of course, will take courage, which this Government lacks, to see it fully implemented. Garnaut identifies a loss of $20 billion a year through structural inefficiencies in our economy, including trade barriers, and through a failure to exploit the markets of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Change of the magnitude that Garnaut recommends requires us to think about forward looking policies, not only about who can provide the greatest mortgage relief.
       </para>
       <para>
        The massively excessive protection of the textile, clothing and footwear industries, which continues under this Government's timid sectoral plans, alone contributes two percentage points to the consumer price index. Its reduction could contribute significantly to a concerted effort against inflation. Garnaut argues that by the year 2000 all anti-dumping arrangements should be removed. He says that until recently we were the most active country in taking anti-dumping action, partly because Australia had the most inward looking manufacturing sector among all advanced economies. Export compensation is clearly inferior to a freer trade and, like other protection, in the long run is built into the cost structure of our economy so that in the end it is paid by exporters and those who are sufficiently efficient to compete against imports on the domestic market without protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) must do more than simply applaud Dr Garnaut and his report. He must implement the report's major recommendations. This is becoming even more urgent as our failure to change causes us to fall further and further behind our trading partners and our competitors. The latest report of the Industries Assistance Commission reinforces that there has been a relatively small reduction in overall protection, especially of manufacturing industry, while, despite the extravagant claims of the Government, favoured sectors of the Australian economy remain very heavily protected. Over the past year the average effective rate of assistance to manufacturing industries fell from 19 per cent to 17 per cent. In contrast, for agricultural industries it fell from 15 per cent to 9 per cent. So it is still the case that our relatively more efficient farmers are carrying on their well-worn backs this country's economy and the standard of living we all enjoy.
       </para>
       <para>
        More particularly, industries receiving special favours from the Government under its sectoral plans continue to receive exceptionally high levels of assistance. Despite a slight reduction, the motor vehicle and parts industry receives an effective rate of assistance of 70 per cent. The textile industry's protection has actually increased to an effective rate of 74 per cent. There has been a slight fall in the protection of the clothing industry but it still remains at a massive 158 per cent effective rate while the footwear industry's level of assistance has increased to 218 per cent. This is costing Australian consumers an extra $1 billion to $1.5 billion or between $170 and $250 per household in the case of motor vehicles and $1.7 billion of $300 per household in the case of clothing and footwear, each year.
       </para>
       <para>
        People are entitled to know that the overall cost to them of protection of inefficient industries under this Government is about the same as the total cost which sales tax adds to the price of goods. Despite this special treatment, or perhaps because of it, restructuring is occurring too slowly to make these industries internationally competitive. For example, the Automotive Industry Authority found a lack of progress in quality control and a continuing high level of labour turnover in the motor industry-a 35 per cent labour turnover here compared with just 7 per cent in North America. The Bureau of Industry Economics found that the steel industry plan, now mercifully ended, had little effect on the industry's recovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Industries Assistance Commission not only directs our attention to the cost of protecting inefficient industries. It also has identified an extra $9 billion per year in gross domestic product which could be achieved by removing major inefficiencies from out transport sector. Another $3 billion per year in gross domestic product could be gained from improved efficiency in our postal, telecommunications and electricity sectors. These reforms, combined with the removal of industry assistance, would collectively add $16 billion per year to our gross domestic product or $1,600 per year to average household income. To assist in achieving these benefits for every one of us, government business enterprises must also be opened up to competition. Mere administrative reforms will not suffice to achieve the required efficiency.

         —I welcome the support of Senator Alston, who has been putting forward strong and rational arguments for opening up government business enterprises to competition, particularly with regard to the communications industry. So, protection continues in many forms. It is contrary to the interests of the great majority of Australians. They will be best served by improved access on world markets for Australian products which are genuinely competitive and for which we have a comparative economic advantage.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The influencing of the trade policies of countries such as Japan, the United States and the European Community will be of major importance in achieving that access for those products which are competitive. Our capacity to influence the policies of those countries will be significantly reduced if our own house is not in order. Continuing excessive levels of protection demonstrate that our own house is clearly not in order. But the capacity to influence the policies of other countries is not the only reason for putting our house in order by reducing protection. Unilateral action to reduce protection in a more significant way will reduce the cost burden which this protection imposes on our efficient industries-both primary and secondary-which are now competitive on world markets. It will allow those industries to generate the national income and economic growth for Australia of which they are capable. It will also impose greater discipline in the area of wages policy and government expenditure, which, in turn, will further increase the competitiveness of exporters. In turn, that will benefit all Australians through the generation of higher real incomes through greater productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, it is the inadequate record of this Government in proceeding to implement with sufficient rapidity the well researched, rational and viable recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Inter-State Commission which leads the Opposition to suspect the motives behind this legislation and to oppose it. If, as it appears, the legislation passes with the support of the Australian Democrats despite our opposition, then I put the Government on notice that I, in particular, and, I am sure, my Opposition colleagues such as Senator Alston and Senator Stone, will be watching very closely to ensure that there is no interference with the operation of the new Industry Commission. If it is allowed to operate as it should, I will also be watching closely to see whether the Government improves its response rate to the sort of recommendations which I would expect to come forward from the new Industry Commission. Judging by this Government's recent record, I will be watching in vain and I will have to wait for the election of a coalition government, which thankfully now is not far away, to see the pace of change in areas of micro-economic reform and protection increase to the extent required to ensure an adequate standard of living for all Australians in the future.

        It is true that there is provision in the Constitution for an interstate commission. That remained dormant for 74 years. In 1975 the Whitlam Government, for better or worse, passed through the Parliament an Inter-State Commission Act. For more than seven years that was then sat upon by the then coalition Government and not proclaimed. It was finally proclaimed, again for better or worse, in 1983 by the present Government. Because of the Opposition's humbug and hypocrisy it should be put on the record that those opposite, who were in government for most of the 74 years when this constitutional provision was inoperative, sat on it without proclaiming it for more than seven years after the legislation had been passed. This is the same political grouping that then purports to say that the Inter-State Commission is an integral part of the good government of Australia.

The IAC was set up, principally, to obtain a more independent review of industry assistance and, specifically, to stop coalition governments allowing the rorters of the National Party to stand over Liberal governments or coalition governments, as they had been accustomed to doing, and to inform the public more adequately about the macro-economic consequences of government intervention in pricing and marketing--

        (1.) Page 4, after subclause 8 (3), add the following new subclause:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(4) Where a matter is referred to the Commission for inquiry and report, the Commission must also inquire into, and, in the same report, report on, the social and environmental consequences of any recommendations it makes.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        (2.) Page 8, after subclause 16 (1), insert the following new subclause:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(1a) The Commission may hold public seminars, conduct workshops and establish working groups and task forces for the purposes of an inquiry.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        (3.) Page 13, after subclause 28 (1), insert the following new subclause:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(1a) At least one of the Commissioners must be a person who has knowledge of, and at least 3 years experience, in an employed or voluntary capacity, in, environmental matters.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are three amendments. Very briefly, the first one gives effect to the words used by the Minister in one of his press releases that the Commission will take into account the environmental matters when considering any of the references which are put to it. As I indicated in the speech I made at the second reading stage, there was no formal provision within the Bill that that be done. The first amendment, which adds a subclause (4) to clause (8), has that effect, and reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(4) Where a matter is referred to the Commission for inquiry and report, the Commission must also inquire into, and, in the same report, report on, the social and environmental consequences of any recommendations it makes.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        That gives formal recognition to that informal undertaking by the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second amendment referring to page 8, subclause 16 (1), allows a wider range of forms of public inquiry to occur. This has not been mentioned elsewhere. I will just briefly say that concern was expressed by a number of public interest groups in relation to this Bill in that many of these inquiries are of a formal nature and require the submission of fairly lengthy and detailed documents which often puts those in industry at an advantage compared with the smaller public interest groups, such as environment groups. There would be an advantage, therefore, in the Commission being able to hold the wider range of the types of inquiries. From my own experience I know that the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia has held some inquiries of this form where witnesses virtually could cross-examine each other and participate more openly in discussion. We found that particularly useful. We feel that would add to the ability of the Commission to adduce good information and to redress any imbalance between the ability of public interest groups and industry groups to present information.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third amendment relates to page 13, subclause 28 (1) to insert the following subclause:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(1a) At least one of the Commissioners must be a person who has knowledge of, and at least 3 years experience, in an employed or voluntary capacity, in, environmental matters.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        This point was fairly well canvassed in the speech I made during the second reading stage of the Bill. I was very pleased to note in discussion with the Department that it is accepting that environmental considerations are no longer special considerations expressed by special interest groups, that environmental concerns are overarching concerns which impact on every aspect which this Commission is likely to inquire into. That recognition by the Department certainly pleased me a great deal and gave me some hope that this matter will be taken into account in that rather broad way. I commend the three amendments.

         —One of the concerns that I have about the abolition of the Inter-State Commission is that it has a constitutional base and it must have regard to the needs of the various States and to fairness. It must have regard to such questions as the disadvantages that are borne by various States, such as the State of Tasmania and, indeed, the Minister's State of Western Australia, as far as distances are concerned. I am wondering whether the Minister could advise the Committee what approach is likely to be adopted by this new body and what guidelines will be made available to it in the exercise of its functions under this legislation.

         —I do not think Senator Harradine was here when I spoke on the Inter-State Commission in my reply to the second reading debate. It is true that there was some sort of namby-pamby provision in the Constitution for an Inter-State Commission, which was inert for 74 years. Legislation was passed to set it up, for better or for worse, in 1975. It then remained in limbo for a little more than seven years, under the then Government, and the legislation was not proclaimed. In other words, to put it to bed in one or two lines, I do not believe the Inter-State Commission was ever of any consequence. That view is well and truly borne out by the fact that for almost the entire 89 years of the Commonwealth of Australia it did not even exist.

         —There are two other clauses in the Industry Commission Bill to which I do not wish to move amendments but to which I wish to draw the Committee's attention because they are potentially significant. One is clause 26 (2). Clause 26 (1) deals with a person being prejudiced in employment because of assistance given to the Commission in providing evidence to it either in oral or written form. Clause 26 (2) states that that is an offence and that if action is taken against such a person:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . the burden lies on the defendant of establishing that the action was not done for a reason referred to in any of paragraphs (1) (e) to (h) (inclusive).
       </para>
       <para>
        That is clearly a reversal of the onus of proof in relation to such a matter. I gave considerable consideration to this but, on balance, I feel that under the circumstances it is warranted because it is much harder in these cases to prove that an action was taken against a witness and that that was the cause of the dismissal or some penalty than it is for the defendant in such a case to establish the reverse. So, on balance, I think that clause is justified, but I just draw it to the attention of the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other clause to which I wish to draw attention is clause 38, which relates to the suspension and removal from office of a Commissioner or an Associate Commissioner. Clause 38 (1) states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Governor-General may suspend a Commissioner or an Associate Commissioner from office for proved misbehaviour or physical or-
       </para>
       <para>
        and these are the words to which I wish to draw attention-
       </para>
       <para>
        mental incapacity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 38 (2) states that, in such a case:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the ground of the suspension to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 7 sitting days of the House after the suspension.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is still a certain stigma attached to mental incapacity, and the revelation of that as a cause for dismissal before both Houses of parliament may carry some odium. One hopes that, in the exercise of the power to dismiss under that particular clause, that matter will be handled with a certain amount of sensitivity and gentleness on the part of the Government and the Governor-General.

         —The first comment I want to make relating to both the clauses to which Senator Coulter referred is that there are identical or similar clauses in a number of other Acts, including the existing Industries Assistance Commission Act. I think Senator Coulter has misunderstood the intention of the first clause. The intention of the clause is that nobody may be victimised for having given evidence before the Commission. There is a similar, if not identical, clause in the IAC Act. The second clause, which covers the provisions under which a person may be dismissed for misbehaviour or misconduct, or whatever the words used are, is again identical or similar to the clauses which are in a number of existing Acts.

         —I was here when the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) responded to the second reading debate. I want to come back to the question I asked him about the guidelines which the new Industry Commission will have in addressing the matters which have been addressed by the Inter-State Commission. I have the Inter-State Commission annual report, which was tabled, I think, last week. In that report the Commission makes a number of points. It talks of the constitutionally guaranteed independence of the Commission, about what functions it has, and about the investigations and other activities that have been undertaken. It is clear that that body, as it has been constituted-and for a number of other reasons-has an approach in which smaller States and States disadvantaged by reason of distance or water would have some confidence. Incidentally, the report does refer in its introduction to the work of its former President, the Honourable Mr Justice Merv Everett.

         —The fact that we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989, and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 just three weeks before Christmas is a testimony to the bad planning and the confused administration that typifies this Government's legislative program. This is made worse by the fact that two of these Bills, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989, contain extremely important taxation measures which demand serious and considered parliamentary debate.

The Government brutally put the guillotine on it and shoved it through, if I recall correctly, without its even being debated in committee. It is a disgrace and a travesty of the legislative process. It is an affront to parliamentary democracy and highlights the genuine hypocrisy of a government that has been bleating for months about the state of affairs in Queensland, for example. Such obviously curtailed parliamentary debate is a curtailment of democracy.

        I want to begin my discussion of these three Bills by first disposing of the least of them, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I could spend a deal of time no doubt discussing the merits and nuances of that Bill, but priorities demand that I allocate most of my speaking time to the other two more contentious Bills. The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) gives the force of Commonwealth law to protocols recently entered into and which amend the existing comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Singapore on the one hand, and Australia and France on the other. The legislation also seeks to give equal force of law to comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and also between Australia and Thailand, covering all forms of income flowing between Australia and those countries. The coalition parties do not oppose this Bill.

       <para>
        Let me come now to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) which introduces a host of changes to the taxation laws of this country. I will concentrate my remarks on three aspects of the Bill. The first is the new system for the collection of company income tax and the acceleration of the timing of payment of company income tax. The second relates to the changes proposed to render, in respect of companies, the payment of income tax subject to a self-assessment procedure rather than to assessment by the Australian Taxation Office in the first instance. Thirdly, and admittedly a more minor matter, is the deductability of fees charged in relation to taxation advice. As the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989 now stands, we shall not oppose its second reading.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now foreshadow an amendment to that second reading which we shall move at the appropriate time:

       <para>
        At the end of the motion, add: ``, but the Senate:

       </para>
       <para>
        As the second part of that amendment indicates, we will be opposing clause 30 of the Bill when we come to the committee stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        Small business people in particular must have been totally dismayed when they heard the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in his Budget speech this year announce the Government's proposals in relation to the timing of the payment of company income tax. Those proposals were dubbed the killer tax by the Business Review Weekly because, had they stood in their originally announced form, they would have been the killer for a very high proportion of small businesses in this country. Those proposals would have involved a massive acceleration of the payment of company income tax throughout this country, including by the 750,000 or 800,000 relatively small businesses, who do not have large teams of tax accountants at their disposal, unlike the major corporations with which this Government feels so much more comfortable. Under the existing company tax collection arrangements companies and unit trusts taxed as companies with a tax liability of $1,000 or more pay their company income tax in four instalments spread over the 12 months following the end of their income years. For example, a company balancing on 30 June would pay its income tax in the months of August, November, February and May-four instalments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Budget, out of a clear blue sky, without the slightest word of consultation with the business community-not a word-the Treasurer announced these absolutely draconian changes which meant that companies, complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts would be required to pay company income tax in two instalments each year. It might be all right to say that they have to pay two instalments rather than four, but the king hit is that the first of those instalments, as originally announced by the Treasurer, was to be the payment of 85 per cent of the so-called notional tax on which the company would be assessed for the income year just ended-the notional tax in practice being the tax payable for the previous year-with the other 15 per cent nine months later. The company would have the option, if it believed that its so-called notional tax liability was higher than its actual tax liability proved to be, to assess for itself what that liability would be and to pay tax accordingly. Of course, if it took that course it ran the risk of finding that its calculation was in error, and if it was in error by more than the usual 10 per cent then it would be liable to heavy penalties for falsification-as the Taxation Commissioner would no doubt call it-of its estimated tax liability. That was the original proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        It took some time for small business people in this country to understand what the Treasurer was actually proposing for them, and how this would almost certainly have the effect of driving so many of them out of business. Having finished paying the last instalment of their company tax in May this year, those businesses balancing on 30 June would have found that, by 15 July, they would have to pay 85 per cent of the whole of their tax for 1990-91. That was the proposal that this man-the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia-was actually setting out to impose upon all businesses in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        After some time light began to dawn-or perhaps I should say political terror began to dawn-upon the Government's ranks and it began to get the message that this was unlikely to be totally popular with the business community. As a result, it backed off to some degree by announcing some changes which would have had the effect-I will not weary the Senate with the full details-of exempting half of those taxpayers who were not already exempt under these arrangements; that is to say, half of those taxpayers with taxable company incomes of more than $1,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition intervened and, if I may say so, intervened extremely effectively. On the morning of 22 November the Opposition, after consideration by its shadow Cabinet, announced that it proposed that the exemption threshold, which had been announced by the Government in its first backdown, of a taxable amount of $20,000 per year would be quadrupled. On that basis we calculated that about 90 per cent of companies paying tax would be exempt. We also indicated at that time that, because there would have been some relatively modest cost of that measure, that cost should be funded in manners which we indicated, particularly by reversing the notorious Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd decision and by terminating the payment of so-called compensation to the Government's friends in the airline industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Within hours of the Opposition announcing that decision, the Government had made its second and much greater backdown in a statement of some length by the then Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins)-Mr Keating was disporting himself in London or somewhere at the time-virtually throwing in the Government's hand, at least as far as next year is concerned. The Acting Treasurer announced that the threshold below which these new arrangements would not apply would be increased to a tax liability of $400,000, which would be roughly equivalent to a taxable income of about $1m since the tax rate is 39 per cent and that also the so-called 15-day rule, which I mentioned earlier, would be somewhat elongated by rendering the first instalment payable, not within 15 days of the balancing date but within 28 days. So on both these points-but particularly the former; the exemption threshold-the Government, spurred finally into real action by the Opposition's announcement earlier that day, began to see some sense. That is how we have got to the point where we have this legislation before us which contains the final product of that somewhat long, drawn-out exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason I have taken the trouble to spell a bit of that out is that it shows what kind of a government we have in this country today. We all know that the Treasurer's introduction of these measures was one of two major elements introduced into the Budget documents in order to purport to provide a tougher fiscal policy this year than last year simply by pulling forward, as this provision does, into 1989-90 revenue which would otherwise have been collected in 1990-91. That is because some companies which balance early, the so-called early balancers-Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is known to be by far the most important of them balancing on 31 May-would have to pay under the 15-day rule, and, indeed, under the 28-day rule as now amended, 85 per cent of either their notional liability or their personally assessed liability before 30 June. On the original estimates, that was estimated to bring $885m in revenue otherwise payable in 1991 into 1989-90. That is the kind of Budget or financial juggling, financial sleight of hand, for which Mr Keating has become famous, if that is the right word-perhaps `notorious' would be a better one.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now move on to a different aspect of this decision. The Acting Treasurer in his statement on 22 November indicated that these now changed arrangements will apply only in what he calls the transitional year. In other words, the Government's intention is quite clear. But after the election is over, which is putting it another way-he did not use that phrase; he talks about after the end of the transitional year-the Government will in fact be reverting to something like what the Treasurer originally announced in the Budget speech. We will not have this presently comfortable exemption, which the Acting Treasurer calculated as involving 98 per cent of company taxpayers; we will be back to trawling almost all of them back into the net. So if the small business community of this country thinks that somehow it has been let off the hook-I think it can be confirmed that it has been let off the hook temporarily for 12 months-it should be very well aware that the hook is still there and is being sharpened in preparation, should the Australian Labor Party win the next election, which, of course, I do not for one moment think it will. Nevertheless, I think that point should certainly be noted. The coalition will review this whole shambles when it takes office after the next election.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also note another somewhat disturbing feature of the Government's panic decision of 22 November, namely, that no figuring was given for the actual cost to revenue of the decision and by comparison with the Budget proposal. This decision meant that the Budget is that much less in surplus than it would have been, but we have not been told what that diminution in the surplus is. Certainly, the Government has made not the slightest attempt to tell us that it would offset any such loss in revenue by, say, cutting its spending in some area, unlike the Opposition's announcement earlier the say day, to which I have already referred.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to briefly touch on the issue of self-assessment, having already foreshadowed that we will be opposing clause 30. There is considerable concern among tax accountants that the new self-assessment provisions in relation to companies substantially reduce what protection taxpayers presently receive under existing legislation when they make what is called in the accounting parlance a full and true disclosure to the Commissioner of Taxation of contentious issues in their income tax returns. Mr Deputy President, I am sure that you are familiar with very difficult questions of interpretation which arise under the enormous Income Tax Assessment Act which we have today. Even with the technical expertise which big companies at least can call in, companies are often in genuine doubt about how they should treat a particular matter and, therefore, the extent of their liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, what they do today is in effect make a clean breast of it to the Commissioner, saying, `Look, this is the situation and this is the problem. We are not quite sure how we should evaluate this in terms of our liability, but we put the matter before you. We think it should be evaluated in the following way but, of course, you may think differently and in the end you have to make the decision. If we do not like the decision, we have got rights of appeal and all that'. That matter is then, so to speak, fully and truthfully disclosed. The important aspect of that is that under those circumstances the Commissioner does not, of course, have any right to say to the taxpayer, `You have been attempting to cheat', and to impose penalties as a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the amendments contained in this Bill-under the self-assessment procedures contained in this Bill-the act of lodging a return by a corporate taxpayer is deemed to bring into being an assessment by the Commissioner. The act of lodgment by the taxpayer is rendered the same as an assessment by the Commissioner; that is, the legal process involved. But that cuts out these existing protective provisions because, as we understand it and, for example, as the Tax Institute understands it, section 169a (2) does not permit a corporate taxpayer to require the Commissioner to give attention to a matter prior to assessment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the absence of an amendment to that section which might permit corporate taxpayers to require the Commissioner to give attention to a matter before assessment, or at least prior to the date upon which a corporate taxpayer's return is required to be lodged, a corporate taxpayer will now have a greater potential exposure to interest penalties than he has at present and, for that matter, than an individual taxpayer would have. It seems to me that, under the legislation as now drafted by the Government, the corporate taxpayer is between the devil and the deep blue sea: he must file a self-assessed return and pay the tax that the company assesses, but he is not given any means of making a clean breast of a doubtful point and gaining exemption thereby from penalties which, under the law, can now be imposed upon him under the self-assessment procedures if, in fact, he is found by the Commissioner-with all the discretions at his disposal-to have under-assessed. That is rather objectionable-in fact, it is very objectionable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before leaving this Bill, I want to say that we are very glad to see the incorporation in it by the Government of what I might call the `Watson provision'-the provision to allow deductions for expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1989 by taxpayers in connection with the management or administration of income tax affairs. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that this was the subject of a private senator's Bill introduced into this place by Senator Watson not so long ago which I am glad to see the Government has picked up and incorporated into its own legislation. I wish that would happen more often; we would get better laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I turn to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, which is principally an omnibus Bill but which, for the most part, includes a number of quite non-contentious proposals. The Bill's principal purposes are: the extension from 30 June 1991 to 30 June 1993 of the 150 per cent research and development deduction scheme and to 30 June 1995 of a reduced rate of 125 per cent on that scheme; and a number of other minor changes relating to the concessional taxation treatment of research and development expenditure. In addition, there are a number of minor matters which I do not think time will permit me to enumerate at length.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will make a couple of short comments. First, in relation to the research and development concessions, the cost to revenue of that extension is to be $200m in each of the years 1992-93 and 1993-94 and $120m in each of the years 1994-95 and 1995-96, because the rate is then reduced from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. That is a very substantial financial impact. I note, for example, that private sector research and development rose from $646m in 1984-85 to $1,070m in 1986-87, two years later. That was, one might say, a successful outcome because research and development expenditure increased by $423m in those two years. But I point out that the cost to the Government, to the taxpayers, was $310m in that time. Some people would question whether that was a particularly profitable trade-off as far as the general body of taxpayers is concerned. We will be wanting to have a very thorough and objective look at these provisions in due course because it is not altogether clear that what is happening in that area at the moment is totally defensible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I want to note some difficulties arising from the Bill's capital gains tax provisions for the long term leases of land. The Bill seeks to amend the capital gains provisions-and this is a rather technical matter; I apologise for that but it is an important matter-relating to the treatment of the premiums received by a taxpayer on the grant of a long term lease or sublease of land. Under the existing provisions of the capital gains law the grant of a lease or sublease is taken to constitute the disposal of an asset for a consideration, and that consideration is taken to be the premium paid or payable for the grant of the lease. The only costs now which are allowed to be offset against that premium are costs associated with the grant of the lease or sublease-presumably contracting costs, payments to solicitors and so on. Only those are included in the cost base of the asset deemed to have been disposed of. The effect is to treat most of the premium as a capital gain and to tax it accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment will allow a taxpayer after 16 November 1988 to elect to have the grant of the lease or sublease treated as a disposal of the underlying freehold or leasehold interest in the land, but only where that lease or sublease is granted for more than 50 years on terms that are substantially the same as those which attach to the underlying freehold or leasehold inherent in the land. One can see, in a sense, the logic of that, so far as it goes. In so far as we are talking about an actual lease proposal, the logic of the matter is that the taxpayer continues to be the owner of the land and, therefore, is not, in a sense, permitted to set off against the premium he receives for the lease the cost of the land itself because he continues to own the land although he has leased it to somebody else. As I say, one can find that defensible.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is indefensible is the situation of a sublessor who has himself purchased a lease for a consideration and who then sublets that property and acquires a premium for doing so but is now wholly taxed for capital gains purposes on that premium and is not allowed to offset against that the cost of the lease. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President-and I will put it to the Government in due course-that this is quite inequitable. I can accept the logic of the Government where we are talking about a lessor because, as I say, he remains the owner of the land in question and, therefore, it would not be right for him to be able to offset against the premium received for the lease the cost of land because he still owns the land. But a lessee who has himself paid a premium to gain the lease of the land but who then sublets it is going to be taxed on the premium he receives for subletting but there will be no allowance made for the cost to him of the lease which he has purchased in the first place. That seems to be totally indefensible. In due course, I want to hear the Government respond to that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        I therefore foreshadow that I shall be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill also. The amendment reads:

         —The Senate is considering the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) but because of the time limitation and the fact that we are debating three allied Bills which have an extensive coverage, my comments will be restricted to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5), which covers the new arrangements for the collection of tax by companies. However, before I go on to that, may I say that perhaps the only really good feature of this package before the Senate tonight is that Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) picks up my private member's Bill, which was introduced in the Senate in May and which was passed unanimously in this place. We have the most unusual situation of a Labor Treasurer incorporating the thrust of a tax Bill from a member of the Liberal Party into a Labor Budget.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The good news is that as from 1 July 1989 expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in complying with all Australian taxation laws will be deductable for income tax purposes. The costs of preparing and prosecuting an objection or appeal against a determination made under an Australian tax law and in seeking advice on the taxpayer's business and financial dealings will also be deductable. The allowable expenditure will be confined to payments to registered tax agents or to solicitors or barristers who are exempt from the requirement to register as tax agents but will include expenditure incurred where the relevant services are provided by employees of the taxpayer. Unfortunately, the Bill does not use my identical words in all circumstances. I think there is an unfortunate unintended consequence in the drafting. If we had an over-zealous Commissioner of Taxation we could quite easily have a situation where a taxpayer had a problem because of undisclosed interest of perhaps $1 in a bank account. This could certainly negate the provisions of this Bill if literally interpreted.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must commend the Government for finally-and the emphasis has to be on `finally'-listening to the business community and others and making changes to what the Business Review Weekly referred to as this `killer tax' arrangement announced in the Budget and originally incorporated into the Government's Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). The Government's constancy of change in this issue from Budget time onwards indicates to the community that the Government and the bureaucracy have little appreciation of how businesses are run.
       </para>
       <para>
        The original changes to the collection of company tax were announced in the August Budget. We understand that the idea was from a junior Treasury official. But it was not until 2 November, almost three months later, that the Government acknowledged that it had not thought out the economic and business implications of these Budget proposals. So the grand change was made. In fact, the changes were not really so grand for most businesses. In effect, they amounted to little more than minor changes. It was announced that companies with a tax bill of less than $20,000 would be given a reprieve and an option of six months until 15 December to pay 100 per cent of their tax bill. The rules for balancing companies were also changed. However, the companies that pay $20,000 tax or less are really quite small companies. Their problems, consequently, for financing are comparably smaller. Much has been made of the relief given to small business by the changes proposed in this Bill allowing companies with an annual tax liability of less than $20,000 up to 15 December to pay the full 100 per cent of the liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the relief given is very much a token gesture on the part of the Government because the Government completely ignored the submissions from the entire business community with regard to cash flow and major liquidity problems that Australian companies are destined to face from having to pay a double tax in the one year-the last quarterly tax payments from May in the previous arrangement and then 85 per cent of their tax by mid-July.
       </para>
       <para>
        I point out that 15 different industry associations presented, in October, a unified submission. These industry associations included the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers. While I and others in the Senate maintained a regular questioning of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), finally on 22 November-after the Opposition again pointed out the inadequacies of this tax in the other place and the need for amendments to this killer tax-the Government finally looked at this killer tax again and allowed a five-month extension for all businesses with tax commitments of $400,000 and under. Also, it extended by a further 13 days the previous 15-day rule for payment.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I must remind the Senate that these latter provisions are merely transitional. The other unforgiveable aspect of these provisions is that they were not even costed. We are constantly harassed by this Government about the need to cost all of our proposals; yet a momentous decision is made by the Government on the run and without adequate costing. It is an absolute disgrace given the amount of time that the Government considered this whole thing. Mr Dawkins admitted that these changes were made on the basis of submissions put by leading business groups-quite true. But this statement certainly indicates that the Government was previously not aware of the impact of the original tax regime on companies. The Government showed a distinct disregard for the harsh realities of the commercial world. Again, it showed the Government to be naive in its understanding of how business works.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, with the legislation before us there will still be cash flow problems because very large companies, those with tax bills over $400,000, will still be required to pay the full 85 per cent of their tax commitment on 28 July and to pay the remainder in the following year. I remind the Senate again that this $400,000 figure is merely a one-off or a transitional arrangement. We await the Government's announcement on what the permanent taxation effects on companies will be. For these large companies to have such a large amount taken out of their cash flow at one point of time can only result in the deferral of investment opportunities and the possible loss of business opportunities. Unfortunately, as a result of high interest rates and government action in the taxation field, we have seen a decline in the number of investment decisions and in the amount put forward for investment, but consumer expenditure has continued to move on unabated.
       </para>
       <para>
        It could be a bitter pill for many small businesses to swallow in the present economic climate. In 25 years, our economy has gone from an inflation rate in 1963 of 0.4 per cent to 8 per cent in 1989; a housing loan rate of 5.25 per cent to 17 per cent; and a current account deficit of $457m to $18 billion. Relief has been given to 98 per cent of companies for only one year. It seems coincidental, or it may be the result of unintended consequences, that Australia's largest company, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, with a tax commitment of approximately $536m, which happens to balance on 31 May and thus will have to pay 85 per cent of its tax commitment by 28 June, will give the Government a windfall revenue of approximately $456m towards its overall Budget surplus this financial year. It is this sort of Government action that is so detrimental to the future of Australia. This Government is collecting a maximum amount of revenue under unreal circumstances and is displaying a complete lack of concern for business and knowledge of how business works.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of the Treasury has extended the 15-day rule for payment by 13 days. Mr Dawkins stated that this was a positive approach. However, the extension was given not because business requirements were being considered but because of the `substantial implications for Budget revenue'. Many of the objections that applied to the 15-day rule could still apply to the extended 28-day rule for payment of the tax. It is still too short a timeframe in which to complete all the necessary paper work and discussions concerning the tax payment, especially when coupled with the self-assessment procedure which I will discuss later on.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Australian Society of Accountants, with most corporations the auditor has a role in determining the corporation's net profit. Often it would be August before the auditor and the corporation's office could complete their discussions about contentious items, the recognition of profit and so on. Further, it would still be difficult to try to estimate company tax only four weeks after balance date because companies working on a three-month payment system would be paying tax before all the money could be collected. Most accountants in the suburbs have between 40 and 60 clients and the timeframe given is still not long enough to service them all. Yet the only way a business can make a proper estimate of its tax liability is to call in an accountant and get expert advice, particularly when one reads the self-assessment provisions. The provisions, coupled with the self-assessment provisions which are embodied in the legislation, are indeed onerous.
       </para>
       <para>
        Companies with large stock inflows and outflows that bear a complex relationship to profit will find it difficult to assess their tax liability. Price sheets have to be finished and profit needs to be assessed. It is necessary for the Government to consider business requirements when considering this time limit, certainly under its new legislation. It is too late for those 2 per cent of companies. As I have said, most businesses would see a longer period as the minimum timeframe.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the old system, interest on borrowed funds, by default, tended to be tax deductable. That was not the law but it tended to be the practice because of the difficulty of trying to identify the borrowings. But now the Australian Taxation Office has advised that the current policy is not to allow deductions for interest on money borrowed to pay tax. However, we have a conflict because the Acting Treasurer stated at the time that the policy was under review. How do businesses know where they stand, particularly in relation to self-assessment, when the Taxation Office can go back under the revised timeframes of audit and disallow with penalty when companies in a permanent overdraft situation claim interest on their borrowings to pay tax as a deductable item?
       </para>
       <para>
        Until now the Taxation Office has advised that in order to get a deduction for any claim, it must be shown that the claim is instrumental in generating assessable income. If companies borrow to pay their tax bill that is not contributing to assessable income. That has always been the law; it has not changed. It was more honoured in the breach than in the observance because of this difficulty of being able to identify the category into which a company falls. In all my years and with my knowledge of tax, I do not think that I could identify one particular company that has fallen into that category. Because of the new provisions, companies will certainly be under notice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Companies will now need to demonstrate clearly that the money is being borrowed to produce assessable income or is necessary for the carrying on of the business. The proposal seems to be quite unfair. The payment of tax is just another incident of being in business. It has been estimated that the lack of tax deductability could add 2 per cent or more to the corporate tax rate of 39 per cent. It will threaten to extract an extra $650m in a full year from the corporate sector into the Treasury, adding another 6 per cent to the company tax collections of $11.36m estimated in the 1989-90 Budget. Therefore, I call for an amendment to section 51 immediately to allow interest on borrowings to be tax deductable to enable companies to pay their tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian proposal goes against the general trend of tax law in both Britain and the United States of America, where corporate expenses generally are deductable for taxation purposes. The only exception in the United States is a penalty interest charge for underpayment of tax. The Australian Taxation Office already gets taxpayers both coming and going: late payment interest cannot be deducted and interest paid by the Tax Office to taxpayers is assessable as income and is thus taxed. The present position is not a level playing field. I believe that not allowing interest on borrowings to pay tax is an inequitable step. Businesses will need to use cash from sales to pay tax and to use borrowings for wages and investment. Cash flows will need to be meticulously planned. But can companies plan and survive the unexpected-for example, the devastating effects of the pilots dispute?
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, for a business which is always in an overdraft situation, how will the interest applicable to tax payments be calculated in the absence of apportionment provisions? There is a definite need for companies to be allowed to write off interest on borrowings for tax payments. Given today's steep interest rates there will be little to choose between paying a penalty, which is at a rate of 20 per cent, or paying interest if the tax deduction on borrowings to pay the tax is not allowed. If companies can survive the forward payment of tax, inevitably they will have to pass on the cost of higher borrowings in prices for goods and services which ultimately will cause an inflationary reaction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those companies which have to pay 85 per cent tax generally on 28 July or, in the case of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd on 28 June because of the substituted accounting period, are definitely disadvantaged when compared to those companies paying the whole 100 per cent tax liability on 15 December. In the interests of equity between taxpayers, I suggest that all groups should pay along the lines of the old quarterly basis. Senator Walsh could quite easily bring the date forward-for example, with the first payment being 40 per cent, the second 30 per cent, the third 20 per cent and the last 10 per cent-without making horrendous changes to the old provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to make a few comments in relation to the new self-assessment arrangements which I see as quite inequitable. Companies now have a choice as to how they estimate their tax liability: they can use the previous year's assessment or provide a new one. If the new assessment proves to be inaccurate by 10 per cent or more, a penalty of up to 20 per cent applies. Companies that are struggling may find that they will be overpaying their tax liability by 30 per cent or 40 per cent when they have to rely on last year's results because of the tight time-frames. Companies that have falling incomes should be the last ones that should be paying too much tax. They may get a refund later. In many cases it could well be too late. Thus, there is a high probability of a greater tax payment as a result of penalties incurred through what I call full disclosure and, maybe, honest mistakes. Little time has been allowed for the introduction of what I refer to as a confident self-assessment system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Few corporate taxpayers fully understand this new process and their obligations, and they are certainly not aware of their rights. There is a need for a process, which is lacking in this legislation, which requires careful thought and consideration with regard to taxpayers because self-assessment requires certainty, not the discretion of the Commissioner no matter how objectively he administers the system. Further, companies with overseas branches and networks and companies with wide variations from year to year are going to have some problems. The possible difficulties with the Australian Taxation Office over the self-assessment procedure have come to my notice. Consequently the receipt of tax will not be dependent, as a result of this legislation, on the prior issue of a notice of assessment. The Tax Commissioner sees this as a very important step towards increasing the efficiency of the system of tax administration, as does the majority of the accounting profession. It certainly is the way to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Tax Commissioner has indicated that he will continue to consult with taxation practitioners to establish what further changes are needed to make self-assessment in its totality work, the arrangements have not been finalised. I contend that they should have been finalised before this Bill was introduced into this place. When partial self-assessment was introduced in 1985-86 there was no consultation with those in the general community concerned with taxation. Naturally there were difficulties in the system, and it was not the full-blown self-assessment that we have here tonight. In 1985 it was a modified system of self-assessment. We have before us tonight a Bill relating to companies and complete self-assessment in terms of section 166a which, in summary, says that the Commissioner is deemed to have made an assessment after an entity furnishes a report as required, fulfilling the requirement of subsections (a) and (b). In such instances there is no piece of paper issued as in the form of the traditional assessment. However, the Commissioner is looking, I understand, to the creation of some sort of a document.
       </para>
       <para>
        As legislators we are put in a dilemma because we do not have that document and we do not know what it is all about or what it requires. So we have a Budget Bill before us tonight but not a tax Bill. We have a situation where the Treasurer (Mr Keating) believes it is the responsibility of the Commissioner to determine the fundamental policy in relation to the administration of the income tax legislation. The administration of tax must rest with the Commissioner. There are circumstances, we acknowledge, where the Commissioner does need wider powers for investigations into fraud and evasion. In all other cases the taxpayer needs far greater rights, but he does not have them. We have a situation nowadays where the taxpayer is shown what his obligations are, but he does not have any rights. That is a complete abrogation of democratic principles.
       </para>
       <para>
        To recapitulate, the tax decisions involving administration should always be the responsibility of the Commissioner of Taxation. But other areas involving tax decisions relating to policy-I am distinguishing between administration and policy-should involve recommendations from a wider area, or from a tax policy division. We are therefore being asked tonight to pass full-blown self-assessment, something which is in advance of what applies to individuals, and yet we are not even given an aide-memoire. We are not advised that others within the profession have been adequately consulted; we are merely told that there is an intention to consult at a future time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Taxation Institute of Australia advises that full self-assessment is a process which requires careful thought and consultation with taxpayers, a process which, at best, to date has occurred only partially. It advises that self-assessment will require certainty, not a reliance upon the Commissioner of Taxation, no matter how objectively he administers the law. All people associated with the administration of income tax should be aware that self-assessment will greatly improve the efficiency of the administration and collection of income tax, but there are problems for taxpayers' individual rights. While the Government believes that the Taxation Institute is supporting self-assessment-and indeed this is the logical direction in which we must ultimately move-the Institute further indicates that there are deficiencies in the legislative process before us which reflect a lack of preparedness to consult in a timely way with outside experts who are prepared to provide objective input.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not surprising that the Opposition has put up this amendment. We regret that it will not be supported by the Australian Democrats, the so-called protectors of people's rights, and we are disappointed that the Government will not accede to our request. We agree with the Institute that this issue is so fundamental that there should be a bipartisan approach to its implementation. We were prepared to provide an input. We were prepared to send the matter off to a committee for further evaluation, but the Democrats were not. We were prepared to pass the tax compliance and tax collecting provisions of this legislation and we were prepared to have a committee report to ensure that there was adequate coverage and an orderly development of the self-assessment system. But the Government was not prepared to help. It was not prepared to ensure that taxpayers were not going to be overridden by the Taxation Office. However, I think there will be an attempt at some consultation. I only hope that it is full and complete.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to meet the legitimate claims of the sorts of people who will be given advice on this provision, this issue really should be deferred until there is adequate consultation leading to the proper implementation of a full self-assessment system for companies. Self-assessment is covered by clauses 13 to 27, 29 to 32, 40 and 41, and 51 and 52. Honourable senators will note that in our amendment we have not gone as far as seeking the deletion of all of those provisions. In fact, we have just related it to one particular provision. The concept behind the philosophy is that we do not want to be seen as not supporting the principle of self-assessment; rather, we wish to draw attention to a deficiency within the system. It is not done with a lack of knowledge; it is done with the deliberate intent of showing that we understand what is required. We understand the need for the introduction of full assessment, but it must be accompanied by adequate consultation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Changes to both the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Taxation Administration Act are needed in a legislative form to show the bona fides of the Government and the Commissioner of Taxation to consult with taxation agents and professionals in the industry, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Taxation Institute, the Australian Society of Accountants and others. The problem is that, under taxation administration, taxation commissioners' discretions do not fit easily with self-assessment. Therefore, we are contending that there has to be a mechanism to ensure that the internal arrangements within the Australian Taxation Office are so rearranged as to cope with self-assessments and are fair and reasonable so far as taxpayers are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of problems. We understand that the Tax Commissioner is reviewing the question of providing an avenue by means of remission of interest payable where an assessment is amended, to encourage businesses subject to the new self-assessment system to lodge these requests ahead of their returns. But this new ruling masks a major problem with the new self-assessment program. Many tax commissioners believe that the Tax Office will be swamped with requests for rulings and will be unable to provide clarification within a reasonable period, thus leaving companies in the dark. With only a short time to go before the new system is in place and no binding rulings as yet issued, companies have no guarantee of protection.

         —Before I address the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989 and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, I would like to add my support to what Senator Stone said this evening about the management of Government Business. These three important Bills have been introduced at a time when the Senate should already have risen. The House of Representatives has risen. However, the Bills could pass backwards and forwards between the House of Representatives and the Senate and, therefore, the House of Representatives may be recalled towards the end of the year. It is a case of total mismanagement. It amazes me that, in such enlightened times, we came back after a winter recess of some two months, sat and listened to the Government's Budget, did nothing for the rest of the week, got up for a fortnight and then came back for another two weeks of doing nothing while the Government sold its Budget. We now have 44 Bills before us that the Government considers very important and we must deal with them in the dying moments of this year and of the decade.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I wish to direct my remarks to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). I will further define my area of interest to the changes in: firstly, the company collection of tax; secondly, self-assessment; thirdly, the amendment of assessments; and, fourthly, deductability for the cost of tax advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Probably the most far reaching measure of this legislation is the earlier collection of company tax. This measure is designed to bring forward the collection of taxes in general but, in the short term, it is to bolster this financial year's Budget surplus. This measure is also one of a long line of earlier tax collections, such as prescribed payments and the fortnightly remittance of pay as you earn collections, whose purpose is to quickly supply money for this Government's ever increasing social security bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        These moves pretend to remove advantages enjoyed by companies in the payment of tax-that is, by the earlier collection of company tax-in the name of levelling the playing field. I thought we had a level playing field in the collection of company tax with the quarterly payment of company tax that has existed for quite a few years. But no, this Government had to do it differently. The results of this measure alone will add $880m to the Budget surplus. In the following year, the measure will bring in another $130m. The $880m is a one-off sum which will be paid by companies that close off their financial year before 30 June-in other words, by 30 April and 31 May. I understand that the companies that do that are subsidiaries of overseas companies. They do their end of financial year returns to work in with the overseas owned company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill puts into effect the collection of 85 per cent of a company's tax within 28 days of the end of the financial year. When the Bill was first proposed, that time was to be 15 days. It seems that the Government had second thoughts and extended that period to 28 days after the end of each financial year. The final 15 per cent of the company tax is to be collected by the fifteenth of the ninth month after the close of that financial year. I know that the 28 July tax bill for 30 June financial year payment can be calculated on a notional basis; in other words, the company can pay tax on the previous year's income and adjustments to it are made later. That is all very well if the income for that year is likely to be higher. The company would then pay a lesser amount than it would pay be assessment, by calculating the amount payable on actual balances. But if the income for that year is reduced and a company uses the notional system of paying 85 per cent of its tax, it is penalised by giving the Australian Taxation Office an interest-free loan which will not be recalculated again until the fifteenth of the ninth month after the close of the financial year. In the case of 30 June, the relevant date is 15 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        The requirement that all the accounting be done within 28 days will have an enormous impact on the accounting profession. It is already overloaded. Although it is an expanding profession, it is vastly overloaded, even without this measure that will require it to calculate a company's tax liability in 28 days, let alone the previously intended 15 days. The accounting profession is already doing a massive amount of work to comply with other measures brought in by this Government requiring substantiation of figures and the increasing paperwork associated with the capital gains tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The capital gains tax has had quite a lot of publicity lately, mainly because the coalition has a policy to change it to a speculative gains tax when we get into government. The problem with the capital gains tax measure lies in keeping track of what is going on-not so much with the purchase of a farm, block of units or a piece of ground in the central business district of Canberra or elsewhere, but with the purchase of shares. We may buy a parcel of shares for which, we hope, we receive a dividend every year. In many cases, dividends are reinvested and we may get a new certificate every year. We might buy more shares with the dividends received so that five or six pieces of scrip may come in every year. They will have to be recorded for as long as we hold onto those shares. The capital gains tax alone is creating enormous work, therefore, for the accounting profession.
       </para>
       <para>
        To show the Senate that I have an idea of what I am talking about, I remind it that a few weeks ago Senator Walsh came into the chamber and in answer to a dorothy dixer said that only 0.3 per cent of Australians pay capital gains tax. Probably to suit his own argument he used the 1986-87 return figures. When the 1987-88 returns are taken into consideration, we find that 64,453 people paid capital gains tax compared with the 23,225 that Senator Walsh indicated under his figure of 0.3 per cent. So in 12 months the figure jumped by about 40,000. What will that do in the next 12 months-that is, if this Government is still in power, of course--

         —Order! Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 relating to the raising of matters of privilege, Senator Crowley, acting in her capacity as Chairman of the Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, has written to me to raise a matter of privilege. She has done so pursuant to a decision of the Committee. The matter in question is an apparent unauthorised disclosure of a document prepared for submission and submitted to the Select Committee, and not published by the Committee. I am required by the resolutions of the Senate to consider the matter, having regard to certain criteria specified in the resolutions, and to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence over other business. The relevant criteria refer to the principle that the Senate's power to deal with contempt should be used only where necessary to provide reasonable protection against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct the Senate or its committees in the performance of their functions, and to the existence of any other remedy. In a number of previous rulings I have indicated to the Senate the way in which I interpret and apply those criteria.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The matter raised by Senator Crowley is clearly one concerning which a motion should have precedence in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Senate. It raises the same issue of principle as a matter referred to the Committee on 18 August 1989, which was the subject of a ruling I made on 17 August 1989, to which I draw the attention of the Senate. I therefore call Senator Crowley to give a notice of motion, which will have precedence over all other business on the next day of sitting.

         —I wish to speak on Australia's participation in the live sheep export trade and the crisis that has developed as a result of the refusal of Saudi Arabia to take Australia's sheep. The crisis affects Western Australia severely as some 40 per cent of the Middle East exports come from Western Australia, as indeed was mentioned in the Australian magazine of 24 October 1989. I refer to the statement by Senator Panizza in the chamber on 21 November that at least 300,000 to 400,000 export wethers in Western Australia were being held in paddocks while farmers tried to find markets.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Like Senator Panizza, I call on the Federal Government to resolve the dispute which is now in its fifteenth week. The return to the farmer on sheep for slaughter has fallen by 41.3 per cent since June this year, according to a report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. Some of this fall can be attributed to the crisis in the live sheep export trade with Saudi Arabia, which in the past has been paying very high prices for Australian sheep. With this trade stalled, prices have plummeted. I refer to a report in the Perth Daily News on 1 December 1989, which states that the value of a Mount Barker farmer's ram lambs had dropped from $34.75 to $5.30 each as a result of the Saudi Arabian stance. This article by Zac Donovan is headed `Cash crisis for sheep man'. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A south-west sheep farmer will get less than a sixth of the price initially promised for his flock by live sheep exporters.
       </para>
       <para>
        A Mount Barker farmer stands to lose $11,000 on 400 lambs contracted to live sheep exporters. The report continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        He is one of many WA sheep farmers who will lose because exporters have cancelled their contracts.
       </para>
       <para>
        A clause gave the exporters the option to cancel when the export deal with Saudi Arabia fell through.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The live sheep exporters continue to buy lambs for overseas markets but are refusing to pay the high prices offered in the Saudi Arabian deal.
       </para>
       <para>
        WA Live Sheep Exporters Association vice-chairman Steve Meerwald said other overseas markets were not offering the same price as the Saudis.
       </para>
       <para>
        The likely consequence is that farmers may hold onto stock in the hope of prices improving. There are indications that this could lead to land degradation at a time when the Federal Government has singled out land degradation as a high priority environmental issue. In fact, Senator Cook has identified soil conservation as the No. 1 environmental priority in Australia and has allocated considerable resources to reverse the degradation process. Further land degradation must be prevented.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer also to an article in the Australian of 4 December headed `Farmers threatened by mutton mountain'. Rural writer Paul Downie states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . falling wool prices and the added burden on pastures caused by the increased number of sheep have forced farmers to reduce sheep numbers.
       </para>

        Theirs will be the fifth high level sheep industry delegation to visit Saudi Arabia since the AMLC suspended the trade on August 23 after Saudi health officials rejected five shipments of Australian sheep.
       </para>
       <para>
        The low price for mutton, the uncertainties of the market and the threat of land degradation are alone sufficient reasons for Australia to end the live sheep export trade. The deaths in transit of 30,543 export sheep since July of this year have shocked many Australians. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), as reported in the West Australian newspaper of 1 December 1989, points out that the high death rates would have been preceded by substantial suffering. This is in addition to the suffering of those sheep which managed to survive to their journey's end.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that it is timely for the Australian Government to carry out an independent review of all aspects of the trade, including an investigation into providing facilities in Australia for ritual halal killing which would meet the Middle East market needs. The review could also examine opportunities to increase, on a sustainable basis, the sheep carcass export trade worldwide. My office in Perth has received many calls, including some from farmers, expressing concern about the cruelty involved in live sheep exports. A rally held at Fremantle on 18 November, which was very well attended, restated the abhorrence of many Australians to the trade. A 1980 Morgan Research Centre public opinion poll commissioned by the RSPCA showed that 27 per cent of people favoured the trade; 61.7 per cent were opposed to the trade; and 11.3 per cent were undecided.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many Australians question our right to be regarded as a civilised society while we condone and actively participate in cruelty which results in sheep dying at the rate of one every four minutes-and this under `normal' transport condition, not the diabolical conditions which have been occurring in recent months. In excess of half a million sheep have died in transit since 1985 when the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare report on live sheep exports was published. There have been 2,500 deaths within three weeks on each large boat-they carry some 120,000 sheep-due to the appalling `normal' conditions under which the sheep are housed on these ships. This cruelty has also resulted from a failure by Australia to require that all sheep ships leaving Australia have on board an Australian veterinarian to monitor the condition of the sheep; the degree of foreign ownership of the ships and of the companies involved in the trade with companies able to set and to vary standards unilaterally; the inability of Australia to maintain responsibility for the well-being of the sheep once they left Australia; and, finally, the deficiencies in animal welfare and abattoir standards in some areas of the Middle East.
       </para>
       <para>
        On this last point I refer to the 1981 report by a RSPCA inspector who, having reviewed the processes in the Middle East, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Sheep first drove through slaughterhouse, then were dragged back on top of dead and dying animals where they had their throats cut.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the information of Senator Panizza-I refer to page 2901 of the Senate Hansard of 21 November-I do know the difference between live sheep and frozen beef, although I understand and sympathise with a slip of the tongue.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I support the freedom to choose one's diet and to choose to be or not to be a vegetarian, I join with many caring Australians who oppose unnecessary cruelty to animals. In respect of animal husbandry I believe that we need to improve current practices. Certainly, we should not be condoning a lowering of standards. I believe that, if an independent public opinion survey on the live sheep export trade had been carried out in the last few months the percentage of Australians opposed to this cruel and unnecessary trade would be higher than the 61.7 per cent result obtained in 1980. Animal welfare groups, including the RSPCA, the relevant union and many others who are not members of these groups, oppose the trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provided an orderly marketing system with reasonable and stable returns can be established to sheep farmers through a carcass trade, I believe that farmers would concur with the phasing out of the live sheep export trade. My opposition to the trade stems from the cruelty inflicted on the animals involved. Now that the trade is also beset with environmental and economic problems there can be no reason for Australia to continue to participate in it. I seek the support of Senator Cook, on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), to carry out a review of the industry. The recent statement by Senator Gareth Evans, also reported on page 2901 of the Hansard of 21 November 1989, that the development of a frozen meat market would be a more satisfactory way of conducting the trade is wholeheartedly endorsed by the Australian Democrats.

         —Briefly, I would like to take this opportunity to join with other honourable senators who have congratulated Wayne Goss, his Labor team in Queensland and, of course, the rank and file members of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) for their magnificent win in the State election last Saturday. I want particularly to dwell for a moment on the historic hegemony that Labor has established in Australia with its victory in the Queensland State election. At no time in its history has the Australian Labor Party held government in all six States of the Commonwealth simultaneously. However, there have been some three previous occasions when Labor has held national government and government in five of the six States of Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The first of those occasions occurred during the period of the Fisher Government and the Hughes Labor Government-the term of the Fisher Government being 17 September 1914 to 27 October 1915. Of course, the Hughes Labor Government followed. During that period Labor was in opposition in Victoria. However, William Holman was Labor Premier and led a Labor government in New South Wales; T. J. Ryan was the Labor Premier of Queensland from 1 June 1915; Crawford Vaughan led a Labor government in South Australia from 3 April 1915; John Scaddan was Labor Premier of Western Australia throughout that period until 27 July 1916; and John Earle-of course, the history of John Earle is very well known to Senator Tate-was the Labor Premier of Tasmania from 6 April 1914 to 15 April 1916. So for the period from 6 April 1915 to 15 April 1916 Labor found itself in government nationally and in five States, the exception being Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the period of the Curtin Government, Bill McKell was the Leader of a Labor Government in New South Wales; Robert Cosgrove was the Labor Premier of Tasmania; John Willcock was the Labor Premier of Western Australia; Frank Cooper was the Labor Premier of Queensland from August 1942; and on 15 September 1943, John Cain formed a Labor Government in Victoria but, of course, resigned his commission some four days later. For that marvellous period of four days Labor found itself in government nationally and in all Australian States with the exception of South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the period of the Chifley Government, Bill McKell was again Labor Premier of New South Wales until 6 February 1947. When he became Governor-General, he was succeeded by James McGirr. Robert Cosgrove was the Labor Premier of Tasmania until December 1947. After John Willcock's resignation on 31 July 1945, due to ill health, Frank Wise led the Western Australian Labor Government until April 1947. Labor was firmly in government in Queensland with both Frank Cooper and Ned Hanlon at the helm as Premiers during that period. John Cain senior again formed a Labor Government in Victoria on 21 November 1945 until 20 November 1947. Unfortunately, it was still the dark ages in South Australia with Playford as the Premier. But from 21 November 1945 to 1 April 1947 Labor found itself in government nationally and in five States of Australia, the unfortunate exception being South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Labor now finds itself in its strongest electoral position for some 40 years. We have strong and effective Labor governments in the States of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and now Queensland, as well, of course, as our long term and stable national Government. It is four decades since the conservatives have been routed in this country to the extent that they find themselves routed today. Unfortunately, it is in my own State of New South Wales that the conservatives still hold government, albeit, Mr President, I am sure you would agree, a Government that is well and truly on the skids.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that Labor's record of electoral success in the 1980s is a tribute to the hard work of its membership at all levels. I think it is appropriate to congratulate our ALP colleagues in Queensland for their efforts over the past few months. They deserve a great deal of credit for their victory last Saturday, and I look forward to a similar rout of the conservative forces in New South Wales at the next State election.

         —I rise this evening to put before the Senate my views on the future of the Government's plans to relocate naval facilities from Sydney to Jervis Bay. In particular, I want to address my remarks to the directive of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that his Ministers should take a fresh look at alternative sites. It may appear to some that there is no need to waste one's breath on the Jervis Bay issue, because the relocation plan appears to be in a state of terminal decline. Indeed, there is a lot of evidence to support this view. The preliminary draft environmental impact statement (EIS) has been thoroughly discredited, along with the consultants who produced it, Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd. The promise that large tracts of waterfront land in Sydney would be released has largely evaporated. The only significant site to be vacated would be the Newington armament depot land near Parramatta, which happens to be contaminated with industrial waste, making it rather less attractive than was first thought. Professor John Toon, a consultant to the New South Wales Government on the Homebush area-which includes Newington-has advised against the Federal Government's tentative plans to establish a housing estate on Newington land. Furthermore, 90 hectares of Newington-roughly one-third-is already to be sold off without jeopardising the depot's operations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The New South Wales Government's long-standing plans for an Olympic-standard sporting facility, which for years provided the impetus for plans to vacate the armament depot, are no longer contingent on the release of the Newington land. And no prime land on Sydney Harbour would be released by the removal of the Woolloomooloo fleet base. Even now, many Sydneysiders do not understand that there are no plans to move Garden Island Dockyard. Consequently, moving the fleet base is not going to change the landscape much, and is not going to yield any useful land to anyone.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against the advice of the Department of Defence and the Navy, the Government included HMAS Waterhen in its original relocation plan. It has now realised the foolishness of depriving our largest trading port of a mine-countermeasures base, and has opted to retain Waterhen, and indeed to modernise it. The Prime Minister has backed away from the relocation plan, having initially been one of its most enthusiastic supporters. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), the architect of the move, has dumped the sorry mess onto his junior Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons).
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Jervis Bay scheme has built up momentum and, despite the loss of power, the ship is still moving and is still on course. The sum of $5.3m has already been spent by Australian Construction Services on planning studies; $5.5m has already been committed to the three-year marine studies now under way-studies which are premised on the relocation plan being approved. And $3.1m have been thrown at the EIS, up from the original 1987 contract price of $1.5m-a massive 100 per cent cost blow-out. All told, nearly $14m have been committed to the Jervis Bay plan, with a Cabinet decision still many months away. While the Navy and Department of Defence are largely wary of the relocation plan, key officers and bureaucrats have built a mini-career on it. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the Hawke Government will be a government for very much longer, and the coalition has not revealed its hand on the future of the plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, Government Ministers have not grasped the unique nature of Jervis Bay, and have dismissed suggestions that plans be made to protect it permanently and effectively. For this reason, I want to suggest the direction that this new study of alternatives should take. This study is a golden opportunity to produce a rational and responsible plan, and to consign the present scheme to the dustbin of history. Senator Button, in a letter of 24 October clarifying the Hawke review, assured me that it will canvass `the option of retaining the facilities in Sydney Harbour'. This is the most important part of the study. Despite all the money that has been spent on so many previous studies, no convincing justification has been given for moving any naval facilities from Sydney.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no point in proceeding to a consideration of alternative sites until the justification hurdle has been jumped. Take the Newington armament depot, for which several key justifications have been advanced. One is that the Jervis Bay arrangement will be more efficient than the present ammunitioning pipeline in Sydney. In April last year, Mr Beazley told Parliament that it takes two or three days to ammunition a ship at Man O'War Anchorage in Sydney Harbour, whereas at Jervis Bay it would only take six hours-less than a working day.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems that the Minister was stretching both figures to make his case. According to the preliminary draft EIS, the Sydney process normally takes two complete days, rarely three. And senior Navy officers have told freelance journalist Rod Kirkpatrick that to ammunition a guided missile destroyer or frigate at Jervis Bay will take longer than six hours and will certainly not be completed in one working day. In other words, the time taken will be reduced only from two days to between one and two. In any case, efficiency cannot be judged solely by the time taken to load or unload a ship's arsenal. The operation of the pipeline, as a whole, has to be looked at. In Sydney, there are clear inefficiences at present. The ammunition has to be transferred from trucks onto concrete barges at Newington wharf and from the barges onto warships in Sydney Harbour. At Jervis Bay the weapons would be transferred directly from the truck to warships. However, the Sydney operation has some advantages. The most bulky and dangerous weapons, the missiles and torpedoes, are stored at Kingswood armament depot near Penrith. The distance they travel between Sydney Harbour and Kingswood is presently about 66 kilometres, 44 kilometres by truck and 22 by barge. The distance they would have to travel between Jervis Bay and Kingswood would be 200 kilometres, three times as far.
       </para>
       <para>
        Every time a warship discharged ammunition at Jervis Bay, the missiles and torpedoes would have to be trucked to Kingswood for routine maintenance and replacement weapons would have to be trucked all the way back to Jervis Bay. This is hardly efficient. It is worth noting that there are only notional plans to relocate the Kingswood armament depot to Jervis Bay. There is no money in the Budget for the move, no timetable and no guarantee that it would ever happen, even if the relocation of Newington proceeds. There is even less interest in relocating Kingswood's missile maintenance facilities. Yet the road traffic of explosives between Jervis Bay and Kingswood could be ended only if they moved too.
       </para>

        The main argument used to justify the relocation of Newington is safety. Civil encroachment has made it difficult for the depot to meet the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) explosives safety standards, according to the Department of Defence's 1987 notice of intention. But, according to Mr Tony Hetherington, a Defence Department officer with responsibilities for Newington, the depot does conform to safety standards and will still do so if the plan to sell 90 hectares at the southern end proceeds. Mr Hetherington's views were reported in the Canberra Times of 2 October. The only parts of the Sydney pipeline which do not meet NATO standards are the Newington wharf and Man O'War Anchorage during intermittent ammunition transfer operations. However, the danger zones at both points largely fall over public waterways, where population densities are, of course, low.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, the most likely cause of an accidental explosion is virtually absent at the wharf and the anchorage. Contrary to popular belief, unfused ammunition is particularly insensitive to shock-for example, as a result of being dropped during a crane transfer-but is much more sensitive to the effects of fire. But the possibility of a fire at the wharf and anchorage is very low-much lower than during road transport, when spilt fuel could be ignited following a collision.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1984 the Navy's chief of supply wrote that `the greatest risk' of accidental detonation `is through fire' and that ammunition is `not readily susceptible to shock'. To illustrate the point, in May this year four forestry workers were injured, one seriously, when they lit a camp fire above a buried 105-millimetre antitank shell at Puckapunyal army camp. The shell had apparently failed to explode from the shock of hitting the ground. It is little wonder that in 1979 a working party established by the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff concluded that the most likely risk of accidental detonation is during a fire following a road accident. Yet, under the Jervis Bay plans, the present 44-kilometre road route along the Western Freeway and Great Western Highway would be lengthened to 200 kilometres, including some notoriously dangerous roads such as the Old Northern Road, the Hume Highway and the Princes Highway. There would be a much greater likelihood of an accidental explosion along the proposed route than there is on the existing one.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been argued that because the Sydney route passes through the western suburbs, the consequences of an accident would be greater than along the sparsely populated Jervis Bay route. Therefore, the argument goes, the proposed route is safer because the greater risk is negated by the reduced carnage. Wrong again. The Jervis Bay route would pass through many towns along the way and the city of Wollongong. And the people most likely to be hurt on either route are those in cars who stop to render assistance or whose way is blocked by debris from the collision. In any case, traffic and population densities along the proposed new route are scheduled to grow dramatically, with the planned construction of an airport at Badgery's Creek south of Kingswood and a satellite city between Campbelltown and Kingswood.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, the proposed Jervis Bay ammunitioning pipeline would be more dangerous than the existing one in Sydney. Senior Navy officers have confirmed this in interviews with freelance journalist Rod Kirkpatrick. It would be irrational in the extreme to close the Sydney pipeline so that NATO storage and handling standards were not violated and, in the process, increase the public hazard caused by the transport of explosives. Yet this is what the relocation scheme proposes. History shows that the Sydney pipeline is extremely safe, which raises the question as to whether it should be moved at all on safety grounds. Under the current scheme at least, the answer is emphatically no. The balance sheet in favour of relocating Newington is not impressive: reduced safety, the release of some polluted land, marginal efficiency gains in some areas and efficiency losses in others. No responsible government can commit $176m to such a proposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The justifications for moving the fleet base are just as tenuous. One argument put forward is that increasing urban constraints are placing the operations of naval facilities in jeopardy. The preliminary draft EIS notes that HMAS Waterhen is one of the most constrained facilities. Yet, as the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) has noted in its assessment of the EIS, Waterhen is about to be substantially upgraded to accommodate more vessels and to operate well into the next century. DASETT was also moved to ask `how Garden Island Dockyard will be able to operate indefinitely when, presumably, it will be subject to the same constraints as the other naval facilities in Sydney'. This is a good point. The dockyard is still being modernised, along with the fleet base, and is not going to be moved. The urban constraints argument is a red herring.
       </para>
       <para>
        A variation on this theme is the claim that increasing water traffic on Sydney Harbour will increasingly constrain Navy operations. But according to a spokesman for the Maritime Board, reported in the Canberra Times, shipping traffic on the harbour has been fairly static for the past five years and is unlikely to increase in the foreseeable future. Another argument which has been put forward, including by Mr Beazley when tabling the Fleet Base Relocation Study in 1987, was that the collocation of the fleet and submarine bases and armament depot in Jervis Bay will offer advantages in efficiency. In fact, the opposite is true. As the Department of Defence noted in a 1976 study, `the co-location of'-the dockyard and fleet base-`within the same harbour is central to the efficient operation of the fleet'. Furthermore many of `the other principal naval establishments in the Sydney area'-such as training colleges and supply depots-`require, in the interests of the efficient operation of the Fleet, to be located in the same general area as the fleet base and dockyard'. In other words, the present collocation in Sydney offers maximum efficiency. Separate the fleet base from the dockyard and other naval establishments, and those advantages are lost. The only way to regain them is to move everything-dockyard, stores and colleges-down to Jervis Bay. The cost in 1975 prices was estimated at $1.9 billion. In 1989 prices, that equates to $6.4 billion-more than the estimated cost of the very fast train project.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987, Mr Beazley hinted twice that the dockyard would eventually move. Clearly, however, it would be a gross waste of public money. In any case, Garden Island Dockyard has been privatised, which would greatly complicate any Government plans to shift it. Other alleged benefits of relocating the fleet base are said to be reduced commuting times for Navy personnel, and allowing the Navy to tune its radars out of monitoring range of foreign ships. But these are trivial grounds on which to spend over $1 billion of public money. Some people feel that the fleet base should move because it would be a target in the event of war. But the dockyard would remain a target, so the advantages are minimal. Finally, to move the fleet base south when the likely focus of Navy operations is to the north is inefficient and would increase operating costs. In short, there is nothing to commend the relocation of the fleet base.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government decides to pursue the Jervis Bay plan, or to select an alternative site for the same relocation scheme, it will have to produce an entirely new set of justifications which stand up better than the present house of cards. If the armament depot is to be moved, a rigorous hazard analysis will have to be produced to show that the current dangers are unacceptable, particularly when compared with other more hazardous activities such as the passage of liquefied petroleum gas through Sydney streets and waterways. It will also have to be shown that substantial reductions in hazard will be gained by the move.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, cogent reasons will have to be given as to why options need to be reserved for a totally unnecessary fleet base relocation, particularly to a site south of Sydney. Much more would be gained by exploring the recommendation of Robert Cooksey, made in his 1988 report to Mr Beazley, that intermediate level maintenance facilities which do not require a dockyard should be established further north. Port Curtis, near Gladstone, could be the site of such a facility. Contingency studies could also be done of the possible relocation of storage and maintenance facilities at Newington and Kingswood further north-again, perhaps to Port Curtis. The Newington Wharf and a buffer zone encompassing the northern third of the present depot would be retained, along with reduced storage capacity at Kingswood, which will remain occupied by the Royal Australian Air Force. Ships operating in the south-east of Australia would carry minimal arms for training, supported by a low level of ammunitioning activities along this residual Sydney pipeline. They would only pick up a full armament load at Port Curtis while heading north for a tour of duty. They would off-load most of it on their way back to Sydney.
       </para>
       <para>
        But for such a scheme to proceed beyond the study stage to a firm proposal, a rigorous justification would have to be produced. None has yet been forthcoming. For this reason, studies of alternative sites deserve a low priority. By far the most important study which needs to be done is of ways to protect the unique qualities of Jervis Bay. One activity for which alternatives should be urgently considered is the bombardment of Beecroft Peninsula, or Bundoola Place, on the north side of the bay. Specifically, there would be no loss of training amenity, or defence skills, if bombardment were practised against targets moored at sea.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overall focus of any protection scheme would be to protect the rich marine ecosystem of Jervis Bay, as well as the glorious beaches and other terrestrial wonders. It would also seek to preserve the extraordinary spiritual qualities of the bay, which have been enshrined in Aboriginal mythology, and are obvious to most visitors to the region, but cannot be documented by science. Those qualities are threatened by a number of proposals, of which the relocation plan is but one. A coordinated and comprehensive protection scheme is urgently needed. It is my understanding that environment groups are drawing up proposals for a marine reserve and national park. I urge the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Prime Minister, to give them serious consideration.

         —Tonight I would like to make some brief comments on the proposed Rix Creek open cut coalmine. The site of the mine is very close to Singleton. It is only about 1.5 kilometres from the northern suburb of Singleton Heights. The developer of the mine is a company called Bloomfield Collieries Pty Ltd. The company wants to mix high quality coal from the new Singleton mine with lower grade coal, which has a higher sulphur content, from the company's East Maitland mine. It wants to export about 200,000 tonnes per year for the first two years, and it claims that the value of the deposit is some $900m. The site is to be mined over a period of 21 years. Very few jobs are involved. Only about 15 local people would be employed in the mine.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is no suggestion that there was anything improper about the application for development, but the company must have been fairly confident of getting permission because it has, I believe, already spent about $17m on testing and on an environmental impact statement. It may have received some assurances, of course, from the New South Wales Minister for Planning, David Hay.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is widespread opposition to the mine from the local community. Those people are not what one would characterise as greenies or conservationists. They are, in many ways, ordinary members of a community that has always been heavily dependent on coalmining. One such person is Mrs Alison Howlett, who has been very active in the relatively newly-formed Singleton community group. Mrs Alison Howlett became involved in the group because she had quite serious asthma and her children also suffered from respiratory problems when they lived near coalmines at Ravensworth. The family moved to Singleton recently to escape the pollution and they are worried about being faced with further pollution from the opening up of the new mines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Singleton community group was set up to represent the local concerns and to examine the possible environmental impacts of the mine. They were particularly concerned about noise from the machinery and from blasting and about destructive vibration from the blasting which would disturb their peace and have a possible effect on their homes. They were also worried about the dust which is carried into Singleton by the prevailing winds, which affects the quality of life in Singleton and, most importantly, has a noticeable effect on the health of Singleton residents, especially children. The residents believe that there is a higher than average incidence of respiratory disease in the area. That would not be surprising considering that there are already about 12 open cut and underground mines in the area. In the light of residents' health concerns, a health survey which concentrates on respiratory disease needs to be carried out in the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The community opposition to the mine was supported by local members of the major political parties, including the local State member of parliament, Mr Bob Roberts-a Liberal-the local Australian Labor Party branch, the Upper Hunter Trades and Labour Council, and the Singleton Shire Council. In fact, the Council voted unanimously to oppose the mine. It was the first time in the Council's history that it had opposed a mine. The Council also hired independent consultants to evaluate the impacts of the mine.
       </para>
       <para>
        In August this year I was approached by the community group who were going to Sydney to meet the Minister for Planning, David Hay. They had made two appointments in succession and both had been cancelled. They wanted to see David Hay and also the Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Pickard. The representatives turned up at Mr Hay's office but he still refused to see them. Although this is largely a State matter I felt an obligation to support the residents because of their environmental concerns and because I have some ability to raise these matters during an adjournment debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        For a number of reasons, including personal family matters, I was not able to give the matter the attention that I would have liked at the time. I believe that there was also some misunderstanding that my support was conditional in some way. However, with the benefit of hindsight I feel that even had I given the residents of the area the most vigorous support when they first approached me, I doubt now whether the result would have been different; I doubt whether my support for the residents would have been successful in getting the application for the mine or for the development rejected. The development has been given the go-ahead. But a commission of inquiry which was held earlier this year and which brought down its findings in July placed some stringent conditions upon the mine. In its report which was written by Mr John Woodward and Mr Kevin Cleland, it recognised the strength of the local concerns. That report--

       <para>
        There is widespread and deep concern in the Singleton community in relation to this proposed mine and its potential adverse environmental impact on residences within the town and on rural residences surrounding the proposed mine site. This concern was reflected in numerous submissions put before this Commission of Inquiry by the people of the Singleton area and in the submissions by Singleton Shire Council. The submissions of the Council and the local residents strongly opposed the mine and requested that this proposed mine be refused consent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has placed the usual conditions on the mine. These relate to dust, machinery noise, noise and vibration from blasting and waterway pollution. It also imposed monitoring and quarterly reporting conditions, these being especially important because of the proximity of the town to the mine. Special conditions imposed upon the mine include that when the wind speed exceeds a given value of 5.6 metres per second, all work at the mine must cease. Special limits have also been imposed on the mine. Hours of operation are now restricted to between 6.30 a.m. and 8 p.m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bloomfield Collieries Pty Ltd has accepted these conditions and has indicated that it can operate successfully within the constraints. I hope that it will continue to hold this opinion and will not seek to dilute the environment protection provisions at a later date. The residents have now accepted that the mine will go ahead but there is still concern that the conditions might not protect them. One aspect that particularly concerns me is the permission for the operators to transport the coal from the mine by road. This will amount to 200,000 tonnes per annum to be carried through the town during the first two years. Clearly, there is a danger to the community on the roads. There is the possibility of quite considerable dust pollution. There will be noise. There will be damage to roads. One calculation has estimated that there will be 124 truck journeys through the town each day.
       </para>
       <para>
        The commissioners recommended that a rail coal loading facility and a spur line should be constructed away from the town by the beginning of the third year of mining. If that is not done five times the tonnage will have to be carried through the town. This could amount to one million tonnes per annum. The roads in this area are being used because of the ridiculous situation that it would cost the company $7 more a tonne to transport the coal by rail. One of the most interesting recommendations of the commissioners was the establishment of an overview committee to monitor the maintenance of environmental standards for the community. I gather that the current prospective membership for the monitoring committee will consist of a representative from the Department of Minerals and Energy, who will be in the chair and a representative from each of the State Pollution Control Commission, the local council, the Department of Environment and Planning, Bloomfield Collieries and the local community. This committee is an innovation. I regard it as a very useful one. I hope that it will be able to perform the function envisaged by the commissioners as well as giving the community confidence that standards are being adhered to.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some aspects of the situation are still causing local residents some concern. They feel that there ought to be more than one representative of their community on the committee. Two would be desirable, if only to spread the workload particularly considering that the community resident on the committee gets no financial support. I also think that the six-monthly meetings may not be frequent enough. It would be useful to have three-monthly meetings, particularly in the event of some urgent situation. There is also an apprehension that the local residents will not be able to contest arguments filled with complex statistical data. Obviously, bodies like the council and the State Pollution Control Commission ought to provide support in this situation and I hope that they will.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously the special conditions on the mine and the monitoring committee are very much a second best for the residents of Singleton but it is a lot better than open slather unrestricted development. A lot of people such as the Singleton residents are realising that they cannot merely leave the protection of their local environment in the hands of official bodies but that they have to take an interest as members of communities. Already there are 12 mines in the community and in the new climate of concern for the environment and especially of concern locally for the apparently high incidence of respiratory diseases in the area, the residents have recognised there is no reason for another mine to be accepted unthinkingly and indeed every reason for examining the proposal carefully. All the residents, including Mrs Howlett and others, should be commended for raising the issue and taking action which initiated what the New South Wales Minister for Planning, David Hay, called the strongest protective measures ever issued on a surface mine in New South Wales. The residents of Singleton will set an example for residents of other similar communities by their energy, dedication, sincerity and capacity for organisation.

       In addition to the above programs, my Department, in conjunction with the Australian Heritage Commission, administers the National Estate Grants Program, under which payments are made to the States for projects recommended by the State Governments and approved by the Commonwealth. In 1988-89 a total of $666,200 was allocated to local government projects by the States under this Program. Projects to be supported in 1989-90 have not yet been announced.

       Similarly, under the National Tree Program, grants are provided for tree projects through State and Territory agencies which are responsible for the allocation of the funds to individuals and community and local government bodies. Some $750,000 was allocated to this Program by the Commonwealth in each of the financial years 1988-89 and 1989-90. A breakdown of funding to local government authorities is not available. A further $4 million annually has also been committed to the One Billion Trees Program which commenced in the current financial year and which, like the National Tree Program, is administered for the Commonwealth by Greening Australia.

       Is is a fact that overseas scholars offered contracts without tenure by Australian universities are discouraged from taking up those offers because:
