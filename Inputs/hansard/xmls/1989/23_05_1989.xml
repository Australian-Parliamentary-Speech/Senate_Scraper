       Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.

       some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.

       Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to,
      </para>

       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:

      <para>
       We are concerned that the National Party in Queensland is diverting money given by the Federal Government to the Queensland Government to alleviate natural disasters; that it might not be finding its way to its intended targets; and that it is being diverted to the coffers of the National Party itself or otherwise to expansion projects promoted by members or supporters of the National Party.

       X-rated and Violent Video Material
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.
      </para>
      <para>
       All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.
      </para>
      <para>
       We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.
      </para>
      <para>
       We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.

      </para>
      <para>
       This humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully draws the attention of the Senate to the Government's attack on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we as Australians have a right.

        —by leave-I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the members of the new Opposition front bench on their appointments. If I may say so, they have already achieved a peculiar distinction, being the largest Opposition front bench in the history of Federation and, indeed, probably the largest front bench in the history of Western civilisation. I suppose that there is something to be said for safety in numbers, or, as Mr Peacock put it when discussing the size of his front bench at a press conference on 9 May 1989: `I will bring a capacity to be beholden to none, to be responsible to all and to be obligated to no-one'. Apart from the syntax in the rehearsed press conference, I must say that Mr Peacock speaks like a man with a pimple on his tongue. Let me repeat what he said: `I will bring a capacity to be beholden to no-one, to be responsible to all--

        —It is early days yet; the honourable senator will keep. I would suspect that the new Opposition Leader would be beholden to two or three people at least-for example, the stars of last Monday's Four Corners program. The extent of the obligation is pretty clear. `Obligation' is the word he uses-`obligated to no one'. As former Leader John Howard said on 17 May, `I just cannot believe that something which the plotters themselves so boastfully spelt out on Monday night; I cannot believe in all my heart that he was not privy to all of that'. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the recycled Leader of the Opposition, having had six leadership contests and lost five, put the matter in the hands of the Four Corners heroes and said, `You do it this time'. But he has been there before and been turfed out, as Andrew Hay, one of his former colleagues in Melbourne, used to say.

The intervention from Senator Walters reminds me of the hero of Gilbert and Sullivan: `In enterprise of martial kind, when there was any fighting he led his regiment from behind-he found it less exciting'. We have a new frontbench but who takes a point of order threatening the Government? It is Senator Walters, sitting on the back bench where she has always been and always will be through every successive change of leadership which takes place in the Liberal Party.

       I want to point out to members of the Opposition that there are real dangers in all this stuff. It they want to understand those changes they should see a film called The Naked Gun, which is showing at present. In this film a Los Angeles cop, suspended for shooting six people, says to the mayor, `If you see weirdos in togas stabbing each other to death in the park, well of course you shoot them. How was I to know they were just Shakespearian actors?'. There is a lesson there which the Opposition has to learn in this matter. There are grave dangers of that kind of thing happening to it. Look at the unhappy Jeffrey Kennett in Melbourne today. Do honourable senators remember Jeffrey Kennett, famous for his car telephone conversation with the present Leader of the Opposition? What good did that do to him? The same thing happened to him today. Kennett has been replaced by Brown, whoever he might be, and joins Olsen and the others.

       I might get back to the gang of Four Corners for a minute. The Leader of the Opposition described their performance as tasteless. It is scarcely a description used by somebody beholden to no-one. What did the new Leader of the Opposition expect from Mr John Moore, sacked from a Liberal ministry because the Prime Minister of the day found him less than tasteful, his conduct distasteful? Did he expect Mr Wilson Tuckey to be anything other than tasteless? Did he expect Mr Tuckey to be tasteful? Not at all.

He saw an opportunity to get a fat gratuity out of this coup by the gang of Four Corners and he took it. It is nice to have Senator Austin Lewis as shadow Minister for industry.

Senator Chris Puplick-one of the great conspirators-has moved to the right. Like Cassius-and I do not mean Cassius Clay-Senator Puplick has moved to the right and sits on the front bench. There, he will be able to cuddle up with Senator Bishop until he is pushed off his perch at the next election. Senator Boswell-the great interjector-is the great survivor on the front bench. It would not be the same without him. Then, of course, we have the new faces of Senator Alston, Senator Bishop and Senator MacGibbon. We will see about them.

       This country is currently going down the drain economically at the rate of $17 billion a year. I quote from an article, written by David Potts, in yesterday's Australian. Mr Potts, who is not known as a supporter of the Liberal Party, says:
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's worst nightmare is now forming: a fall in commodity prices, whose strength has been all that has prevented the current account deficit of the balance of payments soaring past $20 billion . . .

       We're getting ominously close to the darkest banana republic days of three years ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the truth. This country is in really diabolical strife, and all that this Government can think about is playing politics. It will move some immigration motion in the other place; it stands here, playing the part of the comedian. This Government is not governing; this Government has stopped governing. Where are the micro-economic reforms that were supposed to be on the agenda for the third term of the Hawke Government? What has happened to this Government? Senator Walsh is sitting there deathly silent because he knows that under this Government this country is falling into an economic abyss. The only thing that is currently holding it up is commodity prices, yet all that this Government can think of is having Senator Button make a speech in which he tries to make fun of people on this side who are doing a good job. I was delighted to hear Senator Button welcome me back because I know that I have always been able to put him on the back foot, and I will continue to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       Interest rates in this country are soaring absolutely beyond control. The only way the Government can maintain the dollar value overseas is by selling off the nation's assets and by maintaining interest rates at extraordinarily high levels. That is this Government's policy-selling off the country and holding interest rates up so that people cannot afford to buy housing, and businessmen cannot afford to borrow money to invest. All that this Government can think of doing is making the kind of speech that Senator Button has just delivered, a speech in the other place censuring the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), and a proposal for a speech about immigration to do with dividing parties, if it is possible to divide parties. We hear nothing about the important decisions. Let me ask Senator Button about his decisions in relation to the waterfront. What is he doing about transport problems? What is he doing about micro-economic reform? Where is the Government's agenda?

        —The Opposition is critical of Senator Button's comments. I would have thought that it is a rather cruel world when, after the last week, he cannot have at least 15 minutes fun. When changes are made it is often the case in this chamber that people indulge themselves for a few minutes. Obviously, Senator Lewis wants to prolong this. I was here in September 1987 when we, on the front bench, were subjected to all those sorts of charges. I remember the debate well. We expanded the Ministry to 30. That was met with derision by those opposite. Let me quote Senator Chaney at the time:

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       . . . we do not believe it is necessary to have 30 Ministers. The expansion of the size of the Ministry is clearly and simply to accommodate the internal political difficulties of the Labor Party . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       That was Senator Chaney a while ago. Senator Short-who I think still owes me $10 from the game on Saturday; but we can fix that up later-said:
      </para>
      <para>
       There was no science in expanding the Ministry from 27 to 30. It was sheer, cold, hard-headed politics on the part of factional managers of the Government . . .

       Peter Shack in the House of Representatives said:

       Finally, I will quote Senator Chaney. On 20 April 1988, just 13 months ago, he reminded the Senate:

       . . . of our objection to seeing the size of the Ministry increase substantially just to meet the problems that the Government has with respect to keeping its factions in good order.

We did not have to move motions, note the matter and carry on for ever. That is the point about politics. Occasionally one dishes it out and then cops it when it is one's turn. But if Senator Lewis and others are saying that they are happy with the behaviour of those opposite over the last eight days and they think that it can just go unnoticed in this chamber, then they are really kidding themselves. He should look at himself. First, on the Monday, he is approached by his colleagues to go to see Mr Howard and say, `It's all over. It's time to go'. That is what he was asked to do and he went along and did it. We then see him bleeding on the media for the next week saying, `Should I have done it? Should I have stabbed the Leader in the back; should I have not?'.

We then had the Four Corners episode in which the so-called pros of the Liberal Party of Australia got on air and said, `We deliberately lied to people'. They then contradicted their Leader. After all, we all know that the press conference of the Leader Opposition (Mr Peacock) on Tuesday was well rehearsed. Paid media consultants were brought in to rehearse Peacock. Every word he said was well rehearsed. He said he was drafted. Mr Moore said, `No, we drew up a document and showed it to him a couple of weeks beforehand'. Who is telling the truth?

Just because he gave Senator Schacht advice on how to run our next campaign, does not mean that he is a spy. He is not secret ticket No. 1,428 of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. Wherever I could I have defended Senator Michael Baume in relation to these matters.

      <para>
       I suppose the real reason we are entitled to raise this matter at least in a passing way is that Senator Lewis says there are serious matters to be discussed. I concede that. But what about his credibility and the credibility of his Leader in this chamber? When he speaks on issues are we to believe him? Let me just go through that record. On 30 March, seven weeks ago, after winning preselection for Pearce, Senator Chaney told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio that his only concern was to gain a senior position in a John Howard led government. Then on 20 April Andrew Peacock told the National Press Club that Senator Chaney `will be an active and effective senior Minister in a Howard government'. When Howard came under pressure on the Victorian preselections, Howard issued a statement which cited Fred Chaney as an example of the diversity in the Party and defended him. Three months ago, on 7 February, Chaney made a speech of loyalty to Howard at their first joint party meeting for the year. He condemned the constant speculation about Howard, he criticised members of parliament who undermined Howard's leadership abilities, and he said that attacks on Howard `give comfort to the enemy'. I wonder whether he was talking about himself. He went on:
      </para>
      <para>
       To engage in that sort of speculation with journalists is totally counterproductive. What it's doing is falling for the Labor Party line, and really you become a Labor Party stooge if you run it.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is even more on the record. Six months ago, on 9 November, Senator Chaney attacked the Small Business Association and Hugh Morgan from Western Mining for opening up the leadership issue. He told ABC radio that the current leadership was performing well. When Howard went down in the opinion poll in October 1988, Chaney was the one to attack a Quantum poll used by the Australian Financial Review. He said that it was:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . a pathetically obvious attack on John Howard . . . a covert operation to destabilise . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       Howard commented:
      </para>
      <para>
       Fred put all of that rather nicely.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not think he felt that that was the case on Monday night. I shall not protract proceedings other than to say two other things. What a pathetic operation it must have been. This was the one time I ever felt sorry for John Howard. There he was calling a leader's dinner. Mr Sinclair turned up, as did Mr Lloyd and Tony Eggleton. But who was missing? Chaney, Lewis and Peacock were all missing. Apparently at one stage, rather plaintively, Mr Howard said that he wondered where the rest of the Liberal leadership were. Their real error is this-and where it differed from our side-was that they did not take John Howard front on. It was a covert operation from behind in which he was stabbed in the back. There is no doubt, looking at this front bench and at political reality, that people crossed from one side to the other for the reward of the front bench. I do not think they can deny that. I am not saying that there would not be other motives such as electoral credibility, but I do not think it can be denied that part of the methods and operations was simply to promote people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Not many people on the Liberal side have come out of this very well. We have been there and we have been through all that, so we cannot crow and we cannot be sanctimonious about it, but we are allowed to reflect on it. Senator Chaney has to live with stabbing John Howard in the back, for whatever motive. I am afraid, Senator Stone, that the old nickname of Red Fred has long gone. We have to think up a new name-perhaps Senator Chicanery. I am a bit of a film buff, and I recall Lon Chaney, man of a thousand faces. Now we have Fred Chaney, man of two faces.

Let Senator Button remember, for example, the testimony of His Excellency the Governor-General, now sitting out there in the splendid pensioner residence at Yarralumla, having at last come to his just reward on the basis of the Australian Labor Party (ALP)--

It is grossly disorderly for any member of this Parliament to reflect on the position-not the person-of Governor-General, no matter who holds that position. Everyone knows that that is grossly disorderly. The Opposition, in fact, on a number of occasions committed itself-and its past Leader certainly committed himself-by saying that the political controversy surrounding that appointment would end once the appointment had been made. The Opposition broke that promise within 24 hours of making it. But it is grossly disorderly to reflect on that office, Mr President, and I would ask for it to be withdrawn.

        —Mr President, far from reflecting upon His Excellency, I intend to draw upon the integrity of His Excellency by quoting what His Excellency has had to say about people sitting immediately in front of Senator Collins at the moment. When His Excellency, as he now is, addressed the South Australian ALP conference in June 1983 on the question of the obligation of Prime Minister Hawke, he had this to say about his intimate dealings with the now Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson). Mr Hayden in his speech described conversation with Senator Richardson in these terms:

      <para>
       Some weeks later Max Walsh broadcast on his TV program `Sunday' that there was another challenge coming up. About the Tuesday after that I had to ring Graham Richardson about a totally unrelated matter. I got him on the phone, and as soon as he got on, he was defensive, and apologetic, and saying, `Oh, mate, mate, . . .'-everyone's a mate in New South Wales. It's a bit like the mafia presenting me with a bunch of flowers. Anyhow Graham said, `Mate, mate, I know what you are ringing up about, that dreadful programme on Sunday. Max Walsh, oh, he's a dreadful bastard. Look, I've got nothing to do with it, mate, and I want to tell you, mate, we're behind you all the way'.
      </para>
      <para>
       I said, `Well, Graham, that's not what I rang you up about, but now you've raised it, that's what you said last time there was a challenge'.
      </para>
      <para>
       And he said, `Oh, mate, mate, this time I've got to tell you the truth; last time we told you a lie.'
      </para>
      <para>
       These are the sorts of people who now want to talk about the question of obligation. Fancy lying to somebody who is going to be a Governor-General, for heaven's sake! We have now had one speech from the resident film buff opposite, saying what people will see if they go to watch the film The Naked Gun. Frankly, we do not have to watch the film called The Naked Gun if we want to see a small calibre, small bore performance. We can come in here and watch Senator Button any day of the week. He says, `What are we going to do about people who have had taped telephone conversations? Poor old Mr Kennett; poor Mr Peacock'.
      </para>
      <para>
       We then find the details of Mr Keating's taped car telephone conversation telling the Prime Minister why he is basically fed up with him in exactly the same way as Mr Dawkins is. Mr Dawkins told Mr Hawke that he ought to resign and, what is more, told the press what a great job he had done about the whole thing. The Prime Minister takes his advice from all over the place. He can take it from his old friend, Mick Young. We remember Mick Young with his testimonial dinner on one occasion, when he told everybody the sorts of people he was obligated to in his political career and how marvellous it was. He proposed at one stage that he wanted to thank some fellow by the name of `Willow'. The newspaper report of his speech reads:
      </para>
      <para>
       `To ``Willow''-Len Wilson-for teaching me how to keep a straight face when I told a lie.'
      </para>
      <para>
       He was eventually caught up with over the whole of his ministerial shenanigans. Senator Ray has come in here and said, `People cannot take it. What a miserable situation it is, trying to abuse people on the front bench opposite'. Equally, we could run through any of the front bench put up by the Labor Party at the moment. It wants to talk about Senator Chaney. At least Senator Evans is in a position to reflect that when Senator Chaney on this occasion stood for preselection for a seat in the lower House, he was able to win it. Senator Evans was not. Senator Evans got creamed when he ran for Jagajaga trying to get out of here.

       A whole raft of people occupy the Government front bench. We are all very sorry for Senator Reynolds and her bad back, and the fact that she is not present at the moment. But we know that Senator Reynolds is on the front bench not because of the number of neurones she can put together but because of the number of chromosomes she has and the necessity in a Labor government for some female representation. Senator Bolkus confessed the other day in the Adelaide Advertiser that the Australian Labor Party in his State was down the tube and was about to be defeated.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, if we really want to talk about the question of obligations, we can go into the obligations that Senator Richardson has around the place. I would be more than delighted to take the opportunity to reflect once again in terms of standards on the Government front bench and to talk to honourable senators opposite about Peter Baldwin; to talk to them about Enmore; to talk to them about Tommy Domican; to talk to them about Joe Meissner; to talk to them about the Pavilion in the Park restaurant and Nugan Hand and the money that changed hands; to talk to them about Virginia Perger; to talk to them about Harris-Daishowa and the Loosley conviction; to talk to them about Laurie Brereton and the Botany scandal and the Walker cover-up; to talk to them about Warren Anderson; to talk to them about Rex Jackson; to talk to them about the self confessions around the place; to read out the extracts from Tommy Burns's report on how Paul Keating stole the Blaxland preselection; to talk to them about the Liverpool preselection; and to talk to them about their ministerial colleagues Mr Young and Mr Brown. I would more than welcome the opportunity to take them chapter and verse through each of these matters in terms of what are standards of integrity as far as they are concerned, to take them through the question of obligation as far as they are concerned and to take them one by one through all of the points that Senator Button has raised.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, the bottom line is that Senator Button has to manufacture that sort of attack in the Senate because he does not want to debate the issues that are of real concern to the people of Australia: the issues of housing interest rates, debt, falling living standards, pressures on our families, the decline in the education system, the perversion of the health system and the absolute degree of incompetence that this Government has manifested over the last couple of months. Honourable senators opposite know that, even with the temporary difficulties that might have occurred in the Opposition recently, all of the latest public opinion polls clearly indicate that whenever the Government wants to go to an election we will meet it and defeat it. They know that full well.
      </para>
      <para>
       All of the efforts that Senator Schacht and his friends can put together to try to gain some degree of prominence and notoriety around the place will do them no good because, at the end of the day, they know that the Opposition, in terms of policies, leadership and the personnel on its front bench, is capable of matching the Government in any electoral context at any time and sending it as quickly as possible to defeat.

       The debate today, having been brought on the way it has been by Senator Button, is a simple indication of the extent to which this Government is absolutely terrified of the capacity of the Australian people to make a judgment on its economic failures and mismanagement. Of course the Government does not want to face Question Time; of course it does not want to face issues about the economy; and of course it does not want to face debate on the Appropriation Bills. It knows full well that when those issues are debated and the opportunity is given to the people of Australia to pronounce judgment upon it for its economic and administrative incompetence, they will do so in the best possible way at the ballot box by tossing out this miserable and discredited government of failures and no-hopers.

         —I think history has passed this question by, so I will be very brief. The situation in terms of travel entitlements is that the shadow ministry is entitled to as much travel allowance per person as the Ministry; that is, if there are 30 Ministers, then 30 shadow Ministers may apply for travel allowance. The difficulty is that we have 31, so someone is going to miss out. It is always possible, of course, that if the former Leader of the Opposition returns we will have two extra positions for which travel allowance will not be made available. Then again, if the three plotters are sacked, there will be one spot over. We on the Government side will not be choosing the shadow Minister who is to miss out. That will be Mr Peacock's task, and the way in which he decides which shadow Minister is not to get the travel allowance will depend on a lot of other factors, which I would love to go into but will not.

        On the question of the use of a Commonwealth car in a shadow Minister's home city, there is no limitation by the Remuneration Tribunal or by Government policy. Now that we have 31 shadow Ministers, they will all be entitled to that privilege. The estimated cost of additional revenue is $5,000 to $8,000-pretty cheap when we think about it, as $5,000 to $8,000 for an extra vote in the leadership ballot is nothing. The allocation of staff is done on a block basis. The staff will just have to be carved up amongst 31 instead of 30, as has been done in the past. So there is very little additional cost in a direct sense-$5,000 to $8,000. I guess we will find out who the least preferred shadow Minister is, or who will miss out, by the announcement. As I look at the front bench, no one here seems worried. It will probably be a House of Representatives member.

Is it the policy of the Department of Transport and Communications (DOTAC) to make new television stations transmit on the UHF band? Is it a fact that, by comparison with VHF, UHF equipment is substantially more expensive to buy and to run? Is it not a fact that UHF relies on line of sight for a clear picture whereas VHF can bend around corners? Is it not a fact that Tasmania is the hilliest State and, if flattened out, would be the largest State in Australia? If UHF is foisted upon Tasmanians, a large percentage of us will need to buy UHF capacity and new antennae. Even then, thousands in valley areas will not get a clear picture. Finally, because of the fact that the band crowding problem does not exist and will not arise in Tasmania because there are alternative answers to mainland VHF interference, because UHF is unsuitable to Tasmania's topography and because of the enormous cost of UHF to Tasmanians and to the stations, is DOTAC's policy consistent with the Government's media ownership aggregation policies, with its emphasis on choice and competition? Will the Government, in view of this, arrange for discussions between DOTAC, the stations and, I would suggest, all Tasmanian representatives in the Federal Parliament?

        The Government chose to use UHF frequencies for all new commercial televisions services in Tasmania because this would allow additional services to be provided without disrupting existing services which use VHF channels to serve rural communities. The existing stations would prefer the new extension services to also be on VHF. However, the Department of Transport and Communications advises that providing VHF channels for the new commercial stations in Hobart and Launceston would mean that eight areas outside Hobart and Launceston currently receiving their commercial station on VHF translators would be forced to move to UHF-in other words, robbing Peter to pay Paul. They would in fact lose their only commercial station unless they invested in UHF. Eight areas would lose their only VHF commercial station under the licensees' proposal. Perhaps I could incorporate a list of the areas and the rest of my answer to save the rest of us the burden of listening to it. If that does not cover all the ground that Senator Harradine asked in his question, I will follow it up with a supplementary answer tomorrow. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my answer in Hansard.

       <para>
        Now compare the loss of service for 40,000 country Tasmanians under the proposal being put forward by the owners of the existing channels, ENT and TRICOM, with the Government's proposal where no viewer would lose their existing range of services, whether on VHF or UHF.

        The existing commercial stations reportedly claim that it will cost the Tasmanian community $30m to introduce UHF television. It would, in reality, cost but a fraction of that amount.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to use UHF recognises that there may be some extra costs for the television licensees, but the Government's priority is to provide more services for all Tasmanian viewers rather than to protect the commercial interests of the existing operators.
       </para>
       <para>
        Concerning the claim that many viewers will require new sets, this is totally untrue. No-one will be forced to buy a new TV set. Existing services will remain on existing channels and UHF can be received on most sets now. For those without UHF sets, there are 2 possible ways of receiving UHF. The first is through a video cassette recorder and the second is through the purchase of what is called a ``down-converter'' for about $100.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, in response to the claim that UHF will not provide adequate coverage without additional translators, the Minister can assure Tasmanian viewers that if it requires additional translators to ensure that they receive high quality reception of 2 commercial television stations, that's precisely what we'll seek to have the stations provide.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has no intention of backing away from its commitment to not only increase the number of services but to extend services to all who should be able to receive them.

         —It is a fairly obvious statement that the Federal Government has always had as its primary objective in the Antarctic the protection of the environment. Our record in that respect in the Antarctic is recognised around the world as being the best. As far as what we will do about a wilderness park is concerned, Senator Evans and the Prime Minister will have the main responsibility for talking to other nations about the possibility of implementing the suggestion with which we are running now. I will do a little of it myself if and when the opportunity arises.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The main thrust of the question is about whether we will declare a national park now. The answer to that is no. The reason is that we all have to understand that our claim to the Antarctic-which concerns approximately 40 per cent of it-is recognised by only four countries. Given that we are trying to implement a wilderness park proposal-and I think there are almost 40 nations involved in the treaty negotiations-I would have thought that to proclaim a national park in the Australian Antarctic Territory would be seen as pretty provocative action by many of those countries which not only do not recognise our claim but actively dispute all claims. I would not have thought that we would proceed to do such a thing now.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a matter of practicality, attempting to in any way manage or police a national park would be pretty difficult, given that we have three bases in the Australian Antarctic Territory, all of which are on a strip along the coast. It is a massive territory, more than we would be able to manage here. I doubt very much whether we could have rangers asking people from other nations to do better. I am sure they would get pretty short shrift. Nonetheless, we can attempt to have our proposal for a wilderness park implemented and, if and when the time comes, when Cabinet discusses what the next step is, I would be more than happy to look at a national park concept to see whether it is appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another part of the question refers to the south-east forests of New South Wales. We have been actively pursuing a policy for protecting National Estate areas, including the south-east forests. My colleague Senator Cook last week produced a proposal for consideration by the New South Wales Government which, if implemented, would have minimised logging in the National Estate areas to less than 10 per cent, while studies about all of the alternatives in the area were concluded. The New South Wales Government rejected that proposal out of hand. That is a cause of great regret to me and, of course, to Senator Cook. However, we will pursue our policy of excluding from the woodchip licence for Harris-Daishowa logs that are taken from National Estate areas. I hope that the New South Wales Government will, in the very near future, come to its senses. That course could be greatly helped if Senator Puplick, whose silence on the environment is unmatched in this country, would just once ask his Liberal colleague Premier Greiner to do the right thing about one forest. It has never happened yet, but one never knows one's luck in a big city.

         —As Senator Richardson has just said, on Thursday, 18 May, I presented the New South Wales Government-in the person of Ian Causley, its Minister for Natural Resources-with a proposal that we, the Commonwealth Government, had spent some time working out. It is a proposal that would settle the issues of the south-east forests of New South Wales and would enable me to proceed to issue a woodchip export licence protecting areas of the National Estate that I have been advised by the Heritage Commission and by Senator Richardson require protection. The day before the proposal was presented, my Department met with the New South Wales Forestry Commission to explain its detail, so the technical matters of cutting cycles, location of compartments, and so on, were understood by the New South Wales Government when I met it. The New South Wales Minister rejected the proposal out of hand. I have asked him for a written reply to what was a very full proposal, and I understand that he proposes to provide one. At this stage we have an oral no, but we are awaiting a detailed response. I trust that it will be a response considered by the full New South Wales Government, and not one acted upon peremptorily by one of its Ministers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The proposal that I presented was based on the criterion that, since the logging in the south-east forest is a sawmill-driven enterprise, the sawmill industry should be protected-enabling the quota requirements for the woodchip mill, as well as the environmental objectives set out, to be met. In preparing the proposal, I was constrained by the limitations placed on me by the Jurasius case decision in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court, which requires an environmental impact statement before areas can be opened for cutting, and by the National Estate recommendations for areas to be protected, requiring me to discover prudent and feasible alternatives if I could, or, if I could not, to limit the amount of cutting in the National Estate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson has said accurately that my proposal would involve cutting about 9 per cent of the National Estate. The decision was not made lightly; it was made after exhaustive consideration, and I will shortly table details of how I arrived at it. I found no prudent and feasible alternative, given not only the consideration of the National Estate but also the fact that upwards of 700 families are dependent on the industry and that in that region of New South Wales there is an unemployment rate of twice the State average. I had to consider the industry. The plan that I proposed was worked out on the basis of figures supplied by the New South Wales Forestry Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second part of the proposal was that, over the next 12 months, we conduct a biological study of the National Estate and the national parks in the area. That biological study would be headed by a team that we believe is balanced, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales and the New South Wales Forestry Commission would act as a referee panel.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been a number of criticisms of the package. The first one, voiced by Causley, was that there were not sufficient resources. The argument there is specious, to say the least. Our proposals were based on his figures. We said that if we were wrong we could make an adjustment, and that we were prepared to enter into joint monitoring with the New South Wales Government to test the validity of our figures. We asked Mr Causley whether he could give us an idea of the magnitude of our error, but he could not do so. In addition, he rejected the two proposals that would enable the accuracy of our proposal to be proven.
       </para>
       <para>
        His second criticism was that the study of biological properties should be reduced to six months. The original recommendation was that it would take two years. The proposal has reduced that by half-to one year. The scientific efficacy of such a study would be damaged if it were reduced to six months. That is just not feasible. The third criticism is that this is an intrusion into New South Wales rights. It is not; it is a simple exercise by the Commonwealth Government concerning our woodchip export licence. The proposal that I have put forward is rational and reasonable. In some of its key elements it is certainly a compromise, but it would work, and it would settle the issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I table for the information of the Senate an analysis of wood resource issues in the context of section 30-obligations-of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The analysis was conducted by my Department for my consideration of prudent and feasible alternatives. I table also the comments made on that analysis by the Australian Heritage Commission-comments which, on balance, I have accepted in part. As I have indicated in my remarks, I have been unable to accept other parts. Consistent with my policy of putting these primary documents on the public record, I now table them. In conclusion, I must say that I agree with what Senator Richardson said in concluding his remarks. I would now like to hear whether Senator Puplick does or does not support Ian Causley's refusal to reach a practical, realistic, rational and logical agreement which would settle this issue. This Parliament sits and waits to hear from Senator Puplick on that very matter.

         —Don't worry, Senator Chaney, I will answer the question. I can readily understand why Senator Puplick is not anxious to ask any questions about the environment. Even though Senator Puplick is the shadow environmental spokesman, I thought he might have had sufficient interest in fiscal matters, particularly in the outlays side of the Budget, to have noticed that this Government has presided over three years of continuously declining real outlays. In this financial year outlays, as a proportion of gross domestic product, will be lower than they were in any year of the Fraser-Howard Government and next year they will be lower again. So he should not come in here and sanctimoniously lecture this Government about fiscal responsibility when the people that he supported, and still supports-including Mr Peacock-were part of that Government as well, even though he has helped to consign Mr Howard via a real dagger in the back, instead of the plastic dagger that Senator Alston was going to use on Senator Lewis. So he should not come in here and lecture us about fiscal responsibility and ask whether we will address all arms of economic policy. We have done so in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. We have done it with much more discipline than his lot ever displayed or is ever likely to display, particularly now that they have that cream puff back as leader.

         —As honourable senators will be aware, on 20 May, just a few days ago, the Chinese Government declared martial law in central Beijing in an attempt to end the massive demonstrations which have been taking place since late April and especially in the past week. Army units took up positions in the suburbs but have not moved further. To date no major clashes have been reported between demonstrators and troops. The central area of the capital remains controlled by the demonstrators and their supporters. The situation remains confused, including the political situation lying behind the conduct of the demonstrations, and the outcome is unclear.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to the position of Australians in China, our diplomatic posts have advised that there is no threat to the safety of Australian citizens but Australians are being advised to stay close to their residences and to avoid areas where demonstrators are concentrated. Travellers who intend to visit Beijing should consider postponing their visits until the situation becomes clearer. There has been a consular warning issued to that effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as Australia's attitude in response to all this is concerned, while the resolution of the affair obviously is an internal matter to be resolved within China, it is Australia's very strong hope that the current crisis can be resolved without violence and with respect for fundamental human rights. We also hope that the situation can be resolved in a manner which will not jeopardise, and indeed will positively enhance, the significant achievements of reform and liberalisation in China that have occurred over the past decade. There has been an opening up of China to the rest of the world. There has been a very great increase in the cooperation of China with the rest of the world, and we hope that these developments will not be prejudiced. China has undergone massive economic change during the past decade of economic reform. There has been steady liberalisation of the environment for foreign investment since 1979. Encouragement of foreign investment has been a major plank of China's investment program, and Australian investment in China has grown steadily and currently stands at around $200m. There is an evident linkage between economic reform and the demands in China for accelerated political change.
       </para>
       <para>
        To come to the last part of the question, it is obviously the case that the current unrest in China will give rise to some uncertainty in the minds of current and prospective Australian investors in China. But it should be noted that to date there has been no threat whatever to foreigners or to foreign interests. It is certainly our hope, and indeed expectation, that, even if the momentum of reform in China were to be slowed in the immediate short term by current events, the direction of reform will be sustained, thus enhancing opportunities for trade and investment with China by Australia and, indeed, other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The whole situation is being kept under very close monitoring by our embassy in Beijing. It is very difficult to predict with any outcome the course of events over the next few days. I shall keep in as close touch with the situation as I can and advise the Senate if there is any change in the Australian Government's position in reaction to events there.

         —I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to an answer he gave me in November last year when he predicted a current account deficit of about $1 billion or, I think he said, `perhaps a bit more' above the Budget estimate of $9.5 billion. The Minister said at that time that there was no likelihood that, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), it would be `as much as 4 per cent'. Does the Minister now agree that a deficit figure at least $7 billion more than the Budget estimate is on the cards, that the deficit for the first 10 months of the year has already exceeded 4 per cent of estimated GDP for this year, and that the deficit for the year as a whole will almost certainly exceed 5 per cent of GDP? In view of this continuing current account crisis, coupled now with a tumbling dollar, have we now reached the worst case scenario which the Minister outlined in his Face to Face interview last October and which, as he put it then, would probably require the Government `to do something further on the outlay side of the Budget'?

However, I did say that one followed the other because I do not think one should be too dogmatic about what causes changes in currency. At least, in the short term, the price at which currencies are traded internationally has as much to do with animal spirits as it has to do with underlying economic realities, at least in the short term.

I think the possibility of error is remote because, as I understand it, this is not a report but a column written by Senator Tambling. It is loaded not only with errors of fact, in that the figures quoted are more often wrong than right, but also with gross error of logic and internal inconsistency. For example-I think I can say that Senator Tambling has written this and has not been reported as saying it-he states that total tax revenue in this financial year will be $82.3 billion. That just happens to be correct or at least it is the estimate for total tax revenue this year. In the very next paragraph he states that personal income tax revenue in this financial year will be $87.9 billion-some $7 billion higher than the estimate for total tax revenue. That is the glaring, logical inconsistency, or internal inconsistency, given that this is, I believe, an article written by Senator Tambling and not a press report. The central allegation that he made is that there has been a massive increase in personal taxation since this Government came to office.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In making such an assessment, it is necessary to look at the Budget outcomes in both of those years. We all know that the Fraser Government ran a `spend now and tick it up on the deficit' policy. That is the policy that the Fraser Government ran for most of its period in office which, of course, degenerated into complete fiscal irresponsibility in the last year of that Government. The Fraser Government, in its second last year, brought in a prospective Budget deficit, following its removal from office, of 5 per cent of gross domestic product. This year this Government will bring in a surplus of something like 2 per cent of GDP, so it would be remarkable if such a huge turnaround in the Budget outcome of almost 7 percentage points of GDP could have been achieved without at least maintaining the level of personal taxation. As I said, there has been a negligible increase in the level of taxation as a proportion of GDP. The absolute figures of taxation and especially personal income tax have been boosted by the high rates of economic growth which have prevailed over the last six years and the unprecedented growth in employment which continues right up to the present. I was asked by Senator Maguire about the relative rates of income tax. The answer is that, following the 1 July tax cuts, the amount of personal income tax paid by taxpayers, as the Treasurer has already stated, will be less than if the 1983 rate scale had been indexed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final point that I want to make is that Senator Tambling is also reported to have said that excise hits the poor hardest, as do indirect taxes in general. That is what the newspaper report said. Some people might dispute that. I think that, as a general statement, it is probably true but there are ways of compensating for it. The real point that I wish to make is that if Senator Tambling believes that, he should send off a letter to the Federal President of the Liberal Party who renewed his calls as recently as nine days ago for the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax and a shift in the taxation mix, or the revenue raising mix, towards indirect taxes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not expect that Mr Elliott will take any notice of Senator Tambling's plea, should he care to make it, on behalf of the poor, because the intention of Mr Elliott's tax policies is to hit the people who have their tinny and pie in the outer at Princes Park while he is sitting in the Elders box with his cronies, guzzling champagne and eating chicken and caviar, all paid for by Elders in the first instance and substantially subsidised by the taxpayer through rorting the Elders account in the second instance. I do not believe that Mr Elliott's fellow Elders-IXL director and about-to-become Liberal Party candidate for the House of Representatives, apparently, will be any more sympathetic to a proposal from Senator Tambling not to hit the poor, not to change the tax mix in a way that hits the poor. Mr McLachlan will be equally unreceptive as Mr Elliott to that proposition.

         —I am aware of the articles in the West Australian about this particular issue. Going to the heart of the issue, I think the Senate needs to be reminded that when the Child Support Agency legislation passed the Senate last year that legislation provided for mechanisms for the collection of maintenance and structures which had to be followed in pursuing the Government's achievement to collect maintenance. Basically, the two requirements were that a person who obtains a maintenance order has to either apply to the agency for the agency to collect the maintenance or opt out of agency collection. The other obligation under the Act was that courts were required to send to the Child Support Agency a copy of all orders they made.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Because of this and because many lawyers practising in the family law area are still failing to advise clients of their obligation either to apply to the CSA for collection or to opt out, we are in a situation, particularly in Western Australia, where there are a significant number of orders which have not been registered and for which no application has been received. Because of this and because this could lead to major cost on revenue, the Perth Child Support Agency exercised its powers under section 24 (2) of the Child Support Act to register a number of these orders. As a consequence, we have had the problem that Senator Giles refers to. The primary reason for the difficulties that have arisen is that people who are not pensioners and beneficiaries have not been aware of their obligation, and have not complied with that obligation, either to apply for registration or to opt out. As I said, one reason for this is that many lawyers practising in this area are not accurately advising their clients of the effect of the particular legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other particular problem-and the Government finds it regrettable-is that the first letter from the CSA to the payee in the particular case which Senator Giles referred to did not make it clear that the payee, who was not a pensioner or beneficiary, could simply opt out of CSA collection. The agency has, therefore, modified its procedures to make sure that people are accurately advised of their rights to opt out prior to collection and, in doing so, has rendered an apology to any particular person who has been inconvenienced by the practice that has been followed so far.

         —In answering this question, I would like to place on record the active and continuing interest that Senator McKiernan has shown in this issue. As he mentions, the background to this issue is that there have been a number of allegations relating to the safety of, the availability of spare parts for, as well as insurance and finance questions regarding a large number of imported Japanese used cars which are still being imported through Western Australia. As a consequence of those problems, I asked the Trade Practices Commission to look at the issues involved in this and to report back to me. The Trade Practices Commission has completed its preliminary report and has concluded that there are six problems in this area that are of important concern for consumers. They go to questions of safety, information disclosure, availability of spare parts, servicing, finance and insurance. Therefore, the concerns can be seen to fall within two areas-those relating to safety and those relating to the right of consumers to be adequately informed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Commission found that there was substantial evidence of potential safety concerns. I am pleased to see that my colleague the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support is to introduce a Bill which will impose an effective national system of compliance to Australian vehicle design rules for imported cars. That initiative is very much in line with the Trade Practices Commission's recommendations and with the recent decision of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. It should be stressed at this particular stage that most players in the field see the need for a strong national uniform approach to matters such as these and do so because it is seen that these problems do not necessarily end where State borders start and finish.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other problem that needs to be addressed arising out of the Trade Practices Commission report is that of information disclosure. The Trade Practices Commission has identified two major areas that we need to address in this area. One is that, even after compliance with Australian vehicle design regulations, there will still be significant differences in the mechanical make-up of imported vehicles as opposed to domestic models. So there will be a number of disclosure problems that we will have to address there. There is also the problem of the existing large store of cars that have already been imported into Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The disclosure problems relate to four specific areas. Insurance, finance and repairs are three of those areas. The fourth is the question of the adequacy of supplies of spare parts, which is a particular issue for which there is specific provision in the Trade Practices Act. Basically, once we put aside the problem of safety which should be addressed by the Bill to be introduced by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, we are talking about the need for fair trading in this particular area to ensure that consumers do have adequate access to information to alert them to the fact that there are major differences between these cars and domestic models.
       </para>
       <para>
        To that effect, the Commission has recommended that further work between the parties be undertaken to ensure that there is adequate disclosure and that consumers are made aware of the differences when considering the purchase of an imported used car. Overall, I think that, between the actions of the Minister for Transport and Communications, the Trade Practices Commission and me, we have made a comprehensive response to this problem, and I would like at this stage to put on record my appreciation of the Trade Practices Commission in providing a very useful and constructive basis for governments to take further action.

I ask the Minister whether the Australian Government is aware of the planning for this exercise, which involves all its regional allies, including Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Philippines. If so, has the Australian Government suggested to the United States that this is hardly an appropriate exercise in light of the proposals for naval arms control in the North Pacific put forward last year by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden? Finally, I ask whether there is any accuracy in the report by Agence France Presse in Tokyo on 20 March this year that Australia has also been asked to join the exercise, known as PACEX, which will span both the Pacific and Indian Oceans and include land, air and naval forces.

         —This question is very similar to a question I took on notice from Senator Sheil in the last couple of days of the previous two-week sitting. I hope that in answering Senator Bjelke-Petersen's question I shall cover Senator Sheil's concerns. There are presently 11 Chinooks in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and they are based at Amberley in Queensland. While the Chinook has performed creditably during its 16 years of service, it has reached a stage in its service life where operating costs are increasing dramatically, and to maintain the helicopter in service would require a major upgrade. The Department of Defence has considered all of the options involved in retaining the Chinook in service but, on balance, and in considering the capability of the Army's new Black Hawk helicopter, the ADF decided that it can neither afford nor justify the retention of the Chinook.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The majority of the Chinook's tasks can be performed by the Black Hawk or by other elements of the force in being. Obviously it is a difficult decision but, in view of the need for the defence forces to exercise financial restraint to allow the development of other higher priorities, the retention of the Chinook can be neither afforded nor justified. The Chinook costs about $7,080 per hour to operate, and the serviceability rates, despite the best efforts of the RAAF, have been very low. Australia's new battlefield helicopter, the Black Hawk, which will provide improved troop mobility, costs only $2,390 per hour to operate, which is a greatly reduced cost in terms of what the Chinook does now. Of course, any upgrade on the Chinook from a C model to a D model-that is what we are talking about here-would cost of the order of $200m. That just cannot sensibly be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bjelke-Petersen raised the question of rescues and Senator Sheil referred to a particular rescue at sea. Obviously, the Chinook's rescue capability could not possibly be the main consideration in the minds of the defence forces when making a decision of this nature. Nonetheless, I will endeavour to discover what the Department intends to do to replace that capability.

         —No, Senator Boswell. This question of daylight saving is seen as being very important in some parts of Queensland-I hope that the honourable senator recognises that too-and it does have implications for the efficient conduct of industry and commerce in that State relative to other States. I recall the gist of the comments made in 1974 by the late Senator Murphy and I have seen reference to them elsewhere. Certainly, I could not say whether the constitutional proposition, which seems to have been put by Senator Murphy, concerning the Federal Government's powers to legislate in this area is correct or not. I think the question of the different summer time regimes should be one for the States. The onus is clearly on them to work towards a uniform approach. I think even Senator Boswell, who interjected about States rights, would concede, as the shadow Minister for regional development, the desirability of a uniform approach. I guess the best way for this issue to be resolved in Queensland, if it is not going to be resolved by the present Queensland Government, is for there to be a change of government in Queensland. This is something I would warmly welcome at the next election.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Before responding to the detail of the Senator's question I should clear up the misapprehension implied in it that Pharmacists are in some way salaried employees of the Government. Pharmacists are in fact self employed professionals who, in respect of the supply of pharmaceutical benefits to the community, received a 25% markup on the cost of goods plus a dispensing fee. Pharmacists do not rely on payments under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for their entire income, most conduct a substantial retail operation in addition to their dispensing activities. The Pharmacy Guild's own figures show that only 35% of Pharmacists' income results from the supply of benefits under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Pharmacy Guild claims that average pharmacy remuneration has fallen by 14.1% in the past 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        This claim is false. Department of Community Services and Health figures show that in the past five years pharmacy remuneration has risen at a rate more than twice that of Average Weekly Earnings and almost twice the increase in the Consumer Price Index over the same period.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Guild's claim is based on a selective comparison of chemists' claims processed in the two half year periods ending December 1987 and December 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Guild should know the two periods are not comparable, for example:
       </para>
       <para>
        The first `Safety Net' entitlement period spanned 14 months from 1 November 1986 to 31 December 1987. This enabled some 227,000 more people to qualify for free benefits than in the second `Safety Net' period covering the 1988 calendar year. A larger proportion of non-pensioner prescriptions were therefore subsidised by the Government in the 6 months to December 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        The maximum general patient contribution was increased from $10.00 to $11.00 on 1 July 1988, thereby excluding from statistics for the second period all general benefit prescriptions in the $10.00 to $11.00 price range.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were a number of technical problems in claims processing during December 1988, with the result that a significant number of claims which would normally have been processed in this period were not processed until January 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additionally the Guild used a number of incorrect base figures, compounded by a simple error in statistical methodology-all serving to inflate their perception of the reduction in pharmacy remuneration.
       </para>
       <para>
        When these methodological errors are corrected and adjustments are made for some of the other factors I have mentioned, in the 9 months to March 1989 average pharmacy remuneration can be demonstrated to have risen by nearly 3%. This period represents the most recent period for which figures are available and reflects the recovery in payment times following the processing problems in December.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has not, as suggested, singled out pharmacists for a reduction in income. Pharmacy remuneration is determined by an independent tribunal, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal and not by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was this independent tribunal that recently determined, after considering all the relevant facts before it, that the pharmacists' dispensing fee should be reduced by 10 cents per prescription with effect from 1 February 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        More importantly however, the Remuneration Tribunal released a report on 26 April 1989 based on a survey of chemists' dispensing costs which implies that the current levels of pharmacy remuneration may be inflated by between 40 cents and $1 per prescription. The Tribunal will be holding a public inquiry to consider the implications of that report on June 2nd.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Pharmacy Guild along with other interested parties will have an opportunity to present their case at that hearing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since January 1988 have affected pharmacy incomes. On the other hand however the Remuneration Tribunal considered that income lost from both Government decisions and cost increases was more than offset by windfall gains achieved through the 25% markup on rapidly rising drug prices. The Tribunal considered all these factors before deciding to reduce the dispensing fee component of pharmacy remuneration with effect from 1 February 1989.

        The vast majority of service providers have implemented the new fee relief arrangements and it is a gross overstatement to say that there is a lack of support by the child care industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course any new procedures will have some initial teething problems. The Ministers for Community Services and Health and Social Security are aware of some of the initial administrative issues which have arisen and officers from their two departments are working closely to resolve these. The Department of Social Security will shortly commence an implementation review and a sample of service providers will have the opportunity to report on any implementation problems they are experiencing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable senator's question implies that the Commonwealth has withheld funding from local government on a widespread basis. This is not the case. We are currently aware of only two local government authorities in Victoria which are not referring people seeking fee relief to the Department of Social Security. In breach of the guidelines they are continuing to assess the income of fee relief applicants themselves. Under these circumstances the Department of Community Services and Health has no option than to advise these municipalities that they will not be reimbursed for fee relief paid for clients where income is assessed outside the guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        Staff from the Victorian office of DCSH are in communication with these councils in order to determine their rightful entitlements and a future course of action. Sponsoring organisations will be reimbursed for all fee relief provided to clients properly assessed in accordance with the guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to have incomes for child care fee relief assessed by DSS was made in recognition of the considerable Commonwealth assistance that may be received by individual families through fee relief. Under the old arrangement entitlement was largely based on self declaration of income and the burden of proof of entitlement rested with service providers. Child care staff have many other responsibilities in working with the families and caring for the children. Accordingly, the government decided to shift responsibility for assessing income to the national DSS network to achieve a consistent approach using uniform and detailed instructions and procedures.

       <para>
        This paper is in fact a corrigendum to page 51 of the annual report of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. The corrigendum, which relates to a change in the estimate of the amount of money the Authority has lost because of the pig-headedness of this Government, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Treasurer has given his approval pursuant to Section 63e of the Audit Act to the Authority undertaking a certain range of investments, the Authority is only investing its surplus funds in interest bearing deposits with authorised trading banks due to the impracticability of obtaining the prior approval of the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is estimated that the loss of income to the Authority during 1987/88 resulting from the inability to invest in a certain range of investments approved by the Treasurer is in the vicinity of $0.4 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is incredible that this Government cannot get its act together enough to allow this Authority to invest along the lines that the Government has approved of. It is a ludicrous waste of money. I wonder whether, when the Government provides this sort of information to us, it might not do us and the Australian people the courtesy of explaining why it is so incompetent that it prevents an authority like this maximising its returns to the benefit of the Australian people. An amount of $400,000 is simply wasted because of this Government's incompetence. A Bill is to come before this place shortly to change the composition of this organisation. It will be interesting to see to what extent the Government will then change the arrangements-as requested, by the way, by the Authority-in terms of approvals for carrying out its financial operations in an effective way, free from the dead hand of the pathetic administration of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a severe limitation of freedom to invest appropriately in line with ministerial approval and the total investment return seems to me to be monumentally inadequate anyway. I think we deserve some sort of explanation. In the annual report we see that something like $32.2m is out on short term deposits and securities, and another $8.5m is in Commonwealth bonds. That is up a bit from the previous year. But the incredible thing is that that earned something like only $4.2m, a return of about 10 per cent. Even Senator Button would recognise that that is a lousy rate of return. Even some of the industries that Senator Button has helped destroy get better results than that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality is that bank stamp bills are getting something like 16 per cent. In other words, if this Authority were given the practical capacity to do what the relevant Minister claims he is allowing it to do-in fact, he is effectively undermining its capacity to do so-it would clearly earn an awful lot more on its $40m-odd of investments and short term deposits of one kind or another than this pretty pathetic reality of about 10 per cent. That is, of course, unless the volume of short term deposits rises and falls throughout the year to a significant degree.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply stress that this corrigendum underlines once again the monumental incompetence this Government has displayed in dealing with its authorities. It is either unable to get them to report on time or, when they do report on time, we see the dead hand of incompetence costing the taxpayers of Australia multimillions of dollars.

       I wish to comment only briefly on one or two matters in relation to the 131st meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, which is chaired by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. John Kerin, and comprises all the State agricultural Ministers, their advisers and their directors of agriculture. This Agricultural Council had a very great responsibility to agriculture throughout our nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I note with interest that the export of Australian hides and skins is referred to on page 18 of the report. This matter was reported on in the annual report of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation. I note that the Standing Committee and the Minister requested the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council to report further on this matter. If they had bothered to look at the annual report of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation, they would have found that some quite remarkable techniques are being used in fellmongering, including laser technology. It is most important to Australia that this is happening because there is a possibility of value-adding about $600m a year to our exports of hides and skins. I believe that the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who has just left the chamber, would certainly support this downstreaming of Australia's hides and skins. This is something that should and can be done here. I am pleased to note that the Agricultural Council has taken note of the technology that has been investigated in this matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also wish to refer to the resolution on agricultural and veterinary chemicals, set out on page 21 of the report. If we cast our minds back to earlier this year, or perhaps late last year, when the Australian Democrats were pushing for this inquiry into veterinary chemicals, I think it was said then that the Australian Agricultural Council had quite a role to play. I am very pleased to note that it picked up quite a few of the concerns of people on both sides of the House about the uses of chemicals in agriculture and veterinary services.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we look through the resolutions we note that the Council endorsed the need to expand the national residue survey. It believed a working party should be set up consisting of representatives of the Australian Agricultural Council, the Veterinary Chemicals Council, the National Farmers Federation, the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Environment Council and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, to further investigate and coordinate the investigations into the use and overuse of some of these chemicals.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Agricultural Council is concerned about maximum residue levels for the minor use of agricultural chemicals. It has made some very good recommendations on this matter. It was particularly critical of the use of tributyltin-an organic compound used for the anti-fouling of ships. I think it has been brought to the Senate's attention on many occasions. The level of tributyltin in shellfish is causing concern. That is something that I am pleased to see the Council has taken note of. It has also noted chemical residues in wool, a matter that was referred to the Australian Wool Corporation for further report.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, the Council makes one interesting comment. It notes with deep concern the impact of continuing and possibly escalating high interest rate levels on farm incomes and farmers' capacity to pay debt loans. That was stated in February. I wonder what the comments would be now, when we look at our ever increasing high interest rates.

        We see yet again another report delivered by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-this time the Report of the Inquiry into the Death of Paul Farmer. Paul Farmer, an Aboriginal Australian, died in an observation cell at Albany Regional Prison on 11 April 1984. He was then 33 years of age. He died from blood loss, having cut his throat with a razor blade which he had concealed in his clothing. He wished to die because for him, life spent largely in prisons no longer had meaning. We are told in this report that he was not proud of the crimes which resulted in his incarceration. The first crime, his only serious crime, involved a sexual assault on an Aboriginal child who was temporarily placed in his care. He committed this offence when his mind was confused by liquor. He was 15 years old at the time and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment in Fremantle prison. Eighteen years lapsed between the time of his first sentence and the time of his death. Thirteen of those years were spent in prison.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are told in this report that there are lessons to be learnt from Farmer's life and death. These lessons are spelt out in some detail at the end of the report. We are told a lot about Farmer's life and how he first got into trouble through stealing. He stole a tricycle and $4. This was his first offence which he committed when he was about 11 years old. He then committed some other petty crimes, mainly crimes of theft. He stole $2 from some clothing left in a park and he stole a packet of cigarettes. He spent some time at Longmore, a juvenile detention centre in Perth. As I said before, he finally ended up in Fremantle gaol at the age of 15.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report tells how there was conflict in Farmer's life between the European education system under which he was educated and the traditions and culture of the Aboriginal people which are very different from that system. He found it very difficult to come to grips with the difference between those two systems. Prison officers in Albany gaol, to which he was eventually transferred a couple of years before his death, state that he changed a great deal during his years in prison. In the early days he was regarded as a happy-go-lucky but serious boy who was interested in his studies but he became very bitter towards the end of his life.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is criticism in this report of the coronial system. The coronial system in Western Australia is given special mention. There is a recommendation that the observations concerning Australian coronial services, which are dealt with in some detail in the interim report by Commissioner Muirhead, should be put into action as soon as possible. The issues mentioned in the conclusion of the report include the imprisonment of juveniles. There are some very important recommendations made in that regard. The issue of suicide prevention in prisons is also dealt with in some detail, as is a section on the mental health care of prisoners. As far as prevention of suicide in custody is concerned, grave concern is expressed in the report about the fact that, although Farmer was searched-and, indeed, strip searched-before being placed in the observation cell, because he had made previous attempts at suicide, he nonetheless managed to retain on his person a razor blade and bootlaces. It is to be hoped that as a result of these inquiries improvements can be made not only to the prison system but also with regard to the circumstances that put so many of our Aboriginal people in gaols.

       <para>
        The situation we are facing today, a debate for five minutes only on this issue of the agreement on the establishment of a joint space research facility, is extraordinary. It is only now and again that the people of the Commonwealth realise what types of powers the Executive Government has. One of those powers is the signing and ratification of treaties. I doubt whether many Australians, or indeed, many parliamentarians, knew what the Convention for the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage 1972 was all about until it was used in the Franklin dam issue. Despite the fact that I may have liked the way that particular issue went, it is extraordinary that so little attention is being paid to this issue. Recently I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) whether there were any avenues for parliamentary review or oversight of international conventions, treaties or agreements. The Minister replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        The constitutional power to enter into treaties is one that belongs to the Governor-General in Council. The Commonwealth Parliament has no formal function to exercise by way of review or oversight of international conventions, treaties and agreements which the Federal Government is considering signing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also asked whether there were any avenues of parliamentary review or oversight of treaties which the Government had signed. The Minister replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        Successive governments have observed the practice of bringing all treaties to the attention of parliament . . . by tabling treaties in batches and often individually in the case of particularly important treaties . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In a batch of 26 treaties in this case, No. 17 concerns the exchange of notes constituting an agreement with the Government of the United States of America amending the agreement on the establishment of a joint space facility, that is, the Pine Gap installation. I would have thought that any change to this agreement, which itself goes to the very heart of Australia's foreign relations with the United States of America and our sovereign status as a nation, would have been given greater parliamentary consideration. Obviously, this is not considered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to be an important agreement. Even those who are opposed to it, I would have thought, would be opposed to that particular interpretation. The Pine Gap agreement has been extended for 10 years, and the extension came into force on 16 November last year. This treaty is now listed for a five-minute discussion by an individual member-months after the event. This belated form of parliamentary consideration is a farce and an affront to parliamentary democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The same comments should be made about treaty No. 18 on the list, which extends Australia's agreement with the United States of America in respect of Nurrungar for another 10 years. This agreement also did not warrant an individual parliamentary statement and discussion. This again is obviously of no importance to the Government. A very large percentage of the Australian population finds these treaties and agreements utterly reprehensible and abhorrent. People find that the Government is signing away a great deal of our sovereignty and is linking us to a nuclear arms strategy that many Australians abhor and reject.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if the majority disagree on that issue, I would still have thought that it would be a matter of sufficient importance for there to be a debate on the treaty itself before the date on which it was signed, rather than debating it by other devices under Standing Orders. It seems to me that the Parliament, as the Minister has said, has no formal role. What the Minister is really asserting is that the Parliament has no role at all. That is extremely disappointing, not only to people who are opposed, as I am, to these particular treaties, but also to those who wish to have a greater and more open debate about the future of this country, particularly regarding these extraordinary links which tie us into a nuclear capacity with the United States, a nuclear strategy which many of us in this country find absolutely abhorrent.

         —I also wish to speak about treaty No. 17 on the list, which concerns the agreement on the establishment of a joint space research facility, and treaty No. 18, which concerns the agreement on the establishment of a joint defence communications station, news of which was foisted on the Australian public without any warning whatsoever by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement to Parliament last year. It was quite a shattering blow. I think the Government did this in absolute secrecy. I understand the concept of executive action being taken-the Government does not need to refer this action to the Parliament and it certainly does not need to bother with anything like referring these actions to the people. It is very anti-democratic to act in this way. Of course, the only thing that people can do about this is to change the Government, which is looking at the matter very cynically. If we were to get rid of the Labor Government on this issue, we would probably be in a much worse pickle with the other lot. It does not leave people very much room for debate in this so-called democracy when such an agreement, which, as Senator Macklin has said, goes to the very heart of our foreign affairs and defence policies, can be changed with a stroke of a pen.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I was quite appalled to see, as part of the Four Corners program on television last night, the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) knocking back the champagne with a former United States Ambassador and saying how easy it was to change the agreements on the bases at Pine Gap and Nurrungar and that there was no need to consult the people. Obviously, they thought they could get away with it and did not think there would be much reaction in the community. A community that is totally uninformed about something like that finds it very difficult to make an immediate response. Of course, there has been a response. The people whom I represent in this place are appalled by the extension of the lease. By extending it for 10 years, as the Government has done, without any acknowledgment of the people's concerns or any consultation whatsoever, even with its own parliamentary back bench, the Government has shown its complete disregard for the wishes of the Australian people. The lease has a three-year clause for notification of any change in the 10-year agreement. That is the very damaging part, because within the life of any government in this place there could be a change of government within the period that is allowed for notification of intent to change the agreement to be made. It is that three-year subclause of the 10-year lease that is the very damaging part.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very depressing for people who have been arguing that Australia needs to get rid of its nuclear entanglements to find all of a sudden that we are involved in 10-year leases on these two bases rather than the situation which had been in place previously, which was notification to be given with only one-year's notice of termination of the leases. It has put Australia into a very much more fixed position of continuing to back up the nuclear war fighting strategies of the United States Government. In these times, when we are seeing somewhat of a detente occurring between the two superpowers, it is absolutely crazy for Australia to be put in a position of being locked into the nuclear war fighting strategies of one of the superpowers. We are doing their dirty work for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate that the agreement that was made on Pine Gap originally was put into place before there were arms control and verification treaties to be monitored by Pine Gap. Yet that is the excuse the Government persistently uses-that Pine Gap is there to monitor international treaties and that without Pine Gap we would be actually working against the cause of disarmament. That is a very dishonest way of trying to justify the presence of Pine Gap and Nurrungar on our soil. No such agreements were in place in 1966, when Pine Gap in particular was first established. So it is an afterthought. It is a justification for the existence of this base on Australian soil.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since signing that agreement, the Government has included another satellite operation from Pine Gap which ties Australia even further into the United States nuclear and conventional forces. This new satellite will allow the United States nuclear commanders to track mobile Soviet missile launches and mobile command posts, so it gives them even greater accuracy of targeting the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons. That is what Pine Gap is all about, and it is in the living heart of Australia and it is a great despoilation of our country. The fact that the Government can get away, at the stroke of a pen and with the clink of champagne glasses, with changing the agreement to lock Australia in for a further 10 years, is a great blight on our democratic process and on the wishes of more than 50 per cent of Australians who are now clearly opposed to the placing of any United States bases on Australian soil. These two in particular directly link us with the nuclear capacity of the United States. I think that most Australians are now moving away from a position of wanting to be involved in that situation.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislative changes made by the Patents Amendment Bill 1989 relate to the duration of a patentee's right to take legal action against infringers of the patent. The Bill abolishes the present complex procedures for extending the term of a patent and replaces them with more straightforward procedures applicable only to pharmaceuticals.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 28 November 1986 the then Minister for Science tabled in the House of Representatives the Government's response to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee's report, ``Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia''. This Bill implements the Government's response to recommendation 11 of the report. Recommendation 11 proposed, by a majority, that the present standard patent term of 16 years be retained, but that the procedures for granting of extensions of the terms of standard patents be eliminated in toto. The majority of the Committee believed that there was no evidence that the social benefits of the extension procedure outweighed its social costs, particularly those costs arising from the uncertainty faced by competitors who are unsure when rights in patented inventions will terminate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government responded by approving recommendation 11 in principle, but stated that it would announce a decision at an appropriate time on pharmaceuticals and agricultural and veterinary chemicals for which effective patent life is eroded by regulatory delays.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's policy on patent term for those special cases was announced on 13 September 1987 in a media statement which I made jointly with the Minister for Community Services and Health. The statement announced a number of new policies aimed at encouraging the growth of the pharmaceutical products industry in Australia. The changes included the Government's decision to provide for extensions to patent life on pharmaceuticals for human use.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill includes the arrangements needed to implement that decision. These arrangements will allow the holder of a pharmaceutical patent to apply to the Commissioner of Patents for an extension of term of 4 years, rather than having to go through the courts under the existing provisions. Extensions under the existing procedures must be based on the grounds of inadequate remuneration (or, rarely in practice, of war loss). Those procedures require complicated evidence and argument to be presented in lengthy court proceedings which are costly to industry and government, and the eventual outcome remains uncertain for years. The new procedures will be simpler, less costly to use and offer greater certainty to patent holders and others.
       </para>
       <para>
        The arrangements acknowledge that the effective patent life for pharmaceuticals for human use is reduced by the stringent and time-consuming evaluation procedures that the Department of Community Services and Health is required to conduct to ensure both the safety of patients and the efficacy of drugs. An extension of 4 years will be available for a patent for a pharmaceutical substance provided that the substance, or a product containing the substance, has received marketing approval by that Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the final 2 years of an extension, a competing company will be allowed to gear up to be in a position to enter the market immediately on expiry of the extension.
       </para>
       <para>
        The transitional arrangements in the Bill raise the drawbridge-in effect, from 3 June 1988, when the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives-on the seeking of extension of term under the present provisions. That move will avoid a rash of speculative applications for extensions under the old procedures, and will come as no surprise to users of the patent system who have been aware for some time that the system would be changing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill was the subject of Government sponsored amendments in the House of Representatives. There was little in-depth consultation with interested parties on the details of the Bill before it was introduced into the House. This was necessary to avert the possibility of advantaging some and disadvantaging others. Comments were made on the Bill by interest groups, and their criticisms were examined carefully. The Government therefore moved amendments designed to improve the machinery by which the Bill implements our policy. Those amendments were agreed by the House of Representatives and are now incorporated in the text of the Bill which is before the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        A detailed explanation of the provisions of the amended Bill is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the existing legislation, pharmaceutical companies regularly seek patent extensions of up to 10 years through the courts. The time taken by the present complex proceedings, particularly in cases where the extension is opposed, means that several years elapse before a decision is handed down. During that period, the patentee enjoys monopoly prices under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, whether or not an extension is subsequently granted. The more straightforward arrangements made by this Bill will result in earlier determination and substantially shorter extensions than may be granted at present. It is likely that patent extensions will be sought for more drugs than is the case at present. However, any increase in costs which may flow from an increase in numbers of extensions will be significantly offset by the more rapid introduction of competitor products after patent extensions expire, as a result of the provision which permits the testing of products by other manufacturers in the last 2 years of an extension.
       </para>
       <para>
        Administration of the new scheme set up by the Bill may involve a small number of additional staff in the Patent Office and the Department of Community Services and Health.

        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL
       </para>
       <para>
        (No. 2) 1989
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill introduces measures to give effect to the superannuation tax reform measures announced in the May Economic Statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The announced changes, which apply from 1 July 1988, have two central elements-first, the bring-forward of tax from end benefits to the point at which employer superannuation contributions are made, and second, the introduction of a tax at a concessional rate on the investment income of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concessional rate of tax on investment income is to apply also to pooled superannuation trusts-that is, trusts that are wholly owned by complying superannuation funds and approved deposit funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tax on contributions and investment income of complying funds is being set at a rate of 15 per cent. Funds will, however, be able to significantly reduce the tax by offsetting excess imputation credits on franked dividends.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has not been possible to include in this Bill all of the legislation necessary to give effect to the May superannuation tax package.
       </para>
       <para>
        The balance of the legislation was introduced into the House last week and will also be read for a second time here in the Senate later today. It will include the changes to the concessional application of capital gains tax to superannuation funds, and the reductions in the rates of tax on retirement benefits paid from taxed superannuation funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the Bill also includes legislation announced in the May Economic Statement to repeal the special tax treatment relating to the calculated liabilities of life insurance companies. The other changes to the taxation of life insurance companies will also be introduced later today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter included in the Bill is the change announced by the Treasurer on 11 August 1988 in respect of arrangements where a holding company cancels shares in itself that are held by a subsidiary company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill reflects changes in the arrangements for approval of research institutes for the purposes of the tax concession for expenditure on scientific research.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I now move on to the detail of the measures that are implemented by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Superannuation Tax Reform
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill removes the tax exemption for the income of complying superannuation funds. Complying funds are those which satisfy standards set down in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contributions to such funds by employers and tax deductible contributions made by self-employed persons and employees are to be included in assessable income by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also includes in assessable income the investment income of complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. To ensure that there is no retrospectivity in taxing funds' income any income accrued before 1 July 1988 will not be taxable even if derived after 30 June 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        Public sector funds are being brought generally within the scope of the taxing provisions, on the footing that the proposed tax would not amount to a tax on the property of a State.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also put in place the following concessional rules for taxing complying superannuation funds:
       </para>
       <para>
        the part of a complying superannuation fund's income that is referable to current pension liabilities is to remain exempt from tax;
       </para>
       <para>
        dividend imputation rebates are to be available to complying superannuation funds even where the dividend is exempt income;
       </para>
       <para>
        as announced on 1 July 1988 the costs of death and permanent disability insurance premiums paid by complying superannuation funds are to be excluded from contributions tax. The Bill allows deductions to funds for premiums paid to obtain death and disability insurance. The concession is also extended by this Bill to funds which, though providing death and disability cover to members, do not fully insure against the liability. Such funds will be allowed a deduction equivalent to the cost of insuring against death and permanent disability liabilities. The concession is further extended by the Bill to cover the cost of providing temporary disability benefits;
       </para>
       <para>
        expenses incurred by funds in bringing in contributions are to be fully deductible even though some of the contributions are not taxable-for example, where a fund receives non-deductible employee contributions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also include in the assessable income of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds the post June 1983 components of certain rolled-over eligible termination payments. The relevant payments are retirement payments by employers (that is, ``golden handshakes'') and, to deal with any argument by public sector superannuation funds that they are not liable to tax because of the operation of section 114 of the Constitution, payments from any such funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concessional taxing arrangements for complying funds will not apply to any superannuation funds and approved deposit funds which do not satisfy the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. Those funds will be taxed on their income and taxable contributions at the rate of 49 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Complying funds which invest in pooled superannuation trusts will not be taxed again on the income which is taxed in the hands of the trust. That approach parallels the treatment of investments in life insurance policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another measure being proposed by the Bill will allow funds that invest in a pooled superannuation trust to pass on to the trust their liability to contributions tax if the trust agrees. The proposed amendment will also allow complying funds to transfer their contributions tax liability to a life office or registered organisation from which they have purchased a life insurance policy. This provision is designed to ease the administrative burden on funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a complement to the taxing of employer superannuation contributions, it is proposed in the Bill to make all such contributions tax deductible from 1 July 1988, whether or not the contributions are made to complying funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, consistent with the policy of bringing forward the tax on end benefits to the point of contribution, deductions will not be allowed in future for amounts not paid into a fund but merely set apart by an employer to provide superannuation benefits. After today deductions will only be available for amounts actually paid to a fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will give effect to the Government's decision, announced in the May Economic Statement, to increase the maximum allowable deduction for contributions made to personal superannuation funds by self-employed persons and eligible employees. The maximum deduction is to be increased from $1500 to $3000 with effect from the income year ending 30 June 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I take this opportunity to announce an extension of the proposal, announced on 11 August 1988, to exempt from tax superannuation contributions made after 30 June 1988 to meet a liability that existed at that date. The concession as announced applies to contributions to a complying fund that was in existence at 30 June 1988 in respect of that fund's own liabilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided that the exemption should be extended to cover superannuation contributions to complying funds that take over pre-July 1988 liabilities of other funds, including where the transferee fund did not exist at 30 June 1988. The concession will only apply in these cases, however, if the liability is transferred in circumstances where the member's employment period is unbroken and where benefits are not paid to the member at the time of transfer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The relevant legislation is included in one of the Bills to be introduced later.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the changes to the system of taxing superannuation funds that this Bill introduces continue the reform of the tax system that this Government has been carrying out since 1983. Together with the proposal (also announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement) to tax the superannuation and rollover deferred annuity business income of life insurance companies and registered organisations they are expected to generate additional revenue of $980 million in 1989-90 and $1,400 million in 1990-91. The net revenue gain will be smaller though because of proposed reductions in the tax payable on retirement benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a time of significant growth in the superannuation industry, this Bill will assist in improving the equity and efficiency of this area of the taxation system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Life Insurance Taxation
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will give effect to two changes to the taxation treatment of life insurance companies as announced in the 1988 May Economic Statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, the Bill will abolish the special deduction available to life insurance companies in respect to their calculated liabilities, and also remove the exemption from income tax where such liabilities exceed the value of the company's assets.
       </para>
       <para>
        These concessions will cease with effect from the 1988-89 income year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The broadening of the tax base of life companies through the changes in this Bill are estimated to produce revenue gains of $70 million in 1988-89, but this will be more than offset by the reduction in the company tax rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Share Cancellations
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill gives effect to the proposal announced by the Treasurer on 11 August 1988 to prevent a reduction in tax liability arising where a holding company cancels, for less than market value, shares in itself that are held by a subsidiary company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where the subsidiary company receives less than market value for the shares, its tax liability would be less than it would have been had the shares been cancelled or disposed of for an arm's length amount.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject to the transitional arrangement outlined below, the Bill addresses this situation by taking the subsidiary company to have received, as consideration for the cancellation, an amount equal to the market value of the shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the holding company were to subsequently dispose of its interest in the subsidiary company, the disposal proceeds would be reduced because the interest would have fallen in value as a result of the cancellation. Consequently, the holding company could in this way obtain an unwarranted benefit, by way of a reduction in its tax liability, from the cancellation of the shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill prevents a holding company from obtaining such a benefit. This is achieved by reducing the acquisition costs, or increasing the disposal proceeds, of the holding company's interests in the subsidiary company by an amount that ensures there is no reduction in the holding company's tax liability because of the cancellation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where the interest of the holding company in the subsidiary is held indirectly through one or more interposed entities, similar adjustments will be made to ensure that the interposed entities obtain no undue benefit from the share cancellation arrangement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment applies to a cancellation of shares for which court approval is obtained after 11 August 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        A transitional provision modifies the legislation as it applies to the subsidiary company for a share cancellation that occurred after the date of announcement of the legislation and on or before its introduction into the House of Representatives, i.e., after 11 August 1988 and on or before 30 November 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        Broadly, the provision provides that the subsidiary company is taken to have received, as consideration for the cancellation, an amount equal to the lesser of the market value of the shares at the time of cancellation or their cost price (or in the cases of capital gains, their indexed cost or cost base as the case may be).
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the transitional provision is that in the period between the date of announcement and the date following the introduction of the legislation, the share cancellation provisions operate in line with the Treasurer's announcement of 11 August 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment relating to share cancellations is of a safeguarding nature without which very significant amounts of revenue would be at risk from the generation of deductions and capital losses that share cancellation arrangements could produce.
       </para>
       <para>
        Approved Research Institutes
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the list of approving authorities in the definition of an `approved research institute' in section 73a of the Income Tax Assessment Act is being amended to reflect machinery of government changes made in July 1987 and changes in responsibilities as between some departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment, which will permit the Secretaries of the Departments of Community Services and Health and Employment, Education and Training to approve research institutes for taxation purposes, will have no impact on revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 1989
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, and complementary Bills introduced today, essentially bring to completion the Government's tax reforms in the superannuation arena.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1988 puts in place the framework of the new tax regime for superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill complements those measures. Broadly, it effectively reduces for recipients of superannuation benefits and related amounts the tax they pay on eligible termination payments, superannuation pensions or annuities. This compensates them for the tax being imposed at that earlier point on employer contributions to superannuation schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with the Government's undertaking at the time of the May 1988 Economic Statement, the Bill ensures that recipients of end benefits are not worse off because of the earlier taxing point for affected superannuation contributions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also places the tax treatment of the superannuation business of life assurance offices, including State and Territory Government Insurance Offices (known as SGIOs), and registered organisations (that is, friendly societies and employee associations) on the same footing as general superannuation funds-at the concessional rate of 15 per cent, allowing full franking rebates for dividend income under the imputation system on the same basis as for individuals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Associated measures in the Bill modify in various ways the deductions available to life offices to make them more compatible with the new tax treatment of superannuation business.
       </para>
       <para>
        To complete the new rules for the taxing of entities conducting superannuation business, the Bill gives wide-ranging capital gains treatment to disposals of assets held in superannuation funds or in connection with the superannuation business of life offices and other entities.
       </para>
       <para>
        This gives them the benefit of the capital gains indexation concession which ensures that only real gains, rather than nominal ones, are subject to tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following discussions with industry, the Bill also proposes several modifications to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6). A number of concessions sought by industry are being provided and there are some practical adjustments to the ways in which tax liabilities are determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        There remains to be put in place a tax instalment payment arrangement for superannuation funds that is to apply for the 1990-91 income year. Legislation to achieve this will be introduced later in the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        New legislative arrangements, also to apply from 1990-91, for the limiting of superannuation benefits under rules applied by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner are also to be included in later legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now move on in more detail to the features of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Superannuation and Other Retirement Benefits
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        With effect from 1 July 1988, lower tax will apply to eligible termination payments (known as ETPs) superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities. This will balance the taxing of contributions to superannuation funds and rolled-over unfunded ETPs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new measures-which were announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement and expanded on in later announcements-will generally reduce the tax payable on superannuation and other retirement benefits in three ways. First, they will reduce the rates of tax for post-June 1983 components of ETPs by 15 percentage points to the extent that such a component is attributable to a taxed source.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, a 15 per cent rebate of tax is being introduced for superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities taken from age 55, or as a death or disability benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, by authorising tax reductions in appropriate cases, the Bill gives effect to our commitment that no recipient of a superannuation benefit will be worse off because of the tax on superannuation contributions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Transitional measures will phase in the tax reductions on end benefits to fit the gradual impact of the new tax arrangements on amounts being paid out under superannuation schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taxation of Life Assurance Companies
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with the treatment of superannuation funds generally, the Bill will give effect to the decisions announced in May 1988 to tax the superannuation and roll-over annuity business of life assurance companies from 1 July 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The assessable income of a life assurance company will include investment income from its superannuation and roll-over annuity business. It will also include post-30 June 1983 components of lump sum retirement benefits taken in the form of ``golden handshakes'' that are invested with the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also in the Bill are rules for apportioning the taxable income of a life assurance company between complying superannuation and roll-over annuity business, non-complying superannuation business, other life assurance and accident and disability business, and non-life assurance business. This break up will allow the separate tax rates applicable to each class of business to operate.
       </para>
       <para>
        With effect from the 1988-89 income year, all expenses of life assurance companies will be apportioned between exempt income and assessable income.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, lightening the effective tax burden, expenses incurred in bringing in superannuation premiums are to be made fully deductible even though those premiums are not taxable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In keeping with the taxing of superannuation funds, including State and Territory government superannuation funds, SGIOs are to be subject to Commonwealth income tax on income derived from their superannuation and roll-over annuity business in the same way as life assurance companies from 1 July 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill extends entitlement to franking rebates under the imputation system for franked dividends received by insurance funds of life assurance companies on or after 1 July 1988. Surplus rebates from the taxation at 15 per cent of dividend received as part of their superannuation business will serve to reduce these companies' overall tax burden. The inter-corporate dividend rebate will no longer apply to dividends on shares forming assets of the insurance funds of a life assurance company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also safeguards against any technical argument that a life assurance company may be entitled to deductions as general management expenses for items of expense which are expressly not deductible to other categories of taxpayers, such as expenses incurred on entertainment or in paying fringe benefits tax. This amendment operates with effect from 26 May 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the May 1988 Economic Statement it was also announced that a life assurance company would be taxed on an overall company basis rather than on a fund-by-fund basis. This was to prevent life assurance companies from manipulating transfers of assets between statutory funds to gain undue tax advantages. In response to industry requests, life assurance companies will continue to be taxed on a fund-by-fund basis. However, the Government is committed to preventing life assurance companies from transferring assets between statutory funds solely for the purpose of reducing taxation liabilities. This matter is to be addressed further in consultation with the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Non-resident Life Assurance Companies
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Dividends derived from assets included in the Australian insurance funds of a non-resident life assurance company are to be exempt from dividend withholding tax and instead taxed on assessment. The non-resident assurer will become entitled to a franking rebate in respect of the franked proportion of those dividends. These changes will apply to dividends paid to a non-resident life assurance company on or after 1 July 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rebate on Short-term Life Assurance Bonuses
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also implement the proposal announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement to increase the rate of the rebate of tax on bonuses received on or after 1 July 1989 in respect of certain short-term life assurance policies. The rebate is to be increased from 29 per cent to 30 per cent in the case of friendly society policies and from 29 per cent to 39 per cent in the case of life assurance company policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taxation of Registered Organisations
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The comprehensive coverage of the superannuation tax reforms extends to the superannuation and roll-over annuity business of registered organisations. The new arrangements which apply to such business of life assurance companies will apply similarly to registered organisations from 1 July 1988 on the basis of the May 1988 Economic Statement. They are to apply to all registered organisations-both to friendly societies and to any other registered organisations that engage in relevant superannuation or roll-over annuity business.
       </para>
       <para>
        Gains or Losses on Disposal of Assets
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill proposes amendments that will extend generally the application of the capital gains and capital losses provisions of the income tax law to disposals of assets by complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. The special capital gains rules will also extend to disposals of assets referable to the complying superannuation and roll-over annuity business of life assurance companies and registered organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        All assets owned by such entities as at the end of 30 June 1988 will be taken for capital gains purposes to have been acquired on that date. This allows the capital gains provisions to apply regardless of the actual date of acquisition of the assets. To prevent any retrospective application of the capital gains provisions to gains or losses that accrued on or before 1 July 1988, the acquisition cost of an asset will be taken to be either its market value or the amount of costs incurred on it to that date, whichever produces the smaller gain or loss on disposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        A major benefit of this capital gains tax treatment is that entities engaged in superannuation business will attract the indexation advantages of the capital gains provisions, including on dealings in some assets that would otherwise have been treated as trading transactions not subject to indexation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the Bill provides for an exemption from tax for gains on disposals of units in a pooled superannuation trust by a complying superannuation fund, a complying approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust. This exemption also extends to certain disposals of assets by a life assurance company or a registered organization.
       </para>
       <para>
        Superannuation Funds, Approved Deposit Funds and Pooled Superannuation Trusts
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill modifies in several respects provisions dealing with the taxation of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6). These modifications will provide a number of concessions and options that have been developed after consultation with the superannuation industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        One will provide an alternative optional method for calculating the tax exempt income of a superannuation fund which segregates some of its assets solely for use in meeting the fund's current pension liabilities. Income derived from the segregated assets will be exempt from tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Vicarious exemption from tax is being provided for pooled superannuation trusts, life offices and registered organisations on such part of their income derived from complying superannuation fund business as would have been tax exempt current pension income had it been derived by relevant funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another alternative method is being introduced for calculating the deduction available to a superannuation fund in respect of the cost of providing death and disability benefits. At their option, funds may claim a deduction for a portion of any death and disability benefits actually paid in a year of income.
       </para>
       <para>
        A special deduction will enable tax exempt death benefits paid by superannuation funds to be paid at the same levels as before the changes taking effect from 1 July 1988. This deduction acknowledges that the contributions tax cannot be compensated for in such cases by the 15 per cent reduction in tax rates applicable to taxable ETPs.
       </para>
       <para>
        A provision that allows a superannuation fund to transfer its contributions tax liability to a pooled superannuation trust, life assurance company or registered organisation has been redrafted to ease the requirements to be met before such a liability may be transferred. It will now allow a fund to transfer contributions tax liability to the relevant entity up to an annual limit based on the highest value of the fund's investment in the transferee in the year of income concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also allow the Commissioner of Taxation to anticipate that certain compliance notices will be given by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The provisions being inserted will allow an assessment to be made on the assumption that the relevant notices will be given but will also permit those assessments to be amended if it subsequently transpires that the relevant notices are not given.
       </para>
       <para>
        To ensure that non-reversionary bonuses (i.e., cash bonuses) paid on life assurance policies are not effectively subject to tax twice when paid to a complying superannuation fund, a complying approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust, such bonuses are to be exempted from tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Exemption from Tax for Contributions to Superannuation Funds
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill gives effect to two measures announced on 11 August 1988 to exempt from tax certain employer contributions to superannuation funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some superannuation funds had unfunded liabilities related to benefits accrued prior to 1 July 1988. Contributions subsequently made to meet these liabilities are to be excluded from assessable income. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will be permitted to consider applications for recognition of a pre-1 July 1988 unfunded liability and, as appropriate, to issue notices specifying an available pre-1 July 1988 funding credit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Broadly, such a pre-1 July 1988 funding credit may be transferred to another fund or the fund trustees may, within specified limits, elect for an amount of employer contributions to be excluded from assessable income. Outstanding unapplied pre-1 July 1988 credit balances will be indexed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second measure covers cases where an employer does not fund benefits until retirement. An exemption from tax for these late employer contributions to a fund will be given for amounts not exceeding `untaxed' benefits paid in a year of income.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated when introducing the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6), the changes in the tax arrangements applying to the superannuation industry completed by the measures in this Bill are expected to generate $980 million in additional revenue in 1989-90 and $1400 million in 1990-91 but the net gains will be smaller after taking account of the proposed reductions in tax on end benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will amend the Income Tax Act 1986 to guard against any possibility that the proposal to tax both the contributions and the other income derived by superannuation funds and approved deposit funds could be found to deal with two subjects of taxation contrary to the Constitution. In such an event, the Act would impose tax only on that other income.

        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        INCOME TAX (FUND CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains a precautionary measure related to the proposed amendment of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986. If for constitutional reasons that amendment were to apply so as to tax only the income of particular superannuation funds and approved deposit funds, and not their taxable contributions, this Bill would operate to impose tax on the taxable contributions of such funds at the rate of 15 per cent.

        INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill complements the measures in the Bill I have just introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will amend the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to declare the rates of tax payable on the various components of taxable income of life assurance companies and registered organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the component referable to policies held by complying funds or in respect of rollover annuities the rate is to be 15 per cent. A rate of 47 per cent is to be set in respect of the component referable to policies held by non-complying funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rate set for the component referable to other life assurance and accident and disability insurance is 39 per cent where the insurer is a life assurance office and 30 per cent where the insurer is a registered organisation. Finally, a rate of 39 per cent is to be fixed in respect of the non-statutory fund component of the taxable income of a life assurance company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new tax rates for life offices and registered organisations will generally have effect for the year of income commencing on 1 July 1988, but the 47 per cent rate in respect of non-complying fund income is to apply from the income year commencing on 1 July 1990. The rates to non-complying fund income for the income years commencing 1 July 1988 and 1 July 1989 are to be 49 and 48 per cent respectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also reduce, in two stages, the rate of tax applying to the taxable income of non-complying superannuation funds and approved deposit funds and the special component of the taxable income of a complying fund or pooled superannuation trust. The existing 49 per cent rate is to be reduced to 48 per cent for the income year commencing on 1 July 1989 and to 47 per cent for the year commencing 1 July 1990 and later years.
       </para>

        This Bill will amend the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to declare the rate of tax payable on taxable contributions and income derived by complying superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. For complying funds, the declared rate is generally 15 per cent. A rate of 49 per cent will apply to the income and contributions of non-complying funds. The existing 49 per cent rate for excessive non-arm's length income derived by superannuation funds and approved deposit funds will be maintained for those funds and extended to such excessive income derived by pooled superannuation trusts.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate will be aware that on 18 November last year the Prime Minister announced a package of measures that signal a major reorientation of the Government's approach to complex conservation and development issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures include: streamlining the operations of the Australian Heritage Commission, to be given effect in amendments to the Australian Heritage Commission Act that will also be considered by the Parliament in these Sittings; the establishment of new consultative processes with the State and Territory Governments and with industry, union and conservation groups to ensure that major conservation and development issues can be discussed in a less confrontationist atmosphere than in the past; the negotiation of a Forest Accord; a review of existing environmental data bases; the development of a National Forests Inventory; and the establishment of an independent Resource Assessment Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these initiatives will improve the basis on which Government decisions on important resource issues are made.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to establish the Resource Assessment Commission which will inquire into, and report on, the environmental, cultural, social, industry, economic or other aspects of resources and their uses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The inquiries will be initiated by the Commonwealth Government on matters where the Government or a Commonwealth authority may need advice before taking a decision on a resource matter within the exercise of the Commonwealth's constitutional powers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with the 18 November decisions, the Commission will be required to be guided by the three policy principles that were announced at that time and that are used as a guide by Commonwealth Ministers in resolving competing resource use claims. These principles are that:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) there should be an integrated approach to conservation and development by taking both aspects into account at an early stage;
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net benefits to the community from the nation's resources, having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental considerations, and an equitable distribution of the return on resources; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) Commonwealth decisions, policies and management regimes may provide for additional uses that are compatible with the primary purpose values of the area, recognising that in some cases both conservation and development interests can be accommodated concurrently or sequentially, and in other cases, choices must be made between alternative uses or combinations of uses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Resource Assessment Commission legislation will be in addition to and not in substitution for existing legislation. In particular, an inquiry by the RAC will not affect the need for, or timing of, any Environmental Impact Statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In general, however, RAC inquiries are expected to relate to industries, regions or issues, in contrast to the processes of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, which generally apply to a specific project proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Inquiries almost always will be into major, complex and contentious resource use issues. They are likely to deal with the resource industries that are of great significance for the economy and the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will have the capacity under the Act to commission smaller scale inquiries, for example with the Chairperson only, to provide an independent assessment of smaller resource issues within a tight timeframe. In such exceptional cases we would expect that the matter under investigation by the smaller inquiry would be part of a larger RAC inquiry and that the Government would want advice or analysis in relation to the matter relatively quickly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's intention, subject to the passage of this Bill, is to refer Australia's forest and timber resources to the RAC as its first inquiry. The Terms of Reference for the first inquiry, and the names of the special Commissioners to be appointed, will be announced following passage of the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation empowers the Commission to enquire into all those aspects of any matters referred to it that the Commission considers to be relevant. It has a reporting freedom like that given to the Industries Assistance Commission. Clause 8 of the Bill indicates the various elements the Commission would be expected to consider-for example, identifying the resource and how it may be used at present or in the future; looking at the kinds of values individuals or groups in the community place on the resource or on the uses that can be made of it (and this includes both conservation and commercial or development uses); and assessing what various uses will mean to the community in the short term and the longer term-for instance who will gain and who will lose in both material and non-material ways. This kind of assessment could thus encompass losses or gains of amenity, or of aesthetic or spiritual values, as well as monetary losses or gains.
       </para>
       <para>
        How the Commission makes its assessment is left to the Commission to determine. It is recognised that both quantitative and qualitative elements need to be assessed, by whatever means seem appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 8 empowers the Commission to do these things ``as far as practicable''. This phrase is intended to cover all the aspects likely to be encountered in the Commission's inquiries and acknowledges our incomplete understanding of complex resource issues. We may have limited understanding, for instance, of the dynamic processes that operate within and between ecosystems or of complex economic and social interrelationships existing within and between communities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, while we can make predictions about the impacts of certain human activities, we can rarely foresee all the consequences or their extent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission, therefore, will have to assemble all reasonably obtainable information and advice and do what analysis can reasonable be done within the time limits set by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each inquiry will be required to prepare a draft report for public consideration and comment unless the Minister instructs otherwise and, after consultations on the draft, to submit a final report to the Government. Depending on the terms of reference, the report can be an information report or a report with recommendations to the Government on optional courses of action the Government may wish to take. The decision on whether to implement the recommendations of an inquiry will, of course, rest with the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its inquiry processes and operations, the Resource Assessment Commission will be similar to the Industries Assistance Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for an open, consistent approach, based on adequate information and analysis. It provides opportunities for participation by all interested parties, be they States, industries, unions, interest groups or individuals. It provides opportunities also for public comment on the background papers or draft reports that the Commission may prepare prior to putting its final advice to the Government. Evidence will be taken informally and legal representation discouraged as with the IAC. Like the IAC, the Commission may be asked to examine more than one issue or reference at any one time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like the Industries Assistance Commission, the Resource Assessment Commission will have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the provision of documentation. Penalties are provided for non-compliance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission will be responsible to the Parliament through the Prime Minister. A Chairperson will be appointed for periods of up to five years on a full-time or a part-time basis. It is expected that the Chairperson will work on a full-time basis if necessary for the conduct of inquiries. Special Commissioners will be appointed for particular inquiries following consultations by the Prime Minister with the Chairperson of the Commission and those of the Inquiries Assistance Commission and the Australian Science and Technology Council. The Chairperson and the special Commissioners will be appointed by the Governor-General.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to announce today that the first Chairperson of the Commission will be the Hon. Mr Justice Stewart, currently Chairman of the National Crime Authority. Mr Justice Stewart has had a distinguished career as a Royal Commissioner, judge of the Supreme Court of NSW and in private practice. The analytical skills, experience in the conduct of inquiries and knowledge of government which he brings to this appointment will ensure the smooth, effective and impartial operation of the Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        The members of the Commission will be supported by a small Secretariat within the Prime Minister's portfolio. Additional expert and professional staff will be hired as consultants or seconded from relevant agencies as required for particular inquiries. In addition the Commission will be able to initiate any research that may be necessary for the conduct of an inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The work program of the Commission and the terms of reference for each inquiry will be determined by the Government. The terms of reference and any instructions given by the Government to the Commission will be made public, as will any subsequent changes to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The financial cost of the Commission will depend on the number and type of matters referred to it by the Government and the duration of the inquiries it undertakes. Each major reference to the Commission is expected to cost approximately $2 million in any one year. If, however, there is no reference in the course of a year the ongoing costs would be relatively low.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government strongly supports economic growth based on sustainable development, including protection of the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In establishing the Resource Assessment Commission the Government has recognised the urgent need to improve its capacity to decide matters that affect present and future generations of Australians. It is absolutely essential that as a community we ensure that our economic development and living standards are not maintained at the expense of our children and grandchildren. We have a lot to learn about managing our unique Australian environment. We have made mistakes in the past for which we are now paying dearly. We need to do all we can to maximise both our economic and our conservation goals. The two are inextricably interlinked.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Resource Assessment Commission will face difficult and complex tasks. We will never have perfect understanding, though we must seek to improve our understanding over time. Nor can we endlessly delay decisions on the basis that more and more information can be sought. We will sometimes face unpalatable choices between conflicting goals on the basis of limited knowledge. The Commission's job will be to assemble all reasonably available information, acknowledge those areas where uncertainties remain, take relevant viewpoints into account and advise the Government on the options it can adopt-within a reasonable time frame.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Resource Assessment Commission will make a major contribution to assembling and improving our fund of knowledge and our analytical capacity. It will provide a transparent, consistent process that can be used by all interested parties as a means of having their information and their views impartially and independently assessed and considered by the Government. The inquiry process will make an important contribution to better community understanding of the facts of a particular situation and of the issues and options involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before you today has been prepared with input from a range of sources including peak industry and public interest groups. These groups raised a number of useful and constructive points about the Bill and, where possible, their concerns have been accommodated in the drafting of the Bill. It is the essence of an integrated approach to conservation and development that all the aspirations of our community be given proper weight. To reflect this, the Commission has been charged with taking the broad view and arrived at independent judgments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the past too many decisions have been taken without adequate understanding of the economic or the environmental consequences of particular courses of action or the full range of views in the community. The Resource Assessment Commission is a major initiative of this Government designed to remedy these deficiencies.

        VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 and the War Memorial Act 1980. The most significant amendments relate to the provision of Repatriation benefits for Australian servicemen and women who will join the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, UNTAG, in Namibia. Other Amendments included in the Bill represent technical and administrative adjustments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before turning to the main thrust of the Bill, I will briefly mention the minor amendments it introduces:
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision is being made to align the War Memorial with other Commonwealth statutory bodies in the Arts and Heritage sphere in relation to their powers to make investments. The effect of this would be to enable the Memorial to enter into an approved range of investments without the need to obtain Ministerial approval. Financial limits on other contracts able to be entered into without Ministerial approval would also be increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        Restitution payments made by Germany to victims of Nazi persecution will be excluded from the definition of ``income'' under the income test on service pensions. This provision will formalise an administrative practice which has been followed for some time and will bring the income test provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act into line with the provisions of the Social Security Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Repatriation Commission's power to set charges for treatment provided to community patients in Repatriation institutions will be clarified, to permit the Commission to adhere generally to State hospital charges but with some flexibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Relevant campaign medals will be defined for the purposes of determining the service pension eligibility of certain Commonwealth veterans who served during World War 2.
       </para>

        To restore the position existing under the repealed Repatriation Act before May 1986, a deceased claimant's legal personal representative will be specifically empowered to formalise and pursue an informal claim or application for pension lodged before the claimant's death.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish now to proceed to the major new initiatives contained in this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 6 March 1989, the Prime Minister gave an undertaking that members of the Australian Defence Force serving in Namibia would be provided with Repatriation benefits, including assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act, `appropriate to the tasks and hazards encountered'. This undertaking was confirmed the following day by the Minister for Defence. Much background information was provided during the debate following these announcements. I do not intend to go through all of this again in detail, but will briefly summarise the points of particular relevance to the proposed amendments on the question of Australian involvement in the Namibian peacekeeping force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Namibia's struggle for its independence from South African rule has been a long and protracted one. South Africa's refusal to abide by the United Nations request to allow South West Africa-as the country was then known-to be placed under United Nations trusteeship some four decades ago led to the formation of the South West Africa People's Organisation or SWAPO in 1957. By the early 1970s, SWAPO was in open confrontation and conflict with South African forces on Namibian soil. The situation was further inflamed by the involvement of Angola following its independence in 1975, as an extension of its own struggle against South Africa. The military support of tens of thousands of Cuban troops in the Angolan-South African conflict only served to heighten tensions in the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        The agreement reached between Cuba, Angola and South Africa in December 1988 facilitated the implementation of the long-established United Nations' plan for Namibia's transition to independence. That plan included a monitoring role for UNTAG comprising military contingents from a number of UN member countries. Honourable Senators will be aware that Australia has contributed a contingent of 305 engineers and support staff to UNTAG.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent events in Namibia indicate clearly that the country's transition to independence may yet remain fraught with difficulty. In the aftermath of armed clashes in the early stages of the UN plan's implementation, some members of the Australian contingent were called at short notice to man assembly points on the border. A continuing danger lies in the abundance of land mines in the regions bordering on Angola, a legacy of many years of open confrontation on Namibian soil, particularly between South Africa and Angola.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is against this background that UNTAG will play its crucial role. The United Nations mission is a very significant one, coming ten years after a Security Council resolution that independence should be established in Namibia. And Australia's long standing involvement in this venture should by no means be underrated. As early as 1979, the then Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, made the initial commitment to send an Australian contingent to assist in the establishment of self rule in Namibia. The fact that, regardless of party allegiance, the Government of the day felt it imperative to contribute to any United Nations mission to assist in the establishment of self rule in Namibia indicates the importance attached to this matter by Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The realisation of this long standing proposal for the independence of Namibia is now at hand and this Government has the responsibility to ensure that its servicemen and women, who will bear the brunt of the country's commitment, are provided with Repatriation benefits appropriate to the dangers they are likely to encounter and the tasks they will have to perform.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill in support of which I now speak meets this responsibility. Schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act will provide that the area including Namibia and extending 400 kilometres into Namibia's neighbouring countries, as well as Walvis Bay, shall be considered ``operational'' for the duration of the United Nations mission. Parallel provision has been made to include members of the Australian Defence Force who serve in this operational area in the list of persons whose service will qualify them for service pensions under Part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The cover provided will be effective from 18 February 1989, the date at which the first Australian representative arrived in Namibia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our people serving in Namibia can do so in the knowledge that the Government has recognised the difficult situations they may face. Once the proposed amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act have been introduced, these persons will be entitled to the full range of benefits and entitlements available under the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        They will have access to disability pensions on the same generous standard of proof basis as other war veterans. They will qualify for service pensions at age 60 for men, and 55 for women. They will also be eligible for free Repatriation medical treatment and associated benefits on the same basis as other war veterans. Cover under the Act will also be available to the families of any serving member in the event of the member's service resulting in severe or fatal disease or injury.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also proposed to amend the Defence Service Homes Act to include in the categories of ``Australian soldiers'' to whom the Act applies those servicemen and women who serve with this United Nations operation. In this way, they will have access to subsidised low interest housing loans, insurance and other housing benefits under that Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed veterans' entitlements I have just listed are the necessary outcome of a policy which has benefited from bipartisan support not only within this Parliament, but ever since Namibia came to the notice of the free world.
       </para>
       <para>
        I call on all Honourable Senators to support the passage of this Bill through the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES AMENDMENT BILL 1989
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1989 is to clarify the intention of certain provisions of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 which deal with the provision of assistance to entitled persons for the acquisition of a home. The Bill would also make a minor technical amendment to the provisions of the Defence Service Homes Act dealing with the preparation of Annual Reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since 9 December 1987, entitled veterans and members and ex-members of the Defence Force have been able to receive Defence Service Homes loans which are portable from home to home. This means that a person who borrows a Defence Service Homes loans after that date may have any amount, which is still owing on that loan immediately before its discharge, re-loaned for the subsequent purchase of a new home. This benefit continues to be provided in respect of all new loans made under the revised delivery arrangements of the Defence Service Homes Scheme. These arrangements were agreed to by the Commonwealth and Westpac Banking Corporation and approved by Parliament in November and December of last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The arrangement which applied in all cases before 9 December 1987 was that the approval of the Minister had to be obtained before the balance of a Defence Service Homes loan could be re-loaned to purchase a new home. This arrangement continues to apply to borrowers who received their loans before 9 December 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        The circumstances in which such Ministerial approval is or is not required were included in the amendments which were made to the Defence Service Homes Act on 19 December 1988 by the Defence Service Homes Amendment Act 1988. Those circumstances may not have been made sufficiently clear and the purpose of this Bill is to put the intended meaning of the relevant provisions beyond doubt.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, it is arguable that the Act does not require that Ministerial approval be obtained for the re-use of the balance of a Defence Service Homes loan to purchase a new home where the loan in question was discharged before the vesting of the Defence Service Homes Corporation's assets in Westpac. The Act also would seem to require that any person who has received Ministerial approval for the re-use of the balance of a Defence Service Homes loan must seek such approval again for any subsequent use of any remaining balance of the loan for the purchase of another home. Neither of these possible interpretations in intended and the proposed amendments would restore the intended meaning of the provisions in question.
       </para>
       <para>
        The intention broadly is that any person who received a Defence Service Homes loan before 9 December 1987 and, in a small number of cases, after 9 December 1987, must obtain the Minister's approval before a certificate can be issued by the Secretary authorising the payment of interest subsidy in respect of the re-use of any remaining portion of that loan for the purchase of a new home. However, it is intended that once such approval is given, no further Ministerial approval is necessary should the borrower at any future time wish to re-use any remaining portion of the subsidised loan to purchase another home.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments also would exempt from the requirement to obtain Ministerial approval, those persons who are deemed to have been borrowers of Defence Service Homes loans or purchasers of dwelling-houses under contracts of sale with the Defence Service Homes Corporation only because they are or were personal representatives of deceased borrowers or purchasers. This exemption would enable any such persons who have entitlements to Defence Service Homes assistance in their own right to apply for and receive such assistance without being affected by any previous or existing status they may have had as the personal representative of a deceased purchaser or borrower.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments would be effective from 19 December 1988 in order to ensure that any persons who received assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act without obtaining the Ministerial approval which, upon a strict interpretation of the Act from that date, may have been necessary would be exempted now from having to have obtained such approval. The amendment also would authorise any assistance which may have been given from that date without Ministerial approval to applicants who previously had been personal representatives of deceased purchasers or borrowers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also would amend the Defence Service Homes Act to achieve consistency between its annual report provisions and similar provisions in other Commonwealth legislation. The amendment would ensure that the powers of the Auditor-General are not restricted unintentionally in relation to his ability to report to the Minister on the financial statements which are required to be included in annual reports under the Defence Service Homes Act.

        The Minister for Defence announced last August that the Office of Defence Production (the ODP) would be converted into a Government-owned company Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd. The prime objective of the company will be to provide specialised industrial support to the Australian Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present Defence production establishments originated over 100 years ago with the establishment of the Colonial Ammunition Company in 1888 and now form a major part of the overall Defence Industrial base of this country. In recent years the Defence production organisation has been subject to extensive rationalisation aimed at improving delivery and performance. This has included:
       </para>
       <para>
        Elimination of excess capacity through the sale of facilities such as Williamstown Dockyard
       </para>
       <para>

       <para>
        Emphasis on product development
       </para>
       <para>
        Management and staffing restructuring together with introduction of measures to increase productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        These reforms have realised a saving of $150m per annum in the Defence budget and have been accompanied by a 30 per cent productivity increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has focussed attention on improving efficiency and effectiveness across all aspects of the defence portfolio. The 1987 defence white paper emphasised the need for defence production to be as efficient as possible. This has placed pressure on the defence production establishments to improve performance. The only way to achieve this is to enable the organisation to operate in a commercial way outside the public service. Work from the Australian Defence Force, traditionally allocated to ODP facilities, will be progressively open to competition. The production facilities will need to adapt to direct competition from other Australian and foreign companies. It is imperative that defence production be given the opportunity to restructure and develop in the open market with only commercial restrictions and controls on its mode of operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The establishment of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd is designed to improve the operational management of the production facilities while maintaining Government control of these valuable defence assets. As the ultimate ownership of the organisation will not change, it is unreasonable to burden the company with the imposition of costs and taxes associated with a technical change in legal status. An initial charge of $16m in stamp duty associated with the transfer of assets to the company would impact seriously on its financial situation. The Bill therefore excludes the company from the payment of stamp duty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other potential area of difficulty for the company is the application of state regulatory laws, such as those relating to land zoning or the handling of dangerous goods. The ODP facilities have operated under the control of the Commonwealth Government for most of their existence. This has resulted in management and cost structures not always appropriate to a large manufacturing company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having operated as an arm of the Commonwealth Government these production facilities will take time to adapt to all the laws and regulations applicable to a company operating under state laws. These establishments already liaise closely with state and local government bodies on matters relating to their production activities and adhere to stringent national and international operating standards. However these do not always correspond to the laws of the states in which they operate. In the longer term it is desirable that these establishments operate compatibly with state laws, but it will take some time to reach this position. This legislation is designed to give the company the time to meets the requirements of State legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be unfortunate if the continued operation of these valuable strategic assets was placed in jeopardy by providing insufficient time to adhere to a new set of operational requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        An efficient industrial base is just as much a part of our self reliant defence capability as military capabilities. By the establishment of this company, the Government has acknowledged that it is sensible to encourage and support these defence facilities as part of the total defence industrial base and to allow them to reach a situation where they can operate commercially and competitively. This Bill will provide protection for an interim period to allow the new company a smooth transition to a fully competitive commercial situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill itself contains a sunset clause so that these protections will exist for a period of 6 years. It is envisaged that progress towards a fully compliant situation in terms of state law will be reviewed after 4 years to assess the requirement for continued protection.

       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        It is estimated that the exemption of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd will save the company from being liable to pay approximately $16 million in state and territory stamp duty on the transfer of establishments to it, and from having to meet the costs (estimated to be at least $60 million) of complying with state and territory regulatory laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other provisions of the Bill have no financial impact.

       (a) that in the first ten months of 1988-89 Australia's deficit on the current account of our balance of payments has already reached $14,000 million, compared with the Treasurer's budget forecast of $9,500 million for the year as a whole, and that many forecasters are now predicting a total 1988-89 deficit as high as $17,000 million;

       (b) that these external deficits can only be financed either through further borrowings by Australians from foreigners, or by further sales of Australian land or other assets to foreign owners and there is growing public unease at the speed and extent of the continuing growth in foreign ownership of Australian land and other assets;

       The Appropriation Bills before the chamber are to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures which are additional to those authorised by the Parliament in the Appropriation Bills for 1988-89, now Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2, and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act which were passed by this Parliament in the latter part of last year. These additional appropriations are required to meet commitments that have been approved by the Government since the Budget, and which were therefore not taken into account in the drawing up of the original Appropriation Bills, now the Appropriation Acts, as well as additional requirements of an ongoing nature. The principal factors underlying those requirements include certain-no doubt believed by the Government to be unavoid- able-cost and price increases and other parameter changes which have occurred since the Budget was prepared and since therefore the original Appropriation Bills, now Acts, were drawn up.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of the additional appropriations in the three additional estimates Bills which we have before us and which total $683.9m, some $5.7m is sought in the second Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill which is presently before us; some $609.9m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3); and some $68.4m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). It should be noted in passing that these amounts are offset in part by savings in the appropriations which are already made by Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 and by the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. Those savings are estimated by the Government to amount to $425.7m. So the appropriations now sought represent a net increase of $217.8m in expenditures to be financed from annual appropriations.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I mentioned at the outset, we are in addition debating cognately the Supply Bills. These three Bills, Supply Bills Nos 1 and 2 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90, seek interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government and the Parliament during the period from 1 July 1989-the beginning of the next financial year-to 30 November 1989. By that latter date it is expected that the equivalent Appropriation Bills, which will form part of the 1989-90 Budget, will have been enacted by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will just very quickly mention the significant aspects of those three Bills. Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations which total some $9,948m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. That is about 14.5 per cent greater than the equivalent amounts which were provided in the corresponding Supply Act (No. 1) at this time last year. Supply Bill (No. 2) seeks appropriations totalling some $3,013m, that being for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and certain other specified services, again for the same period from 1 July to 30 November of this year. That amount is about 46 per cent more than that which was provided for in the corresponding Supply Act (No. 2) 1988-89. In fairness to the Government I should say that a significant part of that apparently very sharply increased provision reflects revised funding arrangements for hospital grants in the portfolio of community services and health, which were funded last year under standing legislation-under special appropriations. Finally, the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing requirements of the parliamentary departments during the five-month period from July to November of this year totalling some $46.3m, which is 9.7 per cent greater than the amount provided for in the equivalent supply Bill last year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendment which I have foreshadowed to be moved to the second reading motions of Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 1988-89 condemns the Government for its failure to pursue policies which will address the twin evils of dangerous levels of foreign debt and declining living standards, both of which are leading to a growing loss of control over this country's future. I, as I am sure do most other honourable senators, move around this country speaking to meetings of one kind or another. I am continually struck, as I am sure you are, Madam Acting Deputy President, by the extent to which people in those assemblies get up in Question Time and express their concern and dismay at the manner in which they feel the future of this country is being taken out of their hands and out of the hands of Australians generally. They are bewildered, confused, concerned and increasingly resentful of the policies of this Government in Canberra which are leading to and have led to that situation developing. It is bewildering in one sense to know where to start in addressing that situation, because wherever one looks one finds evidence for the proposition which is put to one at meetings of that kind by ordinary Australian citizens.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us take a very recent example-I think statistically it is the most recent example-of the balance of payments figure for April which was published on Tuesday of last week-just a week ago today. As honourable senators will recall, that figure for April alone was a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments of $1,191m. That brought the deficit for the first 10 months of this financial year, as noted in the foreshadowed amendment, to just over $14 billion. That compares with the original estimated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) at Budget time of a deficit figure of $9.5 billion for the year as a whole. It does not require much understanding of these matters to see that we will be very fortunate indeed if we run out this financial year as a whole with a deficit figure of much less than $17,000m-$17 billion, approaching almost double the Treasurer's original estimate.
      </para>
      <para>
       What can be the reason for this extraordinary error on the Treasurer's part? Can it be that during the time since the Budget was brought down our export prices have slumped and world markets have gone into decline, and that because of that the forecasts made by the Treasurer have naturally not stood up to examination? So far from that being the case, it is precisely the reverse. In fact, the Treasurer assumed in his Budget Speech that there would be a further improvement this year-in addition to the significant one that occurred last financial year-in Australia's international terms of trade. In fact, not only has that occurred, but the improvement has been significantly greater than the Treasurer assumed. We have had an improvement in our terms of trade this year in the order of 15 per cent. The Treasurer assumed that it would be 9 per cent. That should have improved our balance of payments and reduced the Treasurer's forecast of $9.5 billion to some lesser figure-to something in the order of perhaps $7.5 billion to $8 billion or thereabouts. Instead, we now look as though we shall be running out the year with a figure of about $17,000m.
      </para>
      <para>
       I point out to the Senate that in May and June of last financial year Australia recorded a deficit of just under $2.4 billion. If we add that to the deficit for the first 10 months of this year, we finish with a deficit of almost $16.5 billion. But to achieve that we have to have figures no worse in May and June this year than we had in May and June last year. Certainly, that has not been our experience in the first 10 months of this year-quite the contrary. As the Opposition's foreshadowed amendment says `many forecasters are now predicting a total 1988/89 deficit as high as $17,000m'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Indeed, let me turn to the view of Mr Nobby Clark, the Chief Executive of the National Australia Bank, who is not a negligible figure, despite the public ridiculing of him in which no less a figure than the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia indulged himself on the Sunday television program last Sunday. Mr Nobby Clark simply revealed to the viewing public that his own bank at least is estimating or forecasting a deficit in May alone which could approach $2 billion. I am sure that Mr Clark would not want to be held to that particular forecast, any more than the Treasurer obviously would want to be held to his Budget forecast of last August. But the Treasurer indulged himself in this splenetic attack on Mr Clark:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the best thing Nobby could do would be to give his shareholders a break and get back behind his desk . . . And do a bit of banking, instead of trying to be an economist and a media personality.
      </para>
      <para>
       That was what the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia had to say about the Chief Executive of one of our major banks. I hold no personal brief for Mr Clark, but for the Treasurer to let himself go in that way is to lower the standard of public debate. The Treasurer ought to be encouraging people like Mr Clark to get out there and be willing to subject themselves to public debate on a television program such as Sunday or any of the other major current affairs programs. He should be encouraging such people instead of taking a club out of the cupboard and, merely because somebody happens to disagree with him about something, battering that person around the head and frightening him off. I think that that is a sign-not the only sign, I might say-of a Treasurer who is losing his grip. He is flailing around trying to hit any head that is raised above the parapet and directs a shot or two in his direction.

       As the Opposition amendment goes on to say, the fact is that these enormous deficits on our balance of payments can be financed only-and I underline the world `only'; there is no other way of financing them-through further borrowings by Australians from foreigners or by further sales of Australian land or other assets to foreign owners. Without in any way wishing to contribute to some kind of xenophobic debate about Australia being taken over by foreigners and things of that kind, nevertheless I share to a degree the concern being increasingly expressed by more and more Australians about the fact that that is happening. It is one thing to say that we welcome foreign capital in this country to help us to build a bigger, better and faster developing Australia, which used always to be said by coalition governments in the past and which has been said by the present Government, but it is quite another thing to say that we are prepared to go on living beyond our national means in this way-living beyond our productive capacity to finance by our own endeavours and basically doing so by either borrowing or by selling off Australia. That is a quite different process. While I would be the first to agree that it is not possible to define precisely where one process stops and the other beings, nevertheless the fact is that they are different. If the Government cannot recognise the difference between them, I warn it that the Australian people are beginning to do so.

        —We will have more to say about that in due course, I suspect, and I thank Senator Tate for his interjection. In general terms, these deficits can only be financed in that way because, to take the more favourable theory, after approximately six years of this Government, until the end of the last calendar year our net debt to foreigners grew from about $22 billion or $23 billion to $95.5 billion. The Treasurer finally seems to have understood that we have a problem. In the media conference he gave last Tuesday afternoon, following the release of the balance of payments statistics which I referred to earlier, he stated:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       . . . the problem is that even off this year's current account we'll be looking at something like $2 billion worth of interest payments-
      </para>
      <para>
       I think he really meant interest payments and other forms of property income-
      </para>
      <para>
       next year just off this year's alone.
      </para>
      <para>
       He went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . so the trade accounts have got to run $2 billion faster just to stand still.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer became tied up in that quotation. I have quoted him exactly; his syntax was a bit confused. What he really meant-he did not spell it out-was that if we ran a deficit this year of $16 to $17 billion and if we calculate an interest rate on that of only 12 per cent-one would probably get less than that on the non-debt financing component-clearly, income payments to foreigners in the next financial year would have to be about $2 billion higher than they are this year. As the Treasurer also pointed out last Tuesday at a later stage of his media conference, in the first 10 months of this year those income payments to foreigners-to foreign creditors and to foreign owners of Australian assets-have already exceeded $10 billion, which is roughly $1 billion a month. On that basis, those payments will be roughly $12 billion for this financial year, so the Treasurer is saying that next year that figure will be $14 billion; that Australia has to keep running faster and faster on the trade account to pay interest and service the property that it is selling to foreigners, just to stay in the same place.

       Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not know whether you have ever had the interesting experience of trying to chase one of your children down an escalator. It can be done if one is in good wind, and is young, hale and hearty. But if one keeps doing it for too long and runs out of puff, after a while one finds that one is not making any progress, the escalator goes up just as fast as one goes down. I can see Senator McKiernan has obviously had a similar experience; we all know the problem. The point I am making is that that is the situation in which Australians collectively find themselves, or almost find themselves, today. I repeat: our international terms of trade, on last reports have never been better since the March quarter of 1977. In this year alone our international terms of trade have improved by almost 15 per cent. What if we get a slowdown-not a recession, but a slowdown-in the world economy?

       This Government has been dicing with financial death, in this sense, for so long now that it has forgotten that that is what it is doing. This year we will finish with a recorded deficit of $17 billion. The additional income payments and interest payments next year alone would raise that to $19 billion, other things being equal. If, in addition, we have a fall back in our terms of trade, we could be looking-we could be; I am not making this prediction-in the next financial year at a prospective deficit of $25 billion. That is not a fanciful figure. The only way in which that would be significantly reduced would be if this country were to fall into the kind of recession for which it is undoubtedly heading under the policies of this Government. This fact was very well recognised by Mr Michael Stutchbury, a journalist with whom I do not always agree. Mr Stutchbury and Mr Tom Dusevic wrote an article in the Australian Financial Review of last Friday entitled `Keating flinches as debt trap bites'. They referred to the most recent report by the State Bank of Victoria, which showed that that bank's leading index of economic activity fell in May for the sixth consecutive month, suggesting that the economy would decelerate in the second half of this year. They concluded by saying:
      </para>
      <para>
       If this is correct, the foreign-debt trap is forcing the Government to hit the economy with high interest rates when it is about to turn down, anyway.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the situation we now have in this country. Mr Keating is driving us inexorably towards a recession, not necessarily because he understands that that is now the only way in which he can reduce that enormous balance of payments deficit-given his Government's policies and in particular its failure to handle the problem of wages policy-but simply because he has run out of options. He has run away from real policies throughout the life of the Government since the last election and certainly since the last Budget. He has resorted to higher and higher interest rates which he told us, only last month, would not rise any higher. However, this month, at the same press conference I referred to earlier, he told us he was prepared to see interest rates increase further if necessary and to tighten further all the other arms of government.

       Of course, we saw the first evidence of that other tightening in the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting here last Thursday, when the State governments were sent packing with a cut of $550m in their financial assistance grants and a cut of $1 billion in their global borrowing limits. The Commonwealth accepted a cut of $1,150m in its semi-governmental borrowing limits, although that last figure was somewhat cosmetic. The States have been significantly affected. We will now see whether the Commonwealth will take the same medicine in its own Budget.

        —The package of Appropriation and Supply Bills being debated by the Senate comes at a time of critical importance for the Australian economy. The future of the Australian economy is balanced on a knife-edge. Certainly the problems facing the Australian economy-when one looks at the fundamentals of the Australian economy-are as serious as they have been in the lifetime of most Australians today. If one looks at the basic statistics and fundamental situation underlying the economy, one has cause for the gravest concerns, not only regarding where we stand as a nation, but in particular regarding where we are heading in the period ahead. In my remarks today I would like to concentrate not only on those macro-economic issues, but also on some of the fundamental micro-economic issues and problems facing us. I shall reserve comment on specific aspects of the appropriations, which have been the subject of Estimates committee consideration, until the committee stage.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Government has made some massive miscalculations over the past year as to the course of the Australian economy. It is unusual for a government to accept or admit that it has been wrong. Often it has to be left to officials of government to do that because, quite frankly, the government of the day does not have the intestinal fortitude to do so. We are very fortunate in having had, for several years, a Reserve Bank of Australia Governor in the person of Mr Bob Johnston, and I take this opportunity of paying him a great tribute in his role as Governor of the Reserve Bank. His term expires within the next few weeks. We have been privileged and very fortunate in having Bob Johnston as the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Last week, in an address to the National Farmers Federation annual conference, he said exactly how it is. He admitted, and he was doing it on behalf of the Government, that they got it wrong. I quote from what Mr Johnston said last week:
      </para>
      <para>
       It was believed then (i.e. a year or so ago) that the course of monetary policy could be a good deal easier. Now . . . the major miscalculation that we made, including myself, was to underestimate the power in the economy, the pressure of growth, the exuberant spirit and the animal spirits that were at large and we have gone on underestimating for a very long time how strong the economy is-so that we were not able to get a switch of policies, pressure from monetary policy on to fiscal policy, and we find now that we need them both.
      </para>
      <para>
       That, if I may say so, is what the members of the Opposition have been saying now for a year and more. We have told the Government time and time again that the Government was on the wrong course in terms of its economic policies. It is only now that the Government, through a senior person such as Mr Johnston, has been prepared to say that. We have seen the Government stay stubbornly on a course of economic policy that is leading Australia right down the road to the root of the banana republic which, only three years ago last week, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that we would go down if we did not get our policies right. On 16 May 1986, the Treasurer said:
      </para>
      <para>
       If this Government doesn't get the adjustment . . . and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will just end up being a third rate economy, a banana republic.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is what the Treasurer said three years ago. He was predicating the future of the Australian economy on getting economic policy right. Over the past three years and earlier, the Treasurer has consistently got economic policy in this country wrong. One of the greatest, most skilful stunts in political history in this country has been the development of the myth that this Treasurer has been a good Treasurer. The economy, under the Hawke-Keating Government, has deteriorated in terms of its fundamental underpinning in a way that no one could have believed possible when this Government came to office in March 1983. Who could have believed in March 1983, with a level of external debt of the order of $30 billion, that in May 1989, six short years later, our external debt could have quadrupled to almost $120 billion? Who could possibly have believed that the job increases that the Government thrusts down our throats continually in terms of the number of jobs created in the Australian economy in recent years, if one looks at the increase in the external debt, have been at a cost of $70,000 per job? Who could possibly have anticipated that, despite a healthy world economy and despite commodity prices that have been at their best level in the postwar period, with the minor exception of the Korean War commodity boom, our balance of payments deficit in the first 10 months of this year would be in excess of $14 billion, with every prospect that that figure will increase certainly to between $16 and $17 billion by the end of June?
      </para>
      <para>
       The present foreign debt situation and the balance of payments situation in Australia will create burdens and pressures on the Australian economy that will take decades to alleviate. We have been living as a nation way beyond our means. The rate of increase in spending in this country in the last 12 months or more has been twice the rate of increase in production. Yet the Government says that we are on course. It looks at the dollar falling like a stone. The dollar should have come down. We told the Government 12 months ago, when the Australian-United States dollar rate was in the 80s, that the fundamentals of the Australian economy were such that the Australian currency was overvalued. It has now come down and has therefore made exports more competitive but, on the other hand, has greatly increased the cost of imported goods and has increased the foreign debt burden. Despite that, despite all the evidence and despite the fact that money supply increase in Australia is running, depending on how one measures it, at 20 per cent or thereabouts, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is reported in today's paper as having last night refused to change economic policy in any way at all.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the other great myths about the present state of the economic policy is the myth that in fact we have a tight monetary policy. That is a myth. The fact is, as I have said, that money supply growth is running at an enormous rate of increase, 20 per cent or more, and is continuing to increase. In fact, since 1983-84, it has been growing far too rapidly. There are various measures of money supply growth and it is a very complicated issue. Certainly there is no direct relationship between the growth in the money supply and other factors such as inflation, economic growth or investment. In the sense of a direct arithmetic relationship there is not, but there is a view widely held and widely shared by economic commentators, by Treasurers, by Reserve bankers and by anyone else who has studied economics at all that there is a relationship between money supply and the overall health of the economy. If money supply is greatly exceeding the rate of increase in productive capacity in the economy and the increase in production, there will be a potential inflationary situation which will inevitably spill over into an actual inflationary situation.

       The current rhetoric that monetary policy in this country is tight is not supported by the facts. According to the various definitions and the so-called measures of money, the rates are running at excessive levels and have been for some considerable time. It is quite possible that the money supply situation has development a momentum of its own whereby there is little that the Reserve Bank can do to arrest that monetary explosion other than by trying to cool off economic activity. That practice tends to kill the economy first before it kills the money supply. What we have seen is an over-reliance on monetary policy, despite the fact that there has been an under-reliance. The problem is that the Government has not used fiscal policy, wages policy and exchange rate policy in any complementary way to produce a balanced set of economic policies. As a result, we are wildly out of kilter in this country. Despite the apparent reliance on monetary policy, there is every prospect of there being a problem for the future as a result of what is being stirred up and stored up.

       I come back briefly to the problem of the balance of payments, which is horrendous. Senator Stone mentioned the figures earlier, as I have in my remarks. It is very salutary to look at the balance of payments and balance of trade figures over a period of years. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a series of figures on the balance of merchandise trade and the balance on the current account for the period since 1984-85.

        —I thank the Senate. The Government has made numerous mistakes, particularly in terms of its forecasting. It has made horrendous mistakes in its balance of payments forecasting. This year it forecast a deficit of $9.5 billion. That is going to finish up at something closer to $17 billion. It has also made gross mistakes in forecasting the rate of inflation. At the time of the Budget last August, the Treasurer was saying that inflation was expected to slow substantially over the year to around 4.5 per cent. That figure is obviously way out. Even the fiddled inflation rate that the Government produced the other day shows an increase of just under 7 per cent during the 12 months ended in the recent March quarter. The real figure is somewhere between 7 per cent and 8 per cent, and there is every probability that the rate for the year ending June will be higher than that.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Treasurer has got his inflation expectation or forecast wrong by not much short of 100 per cent. The consequences of that for the economy are only too plain to see. Of course, inflation has some benefits for the Government. It allows it to increase tax revenues through bracket creep. One of the other underlying problems that we have experienced in this country since the Hawke-Keating Government came to office is the fact that the overall level of taxation has risen and remains the highest in our history. That has been done through a series of measures. A whole raft of new taxes has been introduced. There has been a rip-off of taxpayers through the indexing of sales taxes and excises, which has caused a higher and higher proportion of the total income of the community to be sucked up in taxation revenue to the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The interest rate structure is also of great concern and is something which the Government got absolutely wrong. It got it absolutely wrong because it wrongly read the signals as to the environment in which the Australian economy was operating. It also got it wrong because it was not prepared to tell the truth as to its expectation of interest rates. Only a few months ago the Prime Minister, when he was campaigning for the Western Australian election, said a few days before the poll that interest rates would fall during 1989. The actuality is that interest rates have risen, and they will almost certainly continue to rise. At least the Treasurer has now been forced to admit that there is every probability that interest rates will have to rise still further, yet only a month ago he was saying that they had peaked and that he was confident that they were on a downturn.
      </para>
      <para>
       The increase in interest rates has had a staggering effect on living standards in this country, particularly those of young married couples with children seeking to buy or trying to pay off an average home. Nowadays, because of the increase in interest rates, according to research by the Housing Industry Association, families need to have an income of $52,300 simply to qualify for an average home loan. According to the relevant indexes, home loan affordability has fallen to its lowest level for five years or more. Mortgage repayments are now swallowing up to 40 per cent of average household incomes. A one per cent increase in interest rates is equivalent to something like a $40 per week repayment on an average mortgage. Housing interest rates have risen over the last 12 months from about 13 1/2 per cent to 16 or 16 1/2 per cent, and they will almost certainly go to 17 per cent in the very near future.
      </para>
      <para>
       They are some of the fundamental problems that we are facing. They are essentially of the Government's own making. They have occurred despite the fact that things have been going well for us in the external environment. As I think Senator Stone mentioned in his address, what on earth is going to happen to our situation if there if a fall in commodity prices over the next 12 months? Commodity prices have been almost at their highest since the Second World War and have caused our balance of payments deficit to be several billion dollars less than it would otherwise have been. Had commodity prices not increased to the levels that they have over the last two years, our balance of payment deficit this year, which is going to be $16 billion to $17 billion, would almost certainly have been in excess of $20 billion. There are signs in the international economy, particularly in the United States of America, Japan and some of the European countries, that economic growth over the next 12 months is going to slow down. If that is the case there is every likelihood that commodity prices will ease back. Indeed, that has started to happen already. Over the last few weeks there has been a decline in many of the prices for metals and minerals. There has been an easing in the wool price and increasingly there is the view amongst economic analysts and commentators that we are in for a period of reduced commodity prices over the next 12 months. If that is the case, this will simply heighten the problems that we have with our balance of payments position and therefore, of course, our external debt position.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has had a massive increase in imports, far exceeding our increase in exports. That is the essential reason why we have this continually deteriorating balance of payments situation. The Government does not seem to know even what the imports comprise. The Treasurer is running around trying to tell us that the growth in imports is essentially attributable to the import of investment goods which add to the productive capacity of the economy. But then we find Senator Button's Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce saying that it does not know how many computer goods are being imported to Australia. It simply does not know the value of computer imports; yet computer imports are, presumably, a very important element in the area of investment. If we look at the list of imports over the last two to three years we find that a very significant proportion of the increase appears to have been due to imports of consumption goods. It is no wonder that overseas investors are losing confidence in the Australian economy and that is evidenced all too clearly at the moment by the decline in the value of the Australian dollar.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matter of the gravest concern to us all, of course, is: where do we go from here? We may be concerned about the past and what it means for the future, but the question is: what will we do in the future to alleviate the problems that are already stored up? Will we as a nation and the Government as an economic manager be able to respond? Will business be able to get us out of the dreadful mess and bind that we are in? My answer to that is that unless we as a nation change course very rapidly we will simply drift further into the mire. We are already slipping very dramatically in the world rankings in terms of our standards of living. In fact, we have witnessed absolute declines in our standards of living over the last couple of years and, in terms of our relativity with other nations, the decline is even greater.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will not solve our problems unless government adopts a much more balanced set of economic policies and exhibits more courage in the tackling of those policies than we have witnessed over the last six years. That applies to both macro-economic and micro-economic policies. So far as macro-economic policies are concerned, the Government has not taken the knife to its own spending in the way that is essential if we are to trim the size of Federal government and thus the necessary tax take of the Government. That is essential if we are to give individuals more incentive to be more productive and more efficient and to work harder and, more importantly, be smarter. As our foreshadowed amendment to the second reading motion for Appropriation Bill (No. 3) says, the Government is to be condemned:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . for its failure to pursue policies which will address the twin evils of a dangerous level of foreign debt and declining living standards, leading to a . . . loss of control over the future of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       It further notes, amongst other things, the lack of ability or willingness on the part of the Federal Government to cut its own spending while instead applying pressures on the spending of State governments that it is not prepared to apply to itself. There has to be a much tighter approach to fiscal policy if we are even to make a start on getting our macro-economic policies right.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will also have to adopt a tighter monetary policy. The rate of growth of the money supply has to be slowed if we are to remove the excesses that will lead to an inflationary splurge sooner or later. In respect of wages policy, the Government will have to adopt the sort of approach that is embodied in the coalition's industrial relations policy which will lead to a freeing up of and greater flexibility in the wages system so that people can be rewarded more on the basis of productivity and efficiency and the resources of our economy can be used and can flow in the most efficient directions.
      </para>
      <para>
       On top of that, we have to tackle the strangleholds on the economy that come from a variety of areas. In particular, we face enormous micro-economic problems in respect of the role of trade unions in our economy. We have the problems of rigidities in the shipping industry and on the waterfront-indeed, in the whole area of transport. We have to be much more flexible in our approach to the whole area of communications. The longer we delay tackling all those issues, the harder it will be to deal with them properly in the end.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, I commend to the Senate the amendment that was foreshadowed by Senator Stone to the second reading motion for Appropriation Bill (No. 3). That amendment reflects the very things that need to be done if we are to put Australia on the road to greater efficiency, productivity and, therefore, increased living standards. This involves dealing with a range of areas. Award restructuring needs to be geared to efficiency and productivity-it should not be a form of social welfare program as is often envisaged by the trade union movement. I am not attacking the trade union movement in this sense; what I am saying, though, is that if we are serious about recognising and tackling the problems we face, the areas of restructuring and wages and all the other micro-economic restraints and constraints we have on our performance must be tackled as a matter of urgency.

        —The economy is in crisis. The full extent of that crisis has not really hit most Australians; it has not impinged on their daily activities. This Government will no doubt be rushing to an early election before the full impact of the necessary measures to halt the collapse of the Australian economy or the effect of the collapse itself start to hit home to the bulk of Australians. Of course, some Australians have already felt a massive reduction in their standard of living as a result of the huge interest rate rises. They are being prevented from owning their own homes, while interest rates remain at their present high levels. They are the people who have been put by this Government in the front line of the economic war-and they are the first victims. It must be remembered that an inability to afford one's own home represents a massive decline in the standard of living that Australians have been rightly accustomed to expect.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As I have mentioned in this chamber before, many other Australians have been protected from the consequences of the interest rate disaster by the banks-the institutions which are criticised so often, particularly by honourable senators opposite-which have chosen to extend the term of most present home loans in Australia rather than increase monthly repayments on those loans which the home owner has to meet. As a result, of course, the great bulk of home loan repayments are not matching even the interest bill. So most Australians paying off their mortgages will owe more at the end of the year than they did at the beginning, having made interest repayments for 12 months. This situation simply cannot continue. One of the banks, I think the Commonwealth Bank, has already indicated that it plans to review the rate of repayment of loans. That is another of the reasons why this Government must rush to an early election, because once the banks start taking that kind of action, once the people of Australia begin to feel in a significant way in their hip pockets the consequences of the fall in living standards, brought about deliberately by this Government's policies, I believe the electoral swing against this Government is going to be enormous.
      </para>
      <para>
       I reinforce my view that the economic outlook for Australia is disastrous by referring to a whole host of evidence-I will go through it in some detail-which outlines the failure of this Government's economic policies, the failure of the August Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the failure of the policy alterations involved in the April statement and, if you like, the continuing failure of this Treasurer to understand what is happening to this economy ever since his former adviser, Professor Barry Hughes, left him. I am not saying that Barry Hughes necessarily knew every answer to every question-in fact he was often wrong-but the fact is that since his departure the Treasurer has been consistently wrong on every major issue.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are well aware of the fact that the Budget forecasts predicted something like a 3.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year. It will be well over 4 per cent, far higher than forecast. The Government's forecasts on imports are just as hopeless. In the Budget the forecast for endogenous imports was for about an 8 per cent rise, but the figure looks like being closer to 20 per cent-an enormous miscalculation which will have an immense impact on the Australian economy and certainly on the balance of payments. Imports are the main culprit in the miscalculations that this Government has made.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also noted that interest rates were clearly not tightened early enough and that monetary policy has simply not been effective. This has enabled the Australian dollar to remain, if you like, overvalued for most of the last calendar year. The fact is simply that monetary policy is, and always has been, a very blunt economic instrument. The Senate is entitled, in light of the disastrous current account result-the current account deficit, mainly because of the large increase in imports, is going to be almost twice what was predicted in the Budget-to ask: Why on earth were other arms of policy not used? Why did this Government rely so heavily on monetary policy? Why did the Government not admit its mistake earlier? At least the Governor of the Reserve Bank did admit a couple of weeks ago that there had been a massive miscalculation. Certainly, Mr Keating has changed his tune. Things are less on track these days. But the simple fact is that the reliance on monetary policy was an economic and policy making disaster. The banks chose not to increase the amount of money coming out of mortgagees' pockets as they repaid their monthly loans. That meant that higher interest rates did not reduce the amount of capacity to consume that people had, which resulted in this huge increase in imports.
      </para>
      <para>
       At a time when we are having this large level of consumption, the Government apparently has no understanding of or no concern about the effect of its economic policies. For example, I asked Senator Button last month, the day after the April statement, which involved tax cuts, increased allowances and other transfer payments, was brought down, whether the Government or any of its agencies had done any studies to establish what impact on consumer spending and the balance of payments would result from the $5 billion ephemeral pre-election tax hand-outs, plus the wage and welfare rises announced in the April statement, what these studies-if there are any-show, and how this large stimulus to consumer spending squares with Senator Button's statement in the Senate just a week previously `that the major responsibility of the Government is to reduce the present level of demand'. I asked him why the Government had repudiated what Senator Button has claimed was its major responsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Button's response was, `I will find out for you whether any studies have been done. I think it is very unlikely'. I challenged him by asking him whether he was serious, whether this Government had brought about these major changes, a $5 billion stimulus in one hit in terms of tax cuts, without being aware of the economic consequences at a time when it said it recognised that there was an excess of consumer demand. I said, `The major responsibility of the Government is to reduce the present level of demand'. Senator Button responded, `I am seriously telling you that'. In other words, he was saying that no studies had been done. This, then, is a government which is not only incompetent but also arrogant in its disregard for the proper concerns of members of this chamber and the people of Australia about what on earth the basic thrust of its economic policy is all about. It has been changing very significantly in the last month or so, without showing that it really has recognised the extent of the disaster.
      </para>
      <para>
       Max Walsh, in a detailed article in Monday's Sydney Morning Herald, dealt with what the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Johnston, had to say about the mistakes in policy. There is no doubt that Mr Johnston has effectively forced the Treasurer, Mr Keating, to change his approach to the whole question of monetary policy and to recognise that instead of things being on track, which is his permanent response to every new bit of disastrous economic news, things are not on track and there is a prospect that the Government may have to take even tougher measures. I note that Mr Keating is talking about tougher monetary measures as well as some of the tougher fiscal measures that he took last week with the Premiers. The important political aspect of this relates to the consequences of what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The question is: `How fast can you expand the economy without running your head into inflation and balance of payments problems?' The answer most times is: `Not very fast.' At present the answer is: `Zero'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Walsh says that this is passing a death sentence on the Hawke Government. The reality is that it certainly would be if the Hawke Government ran its full term. The disastrous consequences of recession-which that statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank clearly implies-would throw this Government out of office without any question whatsoever. The problem is that zero growth, as Mr Johnston said, really represents an inevitability of rising unemployment and of a fall in the standard of living-and of course a dramatic change in the bumptious cockiness of a Treasurer who has led us to the brink of an economic disaster which is now staring us all in the face. The reality that Mr Keating does not understand what is happening is evident from the fact that in the Nine Network's Sunday program he pretended that Mr Johnston had not advocated zero economic growth. Max Walsh reports:
      </para>
      <para>
       And he ridiculed the remarks of Nobby Clark, the managing director of the National Australia Bank, who suggested that growth in the first half of next year will be below 1 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       He gratuitously suggested that Mr Clark go back to banking and leave the running of the economy to Mr Keating because Mr Keating knows a lot more about the economy than Mr Clark. Mr Keating's 100 per cent failure record ever since the last Budget suggests that, if Mr Keating knows more than Mr Clark about the economy, Mr Clark is a total economic illiterate. That is simply not so. We face a disaster, as Max Walsh pointed out:
      </para>
      <para>
       To run the Australian economy at zero growth will mean dipping in and out of-
      </para>
      <para>
       what economists like to call-
      </para>
      <para>
       negative growth, or a recession.
      </para>
      <para>
       There will therefore be an increase in unemployment. I totally agree with Walsh when he goes on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a strong case to be made for an August election on the basis of the economic outlook as defined by Mr Johnston and Mr Clark . . . judging by Mr Keating's performance on television yesterday, he simply does not share the apocalyptic view of the bankers. He was scornful about what he called media cynicism as to the tax-wage trade-off, denying that this was every part of an election strategy.
      </para>
      <para>
       It's useful to remember that Mr Keating's sanguine view of the Australian economy in last year's May statement and August Budget speech coincided with his personal push to displace Mr Hawke in the Lodge. It was, in fact, Mr Keating's playing up the economic promise of his strategy-reducing inflation to 4.5 per cent and giving tax cuts to all, and at the same time playing down the steady tightening of monetary policy-that sent precisely the wrong signals out into the domestic market.
      </para>
      <para>
       Paul Keating's personal ambitions last year generated an atmosphere in which the wrong economic decisions were made and the wrong signals were given to the market place. Australians, particularly those who are in debt, are having to carry that burden generated by Mr Keating's personal ambition. Mr Johnston has shot the ground from under Mr Keating.
      </para>
      <para>
       What sorts of problems do we face now? There are recent reports that Australian commodity prices are likely to fall. There is in today's Australian a report by Max Newton which is particularly bad news for those Australians who believe that we may be able to avoid the inevitable consequences of recession. He says:
      </para>
      <para>
       The ferocity of the gale building in the United States is already causing waves, tidal movements of unusual size and early evidence of shipwrecks, with widespread damage to the shoreline likely.
      </para>
      <para>
       He believes that economic policies being undertaken by the American Government will have the effect of draining the cash reserves out of the entire global financial system and that this will have a disastrous impact on commodity prices, on which Australia's exports so heavily depend. Newton says:
      </para>
      <para>
       A key question being raised in New York is: If Australia is in so much trouble now, at the very peak of a seven-year world economic boom, what are things going to be like in the Lucky Country when the bottom falls out of commodities other than metals?
      </para>
      <para>
       The next question is: Will the Australian Government be obliged to impose exchange controls, limiting the transfer of funds out of Australia?
      </para>
      <para>
       In today's world, where money markets are so intertwined, the fact that such an issue can be raised indicates the fear abroad about the prospects for Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the Reserve Bank of Australia last week raised the rediscount rate to 17.3 per cent-the ninth time since November-alarm bells went off. This is a country, it seems, that has raised dependence on short-term borrowing to a new art form.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a result, we see such headlines as `The dollar sinks to 73.8c'. We see continual concerns being expressed by international lenders that Australia is not a sound place in which to put their money. As Newton says, if the world economy is booming and we are in trouble, what is going to happen when that boom ends, when the problems that are inevitable start to become more widespread? What is going to happen when interest rates throughout the world keep rising so that, for Australia to try to attract foreign investment, our interest rates will have to keep rising as well, not simply as an instrument of internal monetary policy but in order to keep up any kind of inflow and to keep here money that has already come here in search of a reasonable return? There is a real concern, as there should be, about the fact that Australia has simply used monetary policy instead of a genuine attack, a serious and more detailed attack, through the fiscal sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       For years now, every time the Opposition has raised this matter of the need for more spending cuts and for greater restraint in the public sector, we have been told that we are wrong, that Paul knows everything and that the economy is on track. The Opposition's economic statements and objections are being proved to be totally, absolutely and completely correct. The increase in employment that the Government keeps claiming credit for has been brought about by plunging Australia into massive debt. That debt is putting those jobs and our future at risk. There was a purchasing by this Government of increased employment, which by its very nature puts that employment at huge risk.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us examine the way this Government has consistently tried to pretend that it is doing the right thing by having high interest rates. Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this year said what is clearly true:
      </para>
      <para>
       Monetary policy is a blunt instrument, wreaking havoc if applied too heavily for too long. It has two other drawbacks when compared to tight budgeting policy: it hits investment as well as consumption, and it forces up the exchange rate, making our exporters and manufacturers less competitive. So excessive reliance on high interest is particularly inappropriate for the economy facing a chronic balance-of-payments problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is exactly right. We have been saying so for years. I am glad to see that Ross Gittins is now totally on-side, having at some stage been a bit of a fan of the Treasurer. Just a month ago the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) came out with this sort of nonsense:
      </para>
      <para>
       We've got difficulties to deal with, like the external position, and that's why we're doing what no prime minister likes doing. I hate running a tight monetary policy with high interest rates. I hate having to do that. And any prime minister in his right mind would hate doing it, but it's necessary because we can't keep that high a level of activity going which is going to keep sucking in so many imports because we've got this external deficit problem. But we're on track.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we had a dollar for every time the Prime Minister or the Treasurer assured us that this economy was on track, that Australia was on track, we could pay off our foreign debt. The fact is that any Prime Minister in his right mind would not be relying so heavily on monetary policy. A great deal of economic study is being done which establishes quite clearly that this high level of interest rates generated by the Government is in fact having a contrary impact. It is not resolving the problems. The stated object of Government policy has been, firstly, to slow the rate of economic growth to dampen pressure on prices and, secondly, simultaneously, to reduce the demand for imports, therefore promoting a healthier position on the external account. That strategy has simply not produced the required results. The 4.5 per cent inflation rise will be wiped aside, the growth rate will be wiped aside and the external deficit will be something like double what the Government has forecast.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not know why the Treasurer placed his faith in monetary policy. It may be because the Government says in the Budget Papers:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a more flexible policy instrument . . . it is often called on for the initial response to external or internal shocks while other policy adjustments are made and work their way through the system.
      </para>
      <para>
       At that time the Government argued that wages and fiscal policies could not be further tightened. It said at the time the Budget was handed down that it could not tighten fiscal policy any further, yet last week there was some evidence of tightening fiscal policy-because the Treasurer was wrong and had to change his mind. He was wrong again. What concerns me is the defence of the overuse of monetary policy at a time when clearly it has been having exactly the wrong effect.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that, apart from anything else, this tight monetary policy will not moderate demand for or reduce imports. It will not moderate demand, it will not reduce imports, and, very clearly, we can see why. The substantial rise in interest rates over the last 15 months or so has had little immediate impact on demand. We can see it from the figures. The statistics demonstrate that the Government's monetary policy has been a monumental flop and, in the absence of appropriate fiscal policy, has brought Australia to the brink of economic crisis. The problem is that the same interest rates that have failed to slow down demand have produced a far stronger Australian dollar than was envisaged, with the result that Australian exports are now less competitive and imports are relatively much cheaper because the Australian dollar is far higher than it should be. We are belting the export sector of Australia as a result of this Government's deliberate policy. We are encouraging imports by this Government's deliberate policy at a time when it is pretending that the actions it is taking are reducing demand. The simple facts prove that to be wrong. The disastrous trade figures prove that the Government has been wrong.
      </para>
      <para>
       I remind the Senate that the Opposition has been telling this Government for months that its balance of payments forecasts were hopelessly out, that there was a serious and real imbalance, and that either a failure to address this would bring about a crisis of its own making or the measures taken to solve the crisis would produce a recession and rising unemployment. So the massive rise in imports, unexplained in terms of government policy, means that something drastic will have to be done. It is strange that the Government did not have the capacity to resolve this problem at the time. There was some anticipation in the Budget Papers that tightening monetary policy would lead to a rise in the value of the dollar, but the Government did not seem to think that this would affect imports, which shows the most extraordinary degree of incompetence. I know it is all very well to say that after the event, but external commentators were concerned about the balance of payments outlook. The Opposition believed that the forecasts were totally wrong at the time and very strongly argued to that effect.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that this Government has made a mess of the economy. It was warned that it was making a mess of the economy. The Treasurer's arrogance and personal political objectives encouraged him to do things to this economy which were to its disadvantage and to the disadvantage of all Australians. The results of that irresponsible and politically motivated course of action that the Treasurer took last year when overstating how everything was under control will have a massive impact on us all. As the world economy starts to fall apart, or at least to go off the boil, the prospects for Australia are, I believe, disastrous. That is why this Government will have an early election.

        —In rising to speak in this cognate debate on the Appropriation and Supply Bills, I want initially to deal specifically with the reservation made by Senator Alston, Senator Chapman and me to the Estimates Committee A report to the Senate. I wish to deal with that in particular because I feel that matters that we raised are relevant to the overall plight of the Australian economy. It is particularly important that this be brought to the attention of the Senate when reviewing the work of Senate Estimates committees and the importance they have to the Appropriation and Supply Bills.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the reservation that Senator Alston, Senator Chapman and I signed, the first matter we dealt with was the question of offsets and the partnership for development program which comes under the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. In the body of the report itself there is a small paragraph which was approved by the Government members of Senate Estimates Committee A simply saying that they were concerned that the draft report dealing with offsets, which the Department promised in hearings in October last year would be made available, still had not been received by the time Estimates hearings were completed in April of this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is interesting to note that in the reservation that we included in the report we stated that the report still had not been received. I am sure that honourable senators will be interested to know that that report happened to appear on my desk the following day. How interesting to note that it should be made available after the Estimates committees had concluded their business. I found it doubly interesting because Dr Charles, the head of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, appeared before the Public Accounts Committee and told us, in no uncertain but derogatory terms, `I, myself personally, have never had to appear before a parliamentary committee before', and, indeed, he had had to spend all week reading the Public Accounts Committee's previous report which dealt with the offsets program.
      </para>
      <para>
       In drawing the Senate's attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the offsets and partnership for development program, it is important to look at the question of the huge amount of money that is being spent by the overseas purchase and importation of computer equipment and, indeed, at the percentage of that equipment that is accounted for by government acquisitions. It is quite feasible to make out an argument that the offsets and partnership for development program could well make the acquisition of that computer equipment more expensive than it would otherwise have been. Perhaps that would be justifiable if it could be said that the Australian manufacturing sector gained some benefit from it. A useful definition of offsets is contained in an Industries Assistance Commission report of last year. The report states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Activities of a commercial and technological significance which are directed to Australian industry by an overseas supplier as a result of, or in anticipation of, receiving an order for goods and/or services from Commonwealth and/or State government organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me outline some of the things that are causing concern to members of Estimates Committee A and of the Public Accounts Committee. There are proposals that the Defence Department acquire computer equipment to the tune of some $400m to implement the DESINE project and that the Australian Taxation Office acquire some $693m worth of computer equipment. The really surprising thing about all this is that, although lots of companies were invited to tender and, particularly in regard to the Tax Office, although many companies did indeed tender-and it costs a firm $1m or $2m just to tender for such a job-only after the tenders had been received was it decided that the equipment had to be IBM compatible.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is quite interesting that this also has occurred with regard to the DESINE project for Defence. The original project was sent back because it was held to be too IBM favourable. The interesting thing is that there seems to be a movement right throughout the Government towards IBM compatible systems. Recently for a year, Geoff Seymour, who has been very instrumental in advising that the Taxation Office acquisition be IBM-compatible, was deeply involved in the preparation of the DESINE contract which, as I have said, was redrafted because it was too IBM oriented. He was at Education when it went IBM-a second-hand machine but, nonetheless, IBM-and those on his Taxation Office shortlist are IBM compatible.
      </para>
      <para>
       For those of us who are laymen there is currently a debate about which computer systems are going to be advisable in the long term. To a simple layman like me, this is a bit like the distinction between VHS and Beta video systems. But it is quite clear that this Government has made a decision-or it seems to have made a decision-that it prefers IBM compatible equipment. This can have lots of spin-offs with regard to software, which also can be Australian made or imported. These things affect our balance of payments figures directly. The question that I ask myself repeatedly-and I am not really getting any satisfactory answers-is this: How necessary is it that this equipment be acquired at this time? Or are they like new toys that everybody would like to have? I find that the administration of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, in its application of the offsets and partnership for development programs, which are directly connected with these acquisitions, is less than satisfactory-to put it mildly. When Dr Fitzpatrick of the Department was being questioned last October, I said to him that I found it amazing that the Department did not keep a list of important contracts and a separate list dealing with the particulars of the offsets that are required. The answers were to the effect that there were no such lists, that no such records were being kept. Then I was told, `Yes, there is a list, and it is being transferred to the Nomis system'. Six months later we were still unable to get that information.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the reservation which, as I have said, Senator Alston, Senator Chapman and I put into the report of Estimates Committee A, we said simply:
      </para>
      <para>
       The sloppiness which has occurred in the production of the report is of great concern when considering the ability of the Department to effectively manage the controversial offsets program-a program involving billions of dollars.
      </para>
      <para>
       But that was only one aspect of our concerns in those Estimates hearings. A second concerned the Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA). We had dealt with the Australian Bicentennial Authority in reservations following previous hearings, but this time we were dealing with the question of intellectual property. Two cases that are well documented and have caused grave concern to members of the Committee relate to the way in which the ABA dealt with other people's intellectual property. In its main report, the Committee said that it did not wish to comment on the complaint against the ABA by one Mr Liticq, which was currently under investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The problem about that is that on 17 February 1987-and let us bear in mind that the date of this report is 3 May-the Commonwealth Ombudsman made a statement in which he said that he thought that the matter would be more appropriate for determination by a court of law. He advised, by letter of 3 May in response to a request from me, that he would not be investigating the matter any further.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is relevant to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that Mr Liticq had an idea with regard to the publication of a book entitled Unsung Heroes and Heroines of Australia. Evidence was given to the Committee showing that in January 1986 Mr Liticq had written to the ABA asking for support and endorsement for a book he intended to publish entitled Who's Who of Unsung Heroes. The Committee was provided with no evidence that prior to January 1986 the ABA had considered the publication of a book on Australia's unsung heroes. The Committee was, however, presented with evidence showing that, while, after this date, the ABA quickly developed a proposal remarkably similar to Mr Liticq's it continued to request more and more information from him. In the publicity material produced by the ABA it was claimed that the program was the idea of the ABA Chairman, Mr Jim Kirk. Yet, the ABA has not provided the Committee with any evidence that anyone there, let alone the Chairman, had thought of the concept prior to Mr Liticq's contact with the Authority.

       We dealt with the second case involving a program called `Computer Pals'. An innovative schoolteacher had thought of a program to contact a network of overseas students and allow them to talk through computers. This program attempted to establish international computer links between high school students. It was administered by the ABA and, in evidence presented to the Committee, was said to be based on a project already operated by a number of Australian teachers and schools, called `Computer Pals Across the World'. Yet the ABA refused to give any funding or support to this group.

       Again, the question of ABA's redundancy payments came up. The redundancy agreements are drawn in such a way that they actively encourage people not to go out and find another job because they will not get the redundancy package which they would otherwise receive. It seems to me that there are many matters of concern with the Australian Bicentennial Authority. It is relevant to bring this to the Senate's attention because in 2001 we will be celebrating the centenary of the Federation of this country. Because of the controversial manner in which the ABA has been administered and the enormous amounts of money that have been expended, it is important that we have, somewhere in this Parliament, a thorough investigation of the way in which that money was administered, to find out whether the various tales of woe that have come to me and other members of committees have substance and whether something ought to be done about them. It is important to note that the ABA has made no provision in its accounts for any actions that may lie against it in damages. I feel that at some stage in the future the Senate must seriously consider just what sort of thorough investigation ought to be carried out into the Australian Bicentennial Authority.

       Whilst we have heard from some of my colleagues such as Senator Michael Baume and others in this debate about the dire plight of the Australian economy, today in this House we had the spectacle of the Government deciding to play the man and not the substance. It did not deal with the serious issues. It is with a deal of sadness that I raise the following material because it is the Government which has chosen, by moving a censure motion against Andrew Peacock today and by raising the question of truth and the ability to tell the truth, to set the tenor of the argument. The history of the material that I am about to raise began on Tuesday, 2 May.

      <para>
       On Tuesday, 2 May, I asked a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) as to whether one, Mr Davis, had had his employment terminated by the overtures of Senator Richardson or anybody else because of his involvement in a preselection ballot for the seat of Kingsford-Smith, which has subsequently been determined and Mr Laurie Brereton has been endorsed. On that occasion the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade gave me an answer that he had never even heard of Mr Davis. But he came back on 4 May and gave an answer that stated that Mr Davis had in fact not been sacked; he had resigned. Mr Davis had sent me information. He was concerned that his termination of employment had been unfair and had been brought about because of internal Australian Labor Party (ALP) politics.

       That night I spoke in the adjournment debate and brought to attention the notes from Mr Davis. Senator Tambling then tabled the document dealing with this matter which had been faxed to me. Subsequently Mr Davis, who is most anxious to seek redress and some recompense for the injustice he feels has been done to him, came to see me and indeed provided me with additional information. Today he sent me a copy of a letter dated 18 May, excerpts of which I will read. I understand that this letter was today delivered to Senator Richardson. It is Mr Davis's response to what Senator Richardson had to say about him-Mr Davis. Mr Davis writes:

       The reason I went to Senator Bishop was because I had written, unsuccessfully, to Stephen Loosley and had discussions with Johnno Johnson. Neither was inclined to do anything.

The same sort of damage will be done by you if you persist in this transparent tissue of lies about your involvement in my dismissal in Washington.

       The reason seemed to me to be one of arrogance of office and a sudden failure of judgement.

       Quite clearly there is concern in the Labor Party itself about whether or not it is properly represented in a truthful way by members who hold positions on the front bench. Mr Davis has made very strong allegations and perhaps the way to test them would be for Senator Richardson to make those statements outside the Parliament so that Mr Davis could seek redress.

       In choosing to raise this matter in this debate on the Appropriation and Supply Bills, as I said, I have done this with some sadness. I would have been much happier to have dealt simply with the economic matters which this country is facing. It is astounding that in a period where we are facing deficits of $1.2 billion a month, $1.65 billion a month, somehow it is acceptable if the figure is less than $1.5 billion. What is it that matters? Is it the speed that we go down the tube, or the fact that we are going down the tube altogether?

      <para>
       This country is facing a great crisis. It is facing the need to have a strong government which will administer government policies in a strict and comprehensive way so that the system is not rorted. It needs people who will turn their attention to the real economic plight of the day and not indulge in the sorts of things that the Government has chosen to do in its behaviour today. If Australia is to go into the next century as a strong economic nation, clearly it needs new policies and new direction. It will not get them from this Government. It needs to have a change of government. It needs to have a strong monetary direction. The fact that the Labor Party and the trade union movement are so intertwined will prevent the Government taking the micro-economic measures needed. As we go along the path to oblivion, or to Argentina to use the words of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), there is a need for the Australian people to be presented with a strong alternative. Name calling and poor tactics are no substitute for the development of policy.

        —In speaking to the Appropriation and Supply Bills which are now before the Parliament, it is interesting to note the state of the Australian economy at this time. It is a time when we are bedevilled with foreign debt, a situation which worries so many Australians. There is also another issue which probably has a major bearing on the life styles of all Australians at present-people's concern about their declining living standards. When the people of Australia on the one hand have to worry about the major economic issues that seem to bedevil the nation, which is evidenced in the whole area of foreign debt and where it will take the nation, and on the other hand when those people have to attempt to balance and maintain their domestic budgets and households, this reflects very much on family living standards. With a deficit that is predicted in the 1988-89 financial year to be as high as $17,000m, is it any wonder that the Australian community cannot have confidence in this Government? When we are constantly worried about seeing the massive borrowings that are necessary from overseas sources or the sales of Australian land or other assets to foreign owners, of course there is unease at the way in which the economy is being managed by the Government.

       Whenever the monthly or quarterly government statistics hit the deck the press and the media constantly home in on those figures, and this in itself becomes very much a scare tactic in the broad Australian community. It is interest rates that really hurt and hit home. I do not think I need to draw too heavily on the statistics in this area, but it is a fact that an astounding 400,000 Australians have slipped below the poverty line, while more than 500,000 Australians cannot find work. Tragically, 100,000 of these out of work people are teenagers. Basically, the Labor Government has slammed shut the door of opportunity on Australians who want to work harder, want to earn more and want to make life better. We need a change of direction. The fact that the consumer price index has risen by 6.9 per cent during the 12 months ending in March reflects this factor. It reflects on jobs, on poverty and on every Australian family. I refer to families which are seeking to strengthen their family units and to have control over their lives and who wish to be sure that there is a fair go for everyone. Whenever a member of the family is looking for housing or an improvement in lifestyle, the family has to face up to the very high level of interest rates that are constantly before them.

       Last week at the Premiers Conference and the Loan Council meeting sharp cuts were imposed by the Government for the coming financial year. That will bring about dramatic changes in the communities in which we live. I know from the point of view of the Northern Territory that this raises very severe concerns. Over the past couple of years of the Hawke Labor Government's subventions to the Northern Territory Government the recurrent funding to that Territory has been reduced by some 17 per cent. That is a very dramatic figure which has a major effect on the day to day lives of every Territorian who is involved in business in one way or another. The fact that the Commonwealth did not give much prominence to the issue at the Loan Council meeting at which it slashed borrowings by Federal government authorities by well in excess of a billion dollars will have an effect on the services to be provided. I certainly hope from the point of view of the Northern Territory that the cuts will not impinge on the Federal Airports Corporation. The confidence that is required in the Northern Territory in terms of the Darwin and Alice Springs airports depends strongly on the funding of that Corporation. I believe that the Government must maintain those sorts of commitments which it has in the broader community.
      </para>
      <para>
       The perception shown by the statistics is that the Hawke Labor Government has introduced more than 300 taxation measures since coming to office in 1983. Consequently, personal taxes have gone up 107 per cent, company taxes by 133 per cent, and sales tax by 147 per cent. Average weekly earnings and inflation have increased by only 50 per cent over the same period of the Hawke Labor Government. Even with the promises contained in the tax package of 12 April, everybody's real disposable income has fallen dramatically under Labor. For example, a taxpayer on average weekly male earnings with a dependent wife and two dependent children will require an extra $56 a week by July 1990 to restore real disposable income to the March 1983 level. A family with two working adults earning full time average male and female weekly earnings, with two dependent children, will need an extra $71 a week by July 1990 to restore real disposable income to the March 1983 level. It therefore comes as no surprise to learn that the Hawke Labor Government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Total tax revenues have increased from $44 billion when Labor came to office six years ago to an estimated $82.3 billion this financial year. Similarly, personal income tax revenue has jumped from $20.8 billion in 1982-83 to an estimated $37.9 billion in 1988-89.

        —Prior to the dinner break I had outlined a number of the measures relating to the current Budget provisions of the Government and had highlighted a number of the issues relating to the very high taxes which have been imposed in recent years. It is no wonder that voters are cynical about the tax cuts and about the motives of a Federal government that gives with one hand and takes with the other. Certainly, promises of increased family assistance, pensions and wage rises have failed to compensate people for the erosion of their living standards over the past six years. I contend that the policies of the Hawke Labor Government have introduced a range of new increased and indexed indirect taxes on a host of consumer goods. They have maintained unacceptably high interest rates, especially home interest rates. They have maintained an unacceptably high and uncompetitive inflation rate, despite efforts to fiddle the figures, and have ensured that taxpayers still suffer from tax bracket creep. Indeed, what the Federal Government promised in the April 12 statement to give back pales into insignificance when compared with the taxes, charges and other costs imposed over the past six years. It is interesting to note what the respected consumer magazine Choice stated recently:

      <para>
       So much for a Labor government. When looking at the issues of the Appropriation Bills, it is appropriate that we direct our attention to the reports of the various Estimates committees of this Senate. I am a member of Estimates Committee E, which looks into a number of government departments, including the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. Certainly, this issue of the administration of Aboriginal Affairs for the past 12 months has been subject to continual and considerable scrutiny. The two questions that I and a number of other senators have asked continually are: Is the expenditure accountable, and is it efficient? When one measures that accountability and efficiency, I believe there are many issues that need to be properly addressed and taken up continually. I have not been satisfied that Aboriginal Australians can rely with confidence on the Hawke Labor Government. There has not been any real reconciliation or a commitment by the Government to eliminate the disadvantages which prevent Aborigines from enjoying equal opportunity. We want to make sure that the community in which all Australians live is one in which they can feel confident and know that the Government's commitment to finances, in particular, will produce proper outcomes and very good responses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Once again in the report of Estimates Committee E, which Committee, I remind honourable senators, comprises senators both from the Labor side and from the Opposition, we find very trenchant and severe criticism of both the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). If I could make an aside, I was certainly very disappointed that this time, in the preparation of this report, the Government saw fit to replace one member of that Committee purely for the purpose of getting signatures on the report in order to have a majority report. One senator was stacked onto the Committee by the Government in order just to get a report finalised for presentation to this Parliament. The senator who came onto the Committee was not part of the very comprehensive hearings that took place and therefore was not, in my view, in a position to judge the considerable weight of evidence of the hundreds of questions asked across the range of the portfolio. I think that the Government's action, in effect, has forced a reservation to the main report by Senator Michael Baume, Senator Jim Short and me; it has invited natural attention to this particular area and to the high-handed attitude the Labor Government has continually shown in trying to hide behind the actions of Minister Hand.
      </para>
      <para>
       If one looks at the areas of performance indicators and public awareness programs and in particular, as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have pointed out to the Senate so many times, the area of unacquitted grants of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, one sees that once again hundreds of grants-in fact, some 783 grants-worth in excess of $67m remain unacquitted, as was outlined in the Auditor-General's special report to this Parliament. The report also points out that the sheer number of questions that had to be taken on notice by officers of the Aboriginal Development Commission at the hearings reflected not only on the calibre of many of the people seeking to perform in that area but also on the fact that officers of both the DAA and the ADC had effectively been stripped of any effectiveness by the actions of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the last 12 months. The Minister has caused so many senior officers to either resign or retire that the Department and the Commission are unable to administer their work effectively. I hope that these issues are now being addressed by the new administrations in those two organisations. I hope that they in turn will not feel threatened by the legislation, which is still before this Parliament, to create a new Commission, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which legislation, I hope, will not in any way be pushed or thwarted through this Parliament by the guillotine methods that we have come to expect.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know that the Australian Democrats share the Opposition's concern in many areas relating to the formulation of that new Commission and acknowledge the necessity, in any change of administration of the Department or the new Commission, to ensure that we get it right. The fact that the Australian Audit Office has found so many serious problems, which problems were highlighted in its recent special report, also needs to be drawn to attention. The fact that the report of Estimates Committee E, which Committee included Labor senators, was prepared to be so strong in pointing up those problems also needs to be taken into account. I highlight the point I was just making by quoting the part of the report which states:
      </para>
      <para>
       The problems experienced with project evaluation and monitoring which are the core of the Audit Office Report are of continuing relevance to the ADC and must also be considered in the context of the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is a warning to the Government, not only from Opposition senators but also from the Labor senators who participated in the preparation of that report, that we are certainly not yet convinced that the new ATSIC proposals will in any way address the very serious issues of maladministration and lack of accountability that have been so evident.
      </para>
      <para>
       Opposition senators, in their reservation to the report, highlighted the fact that there were many significant issues that needed to be further addressed-in particular, the imposition of staff reductions in DAA and ADC and how this could subsequently affect ATSIC. The effects of these staff reductions were very evident to the Committee. One cannot lose experienced staff without expecting a decline in the standards of administration and management. This has certainly happened. There are many areas that need to be addressed. In particular, I would highlight the operation of the Aboriginal Development Commission Board. The Estimates committees highlighted many issues in late 1988, and a number of those resurfaced in the report six months later. Those issues have been compounded. The fact that the Board itself did not act competently, I think, is of major concern. What concerns me even more is that I believe the Minister, in the last week, has reappointed all of those Commissioners to the Aboriginal Development Commission Board, in spite of the assurance given to this Senate recently by Senator Tate, in answer to a question in this chamber, that Minister Hand would consult widely and comprehensively with the Aboriginal constituency before any replacement positions were made. Obviously, Minister Hand chose to override the very obvious advice given to him by his Senate colleague, Senator Tate, who had heard all of the evidence before the Estimates committees in October last year and this year and was well aware of the very major and significant problems in that area. It concerns me that so many of these issues have been ignored by this Minister.
      </para>
      <para>
       A number of issues related to the Aboriginal portfolio, I believe, need to be stressed in detail, in particular the duplication of functions that are exercised between the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission. Similarly, there remains a very serious duplication of functions between Commonwealth and State agencies. It is very obvious to see, particularly from the amounts of money that are dedicated to these projects, that these duplication exercises are wasteful in terms of both finances and staff resources. Areas to do with grant funds have not been properly acquitted and need to be specially addressed. Some 425 Aboriginal organisations throughout Australia are potentially in breach of the statutory requirements of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act. This is a most serious matter that needs to be addressed by government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The 300-odd questions that senators raised at the Estimates committee hearings in an effort to establishing something to address the real situation again invite further inquiry. There are plenty of examples of problem areas, such as the duplicated activities that I have just mentioned and the unnecessary overlap despite claims of no duplication between the Aboriginal organisation training undertaken by DAA and training for Aboriginals provided by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Why cannot this be properly coordinated by one department?

       The special audit raised many questions as to whether projects genuinely enabled Aborigines to engage in business enterprises as required by section 24 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. This important issue, while under study, remains unresolved, as does the equally important issue of grants versus loans for business enterprise projects. Funds distributed for administrative expenses under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act increased significantly in 1987-88 by 457 per cent to $5.78m, and in 1988-89 by 486 per cent to $6.15m. Indeed, the administration costs are the largest outlay in the 1988-89 year. Would this massive increase in funding promotion be transferred to the proposed new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission?

       I raised a series of questions related particularly to the operations of the Northern and Central Land Councils, which have in effect become the alternative bureaucracies for advice to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. In so many instances Mr Hand has chosen to override the advice given to him by the proficient and experienced officers of his Department and has relied on these land councils which, technically, have very different performance functions under their Act. The fact that the bureaucracies of the land councils have blown out of all proportion is, I believe, the area of major concern.

       Whilst there have been many inquiries into the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio in the past year-and all of them have been warranted, as was borne out by the reports tabled in this Parliament-it is now timely that special inquiries also be put through the operations of the Northern and Central Land Councils. Their staffing indicators, their financial responsibilities and their advocacy on behalf of the constituents whom they represent, particularly the traditional Aboriginals in remote parts of Australia, ought to be tested thoroughly and applied to full indicators across every area. There are areas of buffalo royalties, areas of payments for the operation of community stores, areas where funding is not properly getting through and being properly accounted in the areas of the land councils.
      </para>
      <para>
       Not only should there be special inquiries into their ongoing administration but also the Auditor-General and the auditors of these organisations should be called in to give them a very thorough going over and very thorough attention should be given to every point of detail. They are far exceeding their normal operations. I believe they are not properly representing the Aboriginal constituency which they represent.

       There is just a dismal record for so many projects, whether in the departmental area or the ADC. The Government failed to act and to remedy so many of the issues raised in late 1988 in the various reports to this Parliament, which, I believe, are still on the books and still demand and will demand ongoing and close attention. It appears that it is only this Parliament that is prepared to draw those particular areas of disadvantage to attention.

       One of the other significant areas relating to the Northern Territory that gave me cause for concern in the questioning was the provision of living areas for Aboriginals on pastoral properties in the Northern Territory. For a number of years there have been extensive negotiations between the Commonwealth Government, the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association on behalf of pastoralists in the Northern Territory. It has been an unhappy saga because the real issue that needs to be addressed is adequate and proper living conditions for Aboriginals in remote parts of Australia. The manner in which this whole area has been handled by the Government and in particular by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is of major concern. I seek leave to table a summary of the negotiations between the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association and the Commonwealth Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs in the period from 1984 to 1989.

       It is a very sorry and sad saga that obviously the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, has chosen to participate in an open press debate on this matter at a time when this must be very embarrassing for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and for other Ministers in the Hawke Labor Government. The article a week or so ago in the Australian by a Mr Hoy with regard to Brunette Downs highlighted particular problems at Brunette Downs, but it did not go far enough. The Minister did not address the problems that he knew had been under discussion and under consideration by his Department for some time. There was a total ignorance on his part. As I said, it must seriously embarrass the Hawke Labor Government and its senior Ministers when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would invite and promote open, active international participation in such an area. The ideal way to advance Aboriginal causes in Australia and in fact the very plight of Aboriginal people is not to go around playing funny games on issues as serious and as important as this one.

       There is a very real need to address major disability and the lack of provision of services for Aboriginal people in remote parts of Australia. There is a need to make sure that the governing legislation that is put in place to enable that to happen properly reflects the views of those Aboriginal people. ATSIC is not the answer in that regard and fails to completely address those issues. It does not have the majority support of Aboriginal people around Australia. Instead, it has attracted the radical emphases of part Aboriginal people, admittedly with social problems, in other parts of Australia. ATSIC does not address the major issues of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio and the intention and guise under which considerable amounts of government funding are being provided for the purposes of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.

       This is probably best highlighted by the manner and way in which a Queen's Counsel (QC) was engaged by the Aboriginal Development Commission in order just to counter the arguments and criticisms that had been put forward by the special audit report. The fact that it cost well in excess of $100,000 to engage that QC when the Attorney- General's Department advised, in the details that were given to the Estimates Committee, that it could have done the same task for $3,500, and the fact that Mr Hand's radical mates choose to engage solicitors and lawyers and every other form of help they can from outside, show a complete disregard for the proper process of both Parliament and the Public Service and the way in which these matters should be conducted.

       As I said in my remarks just prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, there are so many areas that need to be addressed. As Senator Stone pointed out in a notice of motion that was given earlier today, the declining living standards of all Australian people is the major issue before this Parliament. It is the major issue in this financial debate tonight. People in Australia no longer have confidence in any government at the Federal level, particularly a government led by the Australian Labor Party. They are scared by the borrowing situation and by the statistical information that continually flows out and is forever bad news. They know that their pockets are being hurt all the time, whether through interest rates or the cost of living. They are always worried about how their own State governments will be able to carry out their tasks. I have highlighted the particular issues that relate to the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio because they certainly stand out to me, as a representative of an electorate of which some 25 per cent of the community is Aboriginal. The Government has failed miserably in all its tasks in this regard.

        —It is proper when debating Appropriation and Supply Bills to cast a critical eye over the performance of the Government. Since the April economic statement, more and more Australians have realised that the Hawke Labor Government is failing to deliver the goods, both in terms of general economic management and in the administration of such essential areas as health. The whole basis of Labor Government policy is the accord that now holds it captive. Of course the accord was supposedly once the tool by which the Government controlled the economy. That arrangement has been absolutely blown out of the water in recent times. The acceptance of a 6.5 per cent wage demand which on top of tax cuts will have the effect of a 12 per cent wage increase on the economy is quite clear proof of incompetent economic management.

       In the nine years from June 1980, Australian net overseas debt has risen from 6.3 per cent of gross domestic product to more than 30 per cent of GDP. In money terms, it is up from $7 billion net to $100 billion and is increasing at the rate of $50m a day. At the risk of stating the obvious, this Labor Government has been in office for all but the first 2 1/2 years of this period and its current actions have everything to do with political damage control and, quite frankly, nothing at all to do with making Australia internationally competitive, which is the only means of confronting the debt problem. The Hawke Labor Government poses as being responsible managers through cutting expenditure. However, the record has invariably been to cut in areas where it hopes the political pain will be the least without tackling the areas of greatest spending.
      </para>
      <para>
       Who was surprised that a feature of the April package was a cut in defence spending? Defence is always a popular thing for Labor governments to cut. They have done it before; the present Government has done it consistently while in office and, needless to say, it will do it again. But cuts of $71m in 1988-89 and a further $78m over the following two years are of concern. The assurances that defence hardware programs are still on track can only mean that economies will be made at the expense of operational effectiveness or, in fact, personnel.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government does not care that the major problem confronting our armed services is the premature loss of trained personnel, a sector that in 1982 obtained just under 50 per cent of defence expenditure and last year was reduced to 43 per cent. We can thank this Labor Government for little. I suppose, sceptically, we can thank it for the loss of 50,000 service personnel who have resigned since 1983, for a slump in defence funding to a record low of 2.4 per cent of GDP and cuts in allocations to rations that prevent the supply of troops in the field. The latest cuts in defence are based on nothing more than a cynical judgment that there are probably few votes to be lost amongst service personnel and their families. I do not believe that this is desirable action for a responsible government to take.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Labor Government's actions in the field of health are typical of its general mismanagement and its so-called management strategy-actions to avoid the main problem, save expenditure by attacking the peripheries and at all costs forget about the effect on the welfare of the consumer and the taxpayer. In the 1988 Federal Budget, some $7.3 billion-that is, 68 per cent of the total health budget of $10.8 billion-was spent on medical and hospital services. Less than 11 per cent was allocated to pharmaceuticals. Predictably, this Labor Government is ignoring the major areas of health expenditure that are fuelled by its Medicare policy. Instead, it wages war on pharmacists and pathologists. Of course, that is not to mention the war it continually wages on the consumer of all areas of health. Just ask the many thousands of people in States right across this country who are waiting for so-called elective surgery but cannot get it. They know that war is being waged against them. More are starting to know and understand that the 1.25 per cent Medicare levy is just a figment of the Government's imagination inasmuch as the levy is meant to be paying for a free health system. That levy raises less than one-third of the total cost of health and, of course, it is getting less and less.
      </para>
      <para>
       For reasons of ideology rather than economic logic, this Labor Government has pursued a very deliberate policy of weakening private health care and discouraging the use of private hospitals. As a result, the queues lengthen for the public hospitals and more Australians wait longer, as I say, for that so-called elective surgery. There are many areas of so-called elective surgery that really are not elective in the true sense. They are areas of surgery that impinge greatly on the well-being of individuals. Resident medical officers at public hospitals are absolutely absurdly overworked, their working between 60 and 90 hours a week being quite normal in Western Australia, and there are reports of regular 57-hour shifts. Of course, if they move to ease this dangerously excessive workload, inevitably the result is even longer delays in surgery.
      </para>
      <para>
       Late last year, through the Australian Institute of Health, this Labor Government embarked on a propaganda exercise that sought to prove that public hospitals were run more economically than private hospitals. Using the 1985-86 figures, costs per bed-which, I might add, were the most recent available in real terms-were said to be $277 per day for public hospitals and $286 for private hospitals. There is a very small gap there. However, even on those figures the operating cost of $244 for a public hospital bed exceeds the $173 in private hospital bed charges. The figure of $244, however, was obtained by deducting an average operating cost figure of $340 per bed day for Australian public hospitals, and then deducting $96 for outpatient costs. Therefore, if the true outpatient cost is actually less, then public hospital bed costs are much greater than the Government is admitting. These figures also happen to ignore the fact that private hospitals pay sales tax and payroll tax. That would, if applied to public hospitals, add another $15 to public hospital costs. Again, the $20 allocated as capital costs for the public hospital bed is understated and should honestly be placed at $50.
      </para>
      <para>
       Altogether, I suppose it really becomes quite obvious that hospitals that must balance their books to survive-and that, of course, is restricted to the private hospital system-give far better value for money than those that need merely to persuade health departments to increase their allocation. Of course, those public hospitals that are teaching hospitals fulfil a far wider role, but the policies of this Labor Government mean that they are losing effectiveness through a quite severe narrowing of the mix of cases. For quite some time it has been claimed that in many areas of the public hospital sector this puts at risk the accreditation of interns going through the system, because they simply are not seeing a broad enough case mix. This is because all that public hospitals are really doing is putting out the bushfires as they arise, in preference to looking at all areas of medical care
      </para>
      <para>
       This whole episode illustrates the fact that this Labor Government would rather play with figures and starve the private hospital sector of support than turn its attention to better management of the public sector, or in fact give people real choice-whereby people do not have to pay twice through having to pay the Medicare levy. The Medicare levy is really only an additional 1 1/4 per cent tax because it is not going to health; it is not covering the costs of health; it is just a figment of the Government's imagination. But as for the Government taking a policy stand that would return real freedom of choice for people to be either privately insured or looked after by the public sector, no, that is all too hard.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government also chose to ignore the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, which last December reported that elderly Australians were being priced out of necessary operations for cataracts. Once again, this Government would say that that is purely and simply elective surgery. But how distressing it is for anyone of any age, but particularly the elderly, to be losing one's sight, now that there is an option and, because of the policies of this Government, having virtually to go blind before being able to exercise that option. Interocular lens implant operations that cost between $800 and $1,400 have since August 1987 attracted a rebate of $600, which the Government very neatly reduced from $820. Previously, pensioners could pay the 15 per cent gap or an amount of $20, whichever was the lesser. But now they are being further penalised not only by being unable to get in to have the operation but also by a cost level that is prohibitive to many. The Government has decreed, despite medical evidence, that this operation should take 10 minutes and be cheap to perform when in fact it takes at least an hour. Pensioners pay the price by joining the public hospital waiting lists, as I say, in near if not total blindness.
      </para>
      <para>
       Standards of health care can only suffer when a government decides that too much is being spent in a particular area and when it then decides to single out certain areas for arbitrary cost cutting, as a diversion from the underlying problems of Medicare. This Labor Government has sought to impose a 6.2 per cent cut in the income of pathologists when the consumer price index has moved 7.3 per cent. In January its reversion to the 1986 scale of pathology rebates, after those imposed in 1988 were found to be invalid, resulted in lower rebates or, in some cases, cancellations. The interim schedule, introduced on 1 November 1988, was first replaced, after an adverse Federal Court finding, with the 1987-88 schedule. The Opposition warned the Government and tried to stop it introducing that scale, but the Government was pigheaded enough to go ahead with it, with the aid, I might say, of the Australian Democrats, who operate from a basis of political envy.
      </para>
      <para>
       I recall quite clearly Senator Powell, in one of her patronising gobbledegook speeches in this place, asking why pathologists should earn so much money. She said that the Government legislation was sound, reasonable and desirable. But repeatedly Senator Puplick, who is responsible for health issues in the Senate, said that this cannot be so. But it took a Federal Court finding to prove the Opposition correct. After three months the 1986 schedule was reimposed, causing confusion and adding to the administrative costs of pathologists. Once again, the bureaucracy triumphed over the health professionals.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the April statement we were advised of cuts of between $45m and $49m to be made in pathology services between 1989 and 1992. There can be little confidence now that these changes will necessarily reflect medical realities because, quite frankly, no other changes that have been made to this dreadful system have ever reflected what is accurate. What is even more tragic is that the mental midget Democrats decide to agree with everything that the Government is trying to do in making health care less and less accessible to the public.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, we are now seeing that the pharmacy area is in line for greater cuts. The Government has not been satisfied with cutting back in every other area; it is now continuing to take the scalpel to the pharmacists-$31m in 1989-90, $96m in 1990-91 and $156m in 1991-92. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme-or, I should really say, the pharmacists that administer it-is the latest major scapegoat of the Medicare muddle. Expenditure on pharmacy may be only a small part of health spending, but this Government is missing no opportunity to reduce the incomes of pharmacists and to cut services to the patients who so desperately require the services that they can provide.
      </para>
      <para>
       In January last year this Labor Government went behind the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal and reduced the wholesale margin from 15 to 10 per cent, a cost that is certain to be transferred to the pharmacists. In August 1988, again as a unilateral action by the Labor Government, the maximum number of drugs per prescription was doubled, not only reducing the income of pharmacists but also taking away their ability to counsel their patients and monitor their dosage. In January the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal reduced professional fees for pharmacists by 10c per prescription. The new drugs pricing policy that was announced in March-with no expense spared, I might add-represents a further erosion in pharmacy incomes through the insistence on the use of cheaper drugs.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government does not care one iota about the drug that is most applicable. All it cares about-because the scheme is costing it a squillion dollars due to its mismanagement-is reducing the options to the patient. Here we have an instance where the losers will be greatly disadvantaged, and they will generally be the patients-disrupting accustomed therapy and suffering confusion. If people think that is just a figment of my imagination, they should talk to some of the patients. Aside from that, there is the possibility that generic drugs will not prove an effective substitute in every case.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I suggest, respectfully, to the Minister that he is being oversensitive. In the same way, I might in the course of debate say that Senator Tate professes to be a lawyer but cannot understand the legislation. It in no way indicates that I do not believe he is professionally qualified. It just indicates my surprise that, with his professional qualifications, he is unable to achieve something that we would normally expect of a legal practitioner. In the same way, my colleague has been saying that Senator Crowley, despite her medical qualifications, seems unable to appreciate the points that Senator Knowles is making. In no way is it said in a way that undermines or understates her professional qualifications. In any event, she would probably be better described as a medical practitioner than a doctor, unless I misunderstand her qualifications. I would therefore suggest that what my colleague has been saying is in order and that the Minister might not be quite so sensitive in this debate.

        —I am concerned that Senator Crowley has sat here for a substantial part of my speech to the Senate tonight and has chosen in a very important area, as a medical practitioner, to go, `tut, tut', when she obviously does not understand the problems that patients are experiencing with arbitrary change to generic and cheaper drugs that the Government has imposed on them.

       It says a lot for the priorities of this Labor Government that money can be found for newspaper advertisements, for oversized capsules and for leaflets to doctors and pharmacists-probably far exceeding $100,000 in toto-yet it cannot be found to ensure the best care for the patients of this land. The Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health in this place, the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, had to have three cracks at giving me a very simple answer as to the cost of the distribution of the outsized capsules and as to advising people of the change to generic drugs. He still has not responded in toto to my original question. He still has not included the costs of the pamphlets and the posters. His third attempt said that the cost of the outsized capsules alone was $76,000-a $76,000 waste. No doubt the 5,600 pharmacists, along with the 30,000 doctors who received that big plastic pill, do not appreciate such unnecessary spending projects of that value, as they then pay the price because the Government has reduced their incomes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The more the pharmacists cater for the disadvantaged and elderly patients, the greater the income loss caused by these Labor Government actions. One such pharmacist lost $3,800 annually through the 5 per cent reduction in wholesale margins; $5,000 through the doubling of maximum quantities of drugs per prescription; and a further $2,550 through the cut in professional fees. Altogether this has amounted to a 14 per cent loss in real income over the last year. If Senator Crowley bothered to go back to her profession, she might see how she likes it. But no, she sits in this place, in the cosy environment of a parliamentary income, and does not now understand or empathise with those in the medical profession and the difficulties they are experiencing.

       It is very obvious that this Labor Government and its advisers have decided that Australia has too many community pharmacies and that this kind of across the board bludgeoning is the best way to reduce their numbers. Whilst it can be conceded that some urban areas may have excess pharmacies, any government concerned with the need to provide proper health care through professional pharmacists should realise that closures will affect the actual provision of services. It is significant that, of the nine closures of pharmacies in Western Australian country areas since January 1987, four have resulted in the town in question losing its sole pharmacy. The towns in question were Lake Grace, Three Springs, Morawa, and Beverley-all significant agricultural centres.

       This Government is not interested in the fact that the pharmacists head the list of respected professionals, according to the gallup poll of a few weeks ago, with a 76 per cent approval rating. The Government seems intent on diminishing their role as health providers. If the ratio of one pharmacy to 2,900 Australians is considered excessive in comparison to the ratio in Britain or Scandinavia, it is not explained that the comparisons are false. In Britain pharmaceuticals are available from 8,000 dispensing doctors, and a depot structure in Scandinavia means that an individual pharmacy provides service through different outlets. It is worth noting that the number of prescription drugs per capita in Australia is 7.7 each year compared with 11.3 in Italy, 16.6 in the United States of America and 35 in Japan. In relation to gross domestic product, pharmaceutical expenditure in Australia was a dismal 0.39 per cent against an average of 0.67 per cent for major Western countries, including 0.59 per cent for the United States of America, 0.56 per cent for Britain, 0.95 per cent for Italy and 1.16 per cent for Japan in 1983. Per capita expenditure in US dollars showed Australia at $40 compared to an average of $72 for developed nations, including $51 for Britain and $80 for the United States of America.

       These statistics are a solid, concrete indication as to how cost effective the PBS has been, in no small measure thanks to Australian pharmacists. Yet the concept of trained health professionals functioning as independent businessmen, receiving a measure of reimbursement from the taxpayer for delivering a major public good, seems too much for this Government to appreciate or recognise. It is concerning to think that there are medical practitioners in the Government who continually choose to ignore that fact.

        —That is quite right. If the cost of pharmaceuticals is moving upwards, rather than blame pharmacists this Labor Government should acknowledge that the decline of the dollar adds to the cost of imports, and medically effective drugs can inevitably be expensive. For example, in February we learned of an extremely effective medication for kidney disease, ETO, which for 12 months costs $10,000. There are no easy answers to this problem but this Government, with its use of the authority system to discourage prescriptions of costly but effective drugs, has created a suspicion that cost cutting is more important than the optimum health of the individual.

       It must be emphasised that from 1961 to 1986 pharmaceuticals declined from 22.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent of health expenditure and from 1.22 per cent of GDP to 0.61 per cent. Therefore it is very much a tribute to the efficiency of Australian pharmacists that they are continuing to function under the discriminatory regime imposed upon them by this Labor Government. This is not the first time that I and my colleagues have pointed out the inherent defects of Medicare under non-medical Dr Blewett and the fact that he has employed the essentially diversionary tactic of scapegoating independent health care professionals. This is an evil in itself and the ultimate victim is the health consumer. I look forward to the committee stage of the debate when we can further ask the Minister about some of the outrageous expenditure that he is presiding over.

She tries to shore up her argument by suggesting that I do not understand the changes that the Government is proposing in any of these areas. It would be quite interesting if Senator Knowles had been a doctor, let alone a pharmacist, as she would have been in receipt of any number of large plastic capsules and any number of samples of any sort that the private drug companies have been bombing doctors with. This apparently was no cause for complaint by Senator Knowles for years and years. Apparently, that is legitimate when it concerns private practice but it is not legitimate if it should be attached to a government's serious commitment to providing the necessary information to people who need that information. It is quite interesting that Senator Knowles would be selective in her criticism. Her suggestion, which she has made before, that the use of generic drugs is likely to cause people to get sick or not get well because these drugs are not as effective is absolutely scandalous.

       What Senator Knowles is doing is positively mischievous. If she understood the debate about generic drugs she would know that there was no need for any patient to be interrupted in the course of usual treatment. Very few drug companies refused to cooperate with the Government. Those that did, because they were not minded to cut the costs of their medications, learnt that the Government was very serious about restraining cost expenditure in the area of drugs, in particular to ensure that the cost to individuals, to patients in the community, did not become unmanageable. That is the Government's commitment. Its priority is to ensure that people who are ill and in need of medication can get it at the most reasonable price while still ensuring a viable pharmaceutical industry in this country and the maintenance of adequate service provision by pharmacists. Senator Knowles tells me that four pharmacists closed in 1987 before any of these changes were introduced. I am not quite sure that her case stands. She may have just proven that what is proposed to happen has had no effect on those pharmacies at all. Perhaps the pharmaceutical industry and the pharmacists themselves appreciate that those kinds of rationalisations may have to go on.

       It is easy and cheap pool to kick the Government. That is fair enough for an Opposition. I do not mind it kicking the Government. I do not even mind if it has to use the argument that my professional status is forever in doubt. Such arguments are just distractions. They are insufficient and they are not going to persuade people. The hard evidence of what people pay when they go to get their medication is the real stuff, and so is the continuing commitment by earnest, proper and responsible pharmacists to continue to provide the kind of care and service that they do.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to spend the whole of my speech picking up the points that Senator Knowles raised but that could be too distracting in the extreme. I want to turn to a brief resume of the matters raised in Estimates Committee C regarding the appropriations. If I have time at the end of my remarks I might return to some of the points raised by Senator Knowles because I think she made some very inherent contradictions that should usefully be spelt out to the honourable senator. In its last hearings Estimates Committee C, unlike the previous time, proceeded with very little difficulty at all. The one point of some useful debate in the hearings concerned questions directed to the tax administration about the letters sent by the Department of Taxation to people who were either not at the address to which the letter was sent or who had died. I think the Committee was comforted or at least appreciative of the answers provided by the Tax Office that as far as possible those errors had been redressed and were to be avoided in the future. Very little else of difficulty or disputation occurred during the hearings.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable senators would know if they had examined the additional information from Estimates Committee C that two fascinating letters were presented. One was from Mr Ian Castles, the Australian Statistician, to the Committee preceding a number of answers to questions on notice put during the Estimates hearings, and the second was a reply to Mr Castles from the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Evans. I draw honourable senators' attention to these letters for a number of reasons, not the least being that they are fine examples of the art of the good epistle. I hope that the letter writers concerned would appreciate that I do this with the greatest respect and in no way do I wish to draw any kind of criticism or complaint to them, but I suggest that if these correspondents wish to continue their correspondence it might be better in the future to do this directly rather than through the Chair of Estimates Committee C, which kept meeting to decide what ought to be done with these letters. I was very appreciative of them because they are fine examples of the art of the good epistle.
      </para>
      <para>
       If correspondence continues and is not sent to Estimates Committee C, perhaps the people concerned would like to send me a copy because they are just the sorts of letters one could record in a memoir of `the better letters I have ever seen'. I draw the attention of honourable senators to that, partly because of the difficulty that Estimates Committee C faced in its hearings last year in going through the disputation about the Australian Bureau of Statistics and partly because of the legality of the more recent survey that created some challenge for it. In essence, the difficulties raised during those hearings are now resolved. There is no further dispute about the matters that were essentially the business of Estimates C hearings at that time. I suppose we are seeing correspondence on slightly different matters from those that are of major concern to Estimates C. I say again that they are fine examples of the art of letter writing.

       I was interested to read some of the debate on the appropriations legislation that took place in the Senate in November in particular last year. I would like to recall to the Senate's attention a quote from Senator Chaney's speech on the appropriations. On page 2630 of Hansard he is reported as saying:
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to assistance to families, I condemn the Government for the fact that the only families it has been prepared to help have been those on the lowest incomes.
      </para>
      <para>
       I said to Senator Chaney at that time that it was a remarkable comment. This Government's priorities were obviously clear to Senator Chaney and they were implemented by the Government. Senator Chaney acknowledged that the Government had assisted families at the lowest income scale but he condemned us for having priorities that assisted those on the lowest incomes. I found that remarkable when he said it and I drew attention to it when I made my contribution in the debate. I still find it quite remarkable. As I said then, perhaps Senator Chaney would have praised us if we had helped families at the higher end of the income scale. Further on in the debate on the appropriations, Senator Bjelke-Petersen criticised the Government for its failure to help families. On page 2880, she said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I am very distressed to see that the average Australian family will gain very little from Mr Keating this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is interesting that none of the honourable senators who at that time were anguishing about what was not happening to families-presumably, apart from families on the lowest incomes-have spoken in this appropriations debate about what has happened to families on the lower and middle incomes. Assistance to those families was announced in the April statement and was implemented on 1 July. I am talking specifically of the change to tax and increases in the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. The Government said in its Budget that it would implement those promises, and it has done so. Honourable senators who anguished about this failure in the debate on last year's appropriations apparently have seen fit to overlook the Government's commitments which were addressed in its April statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to remind the Senate briefly of some of those achievements. In the family allowance area, for the first three children in any family, the family allowance has been increased to $9 a week and for all children after the third-that is, the fourth fifth, et cetera-the payment will be $12 a week. For all families there has been increased assistance for and on behalf of children. As has been the case for a number of years, since it was introduced by the Opposition when it was in government, that payment, in large part, goes to the mother-certainly to the parent with responsibility for the kiddies. We know from research that the money provided to the mother for children is spent on children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Increases in payments under the family allowance supplement were also announced in the April statement. The Government in the Budget increased the payment for children between the ages of 0 and 13 from $21 a week to $24 a week, and for children between the ages of 13 and 16 from $28 a week to $31 a week. In the April statement the Government increased that allowance supplement for children between the ages of 13 and 16 by another $3.10. Children between the ages of 13 and 16 are now entitled to a family allowance supplement of $34.10 a week. All of those payments are free of income tax. Any family will acknowledge the incredible benefit those increases will be to them. As I have said, they are paid to the mother and they are spent on children. That is part of the Government's commitment to assisting families.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's priority is to assist families on the lowest income. It had a commitment to extend that assistance to families on higher incomes following the surplus that was delivered in the last Budget. The Government has done so. It has honoured its commitment from the last Budget, yet no Opposition senators come in here and acknowledge that. I suppose that is easy enough to understand; it is better to come in here and ramble across the health portfolio as did Senator Knowles. If one listened to Senator Knowles one would understand that she seems to defend pathologists, pharmacists and doctors. She argues that she is speaking on behalf of the people in the community but, in fact, it is precisely those people that the Government is defending by asking the pathologists and pharmacists to take part in the restructuring and the reduction in costs, particularly government outlays where that is proper, manageable and does not lead to economic disaster in those areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       If Senator Knowles had followed what had happened in pathology over the last decade or more she would know that pathologists are not among the poor people in this country. In fact, their salaries were a fair shock to many of their medical colleagues. While pathology became automated some 20 years ago, the payment for pathology services has not changed. There was quite clearly room for considerable restraint and moderation in the way fees were paid to pathologists. I do not believe that there has been a disaster in the pathology area as a consequence of those changes. It has not been unreasonable of government to say that it is committed to reasonable restraint in government expenditure and that while the community does not have to pay more, those people who can afford to contribute to restraint-that is, the higher income earners; in this case pathologists-should do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also find it very difficult to listen to Senator Knowles and other Opposition senators who argue endlessly in this place about the outrageous government expenditure. They come in here and criticise us when we make cuts when we honourably, after considerable deliberation, seriously address ways in which government expenditure can be restrained. The Government is bagged for cutting expenditure which seems to be a crime. But, at the same time, the Opposition insists that what we must do is cut expenditure. I do not know what kind of logic Opposition members have or what curious tangle in the back of their brains allows them to argue that way.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also note for the record that quite often Senator Newman will argue strenuously in this place for increased expenditure in the defence budget. How does she imagine that will line up with the Opposition's commitment to cutting government costs? I suppose that one could allow an increase in defence expenditure if the Opposition would give us any evidence of where it plans to increase expenditure cuts. But we have never heard from the Opposition a serious outline of what its policy will be, nor where it will cut expenditure. We are not told what it would cut if it increased its expenditure under defence. I find the Opposition's arguments insufficient and absolutely full of inherent contradictions. Senator Knowles wandered across the health portfolio with very insufficient analysis. It is easy enough to score points off governments that try to provide information to the people who need it. If anyone should ring up and say, `I have not been advised by the Government of the changes', we could expect the Opposition to be in here nagging us for not making sure that it had been provided with the information. That is a cheap point to score, and a not very persuasive one.
      </para>
      <para>
       In my comments on the Appropriation Bills I want to deal in particular with the Opposition's complaints about the lack of assistance for families, apart from those on the lowest incomes, and its absolute silence on the April statement and the proposals for extending the benefits to families, particularly under family allowance and the family allowance supplement. I have not heard a word about that. I guess that it is difficult for the Opposition. The Government has honoured its commitment and has increased assistance to families, not only through family allowance and family allowance supplement, but also by way of tax cuts. Families stand to benefit considerably. At the same time the Opposition says that standards of living in this country have been lowered, yet, as I understand its policy, it intends to lower those standards even further by more cutbacks and so on. If it does not intend to lower standards further by cutbacks, presumably it will allow those who can get on to get on and get richer, and those who cannot to go back on the unemployment pile.

        —Under us, the creation of 1.4 million jobs is a record that stands by itself. It needs no further explanation, but I will elaborate a little on it. Over 1.4 million jobs have been created, and I note that something like 60 per cent of those have gone to women. I am very appreciative of the fact that many women now have some income security by virtue of being employed. The other important thing is that, at the same time, very many of those people are no longer in receipt of the unemployment benefit. So there is a double gain to the Government-a reduction in the outlay on unemployment benefit, and increased revenue from those people now in paid employment and contributing through tax. That is a pattern that certainly all those people much prefer. I hope that that contribution to recovery is acknowledged by the community at large, though presumably it is not acknowledged by the Opposition.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The union movement's contribution, in tightening its belt and contributing, through wage restraint, to the prospect of job creation, is one of the great achievements not only of that movement but of this Government, and it is worthy of our considered acknowledgment. It is a very generous act. The same can be said of pensioners, who also contributed to meeting the challenge that the Government faced in 1986. They suffered a delay in the indexation of their pensions. Any number of superannuants went without 2 per cent over that period-also part of the contribution by people in this country. In his April statement the Treasurer said that the Australian people's contribution to the recovery ought to be acknowledged. I want to place on record my acknowledgment. As the Government said, it was timely at that point to acknowledge that contribution, which, together with the Budget surplus of $5.5 billion-for the first time ever-could be used, in part, to contribute to tax cuts and to the increase in family allowance and family allowance supplement to assist those people who had given this country so much assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Much more could be said about appropriations. I will read with interest and more exactness the report of what Senator Knowles said about health. She made a few other points, not now at the front of my brain, that were contradictory in the extreme-in fact, quite daft. Senator Bishop said that what this country needs is a new government with a new policy. She is wrong in saying that what this country needs is a new government, unless one could call a re-elected Hawke Government a new government-and that would do me. As for tax policy, plans for expenditure restraint, expenditure priorities and tax changes, what we have heard, or not heard, from the Opposition is a continuing monumental silence-can one hear a silence?-over the last few years. The Opposition does not have any coherent policy. There would be no comfort for the community in what it plans to do, let alone in its capacity or ability to manage it. I support the legislation.

        —We are debating the Appropriation Bills, and inevitably my special interest is in how the Government is finding and spending money in the defence area. Sadly, it is clear once again that the Government expects to do the `loaves and fishes' act with the defence budget. Clearly it has failed in its management of Australia's economy.

        —Senator Walsh, who seems to have come alive in the last moment, is very heavily responsible for the failure in that he, having identified 200 programs, has so far been unable to find the knife to wield in order to get the economy back on track. Our external debt, our high inflation, our high interest rates and our low dollar are all clear evidence of how this Government, in its management of the economy, has failed the Australian people. Sadly, that goes to the heart of the problems in respect of the defence budget. Defence funding is static, and although Mr Dibb's recommendation that 3 per cent real growth was necessary to enable the job of defending this country to be done was accepted by the Government when it accepted his report, that recommendation has never been met. Since this Government came to power in 1983 we have had a total real growth of 1.7 per cent in the defence budget, and no real growth whatsoever is planned for the coming financial year. A static budget cannot meet the growing expectations, let alone the vital needs. It is not made of elastic, and the defence of Australia is the poorer as a result.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Let us look at some of the expectations and inefficiencies in regard to the defence dollar-where it is being spent, and where it is not being spent effectively. Let me turn first to Namibia. During the hearings of Estimates Committee D it was very clear that the Government has not seen fit to provide any extra funding whatsoever to enable the commitment of the force that has been sent to Namibia by the Australian Government to be met. We have sent 300 engineers as part of the United Nations force in Namibia. We have been prepared to treat them as flag-carriers for the Australian people, doing their bit for the peace of the world. The Government has been very ready to get involved in the media coverage and to take the credit-although, of course, this has been supported on a bipartisan basis-but it has failed to provide the $28m that that commitment is going to entail. The Defence Department expects that that amount will come out of the existing budget for clothing, operations, training and recruitment. The Government has found no extra funds for that force in Namibia. It is disgraceful.
      </para>
      <para>
       The funding of the Namibian force will therefore be at the expense of tasks that are already expected to be undertaken by the Defence Force in the defence of this nation. It will result in cuts in training and in other operational cuts. When officers were questioned during the Estimates Committee hearings they were unable to tell us where exactly these cuts would be made. Yet we know that this Namibian force has been on the drawing board for 10 years. Surely to goodness, when the decision was finally in the offing and once it was under way, the Government could have told us how the money was going to be provided and where cuts in what the Defence Force is expected to do would be made.
      </para>
      <para>
       The training and operations votes in the defence budget have already been cut severely over the last year or so. It is quite disgraceful that, when productivity trade-offs are meant to be undertaken in the Defence Force-and if ever there was a nonsense, talking about increased productivity in the context of the Defence Force is one-training and operations were cut in the last year or so in an effort to find the money to pay increased wages. I do not know whether Australians are aware of just what this Government has done in the way of cuts in our defence capacity. There is no other way to describe it. When it is cutting down on the manpower and the training of the people who are there, inevitably the defence of Australia must suffer.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had the nerve to tell those fellows who went off to Namibia that they would all do Australians proud. Of course they will, but it is no thanks to the Government. In passing I just mention that in the last couple of weeks I have had a series of complaints from families of the men who have gone. They say that the Australian Government has not even been able to get mail to the troops or get mail back to the families in under four weeks nor have they been able to get copies of Australian newspapers in under a month of their having been sent from home. That is quite unacceptable. It has very much to do with the fact that the Government was not prepared to send postal specialists, who are in the defence forces, with the force in order to see to their comfort and the conditions of service. Once again, it is typical of this Government's lack of concern for the individuals it expects to fight for us.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn next to the decommissioning of equipment. We all know that if the family budget is tight we do not contemplate buying a new car or getting a dishwasher; we make do with washing up or we get the old car fixed up. But of course the Government and often the Defence Department do not think in those terms. Certainly Dr Strangelove, alias the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, does not think in those terms. Even the Prime Minister was on television last night telling us how the Defence Minister likes his toys. That is a major problem that we now face after six years of this Government. The capital equipment program has run ahead at such a rate that it has taken over and gobbled up the defence budget. Little or no attention seems to be given to the need to retain some of our equipment and do better with what we have.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me give some examples. Only yesterday the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, announced that the Chinook helicopters would join the ranks of redundant equipment. He said it was an economic decision and that the Government could not afford to upgrade the Chinooks. Let the position be clearly understood. The United States Government considers those helicopters of such vital importance to its defence program that it is prepared to upgrade 500 Chinooks. Australia could have joined its 11 Chinook helicopters onto the tail end of that upgrading program. We would have achieved an extra 25 to 30 years of life for those helicopters for less than $10m per aircraft. It would have halved the maintenance costs that are currently having to be met. It would have increased their capability with stronger transmissions, et cetera. As Mr Beazley said, the Black Hawks would now be doing the job. I do not believe that he is so ignorant. In fact, I think that was a deliberate attempt to mislead. The Black Hawks do not have the same capacity to transport medium or heavy artillery and heavy engineering equipment into an area where the forces need support. The result of that decision-a bad decision on economic and defence terms-is to downgrade our capability and the mobility of our forces.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have also had Centurion tanks mothballed since 1978 when they were replaced with the German Leopard tanks. At the time it was cheaper to upgrade them. The upgrading cost per tank was in the region of $230,000-odd plus shipping costs from the United Kingdom, or $217,000 with labour costs provided in Australia. Each Leopard tank cost us approximately $540,000. The Leopards are now already outdated. Germany has now developed Leopard II. The replacement costs of those will be enormous. Yet, the Israeli Army, which we regard as an efficient, effective force, is still using more than 1,000 upgraded Centurions. I believe there is still an argument for upgrading. The tanks are useful for training purposes and they are useful for ready expansion of capability in an emergency.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have recently had the ridiculous situation with the Skyhawk aircraft. We sold them to New Zealand for $28m. New Zealand estimated the package was worth $70m. We are now leasing back the Skyhawks for $6m for Navy anti-missile and anti-aircraft training. Why, for goodness sake, did we sell them? Think again too of the Grumman S2 Tracker aircraft. Nineteen of those were withdrawn in 1984. Sixteen were offered for sale and there were no buyers. They were stripped. One wonders whether they could still be used. When we bought them from America we had to put them together. Surely we could do it again. They are still worth approximately $50m. Again, look at HMAS Yarra. It was decommissioned in 1985. It still had operational capability then. Like the Chinooks, it too was sacrificed for economic reasons: the defence repair and maintenance budget was too limited. The directive at the time was to remove 2,000 billets from the naval establishment.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to another matter which from time to time comes up when we are considering the appropriations for the Department of Defence; that is, the hoary old problem of the payment of defence accounts. The salaries of those people processing accounts in the Department are over $50m. This is after 189 positions were abolished as a result of the Block Efficiency Scrutiny. Even now, after the changes that took place at that time, there are still seven stages to the account payment process. The Department is rightly worried about it. A pilot scheme has been introduced in South Australia and Victoria for a new accounts system. I, for one, will be keeping a close watch on that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also turn to the question of defence procurement. It is a matter which is at present under a cloud. The whole matter of defence procurement and the accounts and tendering system has a number of question marks hanging over it. Project DESINE is the latest example of doubtful and questionable practices in awarding contracts. I remind the Senate that in October 1987 the Australian Federal Police (AFP) estimated that $800m was lost in fraud against the Defence Department. So it is not only a matter of concern but also a matter of vast cost to the nation if these figures estimated by the AFP are correct.
      </para>
      <para>
       I draw your attention, Madam Acting Deputy President, to the report of Estimates Committee D, which was tabled in the Senate just recently. There is an item on page 2 of the report entitled `Questions on Notice: Outstanding responses'. The report states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Delays in responding to questions has been the subject of critical comment by a number of Estimates Committees on previous occasions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report goes on:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee notes that undertakings have been made by departments to provide outstanding responses before the appropriation Bills are debated in the Committee of the Whole. This situation will be closely monitored by the Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you would be as horrified as I have been to discover that there are still 120 answers outstanding from the Department of Defence as of now when we are debating the Appropriation Bills. Over 30 of those questions relate to this project DESINE, which has been the subject of public concern. It was also raised and detailed questioning has taken place in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. One has to wonder why it has taken the Department over a month to answer those questions. I have to put the Government on notice that the Opposition is not prepared to support the passage of the defence appropriations while 120 questions remain unanswered.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also have questions that I think will be of interest to Senator Walsh. I am glad that he is in the chamber because he will be able to take them on board. I wonder whether Senator Walsh has been briefed on Defence's DESINE contracts? Does the Minister's Department have a representative on the defence computer acquisition council? Did the Minister's representative at the acquisition council meeting approve DESINE? If not, what external scrutiny was undertaken to ensure that all costs, as well as benefits, were identified? Does the Minister's Department have any reservations or objections to DESINE and the way it is being implemented? Has the Minister been informed of the additional costs to the taxpayer resulting from the implementation of DESINE? Does the Minister agree that he has some responsibility to ensure that for any acquisition in government the lowest cost effective solution should be sought by open tender? Does Senator Walsh express any concern? No, he ignores the question. Let the Senate take note of the fact that the Minister for Finance is not prepared even to listen to questions of such major importance.
      </para>
      <para>
       The DESINE matter raises great concerns in the Department of Defence, certainly among uniformed people. They want to know, for example, why they cannot upgrade the equipment they now have in service. The understanding is that existing equipment cannot be upgraded by the previous supplier. They are being told that they must convert to IBM rather than upgrade the existing systems. Calculations from within the armed forces suggest that purchases under DESINE will cost the taxpayer at least 47 per cent more than equipment bought previously. Industry observers consider that this figure may well be conservative. It appears that there is an interesting clause in the contract with IBM which says that, in effect, the Department of Defence will buy equipment from IBM unless the delegate is satisfied that the solution offered by `big blue' is inadequate. Is the Department of Defence using the word `exemption' in the correct way, or is IBM being advantaged by the Department's definition? There is a belief in the industry that the Department is using the term `exempt' differently-that is, if a particular piece of equipment is exempt from DESINE it can be supplied by IBM from non-DESINE products. Thus, other suppliers are being kept out in the cold. One asks: since when has IBM been outside the Commonwealth's purchasing rules?
      </para>
      <para>
       The argument can run that there will be an overall cost advantage in future by having compatible systems purchased under DESINE. There are a number of compelling arguments against that. For instance one has to ask: has a study been conducted which shows the cost advantage of having every system compatible? If not, how does the Government know? If so, can the Senate obtain a copy of that? Certainly the Senate has been kept in the dark on these matters. Many questions are still to be answered about that, quite apart from the 30-odd which the Department has had for more than 30 days and to which it refuses to provide answers to the Senate.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are numerous other areas where I am concerned about the expenditure of scarce defence dollars. An example that came before the Committee was the question of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) land at Townsville. On the RAAF land was a dog compound used for security for the RAAF base. The Department of Defence handed over that piece of land to the FAC without any recompense of any kind being given to the RAAF. A sum of $600,000 is to be expended in providing a new dog compound on land which the RAAF already has and no compensation whatsoever will go back into the RAAF's budget for land which was given to an organisation which the Commonwealth Government is always telling us operates, and has to operate, on a commercial basis. That is quite unsatisfactory and has not otherwise received the scrutiny of this Parliament. It highlights the value of the Estimates committee processes whereby something as ludicrous as this can be brought to the light of day. There is no way that defence land should be handed over to anybody for free, especially when it is not just a gift of land but will also incur extra expenditure of this nature, let alone that it be handed over to a body which is supposed to operate as a commercial organisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       We also saw what I believe to be a gross waste of money, although Senator Walsh defended this recently, in the expenditure of $215,000-although he said in the answer he gave in the Senate recently that it was in excess of $100,000. Mr Uhrig was appointed to oversee the transfer to Westpac. Senator Walsh admitted that it was something over $100,000, yet it was $215,000. Senator Walsh either knew it or should have known it. This was the private sector input that was apparently needed to hand over the defence service home loan scheme to Westpac. The Opposition supported the proposal to privatise the scheme. But I find it quite objectionable that for $215,000 we got six months of odd-jobbing by Mr Uhrig. Despite questioning, the Committee was not given any details as to how that money was arrived at. We wanted to know the hours worked and the job that was done and got no details whatsoever. That is not acceptable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another peculiar treatment of the defence budget by this Government was revealed in the Defence Housing Authority questioning. The Government has made much political capital in the last couple of years by saying that it has provided $750m to improve housing for defence forces. The situation is that the Government has not given the defence forces $750m. It has provided a loan which is at a commercial rate of interest, currently believed to be about 13.5 per cent. The Department tells us that there will be a supplement for the interest which is being incurred by the Defence Housing Authority and I understand it is already up to about $13m. I have a copy of the appropriations of the Department of Defence. They show an additional estimate of $9.124m, but do not show any detail about an interest supplement. I do not see how it can be proved that the Government has provided $13m extra. Quite apart from that, at the end of the 10-year period is that $750m returnable to the Commonwealth or not? How is it intended to fund the supplement, and what is to happen to the loan at the end of the 10-year period?
      </para>
      <para>
       We are in the ridiculous position of this country having been run down to its knees. It is suffering at every level. Small business people are suffering a rate of 23 per cent on their overdrafts, and I do not know how they can operate in business these days. Families are trying to get homes on 16 per cent to 16.5 per cent mortgages. All of this is due to the mismanagement of the economy by that Minister over there, who likes to scream and yell and not deal with the substance of an argument. To me, with my responsibilities for defence force personel, the impact falls first on the defence budget and, secondly, on the budgets of all those little families, young wives, young husbands and their babies, which this Government sends from one end of the country to the other. The Government is not prepared to give those people proper recompense for their service to this country.

This year and next year there is a $28m shortfall in clothing for the troops. That is what a good manager this Government is! That is how much it cares for the people it sends to defend this country. Yet, it struts the world stage telling the world, `We will send a brigade to Kampuchea; we will send engineers to Namibia; we will send somebody to Vanuatu and we will send some more to Fiji'.

        —I am sorry, Madam Acting Deputy President. I quite forgot you were there for the moment. I was so busy making sure that I taught this Minister a lesson. If the Minister is so interested in the fine print of accounting, let him see that his own Government does a much better job of accounting with the nation's resources, because this Government is a rotten manager of the national Budget and an even worse manager of the defence Budget. If it were a better manager, we would be able to achieve more with the scarce resources we have. But it is failing on every level. If the Minister for Defence got cleaned out in the next election and we got into government, we would show those opposite how to make the defence dollars go further and defend Australia better. The Government has a lot of lessons to learn and at the very next election the people of Australia, including all those Defence Force families which have been neglected, will show the Government there is a better way.

        —I could not help thinking earlier this evening when Senator Crowley was speaking what a pity it is that we have a government in this country that tends to look at families in terms of hand-outs and assistance. Surely that is necessary for a number of them, but would it not be much better if we had a government that looked at creating an economic situation whereby families were able to earn enough money to support themselves, to make the decisions that they want to make for themselves, and not merely at increasing hand-outs and assistance? Senator Crowley also referred to the Government having honoured its commitment in relation to child poverty. I remember that in April of this year, when certain increases were announced by the Government, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said the Government had honoured its commitment. He gave no evidence whatever to support that fact, but he certainly did not convince everybody that that was the case.

      <para>
       I refer to the Canberra Times report on 19 May of the speech given by the Anglican Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn, the Right Reverend Owen Dowling, when he was speaking at the launch of this year's Bishop's Welfare Appeal, which has a target for this diocese of $150,000. I quote:
      </para>
      <para>
       Poverty in Australia has not lessened, despite the Prime Minister's pledge that no child need live in poverty after 1991, according to the Anglican Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn, the Right Reverend Own Dowling . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       He said the Prime Minister's pledge stretched his credulity.
      </para>
      <para>
       `I would like to believe it to be true but I suspect the poverty element in our society has not actually reduced'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The bishop said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . there had been some relief but many people from the middle-income group were not making it. It had been estimated that one in five families in Australia were below the poverty line, therefore the number of children involved in poverty was much higher than 20 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think the bishop knows what he is talking about. All the words of the Prime Minister when he said that he would honour his commitment will not convince those who still have serious financial problems in making ends meet for their families. They will not be convinced that because the Prime Minister says so it is right.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Appropriation and Supply Bills that we are discussing today relate to the authorisation by the Parliament of several hundred millions of dollars from Consolidated Revenue for the purpose of government expenditure. They cover many areas and a number of honourable senators have spoken about matters in which they have a concern. It is reasonable that we look closely at this expenditure and where the Government gets the money from. The lion's share comes from pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers, ordinary workers and their families, in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is worth remembering that the Government has no money of its own and cannot have money of its own; it can only have what it takes from the people of this country. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) said earlier this month that PAYE tax collections in the nine months ended March of this year totalled $30,147m, almost 17 per cent up on collections for the same period a year earlier. Let us remember, of course, that this Government boasts about keeping wages down. When one looks at the fact that the PAYE collections are up 17 per cent, one realises exactly how much more is being taken from the wage earners of this country. Company tax was up 13.6 per cent; sales tax was up 24 per cent. It is indeed a high taxing government which finds many and devious ways of collecting more money from the people of this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the current financial year so far, Government revenue is up by 7.7 per cent compared with the previous year. The Minister explained that the increased PAYE collections arose, in part, from increased employment. Nobody argues that there has been some increased employment, but that is only a partial explanation for the extra amount which has been collected. While earning a little more, people find that each time they are paying a great deal more in taxation. This is expressed as `bracket creep'. It is of course not surprising that the Government does not say too much about that, but Australian workers know that they are paying a great deal more in taxation than they ever have before. They are no longer interested in working overtime. It just is not worth their time and trouble because of the amount of money that the Government takes from them. The Government cannot ignore the fact that its tax policies have led wage and salary earners to the conclusions that the harder they work the more the Government will take from them.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government should not fool itself that it can convince the public that the tax cuts announced recently will make up for what they have lost over the last six years. There was, I am sure everybody would agree, a very cynical reception to the tax package announced in April of this year. The taxpayers of this country are not gullible. They know what has happened and the bribe, or the attempted bribe, will not work. They will not accept the short term palliative of a tax cut just prior to an election and feel that they are supposed to be grateful as a consequence of what they are receiving.
      </para>
      <para>
       They want solutions to the larger fundamental problems with the economy which have resulted in the high inflation and high interest rates they face. Interest rates, already at record levels, are, from everything I have read lately by the experts, looking very certain to rise again. This is killing the dream of home ownership for Australian families. An article in the editorial column of the Canberra Times of 22 May carried the headline `Interest should go no higher.' The article stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       With the majority of mortgages now over $80,000, the increase in interest rates is dragging an extra $100 a month from the pockets of borrowers. Many, of course, cannot afford it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those out there who are having to sell homes because they cannot afford the repayments know exactly that. People will find that their homes have a mortgage and a debt upon them which are more than they will be able to sell them for. They have no hope of ever owning their own home because of the debt. If they rewrite the mortgage so that the payments remain lower as interest rates go up, the end result is quite devastating considering what they will owe in mortgage and interest payments in the longer term. So far this financial year, the cost has risen $40 a week. A New South Wales family with an average mortgage of $84,000 is paying over $270 a week in repayments. Most families would be far better off swapping tax cuts for lower interest rates. Labor has deliberately chosen higher interest rates as its major economic policy weapon in dealing with our balance of payments and inflation crisis. It appears from what the Government says that there will not be any change.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those who are hurting are the people who have entered into contracts and are attempting to purchase their homes. They are facing enormous monthly repayments, frequently far beyond their earning capacity. According to affordability surveys based on 25 per cent of family income being an appropriate amount to be paying for the purchase of a house, the only families that can buy an average home and meet the repayments at present would need an income of more than $65,000 a year, and that is more than double the average Australian family income. That is the position we have reached after six years of Labor's economic management.
      </para>
      <para>
       The consequence of this is that it places families under enormous pressure. A marriage guidance council confirms that the number of people seeking guidance owing to the housing crisis is putting a strain on its resources. Soaring house prices and interest rates have taken a very heavy toll of families in this country. Many young couples attempting to buy a home have put off starting a family for many years. They are starting a family much later in life; some are not having a family at all. Ordinary men and women around this country are telling the Government by whatever means are at their disposal-by writing to the papers and by writing to their members and senators-that they cannot take these high interest rates, that they cannot continue.
      </para>
      <para>
       People have been protesting in rallies around the country. In Canberra, the interest rates revolt group has been formed. Mrs Jeffreys and others have banded together to try to get the message across to the Government. These people are not attempting to buy luxuries, to have holidays or to go out or entertain; they merely want to be able to meet their financial commitments and provide accommodation for their families. They want to be able to feed their families. However, many can no longer afford to buy new clothing for their children.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have had a number of letters from people in my electorate. One has come from a married mother of two, who survives on the single income of her husband. She says that she believes that he is on a good wage and that the only debt the family has is a mortgage. She is certainly not able to buy clothes for herself. She worries about the family car breaking down because they do not have money available to repair it. The family finds it impossible to save and they have to live without the security of anything put aside in case of emergencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another married woman with two children contacted me. She can no longer afford to buy clothes; she has had to cut back on the amount she spends on food; and going out, and any form of entertainment, is absolutely out of the question. She faces the problem that if any of her household appliances breaks down she has no hope of finding the money for repairs. These people are not complaining about missing out on any of life's little luxuries. They are talking about providing adequate food and clothing for their children, maintaining the family vehicle which is probably getting on in years and being able to maintain household appliances. These are not isolated accounts and this is reflected throughout this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wish to read some parts of one letter I received because I think it is worth reading. The writer asked:
      </para>
      <para>
       I wonder if Mr Keating and Mr Hawke really know what it is like to try to meet the everyday needs of a family;-
      </para>
      <para>
       I interpose to say that that is a very fair question-
      </para>
      <para>
       To have to empty money boxes several days before payday to be able to buy petrol; to run out of butter or margarine and literally have unbuttered sandwiches and toast; to go to a doctor, get a script, then reassess the gravity of the complaint and decide that salt water gargles for another 24 hours may avert the need for the antibiotic, or if it's a skin complaint, put up with it; to buy a child's sneakers from St Vinnies and make him wear them with thick socks because it is impossible to contemplate the purchase of a new and better fitting pair; to go without dental checkups and treatment because there just isn't any money for a dentist's visit; to make a child put up with badly scratched glasses; telling a child he or she can not play a sport or join Scouts because they have to be classed as extras. One doesn't even need to have a very large family for these to occur.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the writer indicates, these are not isolated instances. If honourable senators go out into their electorates and into the community they will find that this is more and more the case. The writer continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is situations of this type that cause people to use bankcards, borrow and end up in debt. It is not necessarily the purchasing of luxury items on credit.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is situations such as the one she describes that force mothers who wish to be at home with their children for a period to go out into the work force, and that creates other problems and stresses for families. The author of this letter, like many others, accepts and makes it plain that, in times of economic difficulties, sacrifices must be made. That is accepted in the community but it is the middle income families that are sacrificing so much. The letter continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       When the country's economy is tight it is right and fitting that every one should be required to tighten one's belt and contribute to righting the situation but this should be required of all sectors of the community; big business, corporate sectors, workers, self-employed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I don't agree with the idea of taking from the rich and giving to the poor but surely there are ways and means of putting some form of incentives into the system to encourage people to work and enable them to see the results of their work: ie to be able to meet their basic needs, improve their standard of living, getting satisfaction from the fact that what they have is a result of their productivity.
      </para>
      <para>
       When a man works an extra shift and gives extra time to help his boss he is penalised by our current tax system.
      </para>
      <para>
       That statement is worth repeating:
      </para>
      <para>
       When a man works an extra shift and gives extra time to help his boss he is penalised by our current tax system.
      </para>
      <para>
       All she is asking for really is a fair go. What the Government is offering wage and salary earners and their families is nothing but discouragement. I will read the concluding portion of that letter:
      </para>
      <para>
       Let's face it. It's the groups that can make the loudest noise who get attention. Families don't complain, grumble, strike etc, because they are just too busy getting on with their lives with all the demands, emotional or otherwise, that are placed on them. Surely, if the Government really has this country's future welfare at heart it would concentrate on the area which is the backbone of any nation, and that is the family.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would echo that and say that I hope that the Government will listen and will pursue policies to enable families to do what they want to do for themselves without taxation being at the level at which it has been.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, as is mentioned in the letter, there is the matter of personal debt. The figures disclosed in February this year showed that every Australian man, woman and child owed more than $2,500 each in personal debt, that is, $5,100 for every member of the work force-a national total of $41.8 billion. It is clear that ordinary people are being forced into taking on this sort of debt merely to maintain their families. The Government is attempting to ignore the implications of this development. The Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, is quoted as saying that the new figures added `some urgency' to the problem of high personal debt but that the Government would not change its approach to it. It is the same `do nothing' approach that it takes with interest rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government can be blase about the problem of consumer debt, but others are not. The Economic Planning Advisory Council warned in April that at least 100,000 Australian families were struggling to pay off their consumer debts. Of course, do not forget that for the most part that debt attracts an interest rate of about 23 per cent. The fundamental cause of this enormous increase in personal debt, which means a fall in the standard of living under Labor, is increased interest rates, high inflation and high taxation. Notwithstanding the recently announced tax cuts, the Government should be clear that many Australians do not accept that the taxation system is in any way fair or equitable. Another letter that I received, referring to this matter and its impact on working people, said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Every person in the mid to lower income tax bracket acknowledges that they are easy picking.
      </para>
      <para>
       That letter, which was written by a young woman with four children, described the cycle in which she had found herself. I have spoken to many in this situation. She is divorced, her marriage having broken up for one reason or another. She wants to get ahead and provide a healthy outlook on life for her children. She wants to secure a position and a future for herself. She wants to be able to capitalise on her future. She needs to obtain a tertiary education. To do this, she needs money for baby-sitters, education costs and the fees she will have to pay. She may not find it very easy to get time off work to study. To get the money required means working extra hard to achieve bonuses or even taking a second job. She would then be in a higher tax bracket which penalises such initiatives and compels the woman to stay poor, uneducated and futureless. I have spoken to many in that situation who find that they are better off remaining on the supporting parents benefit than risk attempting to get ahead and who feel that if they lose the benefits that go with it they will not be able to get the medication they would need if their child became sick. It is a tragic situation. I quote from that letter:
      </para>
      <para>
       What happens in the minds of Australia's greatest resource when they see incentive stifled at every turn. That is glaringly obvious, isn't it-a youth unemployment rate of 20 per cent and kids that cannot be bothered trying any more. It is becoming apparent to myself that the strategy of this Government is to keep working class people poor, keep them ignorant, and keep them down. People are so busy just trying to exist that they haven't got time to question, let alone raise a fuss about the real people ripping off the system.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is common. I have quoted from a few letters tonight-I have received many others-because people can better express in their own words what they really feel about the situation in which they find themselves at present as they struggle to keep their heads above water. They find it impossible to save anything or put anything aside for emergencies and certainly experience grave difficulty in buying or making payments on a home for themselves and their families.
      </para>
      <para>
       People want to be able to work, and work hard, and be able to reap the rewards that flow from it. They want a reasonable standard of living so that they can provide for their children. They want to get the benefit from improved productivity. They want to be able to make decisions for their families and themselves. Unfortunately, the Government seems unwilling to make any genuine attempts to reform the wages system and put in place a taxation system which will enable that to occur. Thousands of Australian workers and their families cannot look forward to an improved standard of living until such fundamental problems are dealt with. Let us not forget the extent to which their standard of living has dropped in the six years in which Labor has been in government. Labor's answer to the economic ills is inadequate tax cuts, high interest and high inflation. The only thing that will really help people in this country is for a Liberal government to be elected. While this Government remains in power, I hope it will address at least some of the problems that are facing families in this country.

        —I rise to speak to the Appropriation Bills. In doing so, what strikes me most about the Bills is the extraordinary priorities that this Government has in many areas. It does not seem to have any idea that the country has to generate sources of income if we are to survive. It does not seem to understand that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar has added $10 billion to $15 billion to Australia's overseas debt in the last two or three weeks. It does not seem to understand that if there is a $2 billion deficit for May, as has been predicted, the interest alone on that amount is in the order of $150m a year. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is in the chamber, may understand that $150m a year is about as much as we get for the total of Australia's woodchip exports. The total of Australia's woodchip exports will pay one month's interest on the extra deficit, and that is all.

       We are bleeding to death from interest payments. But the world's worst Treasurer does not seem to believe there is any problem about that. He does not seem to take it seriously. He says, `We are on course' and leaves it at that. People around Australia can no longer tolerate it being left at that. We have to build up the country's generating operations. We have to face this question of interest. We are paying the highest rate of interest of any similar country in the world. Our debt is now at the level of those countries that we have been led to believe are in a very poor state. We are in the same order as Brazil and Mexico. I would not have thought that this would bring the Treasurer (Mr Keating) any great joy. I was interested to read a portion of a speech given by Sir Arvi Parbo on 5 May in Melbourne. In one paragraph he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       In June 1980 our net overseas debt was 6.3% of GDP-that is 6.3 per cent of what we produce annually. By June 1985 it had leapt to 25% and is now over 30% of GDP. In these terms it has risen by five times in less than a decade. In money terms we have gone up fourteen times from a debt of about $7 billion to what will be around $100 billion by the middle of this year. (The gross debt is well over $100 billion). The debt is increasing at the rate of $50 million a day. During the hour and a half we are spending at this lunch, it will have increased by $3 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       The world's worst Treasurer does not seem at any stage to take that into account. He says that we are still on track. It is a pretty poor track we are on, and I do not know where it will wind up. The people of Australia must change this wretched Government and get a bit of financial management from people who know where they are going, who know when things are serious and who are prepared to do something about it. That is the only alternative. The Government has said that it supports higher wages. The people of Australia certainly need them, but higher wages have to be accompanied by higher productivity. I notice that we are now using various newfangled expressions for covering up on a wages increase that means absolutely nothing and produces absolutely nothing except greater debts and higher interest. We are still going up this track of having higher interest rates and greater and greater debt.
      </para>

       Senator Reid covered many of the domestic issues very well and clearly demonstrated the sorts of problems that the average people are suffering from. But it goes a lot further than that, because over the last 12 months the arrears owing through the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation have gone up again by another 7.1 per cent. This debt concerns people's greatest asset-their house. It has risen another 7.1 per cent over the very high figure that applied before. The world's worst Treasurer does not worry about that either-I do not know whether he even recognises it-but the people whose houses are in jeopardy, the people who may lose the roof over their heads, certainly understand.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us look at the individual areas. Tonight I would like to deal briefly with only three small areas. I would like to mention science, the Antarctic, and foreign fishing. On the matter of science, in the last week or two the newspapers and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have been talking about a $1 billion hand-out for science and research. That is absolutely, flagrantly, deliberately and wantonly incorrect. That so-called $1 billion is, of course, to be allocated over five years; it is not a simple injection of $1 billion that could now well be made if the Government had any intention of trying to generate the economy into productivity again. Approximately two-thirds of the $1 billion goes to tax deductions in the area of research and development in the private sector. That is an increase on the situation that applied before, but in the areas where the Government has the responsibility the position is quite different. Of course, the majority of the money left after that-the $78m per annum average-goes to Mr Dawkins, not to the Department of Science as such. That is important and it needs to be taken into account.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of that $78m a year, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) may get $18m per year. The Prime Minister has decided that, as he wants to beat up his own position a little, he will take unto himself science, the greenhouse effect and anything else which might provide a bit of good publicity and on which he can shower some money. Of that amount, $7.8m is to go to funding work in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on the greenhouse effect. Even when Senator Richardson, the muscleman in this organisation, applied for $1m he could not get it. The amount of $1m last year in many respects would have been far more valuable than $7.8m as part of this $1 billion package.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is to get $2.5m over five years. The Australian Institute of Marine Science is to get $2.5m over five years. Marine science generally gets $3.9m, or $0.78m a year. The universities and colleges get $35m a year, and then we have an Australia Prize of a quarter of a million dollars a year. So it goes on. But where will that have an effect? How will that catch up the huge losses accumulated in the last seven years? Every year since this Government has been in office there have been huge cuts in the generator of the Australian economy. Without the work done by science, and without the hope that it gives our young people to work in this country for this country, we are going downhill fast. And it does not worry the world's worst Treasurer one iota.
      </para>
      <para>
       I give credit to Barry Jones for doing absolutely everything that one man could possibly do to try to get some interest in science-and, or course, he can get interest everywhere except in the Cabinet room. The way he has been treated by the Prime Minister, by Mr Dawkins in particular, and by others is absolutely disgraceful. The dedication of the man in staying in his portfolio deserves particular mention. The derogatory remarks that he suffers at the hands of his colleagues do none of them any credit. If any of them had the dedication to their jobs that he has for his, we in Australia might be in a slightly better state-but they do not and so we are not.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we are to get this economy moving we will have to get this generator started, and it will not start without fuel. The situation now is that in most of the science places I go to I find people trying to work with equipment that is hopelessly out of date and hopelessly inadequate. We are expecting people to produce for the year 2000 and beyond with the clapped-out equipment of the 1960s and 1970s. Any other country with any desire to succeed in these areas has provided its people with reasonable, adequate equipment for a start. Such countries have also given their people some sense of security and some pride in what they are doing. But here the people engaged in science are underpaid. The qualification necessary to get into science has now been downgraded, and now it is way down the list for the people with high intellectual capacity. We are expecting those people to come up with the best science in the world, and it just does not happen that way. There is no security in their work. People are leaving in considerable numbers. I noticed in the computer section of the Australian of 9 May an article under the heading, `Expatriate researchers argue a number-cruncher of our own is essential now to secure the future'. It then goes on to state, `Brain drain: the super story of why scientists go', and to list several Australians who have done remarkable things in various areas of science-absolutely top men and men of considerable brilliance except that they are all overseas. All the good research they are doing is being done in other places. Why should that be? Twenty years ago Australians led the world in many of these areas. Why do they not now? We have destroyed many of these people. We have killed the incentive and the initiative that they had. Where are we heading?
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us take the area of marine science. We have a greater area within our 200-mile limit than we have in our land area. What are we doing about research in that area? What do we know about the mangrove areas or the Great Barrier Reef? We have a magnificent research vessel, the Aurora Australis. It looks lovely tied up at the Hobart wharf. It would look a jolly sight better if we provided it with some fuel and let it go to sea. What about research generally? What do we know about the waters and the fish that are in the waters? Precious little. Why? These waters have a lot of very valuable material in them, but we do not do anything about it and we do not let anybody else do anything about it. We have this magnificent boat tied up at the Hobart wharf. When we read newspaper articles on the subject, we find that not one word of credit goes to the Government for what it has done. Every article that I have seen over the months is critical of the Government's performance in this area, and it is not suddenly going to come right unless somebody makes it come right.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is extraordinary that the Government believes that it can say to the CSIRO, `Go out and get 30 per cent of the money you need and get on with your research'. There are many areas of CSIRO research in which it is just not appropriate to try to raise that sort of money. There are other areas where, if it does raise the money, the money is tied, which reduces the amount of discretionary funds it has for other jobs, and it accordingly winds down on other research. Every tied job it gets reduces the funds available for other areas of research. It is so short-sighted; it is so absolutely stupid. I do not care whether it is the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) or the Prime Minister himself who says that has to be done; what is going on is absolutely stupid. Unless we start this generator we will never improve our position internationally, but it does not seem to matter to the Government that we are going down and down.

       I will briefly touch on the Antarctic. It has become clear in the course of the Estimates hearings and as a result of other committee hearings conducted at about the same time that all is not well with the operation of the Antarctic Division. One thing that is clearly not right is that it is in the wrong hands. Why the Antarctic Division should be in the hands of the Minister for odds and ends-for sport, recreation and whatever else-I do not know. It is clearly inappropriate. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) clearly has no interest in it. At one stage he was asked whether he had been to Kingston, south of Hobart. He said yes, he had. We knew very well that he had not, because the people down there were absolutely disgusted at the fact that, while he was trotting backwards and forwards to Tasmania once or twice a week, he had never been to the Antarctic base. Later, when we quizzed him on it a second time, he admitted that he had telephoned the base but he had not been there up to that point. Is it any wonder that morale is low when the Minister deliberately misleads the Senate by giving the wrong information?

       Let us get onto the question of sledges for the Antarctic. Why we have to build sledges in Germany when we can build the ship that is going to carry the sledges in Australia baffled even the Minister. We clearly need to work this one out. The stupidity of spending money on buying sledges made in Germany which were ordered nine months before they were needed and which, because of the weather conditions, still have not been delivered 14 months later, requires attention. It is a crazy business.
      </para>
      <para>
       We also have the question of the Lady Franklin. Due to bad management and bad planning, the Lady Franklin was sent to the Antarctic area at the beginning of October last year and, of course, could not get into the base, whereupon it turned around and came back. It was also discovered that some of the gear had been left on the Hobart wharf and it was then necessary to get the Air Force to parachute it onto Macquarie Island. This is the way this enterprise is run. This is Minister Richardson's bailiwick. Again I say that he has no interest in it. Morale is low as a result and management is less than adequate.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn to the matter of foreign fishing. We have been told that the main aim of the fishing service is to improve the Australianisation of foreign fishing in these external waters. After a number of questions during the Estimates hearings, we found that in spite of that, and in spite of trying to get Australians involved in one way or another, we had hived off considerable tonnages of the allocation that we were making and let them go to the Republic of China on a straight fee fishing basis. The Chinese paid $336,000 in access fees to fish the North West Shelf, and that was all. They take the fish, pay the money and go. That is not helping the Australian fishing industry one iota. We found in the cut-up of the tonnage that 2,850 tonnes were not allocated. Why they were originally gazetted as being available and then not allocated, I am not sure, except that subsequent correspondence says that they were being held for Australian fishermen.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact is that at that time a company was prepared to move in, to build considerable equipment in Australia, to replace its ships with ships built in Australia and to market either inside or outside Australia, whichever was decided. When we raised this during the Estimates hearings we were told that the Government had considered it but it was not appropriate. I have a letter which more or less confirms that in various words. I still cannot understand why this was so, and I am a long way from being satisfied as to why we get this sort of answer. Why should we sell our fish to some foreign country when we could establish a great Australian industry in Western Australia? I am sure that the Western Australian senators would like to know that too. It is another matter which I hope we will be able to deal with later on when we get to the committee stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that this Government's extraordinary priorities regarding the income producing areas of the nation as against the non-income producing areas require a lot more attention. I am disgusted at the way the priorities are worked out, and we will deal with that at a future time.

         —On Monday 15 May 1989 workers at Henderson's Spring Industries in Melbourne ended a 10-day strike. Much has been said about it. My remarks will be short. We live in hard economic times. There is need for restraint, for sacrifice, for altruism. Workers are asked for greater effort for the country's good. Given this, the strike was tagged as unwarranted. Four thousand vehicle builders were stood down, production was slowed and the economy was prejudiced.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Why did people at Henderson's strike? The reason is found in their work conditions. Last week two employees told me of their experiences with the company before the strike. One employee has worked at Henderson's for the last year. His shift is from 4 o'clock in the afternoon till after midnight and he arrives home each night at about 1.00 a.m. His domestic problems are great; he has a child needing extensive medical treatment; and his wife looks after the child and does not work. Before the strike he took home about $290 a week. This is hardly commensurate with the cost of basic living. Bills for rent, food, clothing, gas, electricity, transport, medication and toiletries mounted up to overwhelm his family. His problems still haunt him both at home and at work. There are very few other places to which he can afford to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        When he first worked with Henderson's there was overtime. That gave him a reasonable wage. He took home about $370 a week. About three months ago the company instituted a scheme to increase production. It did so. This reduced the need for overtime and his wage fell by $80 net a week. There was limited overtime available for a period following the increase in productivity. This was given to those favoured by management. Those not favoured found their pay slashed. Now overtime is available to a few key workers only.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other person I spoke to was one of the key workers. He does overtime. He works 9 1/2 hours a day six days a week and at times on Sunday. He must do so in poor conditions. Before the strike he earned $475 a week. He is a family man, he has a wife and two young children; his wife must look after the children and so cannot go out to work. Quite often she needs his help at home but she cannot get it because of the hours he works. This leads to tension and there is misery aplenty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Henderson's strike imposed costs on the country, on employer and on employee. This was an unhappy outcome which no-one welcomed. The forces driving the workers were great. Poor pay, bad conditions, long hours and troubled relations with management set the scene for their industrial action. To ignore these realities is to be unfair and foolhardy.

         Senator Cook

       <para in-line="1">
        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) On 1 June 1987, the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) provided a list of locations of single-purpose railways constructed within Australia in response to a request by John Holland Holdings. While the information may have been used by the company in preparation of a submission to the Sarawak government, the Australian government has not assisted the company in negotiations in the sense of making any representation to either the Malaysian or Sarawak government on the company's behalf.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I understand the proposed railway is to be used as a logging railway, as part of timber industry development in Sarawak, and the involvement proposed by the John Holland Company is in railway construction only.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I am not prepared to endorse the assumptions made by Senator Dunn concerning the effect of such developments with respect to the greenhouse effect and the climate of the region. Logging of tropical forests does not necessarily increase the greenhouse effect. New growth is a greater net consumer of carbon dioxide than climax forest. The key issue is land use practices after logging. Clearfelling and burning followed by conversion to agricultural land would most likely contribute to the greenhouse effect. However, I understand that control of the exploitation of timber resources is the responsibility of the Sarawak government, which states that logging is carried out under guidelines of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) aimed at sustainable long term yields.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) I am not aware of any substantive proposals to develop coal resources in Sarawak. There are significant coal project developments in the planning and implementation stage in Kalimantan, which is Indonesian Territory. The massive expansion in prospect in the Indonesian coal industry is primarily destined for domestic consumption and the surplus available for export is expected to be relatively small. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy's estimate of the amount available for export in 1995 is about 4 million tonnes a year. By definition, these will add to the future world supply of coal; whether this might be deemed an oversupply will depend on demand conditions at the time. Studies the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has undertaken forecast continuing growth in world demand for steaming coal over the next decade.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Coal from these sources may compete with Australian production. Projections of international and regional demand by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy indicate that there is an opportunity for the Australian coal industry to share in future demand growth. Whether these opportunities are realised will depend on the industry's competitiveness with production from new producers and incremental production from existing producers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) I am aware that the population of Sarawak includes a number of distinct tribal groupings. I am also aware that some of these peoples, particularly the Penan, continue to lead a nomadic existence and that it appears the long term policies of the Malaysian Federal and State Governments are for their integration into the broader Malaysian population. Officers of our High Commission in Kuala Lumpur have discussed these issues with relevant State and Federal authorities in the context of the Australian Government's strong support for the observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights. The Government is continuing to monitor these issues closely.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) See answer to question (6).
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) I received 6 written representations in 1988 suggesting Australia should ban imports of products from tropical forests. All have been answered. I have received no written representations on the specific issues raised by Senator Dunn.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Australia imports timber and timber products from Malaysia. Details of whether these are sourced from Sarawak are not available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Firstly, it is not possible to identify products from logs sourced from Sarawak. Secondly, Australia acceded in February 1988 to the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) developed under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). ITTA provides a framework for co-operation and consultation between tropical timber producing and consuming countries. It seeks to promote the development of the tropical timber market, to improve forest management, and to encourage further processing in producing countries. At the same time it encourages the development of national policies aimed at sustainable utilisation of tropical forests, conservation of their genetic resources and maintenance of the ecological balance in the regions concerned. I would also draw Senator Dunn's attention to my announcement of 27 April 1989 that I will be convening shortly a meeting at which Trade Union, Conservation, Timber Industry and State Government representatives could discuss constructive Australian initiatives towards solving the problems caused by deforestation in tropical countries. One idea I have in mind is to raise the question of standards for sustainable management practices and environmental protection in tropical forestry at the next meeting of the International Tropical Timber Organisation in late May.
      </para>
      <para>
       Against this background, I will not give an assurance of the impractical and inappropriate kind sought by Senator Dunn.

      <para>
       (1) The Australian Government policy is that it does not intervene in the judicial processes of other countries. The Honourable Member may wish to refer to the Ministerial Statement of 27 April 1988 in the House of Representatives on Australia's consular role. This did not however prevent the Australian Embassy, in the course of normal consular duties, maintaining close contact with the Indonesian authorities from the time we first learnt about the incident. Mr and Mrs Blenkinsop, in accordance with normal consular procedures were provided with a list of lawyers based in Jakarta in the event that they wished to seek legal advice and support.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As stated in (1), the Government does not intervene in the judicial processes of other countries. Nevertheless, during the pre-trial period, and in addition to the regular Embassy contact with the Indonesian authorities already referred to, the matter was raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, during his discussions with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Alatas, in October.

      <para>
       (4) An officer of the Australian Embassy, fluent in Indonesian, was present at all sessions of the trial which took place over 20-23 February in a military court at Biak. The trial was open to the media. The Embassy's presence at the trial was to satisfy the Government that due processes of Indonesian law were followed. The Prime Minister indicated that he was satisfied that on all the advice we have received, the trial was conducted in accordance with Indonesian legal processes. He said that while he could understand some feeling on the part of the Blenkinsop family about the length of the sentences, Australia was not in a position to tell other countries how to run their judicial processes.

      <para>
       (1) The first column of the following Table A, based on information provided by the Attorney-General's Department, sets out Acts passed by the Federal Parliament since the beginning of 1983 which have expressly implemented the specific international conventions, treaties and agreements (hereafter ``treaties'') listed against them in the second column which has not previously been implemented in Australian law and which required legislation for implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Table B sets out all 183 treaties signed by Australia between the beginning of 1983 and April 1989. All except those 33 marked with an asterisk have entered into force for Australia. Those 16 marked with the letter (A) also appear in Table A as having been implemented expressly by Federal legislation. (See further the answer to question 3.)
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Particular treaties signed since the beginning of 1983 may not have been implemented by Acts of Parliament for the following reasons:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Not all treaties need to be implemented by Acts of Parliament as existing laws, federal and State, usually enables effect to be given to the obligations set out in a treaty. It has been the consistent practice of successive federal Governments that Australia never binds itself to a treaty by bringing it into force until existing law (whether Commonwealth or State) enables effect to be given to obligations created by the treaty. Some treaties are given effect by federal regulations, for example, by providing that an existing Act applies in relation to a country with which a treaty has been concluded.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Some of the 33 treaties in Table B which have not entered into force for Australia have been signed subject to ratification or require some other subsequent step by Australia before they enter into force. In such cases, implementing legislation may still have to be introduced or the Government may still be considering whether to ratify.
      </para>

While some of the media representatives visited Australia to report specifically on agricultural trade issues, the majority covered other topics.

       (1) With reference to a press conference given by the President of the Democratic Kampuchea Party, Mr Khieu Samphan, which was reported in the Financial Review on 23 February 1989 and in view of the mass murders in that unfortunate country between 1975 and 1979 under the stewardship of the notorious Pol Pot, what is the Australian Government's attitude toward the Khmer Rouge.

       (2) As a result of the Government's decision, in January 1988, to abandon the recognition of governments, the question of ``recognising'' the Khmer Rouge does not arise.

       (3) The emergence at the end of the settlement process of a Khmer Rouge-dominated government in Cambodia is most unlikely. Indeed, such an outcome has been specifically ruled out by the Khmer Rouge's main supporter, China. It would not be acceptable to the Cambodian people, to Australia and to world opinion generally.

      <para>
       (1) The Constitutional power to enter into treaties is one that belongs to the Governor General in Council. The Commonwealth Parliament, in consequence, has no formal function to exercise by way of review or oversight of international conventions, treaties and agreements which the Federal Government is considering signing.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Successive Australian Governments have observed the practice of bringing all treaties to the attention of Parliament. The practice has been to table treaties in both Houses. This is done at most sessions in batches (tablings took place in April and November 1988) and often individually in the case of particularly important treaties about which statements may also be made to Parliament. Where a treaty enters into force by a step subsequent to signature, every effort is made to table the treaty before that step is taken in order to give Parliament the opportunity to express its view on the treaty. Additionally, Parliament is able to consider its attitude to many treaties when that is necessary for other parliamentary functions, such as appropriating moneys for Commonwealth purposes or enacting legislation to give effect to a treaty. This opportunity arises because it has been the consistent practice of Australian Governments that Australia never binds itself to a treaty unless existing law, state or federal, enables effect to be given to the obligations set out in the treaty. It follows that although Parliament has no formal role in reviewing and oversighting treaty action, there exist a number of avenues through which the Parliament is informed of all treaties which the Government has signed and in respect to which the Parliament may express a view on individual treaties.

       (2) The ACS maintains records detailing the States where drugs are seized and when available, the embarkation point of the drugs and the country where those drugs originated. The data available is dependent on information gathered at the time of seizure and after the arrest of offenders. Australian Customs Service major seizures (i.e. those of 1 kilogram and above) for the periods outlined above and the results are listed below.

       (4) The Government does not consider that staffing levels at air and seaports are inadequate to control drug smuggling. The Australian Customs Service (ACS) within the limits of budgetary requirements has deployed its staff with particular emphasis on targetting critical areas. The redeployment of some staff has been made possible by implementing changes in work practices, adopting new technology and generally improving operating procedures.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Yes. There is continual upgrading of Customs systems and procedures and improvement in the training of officers. This, in conjunction with the increased co-operation and intelligence sharing with other enforcement agencies, aims to result in the ACS being even more effective in areas of drug surveillance. Examples of specific measures follow.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ACS has introduced Contraband Enforcement Teams-mobile Customs teams used to detect unlawful activity, in particular narcotics-related offences. Officers concentrate on high risk areas, ships and cargo instead of being constrained by routine processing work.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ACS is developing an automated cargo system for officers to risk rate imported cargo, improve cargo flow and simplify accounting. This is in line with the management strategy to develop and apply risk assessment techniques with a view to cost effective deployment of resources while maintaining an appropriate level of protection for the Australian community against the importation of narcotics.

       (1) With respect to an article in the Melbourne Age of 17 March 1989 stating that the Federal Government's plans to reorganise its defence operations under a corporation `have stalled' following a breakdown in negotiations with unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) over award conditions, will the newly created Australian Defence Industries Corporation be bound to agree to the commitment apparently given by the Government to the ACTU in 1988 to support the spread of industry-base superannuation.

       (1) Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd is a Government owned company which has been established to take over the operations of the Government's defence production facilities. As a separate legal entity from the Commonwealth it will not be bound by the superannuation commitments of the Australian Public Service.

       The Company has approval to establish its own superannuation scheme and, subject to approval by the Minister for Finance, will be free to seek a cost effective scheme which will attract a suitable workforce. As a large manufacturing organisation it is reasonable to expect that the Company will consider appropriate industry based schemes.

       (3) The production facilities taken over by Australian Defence Industries were in constant contact with the team organising the transition to the Company. The factories were advised on 15 March 1989 of the intention to formally transfer the organisation on 1 May 1989. In the event the transfer was set to take effect from 3 May 1989.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Attached are the statistical data for the export of canned dog and cat food by country of destination and State of origin. The data relate to the financial years 1984-85, 1985-86, 1986-87 and calendar years 1987 and 1988 (the Australian Bureau of Statistics having changed its statistical reporting systems at the end of 1987).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Canned dog and cat food is mainly produced using by-products of animals slaughtered for human consumption, i.e. principally cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Pet food includes trimmings, offal and other meat suitable for animal food. I am advised that members of the Pet Food Manufacturers' Association of Australia Inc., who represented 95% of the industry, have a declared policy of not using horse, kangaroo or whale meat in their processed products. As animals may not be specifically slaughtered for manufacture of these products it has not been possible to assemble the specific information requested.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) With respect to exports of canned pet food, see answer to question 2. No information is available on the numbers of animals slaughtered in Victoria in 1988 specifically for the export pet food trade.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Pet Food Manufacturers' Association of Australia Inc. has advised that the major exporters of canned dog and cat food are Uncle Bens Australia and AJ Bush Pty Ltd.

       No specific 008 number is provided for Gold Coast residents to make general inquiries or to contact Departmental officers in Brisbane. The Department's operation is structured so that general and individual inquiries can be directed to the local Regional Office at Southport or Burleigh Heads. All residents within the areas serviced by these Regional Offices are within a local call boundary.

       From time to time the Department operates 008 numbers for Social Security initiatives. These numbers generally operate when there are major policy changes such as in the Budget or April/May Statements.
