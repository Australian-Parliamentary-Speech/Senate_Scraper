       Violent Television Programs

      <para>
       We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.

       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.

       Health Insurance Costs

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.

      <para>
       The statement read as follows-
      </para>
      <para>
       The cost of legal services is already an issue, and it is becoming a bigger one. There is presently legislation before the Victorian Parliament providing that where the matter in dispute involves $5000 or less, the litigants are not entitled to costs. In recent times there have been moves towards conciliators and arbitrators rather than courts to resolve disputes. These processes are seen as cheaper than the traditional ones. Besides concern about the cost of litigation there has been much debate about the cost of non-litigious legal services such as conveyancing. Lawyers say that their overheads are high.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been much criticism of lawyers because of the expense of legal services. It would be counter-productive of this Committee to join in a witchhunt. The Committee believes that most lawyers, like other professional groups, are genuinely hard working persons. For this reason, the Committee will be looking at lawyers' fees and charges not in isolation but in the context of the overheads involved in running their practices. In examining the overall cost of legal services, the Committee wants to consider aspects of lawyers' professional practice to gauge whether they have an effect on the cost of legal services and litigation in Australia today. Some such aspects include, for example, the two counsel rule or the split nature of the profession in some States.
      </para>
      <para>
       Beyond the costs associated directly with lawyers, other factors may contribute to the cost of obtaining justice in Australia. Such factors include the listing arrangements in courts, the monetary jurisdictional limits of the courts, the awarding of costs, and legal representation in small claims jurisdictions or before certain tribunals, for example.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee will be asking whether there are ways of streamlining court procedures so as to reduce the costs of those procedures. It will examine, for example, whether measures such as longer sitting hours, grouped proceedings, contingency fees, or increased incentives for people to try alternative, informal, means of resolving disputes may be practical.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee also wants to look at the factors that affect the cost of non-litigious legal work-for example, should conveyancing, or the incorporation of companies, be the exclusive province of lawyers?
      </para>

       One of the concerns the Committee has in undertaking an inquiry such as this is that the community's reasonable expectations of obtaining justice should not be unduly compromised. As far as the Committee is concerned, there is a balance to be achieved between an acceptable level of justice and an acceptable cost to individuals and to the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another concern of the Committee in this inquiry will be the availability and targeting of legal aid. Again there is a balance to be achieved between the provision of reasonable services to the community and reasonable costs being borne by the Australian taxpayer.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to remove discrimination against public servants standing for election to federal Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under section 44 (iv) of the Constitution, any person who holds any office of profit under the Crown is incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or member of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is interpreted as meaning that public servants must resign or take unpaid leave of absence from their jobs before they can nominate as a candidate for election to either House of federal Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of the validity of this interpretation of the Constitution has, of course, been raised many times in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bills have been introduced on this topic, but came to nothing. In February 1980, Australian Democrats' Senator Mason raised the question, requesting that the then Government re-examine Public Service General Order 3/D/4 which stated that a member of the public service must resign before nomination for election to a House of federal Parliament. As a result of this motion, the question was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, who reported in 1981 that Commonwealth and State public servants do not have equal rights with other citizens to seek election to the Commonwealth Parliament. The Committee concluded that two important principles should be upheld:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(a) to ensure that a member or senator is not simultaneously a member of the Commonwealth Parliament and a Commonwealth public servant and in receipt of two salaries as a result; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) to ensure that Commonwealth public servants are not effectively discouraged from standing for the Commonwealth Parliament.''
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommended that ``a simple but effective solution lies in taking as the crucial date the date at which a person elected to Parliament becomes entitled to a parliamentary allowance and providing for the resignation of a public service candidate, who is elected, to be effective from that date. If the Constitution is amended to provide that a person who holds what is presently termed an `office of profit' is to be deemed to have vacated that office at the date that he or she becomes entitled to payment of a parliamentary allowance, these two principles will be satisfied.''
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1985, former Senator Colin Mason had this Bill drafted to put that recommendation into effect. The Bill lapsed with his retirement from Parliament, and in the interests of public servants I now restore it to the notice paper, in the hope that it will finally be acted upon.
       </para>
       <para>
        The view that public servants must resign before nomination has, of course, been modified, so they are now required only to take leave without pay. The prospect of at least four weeks with no income whatsoever is, however, a daunting one for the most hardy among us, and for someone with the responsibility of paying rent or a mortgage, and buying food, it provides a hefty barrier to nomination for election to federal Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will remember the case of Mr Bill Woods, who was refused re-employment after contesting the Queensland seat of Leichhardt in 1977, on the specific instructions of the then Queensland Premier. Under the present ruling this situation could not occur. However, this can change at any time, and under the existing, often-disputed wording of this section of the Constitution, resignation from the public service could again become a necessary precursor to nomination for election to the federal Parliament. Resignation may carry with it, of course, adverse effects on superannuation benefits and credit loan interest rates, and may even affect housing and, as in Mr Woods' case, jeopardise future employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not good enough that the rights of all Australians in the public service are limited so unjustly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The right to stand for Parliament is a most important and cherished right. We must protect it by all possible means.

        One of the most important is to be found in this Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        In moving that the Bill be read a second time I ask the Parliament to endorse four historic commitments. This Bill would establish:
       </para>
       <para>
        a secure fair deal for families with children;
       </para>
       <para>
        a guarantee of adequate standards of income for children;
       </para>
       <para>
        for the first time maintenance of the real value of family payments;
       </para>
       <para>
        indexation of pensions and benefits at the earliest possible date.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1966, the Arbitration Commission did away with the basic wage. From that time on Australia has not had a wages system that takes account of the costs of children. From that time fair income distribution has been a function exclusively for the tax and social security systems. Since then the social security system has been required to make sure working families have adequate income to care for all children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia owes much to Professor Ronald Henderson for his clear articulation, as early as 1970, that the 1966 moves in the wages system would compel attention in public policy. He spelt out that we would have to address through tax and social security policy the issues of equity between families with and without children and the adequacy of incomes for all families with children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report of the commission of inquiry into poverty highlighted what issues had to be addressed. The work of that commission led to the Whitlam government converting deductions for children into tax rebates and to the Fraser government's cashing out the rebates to family allowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the benefit of hindsight we can see that those moves were not sustained. The issues of fairness of the tax treatment of families and adequacy of family income, having been addressed by Henderson were not further addressed for some years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not until the social security review were the issues thought through. The issues addressed by the review include:
       </para>
       <para>
        first the balance between horizontal equity measures-like family allowance-and vertical equity measures-like family allowance supplement and additional pension/benefit;
       </para>
       <para>
        second the make-up of families and the importance of adequate provision for all family types-couples with one and two incomes, sole parents, families with pre-school age children, school children and teenagers, families with children with disabilities;
       </para>
       <para>
        third, to which family member should particular payments go; and
       </para>
       <para>
        fourth, standards of adequacy for families with inadequate incomes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Professor Cass's issues Paper No. 1 of the Social Security Review, Income Support for Families with Children is the first comprehensive analysis of the detailed policies required to build a fair, secure policy that deals with the issues identified by Henderson 20 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cass identified short-term measures which were demanded by the appalling extent of poverty among families with children. Over the last two years those recommendations have been progressively implemented through the families package: family allowance supplement was introduced, payable to the mother; child disability allowance was introduced, differential rates of payment for younger and older children have been introduced; massive increases in payments per child have occurred; family allowance supplement and family allowance have been integrated into a single payment.
       </para>
       <para>
        With this Bill we move the short term to the long term recommendations of Professor Cass-addressing the more fundamental issue of horizontal equity and sustaining the system into the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill proposes the biggest increases in family allowance in history.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1976 when tax rebates for children were cashed out by the Fraser Government assistance for working families was cut-from $4.50 per week for the first child to $3.50. This was done by converting the tax rebate for the first child of $200 a year into an increase of $3 a week in family allowance to a total of $3.50.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1982, the Fraser Government gave its first and only family allowance increase-of $1.75 a week to $5.25, a net increase in assistance for the first child of 75 cents a week in 7 years. With this Bill I ask for Parliament's endorsement of a rise of $3.75 a week to $9-an increase of 71% for the first child in every family.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill would massively simplify the family allowance system. The current system of four rates of allowance will be replaced with two rates: $9 a week for the first, second and third child and $12 a week for fourth and subsequent children and for children in institutions. This new simple structure accords with proposals of the Social Security Review-a basic family allowance at a flat rate, with special recognition for larger families.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increase to family allowance would directly benefit almost 2 million families with 3.8 million children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The family allowance system to be implemented by this Bill is simple, fair and sustainable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill would index all family allowance payments in line with movements in the CPI. This fair deal for families will not be eroded by inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fair deal for Australian families in this Bill is complemented by the major rises in, and annual indexation of, the dependent spouse rebate and sole parent rebate announced by the Treasurer in the April Tax Statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In our policy commitments at the last election we promised that `during Labor's third term adequate living standards for children will be achieved by:
       </para>
       <para>
        raising child payments to ensure that total assistance per child moves from its current level of 11 per cent to at least 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension; and
       </para>
       <para>
        Ensuring that the aggregate payments for older children attain a benchmark of 20 per cent of the combined married rate.''
       </para>
       <para>
        With this Bill this Labor Government delivers on that promise.
       </para>
       <para>
        That promise was made because of our firm belief that the greatest scourge facing our nation is child poverty, that we must put an end to that, and that there is only one way to do that: to guarantee adequate income for all children.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill delivers on our promise-putting behind us the scandal of child poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The levels of child payments set by this Bill are consistent with Australian research on the income needs of families with children. For the first time in Australian history a government has set a standard for child payments that is adequate and will be maintained in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        Professor Henderson in the Commission of inquiry into poverty recommended payments equivalent to 12%, 15% and 18% of the payments for a married couple respectively for first, second and third children. The package we have announced tonight of 15% of married rate pension for each younger child and 20% for 13 to 15 year olds goes beyond the Poverty Commission's work-providing for the first time in history a guaranteed income for families at a higher real level than recommended by the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the basis of the social security review's work Labor made its commitment to benchmarks for child payments-a commitment to establish enduring relativities between families with children and people without children.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the first time in Australia we have a policy based on what it costs to raise children-rather than on what happens to be available in the Budget process.
       </para>
       <para>
        That policy that recognises the costs of children has built in what every parent of teenagers knows, and all the research shows: teenagers cost more. In just 18 months we have introduced and won universal acceptance for a higher rate for teenage children.
       </para>
       <para>
        These policies are complemented by the common allowance structure for youth incomes. We have put in place income support of 15% of married rate pension for children up to 12, 20% for 13 to 15 year olds and 25% for 16 and 17 year olds.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill would implement the guaranteed standards of adequacy from 1 July this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Building on Henderson's work the social security review examined in detail 30 separate studies of equivalence scales-of the relativities of income needs or expenditure patterns between different family types and sizes.
       </para>
       <para>
        For younger children family allowance of $9 a week plus family allowance supplement of $24 a week will be payable-a total of $33 a week per child. For 13 to 15 year olds the increases in family allowance will be added to by a $3.10 increase in family allowance supplement providing a combined payment of $43.10 per week per child-in comparison to the $15.25 available when we came to government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reaching those standards means massive real increases in payments for 1.1 million children in low income families. The level of those payments line up with Australian research on income needs of families. The days of policy based on anecdote, of increases based on what is left over at the end of the budget process are behind us. Policy is now based on explicit standards that are available for rigorous scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third commitment I ask of the Parliament is indexation of family payments and maintenance of the standards of adequacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a nation we like to think of ourselves as placing our children first.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until this Bill the actions of this Parliament have not placed our children first. We have fully indexed payments for adults-offering them some security and protection from the ravages of inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before this Bill no Government had ever committed itself to maintenance of payments to families with children in real terms. This Labor Government has now done so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill seeks to index family payments: family allowance, mothers/guardians allowance, child disability allowance, multiple birth payment and double orphans pensions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first indexation increase will be on the first payday in 1990. Family allowance will be adjusted in line with the increase in the CPI between December 1988 and the June quarter this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        After that family allowance will be indexed annually with effect from the first payday each calendar year in line with movements in the CPI in the preceding financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mothers/guardians allowance, child disability allowance, multiple birth payment and double orphans pension will each be indexed on the first payday in 1990 and each year after that. Increases will be in line with CPI movements in the preceding financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already referred to the real declines in tax and family allowance provisions for families with children under the previous government. All families suffered in that period because payments and rebates were not adjusted for inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        For low income families the absence of that adjustment was devastating-800,000 children were forced into poverty. Payments for children in low income families were increased in nominal terms only once in 7 years from $7.50 to $10.00-a real decline of 35%. Under Labor those payments have been increased every year-in 1983 from $10 to $12; in 1984 from $12 to $14; in 1985 from $14 to $16; in 1986 from $16 to $17; in 1987 from $17 to $22 for younger children and $28 for older children; in 1988 from $22 to $24 for younger children and $28 to $31 for older children.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill proposes a further increase for older children in 1989 from $31 to $34.10 and historic rises in family allowance for all children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill would guarantee these gains would not be eroded by inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        On top of family allowance indexation, family allowance supplement, additional pension and additional benefit will be adjusted from the first payday each calendar year.
       </para>
       <para>
        This adjustment will increase rates of FAS and additional pension/benefit whenever necessary to maintain the standards of adequacy. Total payments for children in low income families would be guaranteed as a percentage of married rate pension-which is automatically indexed in line with the CPI.
       </para>
       <para>
        The standards of living of low income families with children will never again be subject to decimation through policy indolence and lethargy of governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        All members of this Parliament are asked to step beyond attitudes and to commit themselves to a solid policy-of a secure and fair deal for families.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the last year we have had vigorous debate in Australia on the appropriate levels and type of provision for families with children. That debate is central to any concern about fairness and equity in our community.
       </para>
       <para>
        To quote Professor Cass:
       </para>
       <para>
        in a period of restraint on public expenditure it is essential to address the matter of immediate priorities for family assistance. This focusses attention on those approaches which provide greater assistance to low income families by improving adequacy of income-tested payments for pensioners, beneficiaries and low income working families and introducing measures which minimise work disincentives and support the transition to employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        There she described in 1986 the processes the Government has implemented in the last two years. She went on:
       </para>
       <para>
        proposals for reform based on the principle of horizontal equity have the long-term objective of improving and maintaining the disposable incomes of families with children relative to individuals and couples without children . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The value at which family allowances might be set is obviously contentious, with the terms of debate set within the outer limits of appropriate assistance with the costs of children on the one hand, and the capacity of government revenue and the willingness of the political process to redistribute to families, on the other hand.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill together with the Treasurer's announced increases and indexation of family taxation rebates delivers a fair, sustainable deal for all families with a guarantee of adequate income for all families with children. There is a balance involved-a balance that until this Bill Australian public policy has addressed for 20 years in an ad hoc way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The balance we have struck provides a fair distribution of income; and provides a guarantee of income for every family which is adequate for them to share fully in the life of our community. It accords with the very essence of social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sustainable, equitable social reform is never easy, never quick. This package is a fair sustainable deal for families. Professor Henderson indicated the need for it 20 years ago. Professor Cass did the detailed work on how to do it and spelt out the process to achieve it. With this Bill, we propose to deliver it.

        We will deliver for all children-whether they live in one or two parent families, whether one, two or no parents work, or whether they live in institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just as in family policy we have known of the issues for many years; just as we needed the social security review to look at the detail and work through the detailed processes, so we are entering upon a detailed review of retirement income.
       </para>
       <para>
        In October 1988 the social security review released issues paper Number 6, Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following release of that paper, the Government initiated an extensive series of community consultations on retirement income policies. The Prime Minister's task force on retirement income has travelled to all States to meet with, and listen to, several thousand pensioners and retired people at some forty separate meetings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Council of Social Service, in conjunction with the Australian Pensioners Federation, has also undertaken an extensive consultation process to obtain the views of pensioners and the community welfare sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has been consulting State governments, trade unions, business, the superannuation industry and relevant national organisations, as well as considering the many written submissions received in response to the social security review issues paper.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the April Tax Statement we announced two measures that were both recommended by the Social Security Review, the Prime Minister's Task Force on Retirement Income, consultations and submissions received by the Government. These initiatives form part of a phased reform of retirement income to improve adequacy, fairness, security and sustainability.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to recommendations from the Social Security Review and from the subsequent consultations, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs recommended that the Government should reduce the lag between the release of the CPI figures and the indexation of pension payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has therefore decided to bring forward pension indexation increases in three stages. Each stage will bring the indexation increase forward by four weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill would provide for indexation dates to be 15 November 1989, 18 April 1990, and then each September and March.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indexation dates would be brought forward in total by 12 weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consultations on retirement income have also shown quite clearly that the differing free areas for tax and social security confuse many age pensioners. The Government has therefore decided to ensure that the income test free area will become 100 per cent tax free. This will be achieved by setting the pensioner tax rebate at an appropriate level.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer's announcement that the pension free area is to become tax free is a major reform. No previous Government has ever committed itself to a standard for the amount of non-pension income that pensioners can receive without paying tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        This announcement together with the changes to indexation dates are a clear statement of the Government's direction in retirement income policy. They will enable people contemplating retirement to plan for their future with the security that their real levels of total income will be protected.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1989-90 a single pensioner will be able to receive $25 per week on top of the maximum rate of pension without having to pay tax. In 1990-91 this amount will be increased to $40 so that the income test free area is totally tax free.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1989-90 married couples will be able to receive $35 per week each tax free. This means that married couples will be able to receive 100% of their pension income test free area without paying any tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's decision will also mean an extra 75,000 pensioners will not pay provisional tax. This is because all pensioners receiving the pensioner tax rebate are exempted from paying provisional tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has repaired the damage done by the previous government-by repairing the income security safety net, by protecting the safety net from inflation through indexation and automatic adjustment and by restoring employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last month unemployment benefit numbers fell to less than 400,000-the lowest figure since 1982. Unfortunately those who have been unemployed longest are finding it hardest to take advantage of employment growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Newstart offers a leg up to those people-to end their scarring and exclusion. It is available to long term beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        With effect from 1 February this year Newstart has been extended to the spouses of long term beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill would extend employment entry payment to those spouses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also seeks to correct an anomaly affecting the payment of child disability allowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the current legislation, in some cases child disability allowance may not be payable where a father is caring for a disabled child. The Bill would make it clear that the family is entitled to the child disability allowance regardless of which parent actually cares for the child.
       </para>
       <para>
        Experience with the operation of the savings provision introduced with the maintenance income test in June last year has shown the need for refinements in three areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, the Government has decided to restore and backdate fully indexation increases to people in the saved category who are receiving spousal main- tenance only and have no dependent children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, income payments received in arrears would be excluded from the definition of `total income' so that people who receive late what they are entitled to all along maintain the benefit of the savings provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, the Bill would close a loophole in the maintenance income test savings provision by ensuring that the previous level of benefit is `saved' only to the extent that the client continues to meet the basic eligibility criteria for the payment. It is being made clear, for example, that if a child ceases to be a dependant for the purpose of the payment of additional benefit, then that component of the entitlement ceases.
       </para>
       <para>
        Entitlement to a one off double payment of benefit to ex-prisoners will be extended to former long-term beneficiaries who reclaim unemployment benefit on release from prison within three months of last receiving unemployment benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill refines rules governing the portability of Australian pensions overseas. This refinement is necessary for the effective negotiation and operation of our reciprocal social security agreements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Broadly speaking, the rate of pension currently paid overseas after 12 months' absence is based on the proportion of a person's working life spent resident in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        To date, each agreement has contained this rule within its own text. However, future agreements will apply the rule by reference to our domestic social security legislation. It is necessary therefore, to set down this mechanism in the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill would increase penalties for the unauthorised disclosure of client information.
       </para>
       <para>
        The penalties currently provided by the Act on summary conviction for unlawful disclosure are up to six months' imprisonment or a $1,000 fine. On indictment, an offender can face a gaol term of up to two years or a fine of up to $5,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill would raise the fines for breaches of the secrecy provisions contained in the social security act to $3,000 on summary conviction and $12,000 on indictment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the last 3 years we have redesigned and rebuilt the system of income support for families with children.
       </para>
       <para>
        That has involved major changes in the approaches required of the staff in the 220 regional offices, the area and state offices of the department of social security. I place on record the Government's appreciation for the diligence, competence and commitment of all those people who have been charged with delivering those changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those changes have been designed by a large number of dedicated professionals in each of the divisions of the central office of the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regardless of our political differences, I am sure all senators have seen the changes in social security in the last 3 years and will join with me in congratulating and thanking the secretary and his staff.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also wish to place on record the Minister's appreciation for the work of Professor Cass as head of the social security review and the many people who have worked for that review. It is their detailed work which has made the package included in this Bill possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        â€”I wish to make a point prior to the debate on the first amendment. Technically, it is on the first clause of the first Bill. The Opposition is unhappy with the way this matter is being handled. Colleagues of mine who have an interest in corporate law and in securities law are distressed at the fact that they have been given inadequate time to consider the Government amendments, which were circulated only on Monday of this week. My colleagues have had inadequate time also to consider the amendments of the Australian Democrats, which were received only yesterday, and the explanatory memoranda, which are important in assisting with the large volume of amendments. I stress that we are not looking simply at a handful of changes. The changes, of which there are some 30 pages, are very significant, and they have only just been distributed in this chamber. It is therefore the Opposition's view that Committee should not be considering these amendments today but that the Parliament, and the Senate in particular, should be given reasonable time not only to read them but also to analyse them and their consequences.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As I indicated to the Minister a few moments ago, there are a number of business and commercial organisations within our community which have contacted my colleagues and expressed their wish to comment upon various amendments. The time being allowed by the Government makes that absolutely impossible. We are looking at a package of Bills that has been some years in the making. The Government made 280 of its own amendments in the House of Representatives, which amendments were not properly debated. Now that the Bills are in this chamber we have been presented with 30 more pages of Government amendments on two days notice following a Government response to the Senate Select Committee which was put out by the Government only last Friday. On the Opposition side of the chamber we are at a loss to understand the rush at this stage after the Government has taken so long to reach this stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       We believe in orderly processing of legislation and amendments. We believe that our colleagues who have an interest in this area should have reasonable time to analyse the changes that the Government is proposing and the Government's response to the Joint Select Committee. That is simply not being permitted by this time frame. I accept that the Government, Senator Bolkus, Senator Macklin and those who have been intimately involved through the Joint Select Committee procedure have a special knowledge and perhaps for them there is not the same time necessity in order to take in new matters of this nature. But this chamber is not simply made up of those who were involved in that process of the Joint Select Committee. It is not simply made up of those who have been principally involved in the negotiation of what might be described as a settlement: Senator Macklin on the one hand and Senator Bolkus on the other. I do not mean that with any disrespect. That is fine as far as they are concerned. But I stress on behalf of the Opposition that there are other honourable senators with an interest in this area who are not being afforded the opportunity within this time frame to meet their responsibilities properly. We therefore suggested to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that this matter be delayed a few more days in order that it might be properly processed by the Opposition. I understand that the Government and the Australian Democrats are not prepared to meet that very reasonable request.

        â€”We could have someone ready at short notice. The matter is complex. As I said yesterday, the corporations legislation is the largest package of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament. We are looking at 16 separate Bills, literally thousands of pages of legislation and hundreds of amendments that have been introduced by the Government in the other place and we now have more Government amendments in this place. I accept that we have contributed with a series of amendments that I have prepared to try to pick up matters which the Joint Select Committee recommended but which were not adopted by the Government and we think should be adopted.

       There are important questions of principle, particularly relating to the future role of this Parliament in the process, in particular the role of the Parliament through a committee procedure to oversee the whole of this corporate legislative package. It will be the first time that the Parliament has had that opportunity. As yet there are questions to be settled as to the powers to be afforded to that parliamentary committee. It is our view that the powers should not be as restrictive as those included in the amendments we have seen to date. We have the Clerks assisting us at the moment in redrafting some of those amendments in a way that we believe will be in the better interests of this nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is unsatisfactory to have to do it on the run at this last stage. We are confronted with major restructuring of the whole of the corporations and securities law within this nation. There is no urgency that requires that the matter be dealt with today and that the Parliament not be allowed a few days to analyse properly the amendments that are to be brought down en masse by the Government and by other parties who have an interest in this particular debate. On the first clause I want to express that protest on behalf of the Opposition parties in the strongest possible terms.

The Opposition requested that we put off the debate. We also had it scheduled for Tuesday. We put it off again. Our difficulty in this matter is that some other legislation has also been put off, which means that our more vital legislation that has a high priority cannot generally be considered. We have been using the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill as a filler although we do not believe that Bill will get to the committee stage or be put through because it has very low priority in the hundred or so Bills that are before the chamber.

       Senator Hill says that he needs more time. I would have thought the most appropriate way to go through the Bill-the honourable senator has enough nous to realise it-is that, where the amendments are so particularly complex that Senator Hill and others do not understand them, we proceed on and beyond those amendments.
      </para>
      <para>
       We can get a degree of the committee stage completed here today; when we get to an impasse, to a point at which the Opposition can justifiably claim that the legislation is too complex, we can proceed on to other legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think we should make a start on this today. If it gets to a point during the day where it is impossible to proceed-this requires some good faith-we can then go on to the wheat marketing legislation at the second reading stage. I am sure everyone has those speeches written because we have heard them being rehearsed for weeks and weeks. I suggest that that is a better course of action rather than just intervening at this stage and saying, `We'll whack in wheat marketing'. Why do we not proceed to the committee stage of the corporations legislation and, if there are problem clauses, we can adjourn consideration and give the Opposition more time? If we get to a stage where there is nothing left to do, then we will go on to the wheat marketing legislation.

We have sought to avoid that by expediting its consideration through a joint select committee. We are narrowing the potential for argument and debate by these various means. In actual fact, there was only half an hour of the second reading debate left yesterday. We now get to the complicated part of the committee stage of this Bill.

Of course my particular interest is for the Opposition senators who have not had reasonable time to consider these matters in detail and who, in view of some pressure from their constituencies, are seeking that time. The Government can assume at least in my case, that if we have that extra degree of cooperation I will do everything in my power to expedite the final consideration of the package.

My amendment, which seeks to leave out `securities markets and futures markets' and insert `companies, and of the securities markets and futures markets', relates to clause 3 (2). The reason I am seeking to insert those words is that the Government has an amendment to insert the words `about corporations' in regard to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee.

I cannot imagine that this is an item of great contention at law. The drafting would be somewhat more elegant if we had the same resonance in the phrases used throughout clause 3. At a later stage, presumably, we will deal with the Government's amendment with regard to corporations and the Advisory Committee. On that basis I move:

        â€”There are a number of matters I wish to raise with the Minister concerning transition. The Minister will be aware that the Committee itself expressed concern about the lack of transitional provisions. There is no doubt that the Government, despite its massive legislative package in this area, has not brought down a comprehensive transitional Bill which will allow for clear and unambiguous transition from the existing cooperative scheme to the Government's new proposed national scheme. There are specific and isolated instances within the legislative package that deal with particular matters. In response to the Committee's concern expressed generally as to the lack of appropriate transitional arrangements, the Government has simply referred to a few of the specific examples in which transitional provisions are included.

       Mr Chairman, there remain a number of important matters which should be teased out of the Minister in this area because, not surprisingly, the consequences of the transition can be vitally important to those who practise within this field, in fact, to all commerce and business in this country. The first matter that occurs to me in relation to transition is how the constitutionality will be tested. I think the business, legal and accounting professional communities would like the Minister to put on record how they are to be assured of the constitutional validity of acting under this new package of legislation which has, of course, received so much criticism as to its constitutional validity from so many eminent lawyers, including the Attorneys-General of all States in the Commonwealth.

        â€”In raising this transitional problem Senator Hill has, as he said, detailed some of the points raised in the Joint Select Committee. The Government's position, however, is that there is no need for general legislative transitional provisions because in the Corporations Bill there are specific transitional provisions which continue in force and save the effect of things done under the cooperative scheme law, whether it is prospectuses, company charges, current investigations, prosecutions, liquidations and so on. Also, concerning the existing securities and futures industry, the Attorney-General, as recently as yesterday, made it very clear that transitional provisions would apply in all those areas, and do apply within the legislation.

       On the particular point of constitutionality, as we discussed last night in this place, the Government has no doubt about the constitutional basis on which it is acting. However, once again, the Attorney-General made it very clear that after royal assent and before proclamation there would be an opportunity for anyone who wanted to test the constitutionality of the legislation to proceed at that time.

I put to the Government that if, significant parts turn out to be constitutionally invalid, the consequences will be calamitous for Australian business and industry.

        â€”I support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Hill. The response given by the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, was quite extraordinary. I do not think it is possible to separate comments on the transitional arrangements from the constitutional situation because the length of time required for the transitional arrangements would be very heavily dependent on the amount of time it took to resolve the constitutional situation. I put it to Senator Bolkus that the response from the Government in the document tabled last Friday from which he has been quoting this morning is a totally inadequate response. There is no recognition in that response that the constitutional validity testing could go on for a very lengthy period. There seems to be some suggestion by the Government that somehow or other it will clear this up by having a quick test case. That is obviously sheer nonsense.
       </para>

      <para>
       The constitutionality of the Government's proposals could run for years and it is just not credible for the Government to say that whilst all that is going on we do not really need transitional arrangements. What will be the situation so far as the confidence with which the securities and companies industries will be operating? Under what framework will they be operating? What will be the impact if the constitutional position is decided in one month as compared to one year, five years or 10 years? The Government's response does not answer those questions. The other important fundamental aspect about which the Government has not clarified its position-it certainly has not clarified it to my satisfaction or to my understanding-is: how will the constitutionality be tested and what will be the situation with the existing arrangements while that is being tested? Presumably the existing arrangements will continue. But how does one actually test the constitutionality? Is it going to be tested before the Act is proclaimed or after the Act is proclaimed? What are the implications of one answer compared with another on that particular question? In other words, an enormous number of fundamental questions have not been answered let alone canvassed in the Minister's reply. I seek some greater clarification on that point because we are talking about a matter of great importance to investor confidence in this country.

        â€”We hold that belief on the basis of eminent legal advice which was referred to in the second reading debate last night. The Government's advice, from a wide range of people, including Sir Maurice Byers and Robert Ellicott, QC, is that we are acting quite constitutionally. As with many other important pieces of legislation that come through this place, that question of constitutionality is always raised. If it were not raised we would not have the High Court across the way. That has a function in the whole process. Of course other legislation is also tested, not only at the start but also from time to time in terms of its ambit. So that process can and will continue. The basic point on our side of the chamber is that we believe, and we believe quite strongly, that we are acting on constitutionally firm ground. It was also the firm belief expressed in the unanimous report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation.

       In terms of what will happen in the meantime, I think any clear reading of the Act would indicate that the current scheme will operate until this particular scheme is in place, and also thereafter. This particular scheme does not immediately destroy the operation of the current cooperative scheme. The fundamental answer is that the Government firmly believes, as has been the belief of the committee of this place and as has been the belief of a whole range of eminent legal opinions, that the constitutional basis on which we are acting is solid.

        â€”I was interested to hear Senator Bolkus say that there were a range of opinions other than that obtained from Sir Maurice Byers. When the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation looked at the question of constitutionality we were told by the Attorney-General's Department that no opinions had been sought outside the Department. If there have been opinions obtained from the private Bar in recent times, is the Government prepared to table those opinions? I further ask whether those opinions have taken into account the concerns of the Law Institute of Victoria, which raised considerable doubts about several of the central elements of the Byers opinions, and whether those opinions deal with the range of matters that would nonetheless remain outside the ambit of the Commonwealth power even if the Byers opinions were upheld? In other words, a range of companies, from recreational to educational and scientific and health companies, would not be caught and would not be within the purview of the Commonwealth power. These would include charitable enterprises, holding companies, unincorporated associations, building societies and friendly societies. That is why it is critical to know what transitional arrangements there might be that will take account of the ongoing need for complementary State legislation. It is simply not good enough to suggest that somehow a national scheme would sweep the floor and take over the role of all these other extra corporate structures.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I ask the Minister: what arrangements have been entered into with the States in order to preserve the standing of those bodies that, even on the Byers opinion, will remain outside the corporations power? What arrangements have been entered into with the States in relation to the acquisition of their data bases? Quite clearly there will be a need for the Commonwealth to be in a position to access the records of annual meetings, returns and like documents. Unless those documents are going to be voluntarily made available by the States-we have not had any indication to that effect to date-then the Commonwealth would either need to enact legislation which would give it the power to seize, in effect, or purpose somehow to starve the States into submission. In order to appreciate the extent of any transitional arrangements it is necessary to know the stage that has been reached in Commonwealth-State negotiations. I ask the Minister to indicate to the Senate what stage those discussions have reached, if indeed they have commenced at all.
      </para>
      <para>
       Certainly those who are employed by corporate affairs commissions (CACs) at present would have a very keen interest in knowing what stage negotiations have reached. Does the Minister propose that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) will be in a position to absorb all those people to take on board all their records? Are we to be told what sort of funding will be made available to the ASC, given that the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) was deliberately starved by this Government over a period of years? It was given a shoestring budget of something like $6m, which was a derisory sum in view of the obligations that were imposed upon it. I think that the Government bears acute responsibility for some of the commercial settlements which the NCSC felt itself compelled to enter into almost by way of distress because it knew that it could not afford to run costly and protracted litigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       If that is the case, one needs to have an assurance that the ASC, as the successor body, will be given more than sufficient funds to enable it to take over those roles and responsibilities of the State CACs and to carry out many of the functions that are presently carried out and financed by the States. I ask the Minister to report on those negotiations. Is he able to indicate to the Senate what level of funding will be available to ensure that the ASC is able to take over all those responsibilities?

The basic point is, as everyone in this place knows, that the States have not been all that willing to participate under the new scheme. That is not a revelation of any degree of truth, but the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has continually made offers to the States in terms of how we should cooperate after this particular legislation goes through. Those invitations have not been accepted, and that is also known by people on all sides of the House. In essence, once the legislation goes through the Government will be in a position to go to the States with the legislation in place. The recalcitrant attitude we have had so far may well change with the passing of the legislation.

        â€”Why is that the case in view of the concerns expressed, in particular, by the Law Institute of Victoria? In a submission given in evidence to the Committee, it said:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It seems clear that the question of whether a company is a trading corporation or a financial corporation as required under the Constitution paragraph 51 placitum XX will need to be determined on a case by case basis, even though the buyers opinion concedes that the ambit would not extend to recreational, scientific educational or charitable companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, its submission argued:
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposition contained in the Byers opinion that a law which makes provision for the incorporation within the Commonwealth of trading and financial corporations is not necessarily one with respect to trading and financial corporations formed within the limit of the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       In other words, the Law Institute is saying that it is a dubious proposition to suggest that simply because a law makes provision for something, it is a law with respect to something. That might ultimately turn out to be the case, but I suggest that in many ways it is a novel proposition. It is one that needs to be tested. It is taking the definition to its extreme and I would have thought that the Government would certainly need the comfort of a second opinion.
      </para>
      <para>
       In view of that submission from a respected body such as the Law Institute of Victoria, why has the Government not since sought a second opinion? The Law Institute submission became available only towards the end, and it is quite clear that it was a dead cat in the ring as far as the Government was concerned. I think it deserves an adequate answer. It needs a detailed response. It raises matters which are of genuine concern about the constitutional validity of a whole range of provisions which the Government would hope to be able to enact. After all, if one is talking about trading and financial corporations, one is talking about the vast bulk of companies operating in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its movements around Australia, the Committee heard evidence, in particular in Western Australia, about the very real concerns about what constitutes a trading and financial corporation. What happens when a dormant company is activated? What happens if a trading corporation becomes dormant? What happens to family companies that extend their activities? What happens if a company moves from a low level of passive investment to actively pursuing a range of commercial activities? It is not a simple matter to ascertain what constitutes a trading and financial corporation.
      </para>
      <para>
       At what level does a company trade? If a company sells one item, is that trading? I recall, for example, appearing many years ago in a drug trafficking case in Victoria. My client had bought only $10 worth of marijuana for one of his friends, by request; he had not sought out the potential purchaser. He simply went to a hotel and got $10 worth and made no profit on the transaction, which was entirely isolated. His action was held to be trafficking. I find that a fairly radical proposition. If that is the case, one wonders what constitutes a trading activity of a corporation? Is it constituted by one isolated transaction? Does a company need a certain minimum level of financial activity before it is engaged in trading? What happens if it is a trading corporation and then ceases to trade? What happens if it becomes technically insolvent? Those are all matters which go to the heart of the concept of trading and financial corporations. To say that because a law deals with something it is a law with respect to it, is drawing a long bow. In effect, it would enable a government to pass any laws it liked simply because it touched on the subject matter. That simply cannot be so.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Rocla Pipes case went a long way to establishing the extent of corporations power, but it clearly could not ever have intended that because a corporation was mentioned it should somehow come within the ambit of the power. One of the very real doubts in this area is what happens to companies that are formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. The States have always maintained that the Commonwealth jurisdiction would apply only once the company is up and running. That is why the States have been so keen to hang on to their ability to tax, by way of company registration fees and the like, new company registrations.
      </para>
      <para>
       It simply cannot be the case that because a law deals with corporations it comes within the ambit of the power. Those propositions have been well established over a considerable period. If that is the case, I ask the Minister: why is it that when the Law Institute of Victoria raises a doubt about a central proposition of the Byers opinion the Government has not seen fit to seek a second opinion? Is the real answer that the Government is determined to push ahead with what the Minister chooses to describe as an accountability arrangement when, in fact, it is a grab for power, an attempt to ensure that the Government is in a position to dictate areas of responsibility? In other words, the Government objects to the diffusion of power. Those members of the Select Committee who issued a minority report regarded as very healthy the arrangement whereby the Ministerial Council was able to reflect a wide and diverse range of political opinions and to ensure that it was not possible for one Minister to make a decision-a decision that might well have been made on political grounds.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have seen what happened in respect of the Commonwealth Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, in the lead-up to the last Western Australian election. He made pious and what I would describe as disingenuous suggestions that, somehow, it was a matter for the States to exercise the power to conduct a special investigation into the affairs of Rothwells, when the Minister knew well that the State Government of Western Australia had nothing further from its mind in the lead-up to that election. Clearly there are very real dangers when a power is vested in one government-one level of government-one individual, one department. I find it a matter of great concern that Senator Bolkus should be arguing that, somehow, so long as it is all within the control of one Minister, that is all that needs to be done.
      </para>
      <para>
       In a sense, it is an extension of the Government's intellectual arrogance that it seems to have chosen not to seek further opinion when the Law Institute of Victoria makes it abundantly clear that that is a matter which deserves early resolution. Will the Minister now take account of that late submission from the Law Institute of Victoria and, indeed, address the matters raised by that body-matters which have not been raised even by Sir Maurice Byers himself by way of rebuttal? No doubt, that course has been open to the Government. No doubt, other opinions have been floating around in the public domain, as opposed to opinions commissioned by the Government, which could well have been re-presented to Sir Maurice who, no doubt, would be happy to turn his mind to those matters and rebut them as best he could. On the other hand, of course, he might concede that there were some matters to which he had not given proper consideration. In the interests of fairness and balance, it is highly desirable that the Government take account of all other respectable opinions and deal with them. After all, that is the nature of the game. When one is going to court one does not want the first quote one gets; one wants the best advice one can get. The Government has unlimited resources, when it chooses to use them, so its best course would be to go off and get a second opinion. If it chooses not to do so, the very least it can do is go back to the person expressing the first opinion and give him the opportunity to reconsider it. Will the Minister exercise either or both of those options and take account of some of the very real concerns that have been raised?

        â€”I want to refer the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) to his response to my earlier question and to what he said, as I understand it, in the second reading debate last night. I have not had a chance this morning to check the report of those remarks, but they relate to points similar to those that Senator Alston has been making. I will not go into all of those again in detail. I understood Senator Bolkus, in response to my earlier question this morning, to have said that the weight of legal opinion was that the legislation is constitutionally valid. Perhaps the Minister could take time from reading his newspaper. It is extraordinary that he should be doing so when we are debating what is probably not only the largest package of legislation ever introduced in this nation but also one of prime importance to the whole of the securities and companies industry and, therefore, the structure of the economy. It is disgraceful.
       </para>

      <para>
       I want to know on what basis the Minister said last night, and said again this morning in response to my question, that the weight of legal opinion was that the legislation is constitutionally valid. He says that he has got the Byers opinion. We all know that even Sir Maurice Byers can be wrong-he got it wrong on the referendums, and there is every prospect that he is not correct here. But, more important, it is not correct to say that the weight of legal opinion favours the view that this legislation is constitutionally valid.
      </para>
      <para>
       For months now we have had a unanimous view of the Solicitors-General of the States of Australia that there is very considerable reason for doubting the constitutional validity of this legislation. As Senator Alston has said, we have the view of the Law Institute of Victoria. Admittedly that Institute's submission came to the Joint Select Committee very late in the piece. However, it was not new; it had been around for some time. It was just that the Law Institute put it into detailed prose late in the piece. It represents the view of many reputable lawyers and other commentators with a legal background. As is said in the dissenting report of the Joint Select Committee, there are real doubts about the breadth of the corporations power. Senator Alston explained that in much more detail, so I will not go into it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The point I am making is that, far from what the Minister has told the Senate-that the legal opinions came down heavily on the side of the view that the legislation is constitutionally valid-the opposite is the case. The whole thrust of the legal opinions that are available to the Senate is that the constitutional validity is in very real doubt. I want the Minister to tell us on what basis he made his statement last night, and again this morning, that the weight of legal opinion is towards supporting the constitutional validity of this legislation. I put it to the Minister that if he does not do that he will have misled the Senate and the Australian public. He has said that he has a firm basis for the constitutionality of the legislation. The whole thrust of the evidence before the Senate is that that is not correct. I therefore ask the Minister to explain how he reached that apparently quite incredible view.

        â€”My advice is that that proposal at that particular time, before a committee of which both Senator Hill and I were members, was based on the premise that the Government did not have the power. It was not a firm belief expressed in an opinion that the Government did not have the power. The proposal was put up on the basis of `in the event'. That is where one could substitute `in the event' for the words `if it is assumed' in the evidence from the Department. `In the event' that the Government did not have the power is a question the answer to which it did not at that stage indicate to us in that part of its evidence. Further, in the event that one was to take the position that the Government did not have the power, the proposal was developed on that precondition. I think it is fair to say that not only did we have legal advice at the time but, as I said before-and I will say again continually, probably over the course of today, tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday-Senator Hill was one of those who were firm believers that we did have that power.

       Nevertheless, I go back to the question as to how this constitutional question will be tested. I remind the Minister of the letter of the Attorney-General of 29 April 1988 in which he notified State Ministers that he would not proclaim the legislation in the Bills package until a case determining the constitutional validity of the new scheme had been determined by the High Court. I repeat that part of the letter which was incorporated in the Committee's report:
      </para>
      <para>
       The legislation will be introduced during the current Autumn Sittings of the Commonwealth Parliament but passage through the Parliament will not be sought until the Budget Session.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is somewhat outdated now. It continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is the Government's intention that, following passage, commencement of the legislation would be held back if it has become clear by then that a State or Territory Government proposes to initiate a comprehensive challenge to the constitutional validity of the legislation.

       Is that still the position of the Government as incorporated within the letter of the Attorney-General dated 29 April 1988?

At that stage we will assess in those circumstances whether a challenge will be proceeded with. We will also be able to assess in those circumstances what degree of cooperation we can get from the States. In essence, the Government's firm position is that this legislation should be in place as soon as possible. But I am sure that if Senator Hill were ever able to switch to this side of the Parliament he would be able to work out that in terms of negotiating with States it is much easier if one has the legislation through Parliament than having it held up in the Senate.

What the Government is saying is that it will pass this massive package of legislation but not proclaim certain parts-we do not know what parts-until a case is taken, if it is taken, and that the Government will allow a period of time, the length of which we do not know, for that case to be taken. This is the basis upon which this Government is planning to set up the whole new legal structure for corporate and securities law in this nation. I think it is reasonable for the Parliament and the people of Australia to know which parts the Government will not proclaim, for how long it will not proclaim them and whether it has in place negotiations with the States for an action to be brought in the High Court.

Before the Committee the point was made and evidence was adduced that this is not an unprecedented step. It has happened from time to time. In fact, evidence was produced to the Committee that it has happened four times. In four instances legislation has been allowed to be tested before a proclamation. So we are not dealing with an unprecedented situation. The basic point which we come back to is that once the legislation is passed the Federal Government will be negotiating--

         â€”The Senate is debating the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989, the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Bill 1989, the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Bill 1989, the Wheat (Termination of Tax) Bill (No. 1) 1989, the Wheat (Termination of Tax) Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Wheat (Termination of Permit Tax) Bill 1989 and the Wheat Tax (Permit) Collection Amendment Bill 1989. The purpose of this package of Bills is to allow corporations to market wheat in the domestic market of Australia and to allow greater competition in the transport and storage of grains. Currently wheat marketing in Australia is regulated by the Wheat Marketing Act 1984 in conjunction with wheat and marketing Acts of the various States. These Acts are similar and grant to the Australian Wheat Board a monopoly over the marketing of wheat both internationally and domestically, with the exceptions of wheat sold under the permit system for stockfeed purposes, direct grower to buyer arrangements, and in Queensland where the State wheat board exercises domestic marketing powers.

       <para>
        In April 1986 the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport found that the current system was not the most efficient for meeting Australia's growing distribution needs, primarily because most grain was channelled along a restricted number of predetermined paths such as the compulsory use of rail for most grain transport. Also, prices charged for transportation and storage rarely reflect the actual cost of providing the services because bulk handling agencies pool the costs and charge growers an average price, resulting in all sorts of distortions. The thrust of the Commission's recommendations was that greater efficiency could be achieved through increased competition and the minimisation of storage, handling and transport service costs as well as port services and sea transport charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Government would have us believe that it has been attending to the problems of the macro-economy and micro-economy of this nation. In fact it will claim that its macro and micro-economic reforms are in place. That is an absolute nonsense. All that the Government has been doing is talking about interest rates coming down and inflation. That is the macro-economy. In that area, all that the Government does is talk. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), particularly talks about it as an election approaches. The truth of the matter is, as the people of Australia now know, that under this Government those interest rates have risen regularly and repeatedly until they are now at a massive height. There is a very clear reason for that. The truth is that the Australian economy is sitting on the edge of an economic abyss. We could fall into that abyss, and the Australian dollar value would tumble to the detriment of us all. Australia has to keep paying interest on its overseas borrowings and it is borrowing more to make up for the annual $15 billion deficit. If the value of the Australian dollar falls, that problem increases exponentially in relation to the value of the fall. This Government is not attending to this matter at all, other than by maintaining the current dollar value by way of very high interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is happening notwithstanding our receiving some of the highest commodity prices ever. Our overseas earnings are at their highest, but we are still going down the drain at the rate of $15 billion a year. Indeed, the revenue being earned by the booming tourism industry is also at its highest ever in this nation's history, yet we are still going down the drain at the rate of $15 billion a year. The Government has a major problem on its hands and it is not attending to that problem. All that the Government seems to worry about is winning the next election. As a result of the events of the past 36 hours, the Government has put that problem aside because there is no doubt that it will not run an early election now that we have Mr Peacock and Mr Blunt leading the coalition parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        What could the Government do? As the Opposition parties have been pointing out to the Government for the past four or five years, one area in which it could take some action is micro-economic reform. That simply means enabling work to take place quicker and cheaper in the economy, overcoming some of the problems, the blockages that occur in this country, ensuring that there is adequate competition in order to keep prices down and ensuring that there is an adequate flow backwards and forwards of the business of this nation and that it is not hindered by work practices or State, Federal or local government regulations. These are areas in which there are difficulties. Let us not deny that in these areas there are difficulties for political parties. For instance, there is no doubt that the Government needs desperately to attend to the problems of the waterfront, coastal shipping and transport. Hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved if the Government would attend to those areas.

         â€”The Government is not attending to those areas. It is talking a lot of rhetoric as it has done in the past, but the truth of the matter is that the Government is not prepared to confront the union movement with its work practices in those areas and take the action that should be taken to fix up these problems.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One area in which the Government says that there needs to be micro-economic reform and in which the Labor Party is prepared to take action is the domestic marketing of wheat. We agree that this is an area in which there needs to be micro-economic reform. However, we would say that it should not have anything like the high priority of the waterfront, the need to make changes in work practices in coastal shipping and in the transport industry. But no, the Government is not facing up to those areas. It is saying to the farmers, `Well, in your area, we are prepared to do something about it'. The problem for the farmers is that they, recognising that there is a need for micro-economic reform in the country and many of them recognising that there is a need for reform in their own industries, say that nevertheless the Government should fix up transport, coastal shipping and waterfront practices first or at least attend to them at the same time. I thoroughly agree with the suggestion that they should be done first and, if not first, at the same time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me also say on behalf of the farmers that they are out in the world market. Their export activities, especially those of the wheat growers, are of such a nature that they are confronting world markets which are corrupted by governments subsidising farm produce therefore the prices that they are being paid for their product on the world market are not as good as they should be because, I repeat, of the corruption activities of other governments in the world interfering in these market activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, the Government says that its first priority in micro-economic reform will be wheat and wheat marketing. As I have said, until now, the Government's micro-economic reform program has been all rhetoric. It talks about it and will continue to talk about it. I have not the slightest doubt that the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, who is in the chamber, will rise and tell us that this Government is in fact effecting some micro-economic reform on the waterfront and in coastal shipping. I say that that is nonsense, that what the Government is doing is gradually creeping up on the problem in such a way that it will take 100 years or more to achieve anything. It should stop going down the path at this snail's pace; instead, it should take this problem by the throat and throttle it. As I have said, the Government is saying that it will introduce micro-economic reform in wheat marketing. Why has it done that? It has done it because it knows that the Liberal and National parties represent wheat growers around Australia. The Labor Party does not. So, we have a political difficulty with our rural supporters. Nevertheless, we say to the Government, `All right. This country is in such desperate need of micro-economic reform that we are prepared to accept your proposal to enter into this area of reform in relation to wheat, subject to certain conditions. We recognise that area; so we will not be opposing this legislation'. The Hawke Government has been more concerned with attempting to divide the coalition and offering a sop to its own supporters and unions than adopting the Royal Commission's recommendations. In the process it has manipulated the media and, in particular, the Parliamentary Press Gallery so that there has been no reporting of the fundamental flaws in this package of legislation which is before us. The reasons for the serious reservations of wheat growers and some members of the coalition have been ignored by the Parliamentary Press Gallery which has accepted the Government's actions without any proper or real analysis of the major flaws in the legislation and the problems of the wheat growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        A great deal of misinformation has been generated about this legislation. I do not know whether it is due to clever manipulation of the media or sloppy reporting, but the opponents of the legislation and the Government have certainly exploited it for their own ends. Where in the national media has there been any really informed comment on the issues involved in this legislation? Where in the media is the Government questioned about introducing legislation so sloppy that it requires 45 Government amendments to its laws? Surely any objective reporting would have raised these questions. The Minister might be embarrassed by the lack of foresight by his Department and the politicking of his Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the Government's 45 amendments now put in place in the other House, there are still four major flaws in this package of legislation. The Government has failed to listen to and maintain consultation with the State agricultural Ministers, the Grains Council of Australia and the grain growers. This is the first flaw: since July 1988 the Minister has been talking about the necessity for complementary legislation. He has known that the Australian Wheat Board would not be able to trade intrastate on the domestic market after 1 July and that 80 per cent of the domestic market is carried out intrastate. To ensure competition it is essential that the Australian Wheat Board be a strong trader in this market. Unless the States move quickly the grain merchants could force the Wheat Board out of the domestic market.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second flaw in this package of legislation is that the Government has had more than a year to persuade the States to carry this necessary complementary legislation but to date none has. No State, even those with Labor governments, has seen fit to introduce or pass the necessary complementary legislation. The Australian Wheat Board and the wheat traders are left in a position of considerable uncertainty about intrastate trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the legislation overrides the responsibilities of the State governments, which have prime responsibility for production and distribution within their boundaries. Fourthly, while part 7 of the Wheat Marketing Bill moves to provide some deregulation in powers in respect of the storage, handling, loading and unloading of wheat, including such facilities at ports and arrangements for the provision of storage, handling, transport and other marketing services together with proposed micro-economic reforms, it has not deregulated the labour market. That is, of course, putting the cart before the horse. We well know that this Government will not face up to its responsibilities in another area of micro-economic reform, that is, the deregulation of the labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's economic policies are abysmal. The car plan, for example, was an expensive failure. The Interstate Commission's report on the waterfront reveals the appalling state of that industry. The railway unions continue to impose huge inefficiencies on our railway systems. According to a Labor Party backbencher these inefficiencies will continue in Victoria. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), in the Bendigo Advertiser on 19 April this year, said that V/Line would not lose out in any wheat plan. He assured the railway unions that their members would not lose any jobs and that there would be no redundant railway workers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian flagships are overmanned and cabotage adds significant increases to our shipping costs. Most of the reservations of wheat growers would disappear if the Hawke Government put in place the necessary micro-economic reforms and complementary State legislation. The wheat growers are right to distrust the Hawke Government which is too weak to take the hard decisions. When has it made any tough decisions in recent months? All it is concerned about is trying to present some facade to the Australian people in relation to the next election which it anticipated it would call early in July. But the Labor Government will not be calling the election in July now. Now that the Liberal and National parties have changed their leaders the Labor Party will defer the next election for as long as it can.

       <para>
        Major amendments are needed to these Bills and I will be moving them in the committee stage. In outline, they are: a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee; a wheat grower chairman and five wheat growers out of the nominated eight people on the 11-person Board; provision for more say by the Grains Council of Australia in the spending and management of grain grower money which would be paid into the levy fund; deregulation of labour practices; and compensation for losses resulting from ministerial direction additional to that allowed for credit sales. I will be doing my best to make sure that the legislation contains provisions within it which would enable the Australian Wheat Board to be a strong intrastate domestic marketer of wheat.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government did not accept the Opposition amendment for harsher penalties for the illegal export of wheat but moved its own amendment which increased the maximum fine from $100,000 to $300,000. It also failed to accept amendments which deregulated the labour market. The Government is yet to face up to the harsh realities of Australian growers competing on world markets. The McColl Royal Commission has made out a persuasive case for restructuring but the Government has attempted to use this legislation for devious political purposes rather than as a means of genuine reform. The Bill, with the Opposition amendments, will mean a significant change for the Wheat Board, which will move from being a regulated receiver of wheat for domestic and industrial purposes to an active competitor in the domestic market.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also concern by some growers that there will be a return to the bad old days when marketing malpractices were common. That concern appears to me to be unjustified because trade practices legislation prevents the type of collusive practices by private traders which existed in the early decades of this century. Growers will still have the option of marketing their wheat through the Board. This aspect represents the big safeguard for farmers who do not wish to move into the marketing of their own grain at this stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government would have us believe that the 95 per cent underwriting proposed by the coalition parties would involve the Government in huge payouts. This is not true. If one looks back over the last 10 years at an estimated net pool return at the time of setting the guaranteed minimum price (GMP)-the guaranteed minimum would be set for one year instead of a three-year rolling average-one can see that only once during that 10-year period did the final price achieved by the Board go below the 95 per cent level. Is it not unreasonable for the wheat growers of Australia that we establish that minimum at 95 per cent? That one year in 10 was in 1980-81, before the Wheat Board was allowed to hedge on the futures market. At that time the guaranteed minimum price would have been $160.35. The Board achieved $140.88-$3.46 a tonne short of the 95 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987-88 the guaranteed minimum price of $159.93 returned $163.50 and in 1986-87, the worst year for 15 years when it came to the Federal Government having to put money into underwriting, under this scheme the guaranteed minimum price would have been $125.72 and the return achieved $125.50-not below 95 per cent-and therefore there would have been no Government underwriting. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table with figures for the past 10 years of the estimated guaranteed minimum price on a one-year formula.

         â€”Some growers have expressed concern that in a deregulated domestic market the price could fall to an average export price, and the opponents of deregulation have played on this concern. I put it to the Senate that the evidence suggests otherwise. The 1984 Wheat Marketing Act allowed the feed wheat market to be deregulated, and a case has been cited to me of one Victorian grower who said he was $17 per tonne better off over his whole crop because he had been able to utilise his marketing skills rather than being forced to sell to the Australian Wheat Board. The then Bureau of Agricultural Economics made a study in New South Wales and found that on average growers were better off by around $13 per tonne if they marketed their own feed wheat.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are two compelling reasons for deregulation of the domestic wheat market. The first is that the domestic market is, in effect, partly deregulated already. Secondly, it is only through allowing real competition on the domestic market that the efficiencies in storage, handling and transport that have been outlined by the McColl Royal Commission have any real chance of being achieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are our options? Prior to 1984-85 growers had no opportunity to adopt a marketing strategy oriented to their individual situations. Under this legislation the grower has several marketing options-for example, pool cash-out, deferred payment and deferred delivery-and the grower should benefit from this increased range of marketing options. The McColl Royal Commission has estimated that there are savings to be made in the order of $10 per tonne over the whole crop if these efficiencies are implemented. Victorian Rail, which is currently subsidised at over $1 billion per annum to keep it operating, forces Victorian wheat growers to use their own trucks, and prohibits the use of other road transport to truck wheat more than 60 kilometres.
       </para>
       <para>
        Union influence recently resulted in a small Victorian grain receival depot at Laharum which had been receiving 60,000 tonnes per annum and which previously had special dispensation being closed down at the behest of the Australian Railways Union. This forced growers to truck their wheat north to Murtoa or Horsham, thus increasing the distance to the port of export, Portland, by at least 60 per cent. In other words, they had to truck their wheat north to put it on a train to take it south. That is the nonsense that goes on because the Government will not address deregulating the labour market. The Australian Wheat Board in that case was powerless to intervene. Under this legislation and last year's amendment there is more flexibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        The railways must get their act together. A recent Industries Assistance Commission report claimed that productivity improvements of 100 per cent were possible in State rail authorities, and there was a potential for labour productivity increases of up to 70 per cent and cost reductions of 30 per cent. Rail should be the most efficient way of transporting bulk grains. The fact that it is not is an indictment of our railways and their employees who have sheltered behind the monopoly they have enjoyed at the expense of the growers. Over the past 10 years the cost of transportation, handling and loading of wheat into ships has trebled, while growers are receiving no more than they did 10 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently only one-quarter of our commodity exports leaves our shores in a substantially, or even partially, processed form. It is estimated that only 28 per cent of our total exports are made up of value added products. By contrast, the figure for the United States of America is 33 per cent, for Canada 44 per cent and for the United Kingdom 62 per cent. This low value added level is reflected in a decline in our food export performance. While our volume of food exports has increased over the past 10 years, our share of the world food trade has fallen by more than 30 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are major new opportunities for value added foods, particularly on the Asian market, as Asian populations become more urbanised and their tastes more westernised. These include prepared meals, biscuits, breakfast cereals and soups. While this is a developing section of the Australian food industry, our industry tends to fall well behind its counterparts in Japan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and eastern Europe. Deregulation of the domestic market will provide great opportunities and incentives to develop such value added food exports and should result in new industries springing up. I certainly hope it does.
       </para>
       <para>
        The worst case scenario is that the Australian Wheat Board would be involved only in exports. That is still 80 per cent of the crop and would enable the Board to continue to dominate the market overall, thus enabling the Board to maintain a floor price in the market. Providing the Wheat Board continues to perform competitively and efficiently-and there is no doubt that it has in the past, and no reason why it should not in the future-it should easily retain its status as the dominant local marketer of Australian wheat. There is a natural concern that the Hawke Government will not live up to its part of the bargain, but a change of government will rectify that. The opening up of the domestic market to competition should, under a new Liberal and National Party government, be of major benefit to all Australians.

         â€”Today we are debating a set of Bills containing the most significant changes to orderly wheat marketing since 1947. This set of Bills is divisive not only among the 45,000 wheat growers around Australia but also among members and senators on both sides of this Parliament. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, according to my information, had only 41 per cent of his own Caucus backing him on this issue. But in his usual arrogant fashion he rammed this legislation through just as he did with the dairy plan which cost each Western Australian dairy farmer $12,000 a year. Mr Kerin brought his troops into line in the usual way in the Australian Labor Party Caucus. Ask Mr George Georges how it works, or my own representative, Mr Campbell, who incidentally has his own views on this debate but is hardly likely to try his luck twice.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As I said, the original plan came into effect in 1947 after 15 years of agony, bankruptcy and general walk-off from properties that started in 1931. I hope I may be excused for going back into history. Some people like going back into history and some do not. The ones who do not have a good reason for not doing so. As I said, 1930 was the time when farmers were encouraged to grow more wheat, to improve Australia's trade in the world sphere. Such trade is even more important today. The Government was also advocating the opening up of more land for two reasons. One was to settle returned soldiers from World War I, the other was to settle `turned down' miners, miners who could not get a ticket to work underground any more. After wheat growers were encouraged to plant more wheat, and agricultural banks and intending buyers loaned them money, the wheat buyers took over. Between them, the banks and the buyers fragmented the prices-forced them down-and the growers did not even get enough to cover advances. After growing crops in difficult conditions the growers owed money to the buyers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The results were massive walk-offs, broken families and suicides. Farmers were thrown off their properties and even gaoled for selling wheat to the local storekeeper in exchange for stores to feed their family. If this debate had not started so suddenly I would have brought with me a book outlining the history of my own district-Southern Cross-in Western Australia, where a farmer was actually gaoled for that reason. The battle to get an equitable marketing system continued for 15 years. It finally came to fruition in 1947-incidentally, under a Labor government. I am proud to say that at the time my father was a foundation member of the Western Australian wheat growers union.
       </para>
       <para>
        A pooling system was used during the war because wheat was needed to feed the troops. It showed people what a pooling system was capable of achieving. A referendum of growers was conducted in 1947, and 64 per cent voted for orderly marketing and an underwriting procedure in the system. Speculators then had to move elsewhere. In turn, they wrecked lamb and wool prices, until wool prices were stabilised under the wool stabilisation scheme adopted in 1973.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, this plan involves many changes. The main ones are: Deregulating the domestic market; changing the guaranteed minimum price system; and changing the structure of the Wheat Board. I will address each change in that order. Five years ago, when the last plan came into effect, two permit systems for domestic wheat were introduced. One was the feed wheat permit, whereby one simply rang the Wheat Board, received a permit by phone, and sent money for the research levy and the administration levy. Under that system the wheat changed hands, and so did the money. A grower to buyer permit was also introduced. A deal was reached between the two parties, but the payment was via the Wheat Board, with a guarantee of payment to the grower. The grower immediately received the premium and participated in the pool. As this system is being eliminated, the cheque in the mail feature could be a problem because there will be no guarantee of payment for industrial and milling wheat.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these changes have been introduced by this Minister in his micro-economic reform fury to deregulate the industries that generally support the conservative parties, yet he will not tackle his own mates on the waterfront and in the rail unions, including grain handlers. His excuse to move was the report of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. Mr McColl pointed out that there could be a saving of between $10 and $12 per tonne if certain measures were put into place. McColl recommended the deregulation of transport, handling, storage, and the waterfront. He also said that this could be done under the present marketing system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the infamous waterfront, where rort upon rort is perpetuated. There are no rorts in the wheat industry. On the waterfront, grain handlers earn up to $78,000 a year for an average 46-hour working week. Mainly, they watch self-loading ships load. The average waterfront worker earns $1,000 a week for a 28-hour working week. There are 2,000 too many waterside workers, and many continue working beyond a reasonable working age. There is rort upon rort. As I have mentioned, McColl said that savings could be made without changes to the marketing system. Because the Industries Assistance Commission made a minor recommendation that the wheat marketing system could be deregulated, the Minister is proposing to deregulate industries that support the conservative parties. He went in boots and all. If, as the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said, the domestic market has been deregulated for the last five years-I refer to the two permit systems that I have already mentioned-it would have been far simpler to extend the feed wheat permit across the board. One could simply ring the Board and get a permit over the phone. One could set one's own price, delivery terms, and mode of transport-if one's State deregulated the transport system.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is ironic that under this legislation the levy for research is still to be collected. I cannot see how it will be collected properly if there is no contact with the Wheat Board, even by phone, under the deregulated system. How will it be enforced? I do not know. It may be slightly easier to collect from the larger buyers of feed wheat, industrial and milling wheat, who are located all over Australia. I suppose they will be subject to raids as there are provisions in the Bill dealing with those who do not pay the levies. I believe that it is an impossible system and the loser will be the research arm of the wheat industry. As I said, a simple phone permit system would have been accepted by growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I support the deregulation of transport, storage and handling, as I have done for many years. Authorities such as the various bulk handling authorities are well placed to take competition. The newest bulk handling authority is in South Australia-it was incorporated in about 1961. The silos have been built mainly with grower finance and they are in a position to take some competition. It will take at least 20 years for any private company to build such a system. But the cooperatives that set up the bulk handling authorities are servants of their shareholders, and I think they should get rid of some of their sweetheart deals with the unions. I refer, for example, to Cooperative Bulk Handling Ltd of Western Australia and the deal it had with the Australian Workers Union at Kwinana. Later, after a six-week strike, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia took over anyhow.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has ridden roughshod over 95 per cent of wheat farmers around Australia. I attended meetings all over Western Australia. I was invited to attend meetings in Victoria, but I could not get to them. Out of a total of 800 farmers who attended the meetings that I attended, only 10 voted in favour of deregulating the domestic market. I am assured that upon opening up the domestic market farmers can use their own marketing skills. I am sure they can; the few who are selling privately now are doing so. What must be remembered is that there will be many more sellers in the market and many others with marketing skills. I, for one, will be competing for some of those stockfeed and chicken farm deals. From now on, the odd few looking for deregulation will not have it on their own. This will lead only to one thing-lower domestic prices. This Minister is in the minority in his own party, as he received only 41 per cent support for this proposal in his party room; honourable senators opposite have not queried me on that point to date. He even tried to deregulate the export market. He has not succeeded this time but this is an attempt to get a foot in the door. We will be debating that matter in a few years time-if he is still the responsible Minister, which I doubt-when he tries to wreck that system also.

        My friend Mr Mick Gayfer, who is Chairman of Western Australian Cooperative Bulk Handling-I should say that he was my friend until I opposed him for his upper House seat in 1986; I still call him a friend but I do not know whether he recognises that friendship now-said that the permit system would lead to total deregulation of the market. He was right because this system provides a foot in the door for the Minister for further deregulation. I point to the New Zealand experience where the domestic market was deregulated a few years ago. The result was a drop in price of about $NZ100 per tonne and now there is virtually no wheat board. However, my Party has decided to support domestic deregulation under certain conditions-these are cornerstone conditions, and I support them-which include: reasonable progress towards deregulation in the transport, handling and waterfront areas to reduce the many cost burdens placed upon wheat growers by high levels of regulation, restrictive work practices and anti-market abuses in those areas; a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee to provide a satisfactory first advance or cash trading option for the Wheat Board-this is the major cornerstone on which we will fight to the end-the maintenance of the Wheat Board's existing powers in relation to exports, which I have already mentioned; and the Board having the capacity to remain a strong trader competing on fair and reasonable terms with other domestic traders.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 3 May 1989 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) addressed a meeting of the Australian Mining Industry Council, at which I was present. The Labor Party was so arrogant about this Bill that the night before it was debated in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister told the Council that the Government had deregulated the domestic marketing of wheat. He then went on to say that he would do something about coastal shipping. If this legislation is passed, we will see how the Government will go about deregulating the waterfront, the rail unions and coastal shipping. Coastal shipping has already replied; the Waterside Workers Federation has told us that in no uncertain terms what it will do; and the rail unions of Victoria have also told us what their ideas are.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far the Government has said that it will override the States on the question of the bulk handling-that is quite easy as it is grower controlled- and rail systems, which will not be quite so easy because of union control. Since 1982 I have led the fight against Westrail on the question of grain freights. Growers in the long haul areas were being ripped off in a captive market because they could not use their own transport. The regulations say that it is quite okay for growers to use their own transport, but if a grower is 370 miles from the port I do not think he can cart his own wheat as it is harvested to the port without building expensive on-farm storage. If the crop is any good he will battle to get it away to the local silo.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some road competition in short haul soon convinced Westrail to drop its freight in that area. Over the years some gains were made in Westrail freight charges, but there are lot more to be made. Under this legislation I believe that Westrail will have a dual system of grain transport especially on the longer hauls. Export wheat will be deregulated, so I presume that the freight rate will be cheaper. If a grower wants to transport feed wheat to a miller in Perth, then I assume that it will not be deregulated and I presume that more will be charged for it. I do not know what will happen, but that is where we could quite easily be heading. I presume if that happens the forwarder will have to sign a statutory declaration to say whether it is export wheat or feed wheat to be used in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Will this Government tackle the waterfront, coastal shipping and the rail unions? The rail unions have already told us of their position. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, had the hide to tell the House of Representatives that the Government had to decide what was best for the growers. I heard him myself. He knew that only about 5 to 7 per cent of the Australian wheat growers want him to interfere with the wheat market, but he told us that the Government knew better and that it had to make the decision. He went on to say-honourable senators should listen to this-that the unions do not tell the Government what its industrial policy will be. I would like to know what Mr Kelty thought about that. This Government will cave in to the unions as usual. Last week I personally heard Mr Kerin tell the House of Representatives that the industry, which holds a 95 per cent view to the contrary, does not know what is best for itself and that the Government must take over. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy refused to attend any of the protest meetings around Australia. Once again, he knew better. This Government does not practise what it preaches.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will now come to the most significant aspect of the Opposition's conditions; that is the guaranteed minimum price (GMP). The GMP purpose is twofold: firstly, to guarantee a minimum price to stop sudden world downturns in price being reflected on the Australian market and, secondly, to enable the Government to guarantee the borrowings of the Wheat Board enabling the Board to pay a reasonable first advance. Now the Minister has decided that only the subject year forecast be used. In other words, instead of a three-year average, there will only be a subject year figure average. The Minister intends to bring that down to 90 per cent, phasing down to 80 per cent and ceasing altogether after five years. He told us that a revolving fund should be used, as it is in wool. I assure the Senate that it works with wool because we are the big players in the world and we control wool and world prices. In Australia we do not control wheat prices or wheat movement because we have only 11 per cent of the world market. Wheat cannot be stored indefinitely as wool can because of insect problems and the enormous volume of space required.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a deregulated domestic market the result will be that the domestic price-which is set at best export price, after all Australian consumers have the best wheat available-will settle at the average export price. Of course, the average export price is already affected by the United States enhancement program whereby the Government has been subsidising sales to Russia to the tune of $15 per tonne. As I said, this has already had enough effect on our export wheat without adding injury to the internal market as well. That is why the coalition demanded in return for deregulation on the domestic market an assurance of 95 per cent GMP and without the phasing down option. This is vital because that is the figure that the domestic market will settle at. I exhort the Australian Democrats to support us on this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, there will be no cushioning effect. Under the old system there was a cushioning effect averaging over three years. If world prices went down suddenly Australian prices would be held up and they would decline more steadily. On the other side of the coin, if world prices jumped faster the price in Australia would have gone up more slowly. Under the old system the Government made up any shortfall. That happened only once in 41 years and that was in 1986. In the case of a disastrous downturn under the new system, the Government will have to look at other measures to assist growers. I hope that that never happens, but I wish Mr Kerin would be more definite. If the removal of the floor GMP succeeds it will be the final insult to our 45,000 wheat growers because they have to buy their supplies from regulated and monopoly markets. I have in mind fuel, machinery, chemicals and most imported fertilisers. As the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is a wheat grower, I wonder what his private thoughts are on this matter. I have heard his own brother and partner state his position in Western Australia time and time again.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now move to the composition of the Board. There has been a vast change. Under section 15 of the Bill it is proposed that the Board consist of a chairperson, a managing director, a government member and eight nominated members from persons nominated by the selection committee. I cannot accept the fact that the chairperson does not have to be a wheat grower at the time of taking office. Also, there is no specification that each wheat growing State shall have representation. I find that I cannot accept that either. If this Senate, which is a protector of the States, does not support each State having a representative, then I believe that it is failing miserably.
       </para>
       <para>
        Getting back to the chairperson, it is scandalous that that person does not have to be a full time wheat grower. This industry has kept Australia afloat with respect to its balance of payments. It has kept export balances somewhere in perspective for the last 60 years. The industry will net somewhere near $4 1/2 billion this financial year and may even return to its position as Australia's second biggest income earner behind wool, ousting coal from that position.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reaffirm that the composition of the Board is an insult to the industry. It is like the Government installing a non-mining man to the chair of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-not that the Government has the power to do so, but if it had it would be a similar case. In the debate I have heard in this place and read of in the other place, very little mention has been made of the damage to Australian growers caused by the sale of subsidised American wheat to Russia. As I mentioned previously, Mr Quayle visited Australia in the past few weeks and made a few remarks about the problems, brushing off Senator Gareth Evans. As soon as he left the country there was another big sale of $1.5m tonnes at a great discount to Russia. This Government has made only piteous efforts to correct the situation for growers who each pay $9,000 per year to subsidise Australian manufacturers because of the situation with respect to tariffs on imports. Farmers are tired of being treated like fools. In the transport industry, farmers pay 120 per cent recovery for the use of VicRail, for instance, while urban dwellers pay only 35 per cent recovery for urban rail. I question proposed section 63 (3) which `enables the Board to attribute to transferred wheat'-I presume to the next pool-`such sale price as the Board thinks appropriate.' I want some answers on this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate the arrogance with which the wheat growers of Australia have been treated. Caustic comments have come from various speakers in this place and the other place. There has been personal vilification of speakers who have defended the situation. A good example of that was Mr O'Keefe's taking to task of Senator McGauran, which involved personal vilification. Instead of referring to what Senator McGauran said about wheat, he went into his record at university. What has anyone's record at university or in any other part of life got to do with what he said in debate? Mr O'Keefe should think twice before he makes other accusations, because his own escapades may not measure up too well before his electors.

        As I said earlier, my Party has taken a decision to accept deregulation of the domestic wheat market. I have always fought for the decision to be made by the industry itself-in other words, for self-determination. This was our policy before the last election, but it has since been reviewed. My Party and the National Party came to an agreement to accept the new plan subject to the four conditions I mentioned earlier. I will vote with my Party at the second reading stage, though with some pang of conscience, having regard to my family's plight and fight in the 15 years from 1932 to 1947.

        I will support all the amendments moved by our side of the Senate. I hope they will be supported by the Australian Democrats, especially the guaranteed minimum price amendment. As I said, it is a cornerstone. If the GMP amendment is not accepted by the Government, we will be in trouble. Just five years ago when the last plan was formulated, I was active in agro-politics. I was not then in this place and did not dream I would be here for this plan. A lot of water has gone under the bridge since 1983 and the two permit systems made the wheat plan work very well. It is unfortunate that we are introducing this legislation so hastily, but if the cornerstone conditions are accepted and put into action we can make good legislation.

        The wheat industry is an important industry throughout Australia, providing $4 1/2 billion in export income which is greatly needed in Australia at present. Without those conditions being accepted, we will go into chaos. I do not want to see happen again what happened so many years ago, but I had to mention something of the history of it. As I said, only time will tell the wisdom of this plan and time may yet prove that my fears were well founded.

         â€”In the Senate today we are debating the Wheat Marketing Bill and six associated Bills. It is a matter of common knowledge that this topic has greatly exercised the collective minds of the coalition parties for almost 12 months, since the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, first began talking-I repeat `talking'-about this matter last year. At that stage Mr Kerin had in no way indicated conclusively what he would eventually propose to do by way of legislation. Indeed, as we all know, Mr Kerin's formal proposals in legislative form were not introduced to the House of Representatives until 13 April this year. Meanwhile, Mr Kerin made a number of statements indicating his intentions, all of them, I think it is fair to say, of a uniformly hostile kind, towards the wheat growers of Australia, the wheat industry in its institutional forms in this country, any State Government or Minister of agriculture in a State government who dared in any way to differ from Mr Kerin's views on the matter, and anybody who was not prepared to give assent to whatever Mr Kerin's view, stated at the time, might be.

       <para>
        Debate on this Bill, which has now come to the Senate after processing in the House of Representatives last week, as far as I am concerned, is a debate not just about the important topic of wheat, important though that topic is. It is also about how we happen to have arrived at the situation in which we now find ourselves. In that sense, it has to be acknowledged that it is a debate in part-indeed my Liberal Party senatorial colleague, Senator Panizza, has just been referring to some of its aspects-about the procedures within the coalition which have resulted in the present state of the legislation. I will come back to some aspects of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        To begin with, I want to say that, to the extent that I am known in this country, I imagine that most people who know me or think they know of me would probably associate me with a lifetime in the Commonwealth Public Service and in the Commonwealth Treasury and, more recently, with some other more adventurous occupations. But I remind the Senate and those people that I actually grew up on a wheat farm in Western Australia, not all that very far from the present abode of my senatorial colleague, Senator John Panizza, who has just been speaking. My father, who is dead now, took up his small property between Merredin and Bruce Rock in Western Australia in about 1928 or 1929. I was born in 1929. My parents lived through the Depression in the wheat farming industry in the 1930s, some aspects of which Senator Panizza referred to. While I am not one of those who believe that it is appropriate to live in the past, to spend one's time looking back to those very sad, and in some cases almost desperate, days for the wheat industry and for individual wheat farmers-that serves no useful purpose-I want it to be clearly on the record that I, of course as a child, had some personal acquaintance with the situation in which wheat farmers found themselves at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage I want to foreshadow that, on behalf of myself and my National Party colleagues, I shall be moving an amendment to the second reading motion. In due course I shall cause that amendment to be circulated to honourable senators. The substance of my amendment will be to the effect that the Senate should deplore the Government's betrayal of the wheat farmers of Australia; condemn the Government for weakening the position of the Australian Wheat Board as a strong trader in the domestic wheat market; and regret the Government's failure to negotiate adequately with State governments over their respective responsibilities, including those in regard to State statutory marketing authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The history of this matter has of course gone through a number of phases. I have referred already to Mr Kerin's original ambiguous, and at times ambivalent, proposals, including his proposal to strip the Australian Wheat Board of its powers not merely in respect of domestic trade in wheat for human consumption but also in respect of wheat for export, which of course constitutes something like 80 per cent of the Australian crop This is an area of operation in which I think it is fair to say the Australian Wheat Board has been conspicuously successful. It is certainly one in which it has earned the regard, admiration and professional respect of international wheat traders and of other countries and their representative organisations with which it does business.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say-in these matters, I do not want to sail under false colours-that on the question of the precise degree of regulation of the Australian wheat market I probably hold less strong views than do some of my party colleagues and some others in the community, including people in the wheat farming community. I have never made any secret of that fact. My view of the Bill, as it was originally introduced in the House of Representatives, is based, as I said a moment ago, not only on its actual terms so far as it affects the wheat industry but also on the manner in which we in the coalition parties have subsequently adopted an attitude towards it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me go back for a moment. It is a matter of record that there was a long process of discussion within the coalition parties on this matter. As is again well known, that discussion resulted eventually in the setting up of a committee of six people to draw up what I suppose the lawyers might call a heads of agreement document, which purported to set out the coalition's attitude towards deregulation of the wheat industry. I should like to refresh the memories of honourable senators by referring to what that document says. I will not read it in full because it runs to almost a page of print. After referring, among other things, to the present problems confronting our wheat industry because of the extreme corruption in world wheat markets, resulting from, in particular, the activities of the European Community, and also-admittedly partly in response to that-the activities of the United States, through the export enhancement program--

        That heads of agreement document was placed before the coalition joint party room on 4 April and was agreed to by all concerned. I think it is fair to say that, as with a good many such agreements in the world of politics, it probably did not satisfy any person on all points but, like all such documents, it was an agreement that had been hammered out after long and properly conducted discussions between those responsible for framing it. In the case of the National Party, those people were my colleague the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr Bruce Lloyd, the shadow Minister for primary industry; my senatorial colleague Senator David Brownhill; and Mr Michael Cobb, the honourable member for Parkes. As I have said, that document was agreed to. On 13 April-nine days later-Mr Kerin introduced his legislation. If I may say so, that legislation is something wonderful to see. I will come back later to its quality. It was introduced in this place after deliberations by the Minister lasting almost 12 months. On 13 April it was agreed to-by processes which I will not traverse. Most unfortunately, I was not in Parliament on the afternoon of 13 April. As you, Madam Acting Deputy President, will recall, the Senate rose at about lunchtime that day to go into Estimates committees. As those did not concern me, I thought that I would be very clever and evade the terrorism of the air traffic controllers at Sydney Airport and get back to Queensland. I caught a flight out of here at 3 p.m. and thought how clever I had been.

       <para>
        Shortly after being given permission to enter Pakistan air space, Karachi air traffic control (ATC) sought details of the aircraft's overflight clearance. Although the captain gave full details surrounding the circumstances of the delayed flight, Karachi ATC advised that the aircraft had no clearance to overfly Pakistan and asked it to land in Karachi for identification or return to London. The captain, under the circumstances, elected to land at Karachi.
       </para>
       <para>
        As soon as the aircraft landed it was cleared to proceed on the advice of British Airways, the company's agent in Pakistan. No official contact was made with the captain and as a result he received no explanation as to why his explanation of the circumstances of the delay was unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsequent to the incident, Qantas relayed its view to Pakistan aviation authorities that the authority granted by Pakistan to Qantas to conduct services on the route in question allowed delayed services to operate to their normal routing. The airline has had no advice from Pakistan authorities to contradict this view, which the Australian Government supports. Naturally, the Australian Government was concerned at the incident, although it needs to be stressed that at no time was the aircraft or its crew in danger. The Government has made representations to the Pakistan Government to convey its concern about the diversion and the fact that the captain was not interviewed or given an explanation by Pakistani authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Pakistan Government has explained that the diversion request was made because of uncertainty in the minds of Pakistan air traffic control as to whether the aircraft had an overflight clearance. It is clear finally that the incident is an isolated episode, albeit an unfortunate one and one that is most unlikely to recur. While causing inconvience, obviously, to Qantas and its passengers, I stress again that there was at no time any danger to the safety of passengers or crew.

I believe that within the last day or so my Department has received the environmental report and the management plan by the company on the project.

        The Commonwealth is now awaiting the report of the Tasmanian Department of the Environment on whether it believes that Tasmania's procedures have been completed satisfactorily.

At this stage I must confess that I have not read the reports, given that we have just received some and some are yet to come. So I cannot make a judgment on whether fish farms will be affected; I do not know. Obviously that is one of the problems that are being looked at in the EIS process. When it comes to environmental issues in Tasmania, I do not think that the Commonwealth has a record for being wimpish. I can give Senator Devereux an undertaking that I will have a long, hard look at the evidence as it comes in. There is a suggestion that after Saturday an incoming Labor government would not wish to see the Huon Forest Products mill go ahead.

It follows a question I asked last week in relation to the agreements between the Commonwealth and the States on dumping at sea within the three-mile limit, from either ships ashore or shore based pipelines. Did the former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, propose to Mr Tonkin, the former Premier of South Australia, that State legislation should be passed to control both (a) marine pollution through dumping and (b) land based marine pollution? Did the Premier of South Australia agree to that proposal, including giving the undertaking that `if the States did not legislate, Commonwealth legislation would apply in the three-mile zone'? Is the Minister aware of the severe marine pollution at Port Pirie where Broken Hill Associated Smelters is discharging large amounts of zinc, lead and cadmium into the sea? Has South Australia passed the legislation according to the agreement of 1979? If not, will the Commonwealth now exercise its power to control marine pollution in South Australia?

         â€”I announced some new figures on Australian tourism only last week. Those figures showed that the number of visitors to Australia last year reached 2.25 million, which was well in excess of the prediction of two million for the bicentennial year. If we compare this with the preliminary figures for 1988 from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we see that only 15,100 out of that total of 2.25 million short term overseas visitors to Australia gave Tasmania as their main State of intended stay. That is less than 0.7 per cent of the total number of international visitors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In recent years there has been a decline in Tasmania's share of tourist arrivals. In 1982, according to the figures available to us, Tasmania actually received about one per cent of the international market. Quite obviously Tasmania has the potential to develop a very significant overseas tourist industry. But from these figures it would seem that the Tasmanian Government in recent years-certainly since 1982-has not been active in trying to increase its share, or even maintain it. Obviously Tasmania has some unique attractions. Perhaps the Gray Government would have better served Tasmania by promoting those magnificent forests and wilderness areas rather than attempting to chop them down and develop them on each and every occasion. That natural beauty and wilderness is obviously the way for Tasmania to go. The benefits to the Tasmanian economy if this were to happen would be enormous.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tourism is already worth 6 per cent of gross domestic product. It produces 20,000 jobs a year. Even with the failure of the Tasmanian Government, tourism projects completed or under construction as at December last year provided some 1,700 jobs in construction and nearly 400 jobs in operation. Those 2,000 jobs would represent about a quarter of the total employment in the Tasmanian timber industry. I am very confident that, with an increased effort, Tasmania could live up to its potential and be a large employer in the tourism sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        As an example of the Commonwealth's desire to help Tasmania, a desire upon which the Prime Minister expanded a couple of days ago in another place, it is appropriate for me to tell Senator Aulich and anyone else interested that the Federal Government will give $30,000 on a dollar for dollar basis for a three-month consultancy to investigate ways in which Tasmania can better benefit from the great interest being shown in Australia by overseas tourists. Tasmanian counterparts are being asked to discuss with my officials the terms of reference and the selection of a consultant to undertake the study. It is unfortunate that it has taken so long for the Tasmanian Government to take up this offer. Perhaps, after Saturday, the next Government will take it up much more quickly.

Part of the question referred to harmonising business practices and corporate laws-for example, the activities of the New Zealand Monopolies Commission and the Trade Practices Commission in Australia. Those items are on the agenda for discussion between the two governments. I cannot say that all items covered by the question are on the agenda for discussion but it is recognised that, in the context of developing CER further, we must move from trade in goods and services to a whole range of harmonised activities over time. I cannot give a timetable for that. All I can say is that most of those matters are on the agenda for discussion with New Zealand and will be pursued gradually over the next year or so.

        The outcome of that decision and those negotiations was highly successful. In addition to reaping ongoing savings of the order of $11m a year in lower administration costs because the administration of the scheme will be handled by Westpac and not the Commonwealth bureaucracy, there is a premium of $100m gross paid by Westpac above the face value of the outstanding loans, or $85m net if one makes an adjustment for the timing of that payment. So the outcome was very satisfactory.

         â€”Yes, it does, including the Chief Executive, and from a variety of others. Indeed, the press comment on the science program announced on Tuesday was generally favourable. I was asked by Senator Childs particularly whether I was conscious of any serious or adverse criticism of the package announced by the Government. I am aware of two examples of very serious criticism because the condition of the people who made them can be described only as serious, if not terminal, if there is a reshuffle on the Opposition benches. The first criticism came from the Opposition spokesman on education, Mr Julian Beale, and the Opposition spokesman on science, Mr McGauran.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In a press release put out after the Government's statement Mr Beale indicated his complete lack of understanding of the policy initiatives behind the Prime Minister's Science Council. He said it would compete with the Australian Research Grants Committee and the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) for the disbursements of funds. The Council has nothing to do with that function. It is a coordinating body to bring together the various peak bodies and the scientific expertise in the country to plan and develop forward programs. Mr Beale concluded with a most revealing remark in the halcyon days that we have had this week:
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the verbal camouflage the clear message is this that this Government believes that there are no votes in science.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the message with which Mr Beale concludes. That seems to be a clear indication that it is Opposition policy, if Mr Beale has his way, to pursue policies related only to winning votes rather than establishing a structure for the development of science and technology in Australia into the future. It is also serious because it is confusing. I am not one given to personal explanations, but I noticed the ubiquitous Mr McGauran on television the other day explaining that I had told CSIRO that it was not allowed to sack anybody for a fortnight. I do not know where on earth he got that from. I will not bother to make a personal explanation about that sort of thing. He has an appalling ignorance of his shadow portfolio. For example, he claims that there has been a 28 per cent cut in the CSIRO's appropriation over the past five years. In fact, it was 17 per cent. He talks about a $40m shortfall in the CSIRO budget, which suggests that he gets all of his information from the Australian newspaper because that was a typographical error in the Australian. It said $40m when it meant $14m. For a responsible shadow Minister to say in a press release that that was the shortfall for CSIRO is extraordinary.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also takes the convenient figure of $20m off the top of his head and claims that is what is needed for infrastructure redevelopment, without presenting any evidence for this claim. He states in his press release that we provided an average of $18m a year for CSIRO, but ignores the substantial funds which will flow from external earnings and through flow-ons from industry taking advantage of the tax incentive. It is very difficult to work out which Opposition spokesman is correct about all of this-or less wrong. It is clear that the former, Mr Beale, cannot read and the second, Mr McGauran, cannot count. Their future as shadow Ministers must surely be in doubt and Mr Peacock, as a new leader enjoying a second honeymoon, has an opportunity on the basis of these sorts of press statements to do something about the Opposition's front bench.

Does not this points target plan conflict with the approach of the Government's partnership for development program, as it may lead to biased resource allocation between computer and telecommunications uses? If so, does this mean that the Government is finally abandoning the notion of corporate citizenship by embracing a points target plan for telecommunications equipment?

         â€”Senator Lewis's question requires a very detailed answer and I am not in a position to give that at the moment. Certainly I am aware of a proposal for the telecommunications equipment industry which has targets in respect of exports, research and development and local content. Senator Lewis did not mention that the proposal is of interim duration only; it is not intended to last forever. It has a sunset provision in it. The local content requirements are adjusted downwards, I recall, over the period. It is a transitional arrangement, not a fixed one. That makes a lot of difference to what I see as the burden of Senator Lewis's concern. Senator Lewis asked whether the plan is in conflict with the partnership for development program for the information industries generally. The answer to that question is no. I recall taking a considerable amount of time to ensure that there was no conflict between the two. I will obtain a more detailed answer to the other aspects of the question and provide it as soon as possible.

         â€”I recall the publicity associated with the animal experiments in the Antarctic last year. They particularly concerned the use of radioactive isotopes and anaesthetic on penguins. As a result of the concern honourable senators may recall that I suspended those research programs and instituted an inquiry into the animal research program in the Antarctic with particular reference to animal welfare considerations. The report examined the use of radioactive substances in experiments with animals, the use of anaesthetics in surgical procedures on animals, and possible alternative techniques to achieve the same objectives. A specialist group from within the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee was set up to examine the matter. The Chairman was Professor Gilmour, the Professor of Environmental Studies at Macquarie University. In general, the group commented very favourably upon the research programs of our Antarctic research expeditions. It stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The techniques used in current Antarctic research projects involving live animals are justified on conservation grounds and these techniques are being administered humanely. Australian Antarctic scientists are amongst the leaders in the development of the use of humane methods for collecting scientific data on Antarctic animals as an alternative to killing the animals which has been, and still is, a common practice in the research programs of some other nations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The working group pointed out, however, that there could be some improvements in the administrative procedures which were being used in that research program and in the handling of radioactive materials in particular. The report made a number of key recommendations. I accepted one of them, which was that the program which had been suspended should be resumed. I agreed with that. In addition, the working group recommended that there ought to be an animal care and ethics committee on a permanent basis and that a code of practice should be developed to cover our research involving Antarctic animals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The full title of the committee which has now been set up is the Antarctic Animal Care and Ionising Radiation Usage Ethics Committee. The Committee will report to the Director of the Antarctic Division and will receive all the necessary support from that Division to carry out its activities. The Committee's approval will be required in the future for any research programs which are to be undertaken in the Antarctic. More importantly, it will also be responsible for making sure that those programs are monitored. The membership of the Committee and its terms of reference are based on National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for animal ethics committees. That code of practice is currently being developed and I think it will be announced shortly. It will mean that our proposed experiments are properly examined and monitored and it should give some reassurance to those who have been concerned about whether our activities involving Antarctic animals have been humane.

There have been concerns about the effects these arrangements will have on part time general practitioners, who it is recognised will be predominantly women. The new arrangements are designed specifically to provide incentives for doctors to undertake vocational training appropriate to general practice, to participate in continuing medical education and quality assurance programs and to provide comprehensive primary medical care to all patients. Part time general practitioners who work at least two sessions a week in the same general practice will be considered by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to be in general practice for the purpose of enrolment. For those doctors who do not enrol, existing time-tiered fees will continue so that no patient or doctor will be disadvantaged.

Why has the Government paid so little attention to implementing equal employment opportunity programs in its own backyard?

Indeed, the components of the package that are now being paraded as if they are new and exciting were, in some part, proposals put by us, the Commonwealth, and in negotiations resisted by the State of Tasmania.

        The three elements of the package that I identify as ones to be settled are: how the plantation program is to be developed and organised, and what the management for intensive forestry will be; how the saw logs and veneer package, worth $7m, is to be allocated to improving the value added sector; and how the education, training and skills package, valued at $5m, is to be organised or arranged.

        I find this recycling of what is an old agreement somewhat surprising in the wake of the announcement by Mr Gray to go to an election. On the other hand, when I look at what the soon to be elected Premier of Tasmania, Michael Field, had to say on the fine furniture design and skills package, I find a set of fresh initiatives which are quite engaging and quite exciting, and the sort of thing that workers in forests or forest-based industries in Tasmania would want to support. The three things which form the basis of his package are: a furniture skills training centre in the Huon Valley; and expansion of the University of Tasmania's School of Art design in wood course; and marketing, business management and financial support to assist with the development of production facilities as the basis of a cogent and progressive policy for this industry.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. Is the Minister aware of a report, which recently appeared on the front page of the Melbourne Age, disclosing that Mr Justice Vincent of the Victorian Supreme Court had been approached for the position of Chairman of the National Crime Authority, but had subsequently declined the offer? As this information could only have come from the Minister or the Minister's office, will the Minister give the Senate an unequivocal assurance that he had no knowledge or awareness of this unauthorised disclosure? Notwithstanding this appalling breach of security, is the Minister aware of a later report in the Age indicating that a further incredibly inept approach was recently made to a Mr Peter Faris, QC, who believed that he was being offered the top job whereas, apparently, he was only being sounded out to be a member of the Authority? Is the end result that, with less than two months to go before the expiration of the term of the Chairman, not only does the Government have no successor in prospect, but one member has already announced his intention to retire and the other remaining member has threatened to retire unless offered the chairmanship? Finally, can the Minister explain the origin of the flood of damaging information which has led to the present fiasco and, in particular, can he tell the Senate why the Government is so opposed to the appointment as Chairman of Mr Peter Clark, a very capable and effective member of the Authority who is strongly supported by Mr Justice Stewart?

         â€”Thank goodness I was asked this question! The basic underlying theme of the question was that an inept approach has been made to certain persons in relation to their serving as members of the National Crime Authority, an authority which is absolutely crucial in the fight which is sanctioned by this Parliament against serious crime throughout Australia. It is vested with special coercive powers that are not available to other police forces throughout Australia. Therefore, its membership is extremely important. For that reason, in January or February the Attorney-General wrote to the other Attorneys and police Ministers around Australia seeking their thoughts about and nominees for the positions that fall vacant on 30 June this year.

        Rather than accept-which, of course, I do not-that the supposed leak concerning Mr Justice Vincent was somehow engineered by either my office, which it certainly was not, or the Attorney's office-I am quite confident it was not-I inform the Senate that the speculation which has attended the membership of the National Crime Authority has probably done some damage to the morale of those involved in the work of the Authority, and that is extremely unfortunate. I wish that that had not occurred. The approach to Mr Peter Faris, QC, rather than being inept, has resulted today in his acceptance of the position of Chairman of the National Crime Authority. Indeed, I am delighted that Mr Peter Faris has accepted the position which has been offered to him. Mr Faris is a leading member of the Victorian Bar, specialising in criminal law, and has acted as prosecutor in many major State and Federal prosecutions over the past five years. This work has included cases initiated by the National Crime Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Faris was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Victorian Supreme Court in 1963. He went to the Bar in 1970, was a founder of the Fitzroy Legal Service in 1972 and solicitor for the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service from 1973-74. He returned to the Bar in 1975, taking silk in 1986. He is presently Chairman of the committee of review of Victorian drug laws-a committee of the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions. It is evident that this appointment, which has been eagerly awaited both by the staff and personnel associated with the National Crime Authority and by all those associated with the fight against organised crime, marks a milestone as we now have a successor to Mr Justice Stewart, who has played a leading role in creating the situation under which the National Crime Authority has been at the forefront of the fight against organised crime. I hope that over the next week or so, with the consultations that take place with other agencies and organisations, the membership of the National Crime Authority will be completed well in time for the handover on 30 June.

Is it the case that Mr Vel was accepted as a client by the Australian Legal Aid Office (ALAO) in May 1985 in the matter of his dismissal, which he believed to be unfair, and his appeal was subsequently halted by Legal Aid in December 1986? Was Mr Vel's file given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on 24 July 1987 in order to review his claims, but was he not told until August 1988 that he was required to lodge a separate application concerning issues other than his dismissal from the Department of Defence? Was Mr Vel then informed that, as his application was not lodged within one year of his last contact with the Australian Legal Aid Office, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission could not act on his claim? Can the Minister explain these circumstances to the Senate and assure the Senate that everything which can now be done for Mr Vel is being done?

         â€”Senator McLean made me aware of some of the elements of his question so I have somewhat prepared an answer. Firstly, I am aware that Mr Vel commenced his hunger strike on 24 April 1989. Secondly, the Commonwealth is not able to provide information in relation to Mr Vel's legal aid matters. These matters are completely within the control of the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission. If the honourable senator were to approach that Commission with Mr Vel's authority, it may be able to assist. Thirdly, Mr Vel's file relating to a race discrimination complaint against the Department of Defence was formally referred by the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on 13 April 1988. The Board had declined the matter as lacking in substance and Mr Vel had exercised his right to have the matter referred to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for inquiry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In March 1988 Mr Vel first raised an issue regarding the ALAO and on 10 August 1988 lodged a written request to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that these complaints be joined. On 11 August 1988 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission advised that that joinder was not possible as the complaint against ALAO related to issues other than those arising under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, but that the Commission would carefully examine any other possible action within its jurisdiction. After careful consideration the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission advised Mr Vel in March 1989 that his complaint against the ALAO was outside its jurisdiction on a number of grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourthly, Mr Vel's case against the Department of Defence has been set down for hearing before the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on 19 May 1989. I have been assured by that Commission that everything that can reasonably be expected to be done for Mr Vel has been done and will continue to be done. As the Commission is an independent statutory authority charged with responsibility for making decisions under the enactments it administers, it is not appropriate for the Attorney-General to intervene in Mr Vel's case.

I also noticed that, perhaps as a desperate last move, before the by-election in Queensland at the weekend, the Premier of Queensland has made an offer to reduce the freight rates although that offer has been received with a great deal of suspicion by the coal industry in Queensland, and rightly, because of the huge impost-the hidden taxation-on the coal industry by virtue of the freight rates. The industry's performance has slipped considerably in 1986-87. Coal production was down by 4 per cent in Queensland in 1986 and employment fell by 867 or 8 per cent in Queensland because of that. The industry faces a more optimistic future because of a tightening of the world market, but is still in a very highly competitive international environment and the freight rates are one of the biggest single costs on the industry.

        Dr Brian Galligan, a political scientist from the Australian National University, in a paper entitled Queensland Railways and Export Coal published in the Australian Journal of Public Administration in March 1987 estimated that the rail freight surcharge for Queensland coal in 1985-86 was $354m. Using the same type of analysis that Dr Galligan has used, the Queensland rail freight surcharge in 1986-87 would have risen to a massive $399m in 1987 and $376m in 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        Queensland freight rates are a hidden tax and they are used by the Queensland Government to subsidise other activities. Because they are a hidden tax, there is no scrutiny of them. We do not know accurately how much tax has been imposed. Therefore, we do not know how the tax is reallocated, and this enables the Queensland Government to pretend that Queensland is a low taxing State when, in fact, it is not. The imposition of the freight rates masks the real level of taxation in Queensland. I think the most important point from an export point of view is that it is a tax on exports. This is a tax on the coal industry and it is a flat tax on volume of production in the form of freight transport. At a time in which the Australian coal industry is struggling to rationalise internally and compete in tight international markets, the Queensland Government is retarding the ability of the industry to do that by imposing this pernicious tax.

        There has been international action in response to the massacre in Burundi. In August 1988, at the request of the 40th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights' Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, the UN Secretary General sent a message to the President of Burundi expressing concern about the massacre in Burundi and indicating the readiness of the UN to provide assistance, particularly in respect of displaced persons. The Government would of course support the provision of UN assistance to the victims of the violence in Burundi.

        I reject the implicit suggestion that the human rights situations in Burundi and South Africa require precisely similar responses from Australia. In South Africa, the policy of Apartheid and the violence used to support it are systematic and institutionalised. Australia's response is intended to place pressure on the South African Government to change longstanding policies. The situation in Burundi, by contrast, was characterised by a relatively short-term outburst of inter-communal violence which subsided quickly. It is difficult to see what constructive and effective intervention the international community could have made at that time, beyond condemning the abuse of human rights and calling on all those involved to refrain from further violence. This is precisely what Australia and a number of other countries have done.

         â€”Yesterday during Question Time Senator Hill asked Senator Bolkus, as the Minister representing me in my absence, about the missing yacht Patanela and what the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and other Federal authorities were doing about it. I am aware of concerns regarding attempts by State and Commonwealth authorities to locate the yacht Patanela and its crew. I can only comment on Commonwealth actions in this case.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In November 1988 the yacht Patanela was reported missing off the coast of New South Wales. I am informed that the sea safety branch of the Department of Transport and Communications notified Interpol in November 1988 indicating that relevant authorities in Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Caledonia had been informed that the yacht was missing. The AFP was subsequently informed that the yacht was missing. Of course, the AFP has neither the jurisdiction nor a capacity to mount searches for missing vessels. Its responsibility in such cases is to determine whether there has been a breach of Commonwealth law. In that regard the AFP has undertaken extensive inquiries throughout Australia and overseas in an effort to establish the vessel's movements and in particular to determine whether the vessel is still afloat and its crew alive. Those inquiries are continuing, but the AFP advises that in the circumstances it is concerned for the welfare of the crew.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition the Interpol Secretariat has advised all member nations of the disappearance of the vessel and requested that they maintain a watch for it. Full descriptions and photographs of the vessel have been forwarded as part of this request. I have been in contact with one of Senator Hill's House of Representatives colleagues-I cannot recall his name at the moment-who has also been in correspondence with me on this issue. Perhaps I could make that file of correspondence available to Senator Hill.

         The need for the government to reassess its powers in relation to the woodchipping industry of southeastern New South Wales in view of the widespread public opposition to the destruction of a fast diminishing area of mature forest in the region, and, in particular, the need for the government to exercise its responsibilities to protect the Australian environment under the Heritage Act and under the terms of the Harris Daishowa woodchipping licence, and to take into account the:

         â€”Today I use the only opportunity that I will be given during this term of parliament to raise a matter of public importance to raise a matter that I believe to be of great public importance to many thousands of Australians, not just those who live in the south-east forests. While I understand that matters of great import have been announced within the last couple of days, I believe that the question of the future use of this country's resources is in the long run a much more momentous decision than who sits in which deck chair on the Titanic as it sinks.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am raising this matter today as I know that the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) is on the verge of making a decision that will determine not only the fate of the forests in the Eden woodchip concession area of south-eastern New South Wales, but also will set the tone for the future use of the resources in this country. In particular, this will be a guage of the Government's commitment to sustainable forest industry, one in which jobs, as well as the environment, may be preserved in the long term for the future benefit of all Australians, and not just sectional interests in the population.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is my belief that the Government, and in particular Senator Cook, needs to exercise imagination in the solution of what has been a very vexatious problem in the Eden region, one which has divided the community unnecessarily. This division could be held almost instantaneously by a wise decision by the Government which would and could satisfy the apparently conflicting demands in the local community. Nearly 500 people, including myself, have been prepared to be arrested over this issue. Threats have been made against individuals living in the area and some have taken out their frustrations on the wildlife. It was with great distress that I recently learned that five koalas had been shot in the Tantawangalo area some years ago. If the Government does not make the right decision, this divisiveness will continue and nobody will be satisfied. The forests could be lost; the wildlife would disappear; the jobs would decline with the diminishing resources; and the beautiful old-growth trees would be lost as a source of mental and spiritual rejuvenation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is my contention that in the face of the extraordinary obduracy by the New South Wales Government, particularly by the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources, Ian Causley, in failing to provide the vital information that Senator Cook needs, the Federal Government must take a leading role in the resolution of the problem and exercise the powers it has under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act and in the drafting of the conditions for the woodchip licence. Section 30 (1) of the Heritage Act reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Each Minister shall give all such directions and do all such things as, consistently with any relevant laws, can be given or done by him for ensuring that the Department administered by him or any authority of the Commonwealth in respect of which he has ministerial responsibilities does not take any action that adversely affects, as part of the National Estate, a place that is in the Register unless he is satisfied that there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the taking of that action and that all measures that can reasonably be taken to minimise the adverse effect will be taken and shall not himself take any such action unless he is so satisfied.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday I asked Senator Cook whether he had sought the information necessary to make a judgment on such feasible and prudent alternatives to logging in the National Estate. His reply suggested that he had sought the information but had not yet received it. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Have I requested information from my Department on the Forestry Commission of NSW? Yes, I have. Am I aware of my statutory obligation to find prudent and feasible alternatives? Yes, I am. The reason why I have requested that information is to be properly informed to make a responsible judgment on prudent and feasible alternatives so that when I have my next meeting with the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources, Ian Causley, I am able to have the informational base to assert the consideration of prudent and feasible alternatives that I will make.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe Senator Cook has yet met with Mr Causley, nor yet received the information he requires. He has been waiting months for this information from the New South Wales Forestry Commission and the Minister. That he has not yet received it can only mean that the Forestry Commission of New South Wales, perhaps because it has something to hide, is being uncooperative or that it is keeping poor records.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much of the debate about the value of the south-east forests centres on their conservation value. I suppose Senator Cook and others know that I have been involved as an editor for a very long time in a long term series of studies conducted by Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service officer, Dan Lunney. Mr Lunney was directed by the New South Wales Cabinet in 1979 to research the effects of woodchipping on the wildlife of the region. He has produced some 20 papers in which he conclusively demonstrates the deleterious impact of woodchipping on the native fauna of the region. I will read into the record some of the conclusions of his many studies. In a paper entitled `Kangaroos, wallabies and rat kangaroos: their past, present and future in the woodchip agreement area of the Eden region, south-east New South Wales', Daniel Lunney states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . there is a strong case to suggest that the current areas set aside, or designated to be set aside from woodchipping, are inadequate for the long-term survival of all macropodid and potoroid populations in the Woodchip Agreement Area, particularly away from the coast, and that a major revision of both land-use and land management options is warranted.
       </para>
       <para>
        In another study Dan Lunney and Tanya Leary have produced, `The impact on native mammals of land use changes and exotic species in the Bega district, New South Wales, since settlement', published in the Australian Journal of Ecology last year, it is stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        If the remaining forest habitats are cleared or intensively logged or managed without detailed knowledge of the resident wildlife, it can be concluded from historical records that further extinctions will be inevitable, particularly of those species that have now become uncommon or rare in the district and are known to be dependent upon the remaining mature forest habitat . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In this context, the current plan (Forestry Commission of NSW 1982) to log a substantial proportion of the State Forests for woodchips and sawlogs by the year 2010 will undoubtedly continue the deleterious impact of the European invasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        In another study, `Roost selection by Gould's long-eared bat . . . in logged forest on the south coast of New South Wales', by Daniel Lunney and others, the conclusion is:
       </para>
       <para>
        The second logging cycle, due before the turn of the century, will remove most of the remaining suitable roost trees before they have been replaced in the coupes logged in the first cycle. Therefore we conclude that the second logging cycle, under the current logging plan (Forestry Commission of NSW 1982), will have a major deleterious impact on the survival of N. gouldi unless gullies are redefined to include all drainage lines and that these remain unlogged. An additional strategy, to maintain a range of larger tree sizes, is to extend to more than a century the time over which the second logging cycle takes place.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Jurasius hearing in March of last year, Mr Justice Hemmings concluded:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am satisfied that as a consequence of the nature of the activity-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, woodchipping-
       </para>
       <para>
        it is likely that many species of fauna will be adversely affected by the current logging operations and this effect is likely to be compounded by fire. I am also satisfied that if the current logging operations continue for a long term it is likely that arboreal populations could significantly change, particularly if regrowth forests fail to provide adequate habitats for birds and mammals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst it is apparent that tree dwelling birds and mammals are not evenly distributed in the region, I am satisfied that existing management procedures and prescriptions do not guarantee the maintenance of composition and description.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other papers, but I am running out of time. These other papers suggest that the present system of parks and reserves is inadequate for conserving the full range of ecosystems in the region. An earlier paper I quoted from supported exactly that point.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Estate areas have been recognised as being of particular value. I know that Dr Harry Recher, who was a co-author with me on an ecology book published some 10 years ago and which won a prize from the Royal Australian Zoological Society, has worked closely with the Forestry Commission. In a 1987 study, he recommended certain new prescriptions for dealing with wildlife management in the region. One of his findings was that large, specially selected patches of unlogged mature forest should be left in the compartments of the logging areas now and until the regeneration on adjacent logged areas is mature in 100 to 150 years from now. Dr Recher is very critical of the Forestry Commission and says that it has refused to take up those recommendations. Last month, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I've attempted to cooperate with the Forestry Commission and Harris Daishowa to develop wildlife management policies in the context of a continuing woodchip industry, but they no longer appear willing to implement such policies . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of this, the only way the conservation of wildlife can now be assured in the region is by the creation of new national parks immediately.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is excellent that the Government has recognised the value of the National Estate areas and has put Tantawangalo and Coolangubra on the list. We know that under section 6 (c) of Coolangubra's export licence condition Daishowa is not supposed to take pulpwood for export from these areas, yet the District Forester, Tony Howe, admitted on local radio that the company was extracting pulpwood from Coolangubra. In a remarkable display of casuistry-a word that I find myself having to use more frequently than I care to in this place-Senator Cook denied that the wood had been extracted for export. He said it had been quarantined, whereas I maintained it had been stockpiled. He wrote to Rick Humphries of the Australian Conservation Foundation as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . this material from Coolangubra is quarantined and may not be ever approved for export.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whatever word is used, the effect is exactly the same. Daishowa had cut the wood from a National Estate area and was leaving it on the ground in the hope of getting permission to export it. If that permission could not be obtained, the wood was going to be burned or left to rot away and be good for nothing. At least two lawyers disagreed with Senator Cook in relation to this matter. Mr A. Robertson, of Wentworth Chambers, last month wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it is no answer to say that no approval has yet been given for export of pulp wood already extracted. It does not appear that a further approval is necessary. Any approval must be given beforehand to avoid a failure to comply with the condition or restriction.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end Mr Robertson says:
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, in my opinion, on the basis of my instructions the company may not have complied with the condition or restriction to which it was subject by virtue of regulation 9 and clause 6 (c) of the schedule. My reason for this conclusion is that the condition or restriction is directed to the operation of extracting pulp wood for export as woodchips and the Department did not, before that extraction took place, notify the company in writing that the proposed operations were acceptable to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is another decision supporting that of Mr Robertson, by Nicholas Seddon from the Faculty of Law at the Australian National University. I ask Senator Cook whether this means that Daishowa could cut out the entire forests of the National Estate areas and leave the timber on the ground in expectation of permission to export, and whether he could or would do nothing about it. That is the logical extension of his argument. If that is the case, section 6 (c) is nothing but a paper tiger.

         â€”Good point. Senator Cook is very proud of section 6 (c), which, he says, he inserted in the export licence to give him a belt-and-braces control over cutting in the National Estate areas. Well, I am afraid that the belt and braces are slack and the senator's pants are in danger of falling down.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Daishowa has committed other breaches of its licence conditions. It is clear that wood suitable for saw logs is being taken to the chip mill for pulp wood-I saw this for myself when I was there-and there have been serious-and, I believe, credible-allegations that the company is taking wood from unauthorised areas. Yesterday, when I asked Senator Cook about these matters, he avoided answering me directly, so I ask him again today: is he prepared to request records of tonnages going over the weighbridge into the chip mill?
       </para>
       <para>
        The third matter that I want to address is a question on which timber workers and conservationists are in 100 per cent agreement-that is, the necessity of establishing a sustainable resource that is managed both for its conservation values and for long-term employment. But let us put this in an economic context and look at the contribution that Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd-or should I just say Daishowa?-has made to Australia since it started in the early 1970s. Firstly, it is a wholly Japanese owned company. The Federal and State governments at the time allowed this on condition that Australian equity would be sought in the future. That did not happen, so our largest woodchip export scheme, and one of our most significant forest industries, remains 100 per cent foreign-owned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, in the first eight years of operation the company declared its profits and paid no tax, but at the same time its parent company rose to third position among Japan's huge paper manufacturers and made after-tax profits of $26m in that same period. This meant that the Australian subsidiary was selling its woodchips to the parent company-that is, to itself-for the costs of production. As a result, Australia missed out on taxes for those earnings, and Daishowa still has little incentive to increase its prices and, hence, pay additional taxes to Australia when it is selling chips to itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, Australia receives the lowest price per tonne for its woodchips of all the major exporters to Japan, despite the fact that our chips are of the highest quality and are the most uniform. Why the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, does not set better prices is a mystery. Some cynics say that our forests are thrown in to support continuing coal exports from New South Wales. Senators may not know that Daishowa has also received considerable funding from State and Federal governments over the years. It received at least $600,000 in export expansion grants from the Fraser Government. A reduction of $400,000 was made by the New South Wales Government in the company's royalty payment to help it to build a road to the mill, and the company also received a $125,000 grant from the New South Wales Government to help in the housing of company employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, the royalties paid by Daishowa have been low. Last year they amounted to about $12m, with about $60m in annual export revenue-a drop in the bucket compared to a wood product trade deficit of about $1.5 billion. This is a very small amount when we consider that we have given over nearly 300,000 hectares of State forest to the industry. Our woodchips are then manufactured in Japan and sold back to us at vastly inflated prices. The industry now directly employs about 136 people, with 1,500 dependants, but it is the least labour-intensive of the forest industries. As woodchipping replaces sawmilling, the employment opportunities diminish. Employment in Australian forest industries fell by 25 per cent, or 26,000 jobs, between 1970 and 1985 and can be expected to continue falling.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nobody likes to see our old native-growth forests being sold off for a song, and everybody would like to see the development of a sustainable industry-even Senator Cook, who said last year;
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . woodchipping is the lowest value, lowest effort way to export forest products. Relying on exports of woodchips sells short the resources on which our children depend.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a recent rally in Canberra, Senator McMullan said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is important that this country move to a situation where we are able to sustain a level of forestry operations which does not further denude our remaining native forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        Logging operations in Australia should not be carried out in our priceless natural forests. Forestry operations should move to plantations on previously cleared land.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, people in the Federal Government oppose the current operations at Eden.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) and other conservation groups have put forward detailed proposals for the development of labour-intensive hardwood plantations across the country. The ACF publication The Wood and the Trees argues for the establishment of between 250,000 and 405,000 hectares of eucalypt plantations over the next 15 to 30 years, to be introduced at the rate of about 10,000 hectares per year. It is clear that what is required is a rapid transition of the industry to a plantation-based industry, improved resource utilisation, and a greater commitment to value-added processing of extracted timber, yet in the 20 years since the establishment of Daishowa no feasibility studies have been carried out. These are essential in evaluating the full range of policy options pertaining to the conservation of the region's native forests and the development of an ecologically sustainable and economically viable forest industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge Senator Cook to give the matters that I have raised the most serious consideration before he makes his final decision. I urge him to give the same consideration to Senator Richardson's recommendations. Two hundred thousand people have put their names on a petition; 9,000 have written to Bob Hawke; 500 have been arrested. Clearly this is a major election issue. I should like to see a wise decision on the part of the Federal Government and on the part of Senator Cook. I remind him that former Premier Neville Wran regarded the conservation of the New South Wales rainforests as one of his Government's greatest achievements. Let us hope that one of the Federal Government's greatest achievements will be the conservation and the sound economic and sustainable management of the south-east forests of New South Wales.

         â€”First of all, I want to thank Senator Dunn for introducing this matter for debate. Not often enough do we debate matters of real import to the community. This is an opportunity to debate one of them, and I acknowledge the honourable senator's effort in bringing it forward for that purpose. It would have been better had the debate been arranged for the next meeting week of the Senate. That would have enabled me, as I said yesterday, to hold a meeting with the Minister for Natural Resources in New South Wales, Ian Causley, and to put to him the Commonwealth Government's positive proposition on how the woodchipping licence should be written so as to protect the areas of great environmental sensitivity in the south-east forests. Then the debate could have been about the substance of what the Commonwealth would do and was proposing to do, rather than about what it may do. Much of this debate is jumping at shadows over what may happen. We could have had a better informed debate if we had been dealing with what was proposed. However, I acknowledge the purpose of the debate and I thank Senator Dunn for it.

        I also acknowledge that Senator Dunn has deep convictions on this subject. I respect and acknowledge her convictions. In what I am about to say I will not be attacking those convictions, but I do disagree with her argument in support of them. Before going to the text of what I want to say, let me correct a couple of comments that the honourable senator made as to fact. First, there was the question of whether or not Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd sells to itself in Japan at a price below the market price. If it did it would be engaging in transfer pricing and committing an offence under the tax Act. The prices at which Harris-Daishowa sells is part of the export approval process and must be approved by the Commonwealth Government before an export licence is granted. Those prices are considered against a basket of prices for woodchip sales from companies elsewhere in Australia to other companies in Japan where, to the extent that there is a market in woodchips, there is a free market. That free market level is regarded as a benchmark for the purposes of assessing those prices. Secondly, the price of woodchips obtained for the Australian product is compared with the price of woodchips from other sources around the world. I disagree with Senator Dunn that there is a transfer pricing component and that Australian woodchips sell for the lowest price in the world. As a matter of record and of fact, those comments are not true. Senator Dunn's matter of public importance today states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The need for the government to reassess its powers in relation to the woodchipping industry of southeastern New South Wales . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It raises a question which is basic to this debate and to the way in which the public approach to this debate has been clouded. The question fundamentally is: What are the responsibilities and powers of the Commonwealth of Australia on this issue and what are the responsibilities and powers of the State of New South Wales? Let me go to the facts. We operate in this Parliament under the Federal Constitution. That Constitution was composed by the colonies before 1901. It consists of what work they did, what powers have been ceded by the States since, and what has been decided by the people of Australia in referenda and how it has been interpreted by the High Court of Australia. Under that Constitution and under the set of powers it confers on me as a Minister of State and on this Government, we do not have, as a government, the power to manage the forests in any of the States of Australia. Therefore we do not have and cannot take responsibility for the way in which those forests are managed. The constitutional responsibility for that rests with the States. Some people in this chamber may wish it to be otherwise. Honourable senators to some extent may well count me in on that. But that is the situation. It is with what exists that we must deal, not with what we would wish to exist.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Constitution what powers do I have? The specific power that I have in this particular case is the power of approving export. In the process of approving export I have attached to export licences, as have my predecessors in office, conditions relating to where the materials that are to be exported are drawn from. That exercise of power by the Commonwealth has so far gone unchallenged. I say `unchallenged' because it has not been tested. If it were tested there might be a cloudy result; I do not know. I believe we have that power. On the basis of believing that we have that power, we have imposed conditions of that nature. It is about those conditions, how far the Commonwealth can impose them and what are reasonable conditions, that we are talking about when we talk about the Commonwealth's power.
       </para>
       <para>
        That leads me to where the Opposition is fundamentally misdirected in relation to logging in the south-eastern forest. It is fundamentally misdirected because the State of New South Wales-which manages the New South Wales Forestry Commission, which manages the forests, which determines the sequence of cuts and which has set up the environmental impact statement to justify proceeding-has primary carriage. If there is opposition to what the State of New South Wales is proposing that is where the opposition should be directed, not to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would feel more convinced about the argument that is put if in last year's New South Wales election campaign, when the Unsworth Government proposed the declaration of vast areas of the south-east forest as a national park, the effort that is now being put into lobbying the Commonwealth was put into returning the Unsworth Government and thus protecting the forests in the way in which the Unsworth Government at that time proposed. But the environmental movement, as a matter of record-this is a matter of great pity to it and one of great sorrow to me-chose to stand out of that election and not to support a Labor government with a positive program in that State. After doing that and getting the election result that it did-the return of a conservative government-it comes to the Labor Government in the Federal arena and says, `Now use your lesser powers, to fix up a situation which we didn't take political action to fix up when we could have in the New South Wales election'. That is a fundamental criticism that is justifiably made of the environmental movement and the way in which it has prosecuted its claims. I regret that this criticism has to be made; it is a matter of fact that it has to be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the basis of that, let me recite where we are up to in this circumstance. On 29 December 1988, after tabling in the Senate the documents that led me to a conclusion and after tabling the principles upon which I based my decision, I issued a woodchip export licence for Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd subject to negotiation with the State of New South Wales on what areas of the forest should be properly protected. Since then I have had three negotiations with the State of New South Wales. I am as yet to arrive at a conclusion with it on an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State on the areas to be protected and on a number of other things touching on the timber industry in New South Wales. These include questions such as how to prevent logs that ought to go to sawmills going to a woodchipper and how to ensure that the maximum extraction is obtained from sawlogs and a minimum, therefore, of waste material is generated for woodchipping. Those negotiations, I expect, will conclude next week. Ian Causley and I are still trying to find in our itineraries next week a time when we can meet to have what I expect will be the last round of negotiations. They are certainly running well over time. I think that that is common ground among all those concerned with this debate that it is well over time that this matter was resolved. That is where we are up to.
       </para>
       <para>
        What am I operating on? I am operating on a number of fundamental principles that this Government holds dear and on some statutory obligations that I am bound to observe. When I say bound to observe, I am happily bound to observe them, I might add. The first and most fundamental statutory obligation that is imposed on me in the issuance of this licence is to obtain advice on what the environmental consequences of the cutting would be. To obtain that information I have consulted my colleague Senator Richardson, who has advised me. In consultation with each other we have released publicly his advice to me so that it is a matter of public record so that what this Government does is out in the open and transparent and that can be judged on the judgments we make rather than on assumptions people may make about the evidentiary base upon which those judgments are made.
       </para>
       <para>
        The advice from Senator Richardson was obtained because the direct statutory obligation is that under the Australian Heritage Commission Act I am required to find if cutting involves areas of national estate `prudent and feasible alternatives to cutting in the national estate'. I make the passing observation that the obligation to find prudent and feasible alternatives does not mean to say that there will never be any cutting in the National Estate. It means that if cutting is contemplated there has to be a sincere, conscientious and genuine effort by the Government to find alternatives before countenancing the possibility of cutting in the National Estate.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a matter of fact that cutting occurs in the National Estate in Australia. It is not a matter of fact that the National Estate is not cut. But when it is cut it is cut only after that exhaustive process and we are satisfied about prudent and feasible alternatives. It is cut in such a way as to preserve the environmental features of that area and in a way sensitive to the environmental concerns of that area. On the basis of that obligation I have taken-what is a fair cop for me-an undue amount of time in satisfying myself about that criterion. Fundamentally I have an obligation to discharge logically and reasonably that that criterion has been properly met. The proposal I intend to put to the New South Wales Government next week, if that is the time of the meeting, will, I believe, discharge that obligation properly. It will be open to public scrutiny. I will welcome criticism and comment on it. I believe it will be a sustainable position for the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have also said-and I repeat here-that there are other criteria too that guide me. I think there need to be other criteria. In this issue it is not simply a matter of looking at the environmental consequences. As Senator Dunn has said, we have a timber industry in Australia which is $1.5 billion in deficit. I think the recent figure is more horrendous; it is now $1.6 billion in deficit. That means that we import more timber than we export-an extra $1.6 billion net for forest products. That means that we in Australia acquiesce in the cutting of other nations' forests to feed our timber industry needs or we allow other nations to add value to the products such as woodchips we export. We buy back fine paper, for example-the highest commodity that can be obtained from the woodchip production cycle.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find both those ideas objectionable. One of the purposes of my portfolio is to try to get to a position in which we do not cut down other people's forests. Some nations where we acquiesce in that cutting have environmental standards that I, frankly, find horrendous and which are less than those of Australia. I therefore think we ought to move to a degree of self-sufficiency in the timber industry. Another idea is that we should do the value adding in Australia. On the grounds that these things are essential, the criteria that I have publicly announced are criteria relating to the protection of the saw mill industry in the south-east; meeting the licence condition for Harris-Daishowa; and meeting environmental considerations. We cannot separate these criteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the way in which this debate has been presented in this chamber we have heard an argument from the environmental side that was very well presented and necessary in the debate. But we need to hear the industry argument as well. There is a lack of sensitivity. Timber industry workers in Australia are among the lower paid workers, the most poorly educated workers. Because of the regional nature of their industry, they are located in geographically isolated pockets around the country. Some have invested their small savings into home ownership in those regions. If overnight we were to devastate that industry we would do a grievous disservice to people who ought not to bear the responsibility for structural reform in this country. As far as I am concerned, the party that I represent as a Minister exists to see that such people do not bear the burden of that structural reform. In that context I want to say that the basis of this Government's approach to how we manage the forest industry policy and deal with genuine, sincere and necessary environmental concerns is the key issue that ought to be considered. It is not simply a matter of arguing the purity of one position and ignoring the points that the other side has to put. They are essential and necessary points to be considered in arriving at a balanced outcome. I do not accuse Senator Dunn of that. She has tried to make the effort to meet the other side of the argument. But I do say that, in the public presentation of the argument and the way it comes across, there is a media conflict. It is one or the other. One must prevail at the cost of the other.
       </para>
       <para>
        What this Government is concerned about is finding the right balance between both points of view so that that conflict is obviated. Our guiding star in that course is the national conservation strategy for Australia. We adopt that as the foundation of our approach. We also adopt the idea of environmentally safe development, using as our text the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future. That is the approach that this Government uses. On that basis I have propounded the idea of a forests accord which recognises the aspirations of the industry, the environment and the legitimate aspirations of the wider Australian community. I believe the community also has a distinctly different aspiration in this.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that basis I have argued strongly at the Australian Forestry Council, a meeting of all Australian Forest Ministers including the Commonwealth, and have obtained endorsement for a national plantation strategy for Australia. This industry does not need continuing conflict over environmentally sensitive matters. No-one in industry wants that. That point needs to be emphasised. What people want is security of resource. They want security of resource so that they can develop their industry, plan their investment and plan their industry growth. In my view, security of resource is obtained, particularly in the woodchipping industry-it is more difficult on the saw log side-through a plantation strategy which expands the resource base, dedicates resource to the needs of woodchip, pulp and paper manufactures and enables security of employment and the overcoming of anxieties for timber workers in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That notion is the centrepoint of the accord I have propounded. I am pleased to see that at least elements of the accord have now begun to catch on, in the public debate, as things that need to be endorsed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has also done a number of positive things, as recently as November, to try to obtain a logical and rational framework for carrying on this debate. In November last year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that we would set up a resource assessment commission. Legislation for that is before the other House right now. It will be before this chamber shortly. It is up to the resource assessment commission to make a balanced assessment of the conflicting needs of industry and the environment in an objective way in which the parties propounding particular points of view can come before it and be heard. That commission will be established to operate from 1 July. One of the first references will be the study of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). I acknowledge the very positive role of the ACF in its study The Wood and the Trees. I also acknowledge the industry plan for growth in Australia. The resolution of the competing views in those two studies will start to develop the framework.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before my time runs out I should also mention the second major step. We are embarking on a national forest inventory which will include a study of old growth forest in Australia. The forest stock in this country will be calibrated so that we know what areas are key to an environmental perspective and what areas are key to an industry perspective. We have bolstered funding to the Heritage Commission and streamlined its procedures. We have done a number of things to encourage State governments to follow the Western Australian Government proposal of establishing a tree trust to generate investment in plantations both in the private sector and the public sector.

         â€”When this debate commenced I thought I would be spending most of my time simply making reference to one or two of the specific details of Senator Dunn's motion such as those related to the question of the powers of the Commonwealth and its responsibilities under the Heritage Act. However, I find myself compelled instead to answer a number of points raised by Senator Cook in his presentation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Firstly, Senator Cook raises the issue of what the Commonwealth's real powers are. He says in part that the Commonwealth cannot take responsibility for the way forests are managed. That is true in only the most narrow and limited sense. Certainly the Commonwealth does not have direct power or responsibility as the manager of the forests in New South Wales. However, at the end of the day, it is the Commonwealth's decision as to whether there can be export of woodchips or pulp-and, indeed, what terms and conditions should be imposed upon any such export licences. Senator Cook and the Commonwealth Government cannot get themselves away from the clear responsibility that they have to be satisfied that resources are managed in a way which they find sufficiently satisfactory to allow an export licence to be granted. The Fraser Government had no difficulty in addressing its mind to this matter over the question of sand mining on Fraser Island. It would have been just as easy for the Fraser Government to say, `Sandmining in Queensland is no responsibility of ours and therefore we do not accept any degree of responsibility.' We made it clear that an export licence on that occasion would not be granted and as a result of the clear exercise of Commonwealth power, environmental protection was extended over activities taking place within State jurisdiction, and there is nothing wrong with that and there is no reason for the Commonwealth to shirk that responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point that Senator Cook made to the environment movement is, `Don't come complaining to me. What you should have done was organise support for Barrie Unsworth'. What a pathetic argument that is. `If you wanted to come around and have any credibility with me,' says Senator Cook, `what you should have done was put the runs on the board for poor old Barrie'. Frankly, it is not a good enough argument for him to come along today and say, `If only you had done the right thing by poor old Barrie I might have been prepared to listen to you a little more sympathetically. Go away. That is my fundamental criticism'-his words-`of the environmental movement'. It is not that they are wrong on the facts, not that they are wrong in what they are asking him to do, but they did not back his Party at the last New South Wales State election. That seems to me to be just about the most pathetic argument I have heard even Senator Cook use in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then he says, `Poor me. It is a fair cop for me,'-as if he were some refugee from Division 4 or Homicide-`to have taken an undue amount of time to think about this matter'. I understand that the Minister's time is precious and that he does not want to waste it, but is it not terrible that he actually has to think about these issues for an undue amount of time? What a terrible situation. Then he comes along and says, `We have a $1.6 billion deficit. Why don't we do something about it? We have to address our minds to that question'. Yet the people who want to develop something in terms of downstream processing of pulp mills in this country cannot get from the Government a clear set of guidelines so that they know upon what basis they can make their investments in order to secure some value added in the timber industry. Finally he says, `I am not going to let my mates the timber workers take the responsibility on their shoulders for bearing the burden of structural adjustment'. He should go up to Ravenshoe and peddle that line if he is going to say, in terms of Queensland, that he or the Government will take certain action and that the timber workers of north Queensland are to bear the burden. Remember Senator Burns's earlier comments about forestry industry workers in Queensland who did nothing but enjoy cutting down trees and had never done anything about replanting them.

         â€”That is right. Again he says that that is right-people in the timber industry in Queensland have never taken any responsibility to replant trees. Here is poor old Senator Cook saying, `I am in there for the timber workers', and Senator Burns is talking about the rotten timber workers in Queensland. Frankly, the Government ought to get its act together. Finally Senator Cook comes along and says, `All of our problems are going to be based upon taking as a fundamental starting point the national conservation strategy for Australia'. I welcome that endorsement of a Fraser Government initiative.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I turn specifically to the wording of Senator Dunn's motion. I shall make two comments about the precise wording:
       </para>
       <para>
        The need for the government to reassess its powers . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think that the Government needs to reassess its powers. Its powers are clear; its powers are definite; its powers have been exercised in the past. It is not a matter of reassessing its powers; it is a matter of making decisions and exercising the powers which exist. The second thing she says in her motion is:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the need for the government to exercise its responsibilities to protect the Australian environment under the Heritage Act . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 30 of the Heritage Act in fact imposes conditions upon the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities in a particular regard and I do not believe that in fact it is simply the narrow comforts of the heritage Act which need to be focused on in this debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to say a couple of things about the specifics of the Eden woodchip licence decision and about the policies to which my party and the National Party have pledged themselves in terms of forest policy in Australia. On 9 January I issued a press statement headed `Eden woodchip licence' in which I said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision over the grant of an export woodchip licence to the Japanese firm Daishowa has been marked by yet further displays of incompetence and factional power-brawling between elements of the Federal Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several elements of the decision made by Senator Cook must be called into question.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the first place, I am not persuaded that all the figures related to the new quota add up. The increase in the quota of some 300,000 tonnes needs very careful evaluation. This figure is in excess of the resource guarantees given by the State of New South Wales for material to be taken from State forests. It is to be made up from resources taken from private forests, from recovery of waste and from logging activities in Victoria. Such an increase in the quota needs far better justification than has so far been provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly I find it incredible that the comments of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service have not been taken properly into account. Their 39 page study entitled ``An assessment of the Adequacy of Parks and Reserves in the Eden Woodchip Agreement Areas'' was published in June 1987-it has been around for 18 months. The Summary section of the Report itself should have alerted the Federal Labor Government to the problems of inadequate representation of endangered species of flora and fauna in national parks or reserves within the concession area and the need for remedial action in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are the comments that I made in January. They are comments by which I stand, and they are comments which I do not believe the Government has, in any sense, answered in the period since then.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn next to the specifics of some of Senator Dunn's remarks. I do not believe that there is anything surprising in some of the comments made in the research reports of Dr Lunney and others. Of course any sort of activity of this magnitude undertaken in a forest area impacts on wildlife. However, I think that Senator Dunn betrays some element of her own ideological approach to this when she refers to this as one of the consequences of, and I use her words, the European invasion. That is a particular view about this matter which I do not share. The term `European invasion' is a prejudiced and ideologically-based term which does not really advance the debate very far.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not persuaded of the extent to which she has provided evidence about so-called breaches. I do not believe that the woodchip company itself has been entirely proper and forthcoming with the authorities in terms of what it is doing, but I do not believe that the honourable senator has established all of the evidence about alleged breaches. Those of us who are familiar with the film Without Prejudice would know that occasionally making charges without supporting evidence is certainly a good way to get a headline.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of overall management I quote from some of the commitments made by the coalition parties in the section of our environment policy headed `Forest Policies.' In part our policy reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        The co-ordination of policies can best be achieved drawing on the work and expertise of the Australia Forestry Council and by making effective use of Memoranda of Understanding with individual States. There is great expertise in the various State Forestry Commissions and various formal Codes of Practice are in operation. The Commonwealth also has clear responsibilities related to matters such as the granting of export licences.
       </para>
       <para>
        We go on to say that we `recognise the primary responsibility of the States in forest policy matters while in no way resiling from the proper discharge of national responsibilities'. We believe in `greater protection in national parks of a wider spectrum of the genetic diversity of our native forests'. We support the `development of plantations, especially of hardwoods, in order to lessen, over time, the pressure of the timber industry on Australian native forests.'
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that there ought to be more steps to encourage the adoption of the most scientific and appropriate practices of modern forestry management. We stress the importance of reafforestation programs as major contributions to maintaining the long term future of both our forests and our forest-based industries. Finally, where access is to be granted to resources on public lands we believe that security of tenure should be provided for those who are to have that access granted to them. I seek leave to incorporate that section of my Party's environmental policy in Hansard.

        Australia's native forests are a unique and scarce resource. Australia has a responsibility to protect and manage its forests, especially its rainforests in the face of wholesale destruction of the forests in under-developed or lesser-developed countries. At the same time the timber industry is a major resource and manufacturing industry in Australia and one which should be encouraged to expand. Australia has both the expertise and the experience to manage its forests effectively to integrate policies of conservation and resource utilization. The co-ordination of policies can best be achieved drawing on the work and expertise of the Australia Forestry Council and by making effective use of Memoranda of Understanding with individual States. There is great expertise in the various State Forestry Commissions and various formal Codes of Practice are in operation. The Commonwealth also has clear responsibilities related to matters such as the granting of export licences. Policies will be put in place by the Liberal and National Parties which

        Dr Florence goes on to argue a case for extending rather than reducing the resource base made available for exploitation in the Eden area. On the other hand, in the paper entitled, Proposal for a Preliminary Feasibility Study of a Program of Hardwood Plantations and Agroforestry in the South East of New South Wales, prepared on behalf of the South East Forest Alliance by Walker and Peisley, an alternative set of proposals is put forward. We are awash with sets of alternative proposals. It is clear that what is needed is some evaluation and some positive decision one way or the other by the Commonwealth Government based upon the undoubted power that the Commonwealth has to approve or disapprove of export licences. Primary responsibility obviously lies, and should lie, with Mr Causley and with the State Cabinet in New South Wales. But that does not mean that there is not an ultimate responsibility on the shoulders of the Commonwealth Minister responsible for granting an export licence to satisfy himself and his Government that they have agreed to a proposal which is environmentally sound, economically feasible and protects the jobs of people who are entitled to have their jobs adequately protected by governments at a Commonwealth and State level.

         â€”I, too, applaud Senator Dunn for bringing up this subject. I note that this is her one chance of bringing up a matter of public importance during her entire term. We really should take a look at this sort of thing in this chamber. Time after time we rehash boring issues about the economy, but the environment very rarely gets the attention it needs. We heard Senator Cook go on and on. I think it was probably valuable that he did so because he defined his position. He is, after all, the Minister for Resources. He looks at things in those terms. He is not an environmentalist. He does not give the environment first consideration. He gives the use of the resource his attention.

        As Senator Puplick pointed out, Senator Cook was very scathing of the fact that the environmental movement did not support Barrie Unsworth at the last New South Wales election. Many have interpreted that election as demonstrating a lack of impact by the environmental movement. But that Government was doomed. It was past its time. Nothing could have saved it. Environmental supporters are rational people who will not vote for a completely corrupt government like the Unsworth Government and disregard that corruption to save some forests. The environmentalists are honourable people, they cannot separate one issue from another. That probably points up our whole argument. When one deals with the environment one deals with all the issues at once.

        It is clear that under the Constitution Senator Cook and his Government have all the necessary power to impose their will upon the Japanese company Daishowa over the woodchip issue. They do not do so because they are afraid. It is not that they do not have the power. The fact is that the Government is afraid to use that power.

        Senator Cook made an incredible statement. He said that of course the Government was concerned about heritage areas and the National Estate and that it would make sure that those areas would be cut in such a way as to preserve the environment. I can take a lot of political rhetoric and hyperbole but I simply cannot understand how the Minister for Resources can say that clear felling of trees for woodchips is done with his agreement in such a way as to preserve the environment. Perhaps he should examine Hansard and reflect upon his ways at a later time.

         â€”I am sure that he will. The subject comes up of the important contribution of the woodchip industry to our balance of payments. We have a $1.6 billion deficit because of the wood imported into the country. Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd generates less than $60m a year in the input of funds to our Treasury. Yet we spend $1.6 billion on importing wood into this country. It makes good sense if we are importing all this wood and it is costing so much money to consider what we are importing and how we could replace some of the imports with home grown products-in this case, timber. We are taking our best wood, our longest and best logs, turning them into two-inch woodchips and shipping them to Japan. We cannot buy locally grown timber any more because of the distortions of the timber industry by the woodchip companies.

        The other day I tried in vain to buy a piece of eucalyptus hardwood, a four-by-one, four feet long. I went to a number of hardware stores and timber outfits and found that I could not buy native hardwood any more. When I asked why, I was told that it was because of the woodchippers. The wood is gone. I could buy softwoods, pines, and rainforest timbers, but I could not buy native Australian timbers because the wood is being woodchipped.
       </para>
       <para>
        If Senator Cook were really serious about the $1.6 billion deficit he would stop the woodchip industry in this country now. There would be no more exports of woodchips if he were fair dinkum. But he is not fair dinkum at all. He wants to make sure that his friends in the timber industry maintain their record profit levels for as long as possible. Senator Cook has no idea of sustainability. It became obvious that he did not when he said that his forest accord would lead to the continued, orderly growth of industry. The only thing that can keep growing forever is a cancer-and it does not grow forever; it eventually kills its host. As I said, the only thing that grows constantly is a cancer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Cook is completely out of touch with reality when he says that his forest accord is alive and well and will provide a basis for conflict resolution in this country. His forest accord is as dead as a dodo because the only people who agree with it are the industry representatives and the forestry commissions they control. Let us face it, the forestry commissions in this country are working on behalf of the industry. The forestry commissions themselves make no bones about it. They feel their job is to promote the forest industry. As such, they do not really have an impartial role; they are industry supporters. Of course, they would support the accord but the environmental movement has baled out completely. The environmentalists simply do not believe that an accord is possible given the present situation which is biased so much in favour of the woodchippers and the forestry industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Puplick said, `If the Government were really interested in the downstream processing it would not have killed off the Wesley Vale pulp mill'. The Government did not kill Wesley Vale; it simply did not understand the pressures Noranda was under. The Government merely put up environmental guidelines on Wesley Vale which were technologically feasible and environmentally desirable. They were not even very strong. But Noranda could not live with any environmental controls whatsoever, and had already kicked the props out from under any controls in Tasmania. They made Mr Gray do his famous flip-flop, and removed all the controls from the Tasmanian Government. Noranda could not tolerate any controls because it is in so much trouble around the world, especially in Canada. We saw Senator Puplick's true colours when he scathed the Government for not allowing this terribly environmentally polluting pulp mill to go ahead. He still has a long way to go and a lot to learn before he can be a credible spokesperson for the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about woodchipping itself? Woodchipping started as a way of utilising waste timber. That is the way in which it was foisted on this country. Back in the days when it started, in the last decade, native forests were considered to be trash trees. Softwoods were the trees which were the flavour of the month, the year or the decade. Our native forests were considered to be something to be got out of the way. There were really no controls over logging.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our State governments scrambled over each other to give away as much forest as possible. The results of this can be seen especially in Tasmania where vast tracts are still laid waste. The attitude of the time was, `We will take the waste of the sawlog industry and maybe we can go even further than that and use the woodchip industry in order to clear-fell forests so we can plant viable species-we can plant softwoods'. The attitude was, and still is, that a mature forest is an unproductive forest. Our foresters tell us this. `We have to get rid of those terrible, unproductive mature forests because if we don't, they will die'. They actually say this, ignoring the fact that the forests exist now. They have not been clear-felled before. Why should they die off now simply because they are not clear-felled? That is the logic of the time which can justify anything by means of twisting words.
       </para>
       <para>
        The woodchip industry did take the sawlog waste for a while but then it became obvious that the woodchip industry needed better and better logs. As a result, it gets its logs. If one goes through the stack at Daishowa, or at any woodchip mill, one will find many sawlogs. The mills will deny it, and say it could not possibly be so, and the forestry commissions will deny it, but the fact is the sawlogs are there. Then one goes around to the small saw mills. Senator Cook says he is really concerned about the jobs of the people out in the bush. Has he ever talked to a small miller? I doubt it very much because they are getting very hard to find for one thing. The reason they are getting hard to find is that they do not have any logs any more. The sawmill at Bega closed. The sawmill at Nimmitabel has just closed. If the Government is really interested in supporting jobs in the community, these are the businesses which employ people where they live, and have lived for generations. These mills are now closed because they cannot get the logs. If one goes to the coast, drives by mills which are still operating and looks at the logs they are milling, one will see they have hollow centres, patches of rot-they are milling trash. If one sees Daishowa log stacks, one sees beautiful timber. If Senator Cook was really fair dinkum about jobs and the wise use of this resource, the first thing he would do is go through that stack at Daishowa and make sure the small millers get decent logs, but of course he is not going to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The environmental movement is often accused of not paying attention to economics and jobs and the supply of products at the end of the stream. We are interested in downstream processing. We are interested in making the best and wisest use of the timber. If the environmentalists had their way the forestry commission would go into every coupe that was scheduled for cutting-first of all, the National Estate would be taboo for cutting-and the wood that was to be cut would be examined in terms of the productability of the timber. If productable, the commission should go in and select the highest possible uses for the logs-furniture timber, then sawlogs, then woodchip timber. It is never done in this way, of course. Areas are clear-felled, and much of the best timber is burned and left behind.

        I will conclude my remarks here. I know there is one other speaker who would like to speak on the subject. I am rushing and I will not be able to say all I would like to say. I would like to say we have got to get it right now. If we do not get our environment use and timber use right now we will never have a second chance.

        This is the 1987-88 Annual Report of the Australian Capital Territory Housing Trust. The highlight of this report is that the Trust completed some 546 rental dwellings last financial year and it now has a total stock of rental dwellings of some 11,700. Quite a significant part of the Australian Capital Territory housing market is accounted for by the ACT Housing Trust.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the wider housing picture in relation to this report because it is about time some facts were put and misconceptions about housing were answered directly. In recent months the Opposition has been painting a picture of gloom and doom about the housing sector in Australia. The Opposition's current housing spokesman, Mr Alexander Downer-I understand he may not be the housing spokesman later in the week-has been making a lot of strident claims about the housing industry in Australia in recent months. He has continued to talk down the housing industry, he has continued to talk down home buying opportunities, and he has continued to denigrate the achievements of the Hawke Government in the housing area. Those achievements are very substantial achievements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I get on to those I would like to point out a couple of facts about the record of housing under the previous Liberal Government, and also comment on some of the policy statements which have been made by Mr Downer who, as I say, is the present housing spokesman but, I understand, will not be when Friday of this week comes round. I noted in the Weekend Australian over the Christmas holiday period an article in which Mr Downer attacked the Federal Government's housing record. It was very interesting that when Mr Downer was questioned about what the Liberals would do about housing, he was less than forthcoming. For example, in the same article in which he attacked Labor's housing achievements he was unable to guarantee that under a Liberal government housing fund levels would be maintained. He was unable to guarantee that under a Liberal government levels of public housing funds-that is, for the State housing commissions-would be maintained.
       </para>
       <para>
        Statistics for the Australian housing industry simply do not confirm the gloom and doom painted by the Liberal Party on housing. The reality is that the Australian dream of home ownership is alive and well at present. I point out that in the last financial year there were 136,000 housing commencements throughout Australia. That figure represents real bricks and mortar-136,000 housing commencements. In the last year of the Fraser Government-the last year of Liberal administration-there were not 136,000 housing commencements, 126,000 housing commencements or 116,000 housing commencements; there were 105,000 housing commencements compared to the most recent figure available under the Labor Government of 136,000 housing commencements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Indicative Planning Council, which is an independent body which monitors trends in the housing sector, has forecast that in the current financial year, 1988-89, there will be 165,000 new dwelling commencements. That will bring the average figure for commencements during the period of the Hawke Labor Government to about 140,000 per annum, as compared to less than 130,000 under the previous Liberal Government. In other words, about 10,000 more new dwellings are being built every year over the life of this Government than under the previous Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer also to the achievements under the first home owners scheme which was introduced in October 1983 by the Hawke Labor Government. It is widely regarded as having been the most successful home ownership assistance scheme ever introduced in this country, yet it would appear that the Opposition plans to do away with it, should it ever achieve office in Canberra in years ahead. Since it was introduced in 1983 over 320,000 families have been helped to buy their own homes at a cost to the taxpayer of $1.4 billion. That figure represents direct assistance by the Hawke Labor Government to boost home ownership. It has had a major impact on the housing sector. Many tens of thousands of Australian families have roofs over their heads as a result of this scheme pioneered by the Hawke Labor Government.

        In the time available to me I would like specifically to address the asbestos problems of some houses in Canberra. Not so long ago people were still putting asbestos in roofs. A firm in Canberra put a lot of asbestos insulation in roofs. This occurred at a time when the suitability of asbestos as a material for insulation was being questioned, but in those days the regulations were not very strong and the asbestos companies were still arguing that asbestos was safe. At that time the government of the day had not taken any action. We now recognise the dangers of asbestos and there are a number of unfortunate home owners in the Australian Capital Territory area who have asbestos in their roofs. About 1,300 homes in the Australian Capital Territory have asbestos in their ceilings which must be removed. It will take about three years to remove the asbestos, and it will cost $32m. This is a vast amount of money. A survey of Australian Capital Territory homes has identified those with asbestos and the cost of its removal is to be met by the Federal and Australian Capital Territory governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge that the Australian Capital Territory Government not be burdened with the cost of removing asbestos. I believe that it is a Federal Government responsibility because, after all, the Federal government of the day was the agency which allowed the asbestos to be installed in the first place. I think it would be very unfair for the fledgling Australian Capital Territory Government to bear the entire cost of this operation, especially since the Australian Capital Territory Administration will have to lease a number of houses around Canberra which would be available for rent. I point out that the householders themselves have to pay for alternative accommodation during the period that the asbestos is being removed from roofs. This is also not a good thing. It is not fair to make these people move out of their homes and then not allow them payment for alternative accommodation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to see the Federal Government do two things: firstly, make sure that the Australian Capital Territory Government is not unduly burdened with the cost of the asbestos removal; and, secondly, provide funds for householders who have to obtain alternative accommodation while the asbestos is removed from their homes and the roofs are reinsulated.

        That the Senate take note of the paper.

       <para>
        I would like to make a few comments on this paper as a result of what the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) said in Question Time today in answer to a dorothy dix question by Senator Devereux about research involving animals in the Antarctic. An advisory committee was set up by the Minister to investigate this matter as a result of a question asked by Senator Coates in response to an article that appeared in the Hobart Mercury on 11 February headed, `Radiation Scare: Dangerous Isotopes Dumped in the Derwent at Kingston'. Consequently, a number of reports and cartoons appeared in the press.
       </para>
       <para>
        A question was asked by Senator Coates which in part referred to the fact that an independent member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly had asserted that Antarctic scientists were injecting penguins with radioactive isotopes. Another question was asked by Senator Jenkins regarding the deaths of leopard seals at Heard Island. As a result, the Minister instigated this report which was undertaken by Professor Mike Cullen of Monash University; Mr David Butcher, a veterinarian and director of the New South Wales RSPCA; Dr Frank Cattell, an environmental chemist at Macquarie University; and Dr Barry Chatterton, Director of Nuclear Medicine at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The Chairman was Professor Alistair Gilmour.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think honourable senators would agree that that group of people would be very well versed in all these matters. The conclusions they arrived at were, as the Minister indicated today, that the techniques being used in current Antarctic research projects involving live animals were justified on conservation grounds and were being administered humanely. He also said that there was no evidence to cause undue concern in the short term but there may be a need to develop a code of practice, an assessment procedure, specifically to cover the use of these materials in the Antarctic.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another conclusion drawn was that Australian Antarctic scientists are among the leaders in the use of humane methods for collecting scientific data on Antarctic animals. The report also said that the Antarctic Division should implement measures so that there is an immediate focus on the responsibility for oversight of Antarctic environmental management. The Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, of which I am a member-I am pleased to see my colleague, Senator Brownhill, who is also a member of that Committee agrees with what I am saying-has found that the use of animal ethics committees where animal experimentation occurs have been very successful. In fact, we have been told by different people from around the world that the efforts of universities and institutes in Australia in setting up ethics committees have probably taken them into the forefront of the world animal welfare debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to draw attention to one of the conclusions in the report which stated that `unfounded fears were raised'. There is no doubt that this expensive report, and it would have cost thousands of dollars to bring all those people together, was caused by the allegations of an independent member of the House of Assembly in Tasmania. This is the sort of misinformation and scare tactics that we expect from independents in Tasmania. After this weekend, if more independents are elected in Tasmania, we will have more of this sort of rubbish being pumped out. The Minister would probably have had a report on this matter and would have acted in a responsible manner. He did not need all this extra fuss, bother and expense that is being caused to the Commonwealth of Australia. This report, based on unfounded fears, was caused by the affirmation of an independent member from Tasmania.

         â€”Senator Calvert says, with a snarl, `Probably Gerry Bates'. I guess there is an election coming up and I suppose we can excuse Tasmanians in their exuberance. I found a contradiction in what Senator Calvert said. He praised the establishment of an ethics committee to look at the deaths of animals, but that probably would not have come about without the action of Gerry Bates, who is standing for Franklin in Tasmania, or perhaps Bob Brown, who is standing for the electorate of Denison. Whoever brought it up, he certainly did a service because it did lead to the establishment of an ethics committee to look into the experimentation on the animals in the Antarctic. In that sense, I think even Senator Calvert must say that he has done the community a service.

        The whole issue was brought up in the Senate and put before Senator Richardson, and he did the proper thing. I think the view of the environmental movement and of animal welfare proponents in general is that some research is necessary to determine the health and the environmental viability of animals in the Antarctic. We certainly need to know what they are eating and the availability of krill and that sort of thing. Certainly it is a step forward to develop innovative research techniques such as anaesthesia and radioisotope injection rather than just killing the specimens, as was previously done. As Senator Calvert says, Australia does lead the world in its treatment of Antarctic animals in research, but there has always been much room for improvement. As was admitted in this report, seal deaths were too high. In fact, the experiment that caused this high death rate has been discontinued, which is a good thing. Elephant seal numbers are down by 60 per cent since 1949. Therefore we should not kill any more, but research is certainly needed.

         â€”Elephant seals are down by 60 per cent. The reason they are dropping is apparently the overfishing of their food supply, due to the fishing going on apace in the Antarctic as a result of the rather short-sighted resource management techniques of people such as Senator Calvert who want to rip if off now and save nothing for the future. There were also concerns about radioactivity in penguins. There is some doubt about residual levels of radioactivity in Antarctica. The Australian Democrats policy is to eliminate uranium mining, nuclear power, nuclear weapons, and the nuclear fuel cycle particularly, and we feel that this policy should be carried out in order to make sure that we do not have any radioactivity in our penguins, or anywhere else for that matter.

         â€”The report by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Assistance for the Sugar Industry presents one example of how Senate committees can work and if given the chance do work to produce good outcomes across party lines for the benefit of Australia.
        </para>

        No one here should underestimate the difficulties in attempting to deregulate any primary industry area. This is not the time for me to canvass the arguments for or against deregulation in this or any other area-that is a current debate on its own-but even if one determines to go down the deregulation track one sees that there are better ways and worse ways by which it might be achieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate Standing Committee was charged with looking at the Government's proposals for the sugar industry as they were contained in some legislation before the Senate. It was to examine proposals, take evidence and determine the most suitable procedure for achieving the Government's aims. With this report the Senate Standing Committee has tried to match the desire of the Government to achieve a significant de- regulation with the industry needs for reasonable protection against dumping of sugar from overseas in a situation where the world international market for sugar is corrupt.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have found that there is in this report a solution-that is the important thing about this report-which is acceptable to the Australian Labor Party senators on the Committee, to Liberal Party senators, to National Party senators, to the Australian Democrats and to grower interests. We have found a solution with which all parties can live, and this is something that no-one really thought was possible when we started the job. In essence, the solution is that the Government can move to end the embargo on imports of sugar, an embargo of more than 70 years standing. If the embargo is ended, the domestic market for sugar, about 20 per cent of the total market, will no longer be reserved for locally grown and refined sugar. Of course, 80 per cent of our crop is already sold in international competition on the international market against the world. Even with a corrupt market, we sell 80 per cent of our sugar crop successfully.
       </para>
       <para>
        The document also addresses the remaining concern of the industry, that without the protection of the reserved 20 per cent of the market, will it be able to survive bad times? We have tried to address how the needs of growers might be protected. The Senate Committee has recommended a tariff regime which would cut in only as the price of sugar dropped below a critical level and which would, in essence, place a floor price somewhere around the survival minimum for growers. That is what we have tried to do. As the price went higher the tariff would cut out. As the price came lower, it would cut in. The trouble with what the Government put up originally on an ad valorem tariff is that when the price was high and protection was least needed, the duty was highest and when the price was low and protection was needed, the duty was lowest. That is why the Government's original proposal was no good. It would not have helped the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have endorsed a re-examination of a range of assistance by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1991 with a view to having new arrangements in place by 1 July 1992. We have suggested that the new anti-dumping procedures proposed by the Government should be monitored closely to see that they are sufficient and that they work sufficiently quickly. If they fail to work, they should be altered. I think that is proper.
       </para>
       <para>
        None of us wants to proceed in the matter of sugar deregulation with fire and sword, with blood and battle. We do not want to leave casualties all around the field. Sadly, this has occurred in relation to wheat, to the advantage of few, if any, of the protagonists in the argument. If the proposals we put up in relation to sugar can be adopted, we will have done a whole lot better than was done in the wheat debate. The Senate will have shown what it can do. I have to say that the Government has come back to us and had a discussion with a number of interested people, including the honourable senators who were on the Standing Committee. It said to us something like this: `We understand in principle what you are trying to achieve, but the mechanism you have chosen is illegal under the GATT'. The Government then said, `There is another proposal'. My colleague, Senator Brownhill, will set out in more detail what the Government has proposed. It will achieve our purposes in a way which is legal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In fact, it is slightly more generous than we had proposed, but because it is legal under the GATT we will recommend to our parties in due course that the proposal be endorsed. I hope Senator Brownhill will be able to tell us how acceptable that proposal is to his Party and to grower interests. I hope the answer will be that it is acceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government will endorse this package with its alternative tariff proposal, if it will endorse the package as the Committee members have in a multi-partisan way and as growers seem to have done, then our parties on this side I am sure will back up their Committee representatives. I hope the Labor Party will back up its Committee representatives and the proposal which we have put forward can be endorsed in the legislation which now has to be dealt with by the Senate. We will reach an acceptable compromise and a workable solution in a matter which promised to be a scene of battle and disarray. This is an example of how the Senate committee system can work to improve government. We ask the Government now to accept and promote the solution which we have offered in relation to the sugar industry.

         â€”When the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology commenced its task it was with the knowledge that there was broad agreement in the community, particularly those sections of the community whose lives are bound up in the agricultural and primary industry export section of the Australian economy. That agreement is about the need for our primary products to gain access to export markets throughout the world, particularly those markets that are being served by countries such as the United States of America, which subsidises its agricultural products and thus creates an unfair marketing practice, Japan, with the limited accessibility of its markets, and the European Economic Community countries.

       <para>
        Our negotiators in the international field have been at pains to focus on these unfair practices and to seek their elimination. I refer, for example, to the Cairns Group. Having an understanding of these actions and policies, we were still very much convinced of the need to give assistance at a sustainable level to the industry which has been and is of great importance to Queensland and Australia. We could not accept the thrust of the proposal to pay an ad valorem tariff which gave higher tariff protection when it was needed least. We therefore came down on the side of a proposal to increase the tariff when prices fall, thus putting a floor under sugar prices, at least until a proposed inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1991 reaches a conclusion by way of a recommendation. In present circumstances, we were unable to come to the conclusion that the current embargo should remain in place, but were determined to recommend our proposal of support.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was impressed by the content and presentation of submissions made by representatives of the unions and the industry employers. My experience as a boilermaker working in the industry during a period of 10 years enabled me to understand the efficiency of the industry. This was reinforced by a further 20 years as a trade union official concerned with members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. Contributions made by witnesses to the Committee enhanced that view of industry efficiency. Efficiency, however, is no guarantee that a market share will be gained. Thus there is the need to support the industry for a period while our negotiators continue on the international stage to remove artificial barriers currently maintained by other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the period of the hearings, we interviewed many witnesses. One of those witnesses who impressed me with his sincerity, his wealth of knowledge about the industry and his preparedness to put facts before the Committee was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, who is absolutely convinced that the way in which he is proceeding with this matter is the correct way. In conclusion, the National Farmers Federation should be more than happy with these developments within an industry which it represents. After all, it continually calls for deregulation, a philosophy with which I personally and wholeheartedly disagree.

       <para>
        This has been one of the finest-acting committees on which I have served since I have been in this Parliament. As an all-party committee it gave very due consideration to those terms of reference. We were very concerned at the speed of the removal of the embargo and the ad valorem tariff that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) had proposed. We came up with the recommendations to which Senator Peter Baume has already alluded. Basically, we recommended that the Government could proceed with its proposal to remove the embargo on the importation of sugar and that whatever option was adopted, the Industries Assistance Commission should review the situation in 1992. We also came up with an option of a different sliding scale tariff from that which had been recommended by the Minister in the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We said also that an Australian sugar industry council should be established to allow direct representation of all participants in the industry. Had such a council been in place before the Minister wanted to bring about these changes, we would most probably have found that this inquiry was not necessary. The other recommendation is that if deficiencies are alleged, the Government should investigate them and, if necessary, amend the anti-dumping legislation. Should there be evidence of undue delay in dealing with dumping complaints, the Committee would be prepared to consider a further reference to investigate the dumping claims.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sugar is grown along some 2,100 kilometres of the north-east coast-between Mossman in Queensland and Grafton in New South Wales-and 95 per cent of that sugar is grown in Queensland. There are approximately 6,400 growers. In addressing this inquiry, we had to look at all the infrastructure associated with the sugar industry in some of those cane-growing areas up the coast of Queensland. In so doing, we always had to be mindful of the Government's intent and purpose in regard to tariffs. I quote from paragraph 4.14 of the report:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has looked carefully at whether there could be another way of meeting both the Government's and the industry's needs. It is aware that the sugar industry has for over seventy years enjoyed a privileged position that should perhaps be altered. However, it is also aware that the industry is uncertain about what exactly will happen after 1 July 1989, if the Government's proposals are adopted. The change is seen as being both too quick and far-reaching in its consequences. The Committee, therefore, has some options to propose which would provide less general protection for the industry but would maintain some protection when the prices were very low.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what we set out to do in this inquiry-to give the Government some advice as to whether protection was needed and, if so, where. We, as a committee, believed that it should be given at the lower end of the scale, not at the higher end, as was suggested in the Minister's original proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        We came up with a three-year sliding tariff which would have given protection to the industry, especially anywhere below US11c a pound. I believe that this could have been-indeed, will be-very helpful to the industry. However, we have had a meeting with the Minister since this report came out. I must admit to the Senate, and to anyone else who is interested, that the Minister has been very helpful in this matter, as I think we have been helpful to him in having the inquiry. He has come up with a counter-proposal along the lines of our own proposal to give protection at the bottom end of the scale of sugar pricing. It will also be in terms acceptable in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. In other words, it will be GATT-acceptable. The specific proposal is that a rate equivalent to US- 4.2c per pound should come in as from 1 July 1989 and should exist for two years. At that stage it would be reduced to US3.4c per pound, and in 1992 it would be further reduced to US2.6c per pound. In this way it would be acceptable for the purposes of the GATT negotiations and the other things that are happening in attempts to get better trading relations with other parts of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Minister's counter-proposal, which I am sure he will announce at some later stage, will be very acceptable to the industry. It would make sure that the industry in those towns along the coast of Queensland were not jeopardised to any extent. We would not have unemployment problems, and cane farmers would not be going off their farms because of sugar coming in at a price that Australian cane farmers and refineries could not compete with.
       </para>
       <para>
        The anti-dumping legislation was another aspect of the inquiry that concerned the Committee quite deeply; it was taking so long for anti-dumping legislation to take effect. In consultations during the last day or so, the Minister told the Committee that that will be smartened up; so, hopefully, the fear about sugar being dumped in Australia will not be a problem for cane growers or for the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I commend the cane growers and the sugar community of Queensland, which we visited to have a look at the industry, for their substantial and sensible contributions to the inquiry and for their ability to discuss and address the Government's legislation with a view to improving conditions, not only for the sugar industry but for the economy as a whole. I commend the Committee and all my colleagues-those on the Labor Party side, the Democrats, and my Liberal Party colleagues-for the way in which this inquiry was approached. As I said at the beginning of my presentation, I believe that this report is the best review of an industry, and the best piece of committee work, that I have been involved in in my time here. The reason for that is that it was approached in a way in which I think the Senate should operate a lot more often, to bring benefit to the people we represent-in this case, the sugar industry. We must try to ensure that we will continue to have a sugar industry in Queensland and in New South Wales.

         â€”Very briefly, I support the views that have been expressed by my colleague Senator Peter Baume and my National Party colleague, Senator Brownhill. From a situation in which this matter first became one of public debate, when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) initially announced his proposals for the sugar industry, there has been a remarkable degree of progress in working out a sensible set of arrangements. For that remarkable progress, I pay great tribute to the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, including its Chairman, Senator Childs, and all other members. They produced an admirable report, which went a very long way towards suggesting a rectification of some of the problems that the Minister's original proposal had produced.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the light of what might be called a technical flaw in the particular remedy that they proposed, the Minister himself-thereby accepting the spirit of the Committee's report-has proposed an alternative means of addressing the problem which, one has to say, was originally created by himself. Be that as it may, the outcome which I understand we have now arrived at reflects great credit on everybody. We have arrived at an outcome which I believe will be acceptable to the sugar industry, and I repeat my congratulations to all concerned.

       <para>
        There were in the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 such proposals as are contained, for example, in clause 3 of the Bill, which is a definitional clause, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``grain'' means wheat, barley, triticale, maize, grain sorghum, soybeans, safflower seed, sunflower seed, linseed, oats, rye, rapeseed, rice, field peas, . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        And so it goes on. It concludes:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . and any product of the soil declared by the Minister . . . to be grain for the purposes of this Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the kind of drafting which, presumably, we can expect to receive from this Government and which, of course, is designed to give the Minister dictatorial powers to declare any product of the soil to be grain.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had a similar dictatorial approach to the issue in clause 88 of the Bill as originally put forward, which relates to the operation of certain State and Territory laws. It is a very long clause and I certainly do not have time to quote it in full. But one representative subclause, that is, subclause (4) of clause 88, says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Nothing in any prescribed-
       </para>
       <para>
        that word `prescribed' means prescribed by the Minister-
       </para>
       <para>
        State or Territory enactment operates to prevent a party to a sale contract or a service contract discharging obligations under the contract according to the terms of the contract.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is another way of saying that, whatever the law of a State or Territory may be, if the Minister so prescribes, that law may as well not have been enacted. That, I think, gives great problems to anyone who has any regard for State responsibilities in these matters as distinct from the centralisation of all power in Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a matter of record that during the course of 13 April the then coalition leadership agreed to support this Bill. It did so-I have to say this-notwithstanding that it was perfectly clear that the terms of the Bill did not meet the conditions as laid down in the heads of agreement document of 4 April, which I was referring to before lunch today. Indeed, my coalition colleague the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, in a media release on the following day, 14 April, when he was referring to the decision made late the previous night, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision late last night of the leadership group and the Coalition Parties to ignore criteria in the recently released Coalition Wheat Policy . . . has forced me to consider my position as shadow Minister for Primary Industry and Deputy Leader of the National Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I believed that no objective assessment of the criteria-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the criteria of the heads of agreement document of 4 April-
       </para>
       <para>
        could allow the Coalition Parties to support this further deregulation at this stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then went on with a series of other comments. There is not the slightest doubt in the world that the Bill did not meet the conditions or the criteria, as Mr Lloyd calls them, laid down in the heads of agreement document of 4 April. I simply want to say-Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be well aware that I am now speaking of a matter relating to the coalition pre-yesterday, if I may put it that way-that it appears to me to be quite clear that the agreement at that time to support the Bill did not, in fact, accord with the heads of agreement document entered into between the coalition parties at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        On those grounds alone, the Bill raised a very serious problem for me personally, which I make no bones about stating. There is a matter, I believe, of not merely keeping faith in the sense of the operations of the coalition but keeping faith with people out in the electorate who, I would like to think, believe what they are told by people in this Parliament. I quote, in that context only, a resolution of my own Queensland National Party carried at a meeting of the central council on 22 April in Toowoomba. It was a resolution regarding wheat marketing. I will not quote it in full, but it said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . requests the Federal Leader-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the Federal Leader of the National Party at that time-
       </para>
       <para>
        to call upon Mr Howard to seek a review of this matter to permit NP members to vote against the Kerin de-regulation legislation without damage to the coalition.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were some other aspects of that resolution which I will not quote in full because of the constraints of time. I had also the very difficult experience of attending in Warrnambool on 28 and 29 April a meeting of the Victorian branch of the National Party of Australia. On the morning of 29 April I listened to a debate on the Wheat Marketing Bill and the general matters pertaining to that. That debate was one of the most poignant, in some ways, that I have ever listened to. People asked why it was that their party had not stood up for them on these matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a matter of keeping faith with people to whom one has pledged one's word and with whom one wants to go ahead in company. If these Bills had been debated last week I would have had a great deal more to say on that particular aspect of the matter. We now have, as a result of certain events yesterday of which everybody is aware and which I will not canvass, a new leadership in the Liberal Party and in the National Party. We now have a new and united coalition with, if I might say so, a renewed determination to defeat the Labor Party at the next election and a very greatly enhanced capacity to do so. If only for those reasons, I now believe that there is no longer-because we are debating this today and not last week-any profit in pursuing those points further.

        The Bill we now have before us, as I say, was the subject of no fewer than 45 Government amendments in the House of Representatives last week and also a number of amendments accepted by the Government which were moved in the debate in the House of Representatives by my National Party colleague the honourable member for Murray, Mr Bruce Lloyd. I think he moved no fewer than 39 amendments, of which the Government accepted several. The Government also effectively accepted others by moving its own slightly different amendments in some cases.

        Senator Lewis is leading for the Opposition on this matter in the chamber today. As I think he may have said in his earlier remarks, today or tomorrow when we come to the committee stage he will move no fewer than 22 amendments-what one might call the remaining amendments which were not accepted by the Labor Party in the House of Representatives last week. I hope the honourable senator will have the support of the Australian Democrats in that regard. He will certainly have my support and the support of National Party senators in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, even if those amendments are all accepted, the Bill in a fundamental sense will remain flawed for members of the National Party who regard the course of events in this matter as having left a great deal to be desired. We will indicate our rejection of that process, and in that sense of the Bill, by voting for, as I have already foreshadowed, the amendment which has now been circulated in my name. When we come to the end of the second reading debate we will vote for that amendment and against the second reading of the Bill.

       <para>
        In relation to paragraph (b) of my proposed amendment, I refer to what the Minister said in his second reading speech on 13 April in the House of Representatives. I quote the paragraph concerned:
       </para>
       <para>
        The AWB will continue to be able to use private traders as principals or agents as it does now and it will be able to authorise the direct export of wheat if the Board and growers judge it in their best interest. While it continues to have this export monopoly, the AWB will continue to be the receiver of last resort. This will, however, not prevent it from setting standards for the wheat it receives.

        I am confident that the AWB will remain the dominant force in a deregulated domestic market, given its expertise and the additional commercial powers which I outlined earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we all know, the actual legislation which the Minister produced did nothing of the kind. Far from allowing the AWB to remain the dominant force in a deregulated domestic market, it virtually entirely neuters the Board because of the provisions of the Bill, which basically prevent the Wheat Board from undertaking intrastate trade. If one wanted to, one could argue that, in that paragraph at least, the Minister misled the House of Representatives. I do not want to pursue that here but I think it is necessary to put it on the record. I now formally move:

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”Generally, while we support the thrust of the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989, the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Bill 1989, the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Bill 1989, the Wheat (Termination of Tax) (No. 1) Bill 1989, the Wheat (Termination of Tax) (No. 2) Bill 1989, the Wheat (Termination Permit Tax) Bill 1989 and the Wheat Tax (Permit) Collection Amendment Bill 1989, the legislation is subject to the amendments which will be moved in the committee stage by the coalition parties. At one time I was Chairman of a group called the Australian Coal Exporters Association. I want to make it clear that this was not a marketing authority as such but a grouping of industry to exchange ideas about the marketing of commodities overseas. More importantly, its objective was to stave off government intervention on world markets which would have been devastating to the growth of that particular industry. In some quarters there is an entrenched belief that marketing authorities either maintain or ratchet up prices. If one has a monopoly and there are no substitutes then this is undoubtedly correct.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I know, however, of no commodity which enjoys that luxury on the world scene. The closest to that we have seen in recent times has been the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. The speed with which an oil reliant world switched to alternative forms of energy, whether they were coal or uranium, was a reflection of how markets can and do adjust to monopoly pricing. The International Tin Council inflated tin prices, which had an adverse effect on Australia's marginal producers in the early 1980s. That is another clear example of how the market situation cannot really be manipulated. The simple fact is that the market determines our prices: when there is an oversupply, the price goes down and when there is an undersupply, the price goes up. Certainly, subsidies distort market prices. A recent example of that was the sale of United States wheat to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I might also say that there are few world markets that are not subject to varying degrees of what is called corruption. I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talk the other day about intervening again in the energy market in Europe. What he did not recognise is that when commodities are sold into a market and there are subsidies in that particular market, they are competing on that market with other countries; they are not competing in the subsidised market.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation, however, deals with the deregulation of the domestic market, which represents about 10 per cent of the total production of wheat required for human consumption. There is, as honourable senators know, already a permit system in existence which enables feed wheat to be supplied direct from grower to buyer. What I want to address, however, is why the Government chose wheat when there are so many other areas that could have and should have been tackled first. The question I have to ask is: what are the real motives. After six years, all that this Government has delivered is the highest taxation of any government in history, an intolerable inflation rate, something like seven times that of Japan, intolerable interest rates which are devastating the business community and family home buyers and a continuing and alarming current account deficit and net foreign debt of approximately $95 billion which puts us as the third highest in the world behind Brazil and Mexico.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the micro-economic front, financial markets were deregulated by this Government but again I ask the motive. It was not because of any perceived economic advantage but because the Labor Party Caucus was reminded of the inherent hatred of the Labor Party for the Australian banks. In the main, rather than use economic levers that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) boasts about, he and the Government have used one blunt instrument, monetary policy. Jack up interest rates and hope that the banks get the blame in an attempt to reduce the consumption of imported goods rather than improve our export and import replacement capacity. The whole economic management of the Government over the past six years, notwithstanding the improved terms of trade, has been a disastrous failure. Becoming aware of that, the Government decided that it should put up some sort of front and engage in micro-economic reform. Being the political animals they are, it was not hard for Mr Kerin, who I might say appears to be genuine, to convince his Party that it should zero in on a constituency which never has and never will accept the Labor Party. When the Minister wrapped up the debate in the other place he made some interesting comments. Some quotable quotes are:
       </para>
       <para>
        The positions put forward really demonstrate why we are crippling ourselves as a commodity exporting nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        And:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it is sensible to look at Australia's overall interest, producers, consumers, exporters and service providers.
       </para>
       <para>
        And:
       </para>
       <para>
        Because we deregulate one part of the system to the advantage of an industry, it does not mean we have to deregulate the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I read Hansard, the latter comment by the Minister related to what he called `high cant on Labor deregulation'. What extraordinary hypocrisy by this Government and this Minister. If we are to get out of the present mess we must become more competitive and be seen by the rest of the world as a reliable supplier. We will never achieve those objectives until our outmoded, totally regulated, industrial relations system is deregulated. We must change the system which fosters featherbedding, reduction in productivity and industrial disputation, all of which have contributed to the reduction and, in some cases, destruction of our wealth creation capacity.
       </para>
       <para>
        These comments are no reflection on the capacity of individual Australians to work and compete with anyone else in the world. What prevents them from doing so are some trade union leaders-not all-who, either out of stupidity of because of power grabbing, are not interested in the well-being of their own members and thus the future of this country. They are the people who are destroying the standard of living of Australians and they are the people who call the shots on this Government. The Minister must have had his brain switched off when he stated during the second reading speech, that:
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has other parts of the whole system-shipping and coastal trade and the wharves-on the agenda.
       </para>
       <para>
        These things do not really affect all that much the wheat industry as a bulk commodity. It is a wonder that the Minister was not struck by lightning. Like every other export industry in this country, the wheat industry must run the gauntlet of waterfront rorts, inefficiency and unreliability in getting the product to the market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Gross overmanning at grain loading facilities is one of the more glaring rorts that cost the Australian grain growing industry dearly. Most bulk commodities loaded at Australian terminals do not use any stevedoring labour at all. Waterside workers have been completely removed from the bulk handling of iron ore, bauxite, alumina, mineral concentrates, sugar and coal. The same should apply to bulk grain. Research undertaken by the National Farmers Federation found that, with modern grain loading facilities and self trimming vessels, only one person, a supervisor, was required to be on board during grain loading operations. This research is supported by the fact that a number of grain ships in the port of Brisbane have been loaded and passed as being seaworthy without a watersider in sight.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my own home State, six men are usually paid to be on board a vessel when loading grain in the port of Brisbane. Typically, there are four waterside workers, including a first aid man and a timekeeper, as well as a foreman and supervisor. I visited the grain wharf and there is no need for any of them. A modern grain loader is so constructed that the loader-operator sits over the top of the hold and can see into every part of the hold. While I was there, I saw two Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) people just looking into the hold. That was their job. There was no other job for them to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the port of Gladstone, overmanning is even worse, with seven men on board with a modern grain loader. The situation is slightly better at the port of Mackay where the Industrial Relations Commission recently ruled that a manning level of three-and not the six men demanded-was sufficient for grain loading. Yet, not 50 metres from the new Mackay grain loader is the world's largest sugar terminal without a WWF member in sight.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that, in making its recommendations in its final report that the WWF relinquish its coverage of bulk loading operations, the Inter-State Commission noted that the presence of waterside workers on board ships loading grain is an historical leftover from the days when wharfies loaded bags of grain. They actually carried the bags and put them on the ships. Those days are gone. That is last century stuff. This historical leftover costs grain growers approximately $30 million a year. Yet in his second reading speech, the Minister had the hide to say that what happens on the wharves does not really affect the wheat industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        A recent insight was gained into the attitude of the waterside workers to overmanning. In October 1987 certain loading operations in Townsville were exempted by the Department of Transport from using a lookout man. The union objected and the matter went to arbitration. The Arbitration Commission, in ruling that the lookout man was not needed for safe loading, noted that in Gladstone loading had been conducted for some considerable time without a lookout. The comment of a Mr John Coombs, then federal organiser of the WWF, is recorded in the February issue of the Maritime Worker, and it is worth quoting:
       </para>
       <para>
        Unwittingly we showed we could perform the loading without a lookout and this proved difficult to reverse. It was pretty hard to tell the Commission it couldn't be done when it had been done. This should be a lesson to us all, and in the future, branches should carefully consider the possible consequences of departing from existing safety practices.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, it was not a safety practice at all. Even Senator McKiernan will agree with this. The price of this overmanning pales into insignificance when we compare it with the demurrage charges the grain industry faces when ships are delayed as a result of restrictive work ordering practices. The Waterside Workers Federation requires labour to be ordered well in advance-frequently, 20 to 24 hours in advance-which means that stevedoring labour costs are often incurred without actual loading taking place.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of reasons why vessels may not be ready for loading: weather, health, a letter of credit problem, tidal delays or, in the case of grain ships, the failure to pass survey, which means that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy believes that the vessel is not clean enough. Ordering waterside labour is a costly exercise for all stevedoring companies. They can wait until the ship has passed survey before ordering labour and risk incurring demurrage. I remind honourable senators that this would cost a minimum of $15,000 a day-the costs for larger vessels are higher. Or they can order labour before the vessel has passed survey and risk extra costs being incurred by labour being ordered and not used if the ship fails the Department's inspection. All this for waterside labour which the Inter-State Commission observes has no useful function in grain loading, anyway; it should not even be there.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wheat industry in Queensland has also been plagued by labour shortages on the waterfront. I should point out that these are not genuine labour shortages as much as shortfalls in meeting the grossly inflated manning levels of stevedoring labour required in Australian ports. Nevertheless, the problem caused to Queensland exporters, including grain growers, has been real enough. These include longer queueing times for ships in port, greater freight rates and demurrage costs. The labour shortages are caused by restrictive work practices unique to the port of Brisbane-the one-and-seven roster. The port of Brisbane suffered major shortages last year as a result of the restrictive one-in-seven roster which applies only in that port and in no other capital city port in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under this system employees work for seven weeks and are rostered off for one week. The theory behind the one-and-seven roster is that wharfies work an extra hour each shift which accrues towards their rostered week off, after seven weeks' work. This theory does not really work. The extra hour's work on top of a seven-hour shift entitles wharfies to a 20-minute coffee break and reduces the extra hour to 40 minutes. It is time spent but not worked, as I mentioned earlier in regard to the method of loading grain ships. The rostered week off-Senator Stone will be interested to know-not only is taken on full pay but also includes a 25 per cent loading for overtime which the wharfies did not incur because they were not working. It is calculated that this restrictive roster takes 50 men out of Brisbane's 420 strong work force each day--

In this area it is high noon for the Hawke Government. Just a few days ago I raised this question with Senator Button. He gave me the nonsensical reply that my question was rhetorical. I asked him whether, in view of the remarks made by members of the Waterside Workers Union, such as Mr Tas Bull, the Government would accept the Inter-State Commission's report. He assured me that some time this month, maybe within a few days either side of the pre-determined date, the Government would come out with an agenda of reform--

However, there are much bigger issues which this Government has not addressed. The challenge for this Government is that if it does not address these issues its credibility will suffer. More importantly, unless we do something about the incredibly high and continuing current account deficit, increase our exports and improve our import replacement productivity, this country will continue to head down the decline of a banana republic and may well overtake Brazil and Mexico with the level of our debt.

For some explanation of what this Bill does I went to two sources. One was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). In his second reading speech he said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to introduce new marketing arrangements for the wheat industry and thereby establish a sound future for one of Australia's most important export earners.
       </para>
       <para>
        I then looked at what the Opposition spokesperson for primary industry in the House of Representatives, Mr Bruce Lloyd, said in opening the debate for the Opposition. Mr Lloyd said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and the related wheat levy Bills have a number of major features. They include the removal of the Australian Wheat Board's acquisition and price setting power for wheat for domestic human consumption; the retention of the Board's export monopoly and the reduced underwriting guarantee from the current 95 per cent to 90 per cent next season and then a phase-down to 80 per cent in 1993, after which this part of the legislation will cease; the removal of an acceptable level of wheat grower Board membership; and the virtual prohibition of the Wheat Board from intrastate trading and a threatening restriction to its pool interstate trading.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find Mr Lloyd's definition of what this legislation does to be far more accurate and truthful. The Bill also overrides State laws in the transport, handling and storage of wheat.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make it quite clear that the Australian Democrats are absolutely opposed to all aspects of this legislation, a fact which we made clear six months ago and which we have reiterated many times since-in fact, at every possible opportunity. What we have here is a classic piece of ideological deregulationist legislation proposed by the economic rationalists of the Hawke Labor Government and supported by the privatisers in the New Right Liberal Party, whose President, John Elliott, includes amongst his major business interests a significant international grain trading arm which is no doubt salivating now-if an arm can salivate-at the prospect of a new playing field, however uneven it will be, for Australia's grain growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about the National Party of Australia? I can do no better than quote the honourable member for Mallee, Mr Peter Fisher. He pointed out in his contribution in the House of Representatives that he is a wheat grower and represents one of Australia's greatest wheat growing electorates-a claim with which I concur because that is the electorate in which I was born and brought up. I lived on a wheat farm myself. Mr Fisher said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the tragedy of this wheat debate, and the major changes to wheat marketing arrangements it proposes, is that wheat growers and their industry have been forsaken by politicians for political considerations of power, unity and ideology and not through any understanding or debate on this issue;
       </para>
       <para>
        I will take a few moments at this point to explain what Mr Fisher was referring to by looking at a bit of the history of this exercise. Mr Kerin, in his second reading speech, went on, after his rather marshmallow definition of what the legislation was doing, to begin at the beginning. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In a speech to the annual conference of the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) last year, I invited the industry to take the opportunity of the need for a new Wheat Marketing Act and the report of the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport to think seriously about the future structure of the wheat industry and its position in the Australian and world economy. It is a matter of some regret that the GCA has been unable to articulate a vision for the future of its industry and has adopted a position of non-negotiability on the major issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think what Mr Kerin really meant was that it is a matter of regret to him that the Grains Council has been able to embrace his vision for the future of its industry. Mr Kerin went on in his second reading speech to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The industry has shown that it can respond to the pressures for change.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is no less so in the case of the Australian Wheat Board. Over the years, as an institution and part of the wheat industry, it has responded to pressures for change. It was that fact about the industry to which Mr Kerin referred in his second reading speech.
       </para>
       <para>
        For 50 years since it was established-particularly since the late 1940s when rural industries, particularly the wheat industry, increased their strength, organisation and political voice, and were then able to influence decisions better-the Board has developed marketing structures which, with modification, flexibility, development and increased commercialisation, have served growers well. One only has to ask growers to be told that that is the case, and it continues to be so. Of course, one would not deny that further change, further development and further modification are, and always will be, needed in an organisation such as the Australian Wheat Board; but not major surgery or amputation of this kind, the Australian Democrats would contend. The Grains Council of Australia, and the wheat industry in general, had to wait until April this year to begin hearing from the Opposition about what approach it would take to Mr Kerin's package or, perhaps, his vision.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the National Party, before that time, appeared to be indicating that in its own right it did not favour wheat marketing deregulation, it found itself with a coalition problem. It should not have been a problem for the National Party or, indeed, for Liberal Party members representing rural and particular wheat growing constituencies. The National Party holds seats in this Parliament, both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, based on a claim that it represents Australia's rural population, especially Australian farmers. The National Party does indeed have a very strong constituency, a sectional base, in many parts of rural Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the safest House of Representatives seats are held by the National Party. I am probably safe in saying that the safest House of Representatives seats are held by the National Party. Most of them are held with absolute majorities, many over 60 per cent. The shadow Minister, Mr Lloyd, a former local member of mine, has a very safe seat in Murray. Peter Fisher, whom I have just mentioned, represents the electorate in which I was born, another safe National Party seat. The phenomenon of the National Party sectional base and the strength of it is interesting. I note there was criticism after the Gwydir by-election that John Anderson had caused the National Party to take a drubbing, yet he got an absolute majority. That is a measure of the strength the National Party has in such areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        I began my political career, as well as my life, in a National Party electorate. It is not easy in that kind of situation to build not only a political career but a new political party at the same time. At one point I did coin a phrase for what I felt I was up against, and I called it a socio-political Mafia because it is so strong. It is a fabric of the community. Members of that Party sit here representing those people. From time to time the Democrats have wondered how that support has persisted until now. People in rural areas have probably forgotten that the size of the Parliament was expanded because National Party members voted in favour of the Hawke socialist Government's proposal. What about smaller government?
       </para>
       <para>
        I wonder whether people in the country remember that the tax on wine and an increase in the tax on juice and flavoured milk came into effect because the coalition and the Government in this place voted against the Australian Democrats. However, the message does not always get through. The message that country people are beginning to get-and this matter is helping them get it-is that the whole privatisation push in the coalition puts much of their community life and their economic life at risk. If it is persisted with by the coalition-which of course includes National Party members-services to people in rural areas, which in many cases are still not adequate, will have to be reduced. We already have such problems as Australia Post closing down post offices and reducing the number of letter boxes, and Telecom Australia's reluctance to provide the sorts of services that it should. If we have increased emphasis on private schools, private medicine and the rest of it, it is the country people who suffer first and who suffer worst. In any case, country people in many areas support the Country Party-even though it has changed its name.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the National Party caved in on this matter. Peter Fisher referred to the `political considerations of power'. The coalition was put before the constituency-the constituency of farmers, their communities and a whole major Australian export industry. That is what happened in April. There was quite a bit of posturing at the time, but eventually a formal statement was put out by the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, which said, `Yes, we support deregulation but not Mr Kerin's package. We've got a proposal of our own'. It highlighted four fundamental points. I have here a copy of the press release. The first point highlighted was reasonable progress towards deregulation of the transport, handling, storage and waterfront areas to reduce the many cost burdens placed on wheat growers by high levels of regulation. The second point highlighted was a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee to provide a satisfactory first advance or cash trading option for the Wheat Board. The third point highlighted was the maintenance of the Wheat Board's existing powers in relation to exports. The fourth was that the Board should have the capacity to remain a strong trader, competing on fair and reasonable terms with other domestic traders.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some members of the National Party at that time seemed to indicate in the corridors of this place, `It's all right because Mr Kerin's package deregulates part of the export industry and we said that we don't want that. Mr Kerin's package does not deregulate transport, handling and storage-we have got him there, we will be safe'. The coalition members thought they had won. What a lot of rubbish, or naivety. Anyway, one or two heads have rolled, though only one in the National Party. It seemed to me extraordinarily naive that some National Party members were comforting themselves by making such statements about that package. Clearly, the intention to deregulate in the export area was part of Mr Kerin's ambit claim all along. Maybe these people would have known this was an ambit claim when they first saw it if they had dealt a bit more with unions and such claims. Clearly, the Minister was going to give way on that point. Very shortly thereafter statements were made by Mr Kerin that he would move in the area of transport, handling and storage deregulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having dealt with those two major points, we then heard from the coalition that, although it could not decide until it actually saw the legislation, it looked as though deregulation of the domestic wheat market would occur, that it had gained considerable concessions from Mr Kerin and therefore it would go ahead. At that point many people in the industry said to me, `For goodness sake, what is this I hear about the Democrats caving in on this one?'. I do not know who started those rumours in the press gallery-whether it was done by the Government or the Opposition-but it was never the case. At that point I said to representatives of the Grains Council in particular that if anyone were to do a deal on this one, it would not be the Australian Democrats-and that has been the case. I think it is shameful that the National Party agreed to such a deal on this. It should never have believed that that package was not acceptable, at least in large measure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 88 of the Bill gives the coalition that first demand-for deregulation of transport, handling and storage. On 6 April, only two days after the Opposition's package was presented, Mr Kerin announced his intention to move in that regard. At this point the industry could see the full force of the capitulation that had taken place in the coalition. Since then it has been downhill all the way for wheat growers in the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having allowed the coalition to deliver to the Government the required numbers to pass the deregulation package, which was extended into the area of transport deregulation, National Party members in the House of Representatives did not solidly support their rural constituency and the actions that Peter Fisher and one or two others took. They had delivered the numbers to the Government. Surely they could have stayed solidly together in the interests of their constituents. It was clearly a case of individual ambition and the dream that one day there might be a coalition government and that they might be on the front bench, looking at the fate of others who had done the wrong thing in the past. It should be remembered that this occurred last week. That thought kept them firmly in their seats alongside other members of the coalition. I certainly hope that this week in the Senate, National Party senators will show some more spine.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind rural people what is happening. The Australian Democrats oppose this legislation. We will vote against it at every stage. Some individual members of the National Party have done that. What happens here remains to be seen. However, the Democrats will vote in favour of most of the amendments to be moved by the Opposition-and we will vote for all of those which are supported by the Grains Council. Had the Opposition not moved them, we certainly would have. The major features of those amendments include-this is a major one as far as we are concerned-that they allow for the retention of grower representatives on the Wheat Board and for the appointment of a grower chairperson. We consider, as we always have in rural legislation, that grower control and involvement is essential.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not see how the Government can possibly argue against that. On the one hand it is saying to us, `We will deregulate marketing', and, on the other hand, it is saying that we are insulting growers by saying that they cannot market their product without the Wheat Board-a board which they have had for 50 years, which they say they still want, which serves an enormously important purpose by allowing them to get on with their job of growing so that they do not have to get out in the marketplace; they are represented there by their own body. The Government is saying, `That is an insult. They can get out there, they can do it. Growers are really on the ball and they know all about commercial marketing. But don't ask us to appoint five of them to the Board. Don't ask us to let one of them be the chairperson'. There is no logic in this argument. The Government dare not say to the Democrats, `This amendment is not on'. This amendment is on; it is an affirmation of what the Government is saying-that growers can be competent in marketing. We are saying their most competent representatives should be appointed to their Board. That is why we will support the amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will support the amendments which involve consultation with the Grains Council on various aspects of the operations of the Board, the representation by the Grains Council of the grain industry on issues such as handling of the industry fund, and so on. We will support the amendments which ensure that the Wheat Board, at least until some sort of challenge comes up, if it does, is able to trade intrastate. I cannot imagine how the Opposition in the end can vote for legislation which, if this amendment is not accepted by the Government once it is passed by the Senate clearly will kill the Wheat Board, because a minimum of 80 per cent of grain traded on the domestic market is traded within the State in which it is grown. That is the Victorian figure. In most of the other States it is higher. If that wheat cannot be sent through the Australian Wheat Board, it certainly does not have a level playing field on the domestic market. Not only that, but the Minister's representatives at meetings which I have attended in wheat growing areas have been saying, `Don't worry, growers will still go to the Wheat Board. They are comfortable with it, they have been using it for 50 years and so it has an advantage'. They will not be able to go to the Wheat Board unless the Government accepts this amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I certainly agree with the aspect of the second reading amendment which condemns the Government for not stitching up its deal with the States before coming to us with this legislation. That amendment, which we will be passing in the Senate, is only necessary because the Government needs complementary legislation, but clearly it will not get it. I have not been able to get the report from the last meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in February, but I finally received a communique from it today. A press report today re-emphasises the New South Wales Government's rejection of being pushed into complementary legislation. Certainly New South Wales and Queensland have made public the fact that they are not going to be pushed. Even if they were, the legislation would not be in place before 1 July, which is when new wheat marketing legislation of one kind or another must go through this Parliament. I certainly think the Government stands condemned on that amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another amendment provides for exemption from the Trade Practices Act which is essential if the Wheat Board is to be able to operate. I will go into more detail when we discuss this matter. Clearly sellers who are small must be able to get together, particularly in a market where there is mainly an oligopoly of large buyers. An amended Bill, which will be better for growers in the industry than an unamended Bill, will go back to the House of Representatives. As I said, I believe that the Government must accept these amendments. This is a part of the voice of the industry being heard through the Senate. I acknowledge that the Government has started negotiations on this legislation and has made amendments, many of which were only necessary because it was pretty sloppy in the first place; for example, the Government has used the term `grain' when it should have been restricted to wheat and that sort of thing. There has also been confusion about the rights that it wants to take over from the States and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        I previously asked a question of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who represents the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in this place, about statements made by Mr Kerin that he would not be blackmailed or held over a barrel by the Parliament on this matter and that we could end up with no wheat marketing legislation at all. I am very concerned about that. I am disappointed that we did not get an answer. It would be utterly irresponsible of the Government if it moved in any way so that we do not have wheat marketing legislation in place by 1 July. I hope it will not come to that. The question really is whether the Opposition will hold firm anyway if Mr Kerin decides to dig in his heels. I am concerned about a statement made by the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). When the legislation was going through the House of Representatives, he admitted in a press conference that the coalition would support the legislation even if the Opposition's amendments were rejected. I suppose in the fullness of time we will see whether that meant only in the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will not support those clauses of the Bill which deregulate transport, handling and storage. I think it is quite incredible that Senator McKiernan should become sensitive about the union bashings going on over here. For goodness sake, this Government dished up the ideal opportunity to this Opposition to go into a union bash. The list of speakers just gets longer and longer. Most of them will be union bashing and the Government has caused that to occur. It has capitulated to the Opposition simply to get this deregulation package through. The Government did not consult with the unions and it does not seem to care that ultimately more than 1,000 jobs will be lost in Victoria and that 300 jobs will be lost in Queensland. I am told that in one western Queensland town 100 rail families might have to move out. That will be the end of that town altogether. The Government does not seem to worry at all about that. It will have to sit there and cop it if the Opposition gets into a union bash. The Government has left it wide open and the Opposition has put a further wedge into it with an amendment, which we will not support, to deregulate the labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that the Government has asked for it. The Opposition has given it to the Government and no doubt will continue to do so through this debate. The Opposition's labour market deregulation amendment shows that even though it has a new leadership it is still a New Right Liberal Party. I do not think anybody should lose sight of that. Clearly if that amendment were passed we would be in an enormously confrontationist industrial relations situation. Unless that amendment is withdrawn before the committee stage it will be clear that, new leadership or no new leadership, we are in for strife under a coalition government as far as industrial relations are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats will not support the usual amendment which has been trotted out on equal employment opportunity, based on the furphy that the equal opportunity legislation has in some way or other built into it a system of quotas; it does not. We will not support that amendment because to do so would be to concede that part of the argument. It is the usual coalition rubbish about quotas. I heard a rumour earlier today that that amendment would be withdrawn. I wondered for a moment whether the journalist I heard this morning commenting on the leadership changes might have been right-that woman and wets would benefit from the leadership upheaval in the Opposition. The amendment has not yet been officially withdrawn with me. I certainly hope that it will be withdrawn because at least Andrew Peacock and the rest of them deserve one victory out of all this.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will reluctantly vote with the Opposition on the second reading amendment. I have already remarked on one of its aspects. It condemns the Government for this whole exercise. The Government deserves to be condemned for this whole exercise, but so does the Opposition. I remind the Senate and the Australian public, particularly those people in rural towns, the people in the wheat belt and their families-in fact all Australians who rely so heavily on the wheat industry-that if this legislation is to get through the numbers will be provided by the Opposition. If we are going to condemn the Government for this legislation we must also condemn the Opposition. The Democrats could move to amend that amendment, but we would not get support. I cannot imagine either the Government or the Opposition supporting us in an amendment which asks them to condemn themselves. Therefore, we will support the Opposition in its amendment but under protest, pointing out the hypocrisy in moving an amendment to condemn somebody with whom it is about to vote on a specific piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will be moving amendments in the committee stage. They will be the amendments that the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) moved in the House of Representatives. Those amendments maintain the Australian Wheat Board's powers on the domestic market while allowing opportunities to give greater flexibility and a more commercial thrust. I will await with interest the actions of the National Party senators when those amendments are moved in the committee stage. Even if the National Party senators do move to vote with us, as they should, the Opposition will still give the Government the numbers on this legislation. All that aside, the end result is deregulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        If for no other reason, we should all be opposing this legislation because of the international situation. We are not thrusting this industry into a level playing field. Recently Mr Quayle visited Australia. He said that Mr Hawke was giving all the wrong figures, or he could not understand them; but the facts are that the United States has increased its share of the world wheat and flour market by 48 per cent since its export enhancement program commenced. Our market share has fallen by close to 43 per cent over the same period. The figures go on and they are figures which Mr Quayle was given by Mr Hawke. There is no evidence whatsoever that internationally this major industry is anywhere near a level playing field. We should all be opposing this legislation, even if only on that basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has been and remains a shabby exercise by both the Government and the Opposition. The Nationals have caved in, the Liberals are making an ideological push, from which Mr Elliott benefits, and the Government is on its own ideological push-deregulation of the wheat market. It is hoist on its own petard and has initiated a union bash in this place having done its deal with the Liberals and walked out on its union constituency-first on the railways and who knows where next. Only the Democrats have stood firm in the best interests of a major Australian industry-those who grow the wheat, their families, the communities in which they live and all of us who benefit from the economic advantage that this industry has given us in the past and will have now a much greater struggle to give us in the future.

         â€”Frequently in the Senate I listen to speeches by members of all political parties claiming their support for the little person, the battler and the small businessman; yet if we support this legislation which the Government has brought before us today we will be no better than the Government is. The Government is the champion of big government, big business and big unions. The full ramifications of the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and the related wheat levy Bills which we are now debating will mean that we have abandoned the average Australian wheat farmer.

        Under this proposal basically 40,000 wheat farmers will be placed in the hands of two or three grain merchants. It will provide a windfall for a small but powerful clique of traders. It can be described only as an attempt to destroy, as far as it can, the efficacy of the family farmer who, through hard work and endeavour, has settled and developed so much of Australia. It is because of this abandonment of the average farmer and the total rejection of his plight at the hands of this Government that I will cross the floor to vote against these Bills.

        Fundamentally, as a National Party senator, I represent a rural constitutency. The National Party in Queensland has made many successful inroads into urban areas in the past 15 years. However, we must always remember that the rural base forms the core of the National Party. It is this base which is asking for recognition from this Government of its plight and it has demonstrated how strongly and emphatically it is against the wheat Bills. Certainly, I have been under pressure to reject this legislation. The pressure has come from local authorities, individual farmers and farmer organisations and it can be described only as overwhelming.

        I will quote from some of the comments and letters about the legislation that I have received. I received a letter the other day-I have no doubt that other senators did likewise-from Mr Don McKechnie, the General President of the Queensland Graingrowers Association. He wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . we believe that it is a misguided step which will benefit neither wheat growers nor consumers and will set the scene for the destruction of the Australian Wheat Board's position as the sole exporter of wheat.

        He went on to say:

       <para>
        Senator, my message simply is, the Wheat Marketing Bill has massive, far-reaching and damaging implications for the State of Queensland. For the Parliament to pass it as legislation would be provocative and cavalier and irresponsible. I am relying on you to protect the interests of this State.
       </para>
       <para>
        Queensland is not the only State involved. I invite the Senate to consider Victoria. Peter Fisher in the other place certainly made an impassioned plea on behalf of the wheat growers of Victoria. I have no doubt the same applies to other States-even, Madam Acting Deputy President, your home State of Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Queensland Country Life also took up the cudgels. In an editorial entitled `Wheat refit needs rethink,' it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A bull-headed determination to force through a wheat deregulation system which nobody in the industry wants is hardly responsible government `by the people for the people' . . . grain farmers must start to wonder who the Dickens is supposed to be representing them in Canberra.

       <para>
        I can assure them that the National Party of Queensland is certainly looking after their interest in the Senate at this time. In one of the articles in the Queensland Country Life that I read in my home just this weekend, it is stated:

       <para>
        The Commonwealth Wheat Marketing Bill introduced into the House of Representatives . . . if passed in its current form, will provide the Australian Wheat Board with a baseball bat to beat all grain growers and State storage, handling and transport authorities into submission by over-riding State rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        Irrespective of what John Kerin says, interpretation of legal advice indicates that the Bill is extremely far-reaching and has the potential to cover all grains-not only wheat.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should now be understood why I certainly do not support the Bills before the House. The quotes represent only a few of the many pleas that I have received to reject this legislation. The wheat industry is a particularly valuable part of the Australian economy. It has developed from the activities and personal endeavours of many tens of thousands of people, some of whom began to establish this industry soon after Australia was settled. It now presents to the country one of its basic means of earning export income. It is an industry made up of the hopes and aspirations of many small farmers. However, the reality is that the seasons and markets are unpredictable for agricultural producers and there has been, and is, significant uncertainty for the wheat growers, against which in the past they have looked to the Wheat Board to provide them with some form of insurance. However, very many wheat growers throughout Australia at present are very happy that they have had good rain. They are certainly hoping that they will get some financial recompense for the wheat they will plant in the coming season.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Australian wheat industry there has always been a guarantee that through the Wheat Board there would be a fundamental base structure, a floor, in the market. From that, farmers have been able to make some assessment of their future. Through the Australian Wheat Board Australia has managed to increase its share of world grain trade during the last few years, despite the tough marketing conditions and local subsidy activities of the United States of America and the European Community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wheat industry has tended to protect the interests of the grower in Australia by adopting an uncorrupted price for Australian consumers and establishing an umbrella to protect the grower. That is why we want to make sure that the Wheat Board is maintained. Someone might get a few more dollars elsewhere for his wheat, but it is all achieved under that umbrella price of the Board. That, I am sorry to say, is to be diminished. The value of the Board and the pool is that they can always straddle the times of oversupply and the times at which growers find it difficult to survive. They can ensure that each year something is paid for the wheat crop.
       </para>
       <para>
        Orderly marketing is ingrained in the consciousness of Australian wheat growers. I do not think many people have considered this Bill on the basis that orderly marketing is there not for the good times, but for the bad times. One does not need any help to sell wheat in or outside Australia now, but how many years do we have to go back before we come across bad times? By supporting these Bills, we serve only to highlight the uncertain predicament of the domestic wheat producer. Most Australian wheat producers are family farmers. Most of them do not have the expertise to engage in marketing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should like to quote from Ken Davidson's article in The Age on 6 April entitled `Wheat Farmers Likely Losers in Open Market':
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether wheat farmers as a whole would benefit by choosing when and to whom to sell really amounts to whether they are capable of being better wheat marketers than the Wheat Board. The balance of probabilities is that they are better at growing grain than selling it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The idea that wheat farmers, by having the opportunity to take risks in the wheat market, will be more responsive to market forces, and more effective in getting economies in handling, distribution and transport, has a certain ideological attraction but only a weak practical force. There are continued savings to be made by improving the efficiency of wheat handling, storage and transport, but as Mr McColl, on whose Royal Commission findings the Government's case for deregulation is based, says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The identified savings are achievable with the existing marketing arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unless the bulk of Australia's wheat growers have untapped attributes in marketing their own wheat, the real beneficiaries of the deregulatory proposals will be the middlemen and the end users.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning more specifically to this debate, I believe that we should not have deregulation in any industry simply on the basis of an unyielding philosophy or ideology. There is today an almost fanatical approach to deregulation, not only in politics but also in the community. In the wheat industry, there is a need for some change in management and marketing-a point conceded by many across the nation and argued here today-but the Government's approach, in my view, goes too far too fast. I do not wish for a triumph for the ideology of deregulation of the market place at any cost over the need for sound economic efficiency in the wheat industry. Too many in this place often allow ideology on economic issues and crass politics to replace the needs of people. This is what we are doing today, and it is at the expense of the most important factor underlying this debate-the economic survival of the grain grower.
       </para>
       <para>
        My second point involves persistent concern about constitutional question marks over the Government's approach, based on the Commonwealth's international and interstate trade and commerce powers under section 51 (1) of the Australian Constitution-in particular, the very understandable fear of some that State rights are in question. To base legislation on such a foundation must inevitably lead to challenge, disruption and uncertainty. I wonder whether the industry can afford such a shaky foundation in an environment of increasing competition. Because of this, the issue has become also one of State rights rather than one purely of the deregulation of grain storage, handling and transport systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most importantly, the Commonwealth of Australia is a federation of States which retained sovereign rights upon formation of the Commonwealth. But yet again the Federal Government seeks to override the responsibilities of State governments. The States of Australia have a prime responsibility for the production and distribution of all produce within their own boundaries. The Government has deliberately ignored the continued responsibilities of the States and has said, `We do not really care what you want to do; we will pursue this course and proceed with this legislation because we think it is in our political interests'.

         â€”I agree with Senator Boswell. The very important clause 88 deals with the operation of certain State and Territory laws. This clause allows any trading corporation to ignore State laws in respect of the storage, handling, transport and marketing of all grain destined for export or for sale interstate. In many minds, this can be seen only as a direct interference with so-called State rights. It now has the potential to disrupt some well established State-based arrangements for the storage, handling, transport and marketing of other commodities, such as barley, grain, sorghum, maize, oilseeds, rice, legume crops-and indeed, as I mentioned earlier, peanuts.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not accept that the powers of the Wheat Board should be so extended that they prejudice the continued viable operations of State marketing authorities. Those State marketing authorities have been constituted across a whole range of products of the soil, many of which the Minister can incorporate by regulation as commodities to be traded by the Wheat Board. It could set a precedent for further Commonwealth intrusion into the handling, transport and marketing of other commodities which have an export orientation, such as coal and beef. There is no reason whatsoever why the powers of State marketing authorities, which have traded effectively and well on behalf of their producers, should be threatened by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        My final objection reflects practical local reservations about the potential for increased road transport of bulk grain in very large vehicles. As another senator has said, that in turn will affect the railways in the State of Queensland and, of course, in the other States as well. That is something that ought to be taken into consideration. Many Queenslanders are increasingly apprehensive about the prospect of increased road tonnages heading for the port of Brisbane on already badly damaged roads. Greater use of road transport can only cause massive damage, thus raising maintenance and registration costs, causing more road accidents, and reducing the quality of life in many country towns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just a few days ago when we were debating the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, many of us spoke at length about the problems of roads in our various States and about the need for more money. The road transport problem is indeed exacerbated by the reductions in Government funding for the construction of rural roads over the past six years. Has the Government forgotten that many rural roads in south-east Queensland will need extensive work to meet the demands of increased bulk grain transport? Queensland, and I suspect most other States, cannot afford to allow large tonnages of grain to move by road outside the rail and central storage system. As a Queensland senator who has travelled round the State during the wheat harvest, I have seen the big silos and the big wheat dumps. It is very necessary that the rail system be able to transport the vast majority of the wheat harvest. That is most important. If the transporting of large tonnages by road is allowed, it really will create a problem. I dread to think of the effects of allowing uncontrolled road transport from country areas to our ports. That would cause shocking damage to the road system and would undoubtedly bring about a hefty increase in State taxes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I want to remind honourable senators that the people of Australia put us here not to pursue measures purely on the basis of blind ideologies, but to ensure that there is justice for all. There is no way in which that justice will be meted out to Australian wheat farmers if we vote for these Bills. I certainly support the following amendment moved by Senator Stone to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time:

        I rise to speak on the Wheat Marketing Bills before the Senate in order to restate my stance against the deregulation of the Australian wheat industry as proposed in the Government's legislation. To deregulate the domestic wheat market and essentially take away the acquisition powers of the Australian Wheat Board is the essence of the Bills before the Senate. The essence of my decision is not to support this legislation. I am fully aware, in using the term `cross the floor', that it is against the coalition's position. I do not take that lightly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let it be remembered that it is not I who is supporting a government that has not a shred of interest in Australian rural sector, let alone the Australian wheat farmers. It is not I who is walking away from the express view of over 85 per cent of Australian wheat farmers, the Grains Council of Australia, and, in my own home State of Victoria, the Victorian Farmers Federation. Rather I believe my stance carries with it the strongest of electorate support. When the crunch comes is that not what every public representative is bound to do-to be responsible to their own electorate? We are the very people entrusted to carry their views to Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I am very mindful of the need from time to time for pragmatism in politics. It is necessary and proper to be able to weld the many views that make up this Parliament. To fall and die on a principle may not always be as wise as to live and fight another day. But there will always be a line drawn in public life, indeed, in any sphere of life. In my short political career this is the line I cannot cross. For me to cross that line would forever dull my conscience to the point where it would merely be a moulded product of Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the aspects of this debate that grate me most has been the absolute ability of this Government and its bureaucrats to mock the farmers' view. Many experienced and hard working farmers have drawn on their history of the industry and their fathers history of the industry in the time of the depression and in the time before the Australian Wheat Board was established. They were times that were very hard. They were times when merchants ruled ruthlessly. Yet their knowledge has been dismissed simply as a time passed. It is not a time passed. Australia has never been so economically wrecked since those times. Australia has never depended so much upon the hard work and wisdom of these particular Australians as they depend on them today.
       </para>
       <para>
        These wheat farmers, as with all farmers throughout rural Australia, represent so much of what is the spirit of Australia. They are the people who every day, from dawn to dusk, face the uncertainty and force of the Australian climate. They are the families who produce the wealth and health of this nation. History shows above all that they are the families who gave their lives with greater patriotism than most would today. Any visitor to a shire office in the Wimmera or the Mallee area of my State of Victoria will see the war honour board listing the names of the fallen. Those names far outweigh the population, size and significance of the district. They are the people who laid the foundation stone of the Australian character and of the character of the National Party of Australia. They are the people whom this Parliament is damning today.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Party ethos and historical direction is totally contrary to the path down which the Government is leading our rural producers. John McEwen, a Country Party leader from Victoria, a Deputy Prime Minister and a Prime Minister of this nation, clearly outlined the role he felt the Party should play when speaking during debate on the then Labor Government's proposed Wheat Stabilisation Bill in 1948. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Country Party was brought into existence largely for the purpose of protecting producers against the exploitation of speculators and middle-men. Realising that legislative protection against such exploiters could not be extended to every individual producer, the Australian Country Party conceived a plan of collective handling and disposal of primary products embracing all the co-operatives, of orderly marketing and voluntary pools, and when the objective could not be otherwise obtained, compulsory pools where a majority of the producers so decided.
       </para>
       <para>
        That to this day is the belief of Party members. Every National Party State Council and the Party's Federal Council have overwhelmingly supported the continuation of the existing powers of the Wheat Board in the domestic market. The wisdom of that party's decision has, indeed, been one of the prime motivations for the stance I take today.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have the firmest conviction that the Party must be true to its faith or it shall wither as any party would wither that is not true to its faith. It shall wither as an influence in Australian politics and ultimately fade away. This Party will not wither provided the elected members maintain the ethos of the party as they best know how. Each individual piece of legislation that is contrary to the fundamental purpose of the Party and, more so, is contrary to the unanimous views of the grass roots should be opposed vigorously and without fear.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Party as from yesterday entered a new era of leadership. We moved forward with confidence into a new era with a commitment to hold our old values. As I said in my maiden speech-I believe it is true today-it has been the history of the National Party to speak for those who have no voice, to remember those who are forgotten and to respond to the aspirations of all Australians seeking a better life in a better country. We have never forsaken that history and we dare not. Sadly, under this Government, the farmers have no voice. They have been forgotten and their aspirations have been crushed.
       </para>
       <para>
        A great deal of emphasis has been placed upon coalition unity in coming to a decision on the wheat issue. In today's politics a united coalition front is of importance to rid this great nation of the Labor Government and its incompetence and treachery. It must be remembered that I am on a joint Senate ticket. However, within a coalition there must, from time to time, be different views. After all, we are two separate parties. The foundation stone of a successful relationship rests upon the fact that when an agreement is struck, especially when that agreement is in writing, it sticks. No matter how tortuous that may be for certain individuals or for one particular party it sticks. Otherwise that foundation stone will be chiselled away. Indeed, the now broken wheat agreement between the two conservative parties will probably go down in history as a case in point.

         â€”As my colleague Senator Boswell interjects, a case in infamy. The Federal Government's plan to deregulate the wheat industry is a triumph for the ideology of deregulation at any cost over the need for economic efficiency within the wheat industry. The wheat industry, with the Australian Wheat Board playing the major role, is an efficient industry. I refer to the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report that the Government so heavily depended upon to bring in this legislation. If it reads the first paragraph of the first page it may have a different view. That IAC report said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        By almost any criterion, wheat growing must be judged as one of Australia's most efficient activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is an industry that contributes over $2 billion in much needed export income and supports more than 45,000 family farms and many rural townships. In a deregulated market as proposed under the Government plan, efficiency could only occur where there exists multiple buyers and multiple sellers. But the reality is that there are 45,000 family farmers on the sellers' side and three companies controlling over 70 per cent on the buyers' side of the industry. I quote the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, before he did his backflip on this particular matter. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        If you get rid of the Wheat Board's power you would be handing the industry over to the Elders and Cargills and Continentals Bunges and away you go.
       </para>
       <para>
        That statement was made in 1987 by the Minister before he did his backflip. In the economic textbooks that have obviously been forgotten by the extreme deregulators that is called an oligopoly or a market dominated by a few large corporations. Those deregulators would be very hard pressed to try to put up a case that an oligopoly leads to an efficient market. The oligopolist trade that would occur would not be broken down by new entrants into the industry. For a new firm to be able to achieve the scale of operation required in the secondary stages of the wheat industry substantial capital would be required. It is very doubtful whether new investors would take on the monolithic corporations already established in the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is no surprise that this Labor Government would support a greater concentration of economic power. The corporate state is akin to the Labor Party's strategy over the past six years. It is so obvious. The best way to achieve this goal is to reduce the decentralisation of ownership of private property, particularly in the conservative rural sector. This concentration of market power over the past six years is of concern not only for farmers but also for all small business people. After all, farmers are small business people. The result of this concentration is a situation in Australia, where many significant markets have only two or three companies dominating.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission is so concerned about this trend that it has made clear statements in support of small business in an attempt to reverse the trend. The former Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Bob McComas, has admitted that one of the biggest mergers approved during his administration has had no economic or any other benefit in Australia. That was the Coles-Myer merger. So concerned is the Trade Practices Commission that it has recently issued 25-pages of rural guidelines. If I may refer to the most potent sections of those trade practices guidelines, I shall read what the Commission had to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        While a superficial analysis may suggest that economic efficiency would be best served by removing regulation and allowing the market to operate free from intervention with the individual seller negotiating with the buyer, this does not hold where the market power of the large buyers would (in a deregulated market) far outweigh that of the producers. The following table is a selection of a number of important food product groups that involve only a few suppliers.

        The concentration of market power among processors, manufacturers, distributors and retailers implied by these figures, indicates that powerful buyers have emerged in the acquisition of primary products. Similar concentration has developed in the supply of goods and services such as fertilisers and services provided by stock and station agents.

        It is the Committee's view that countervailing power is necessary for economic efficiency in the rural industry. Without it, individual producers would be exposed to the power of large buyers which in some cases may be manifested in unfair business practices and insufficient market information.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the present climate of deregulation the Committee believes that use of the authorisation procedure provided under the Trade Practices Act to sanction certain kinds of collective market behaviour would be an appropriate means of achieving countervailing market power.

        Is that not what the Wheat Board is all about? It is not the monopoly that it is so often painted; rather, it is the collective of the 45,000 wheat farmers. It is their marketing arm. It is not the monopoly so often painted by the deregulators. The Board's charter is for the farmers. The grain merchants' charter is for fly-by-night shareholders who are usually made up of insurance companies. Surprisingly, though-other than the Government's view, which is no surprise-the extreme economic dries have come out in support of the Government plan. They need to examine the worth of their very narrow ideological path which overlooks economic efficiency on a broader scale.
       </para>
       <para>
        As is the case with all small business, family farms are the dynamo of private enterprise. Family farms represent Australian ownership of our natural resources. Such private access is rapidly being denied in other sectors of the economy due to the concentration of ownership in fewer and fewer hands. Further, the integration of the family and the farm-that is, the social unit and the economic unit-is of great value to this country. If the ideologues are seeking deregulation that will produce efficiency, there are clearly two ways to achieve it. The first is to accept the recommendations of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, which encourage deregulation and thus competition in the handling and transport of wheat. The Royal Commission clearly stated that its recommendations to improve efficiency can be implemented within the existing market arrangements of the Wheat Board. Secondly, the proposed arrangements can alleviate the heavy burden of protection of other industries that the wheat industry carries. To illustrate the size of this burden, the Impact Project Research Centre at the University of Melbourne calculated that if this burden was removed real net returns to farms in Australia's wheat growing zones would increase by approximately 18.4 per cent. Why do they not get off the farmers' backs?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true to say that the marketing arrangements are very complex and that those outside the industry, particularly from suburban Australia, do not have a grasp of the issue. However, the acid test for those city dwellers is whether the new arrangements will lead to increased bread prices or lower bread prices. The answer is that they will not lead to lower bread prices. Both the producer and the consumer will lose out, leaving the middle men, the grain merchants, as the real winners. That is not very good economics. The New Zealand industry, which was deregulated in 1987, has experienced a savage downturn in grower returns. Growers have taken at least a loss of $NZ100 per tonne. Meanwhile, the bread prices in that country have risen almost every month. The New Zealanders have found that after deregulation the wheat price is set by the weakest seller and the bread price is set by the strongest seller.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's plan will not only affect the domestic market, but it will also be the thin end of the wedge of deregulating the export market. Under the proposed legislation the grain merchants, those like Elders and Bunges, will overbuy on the domestic market and end up with unsold stock. This will have the effect of lowering prices for the grain growers in the following season and the grain merchants will go running to the Government pleading for permission to export their surplus. They will make this plea in the name of helping the current account and supporting the collapsing domestic price. The cries will arise that a deregulated domestic market and the Wheat Board's export powers are incompatible and therefore the export market must be deregulated as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        In any case, the Wheat Board will find itself snookered by the grain merchants when the Board comes to fulfil its export quotas. Under the legislation the grain merchants can buy such a significant proportion of the wheat that the Australian Wheat Board will have to try to buy back that wheat to fulfil its own export contracts without having control of the receival standards, once enforced by the Board prior to this legislation, in storage and handling. So there will be an inevitable lowering of receival standards in particular in the quality needed by the Wheat Board to fulfil its export market demands and this will affect Australia as a selling nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia could lose its primary distinguishing feature in a highly competitive market. How does the Parliament think we are able to be competitive in wheat sales against the United States or Canada? Our advantage is quality and price and the grain merchants will now be able to get a foothold in, if not the control of, the quality and price of the export market. I have the firmest conviction that the whole system is headed for a major breakdown under this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I further wish to relate my remarks to the abolition of the underwriting scheme. Underwriting is the cornerstone of any orderly marketing system. It has been responsible for effectively and efficiently allocating resources in many primary industries. It has allowed many family farmers to live and stay on the land with a certain amount of income security. Underwriting provisions have helped protect against the effects of a collapse of international prices and to ward against corrupt world prices specifically emanating from the United States. It is a very small price to pay for an industry which returns so much to the nation. It is also worthy to note that the existing system of underwriting has been triggered only on one occasion, in the 1986-87 season. Since that first underwriting provision was triggered, the Treasury has set about attempting to have it abolished. The legislation effectively does just that. The scaling down of the scheme over five years to 80 per cent of the expected pool returns means that the level of underwriting is placed at such a distance from market reality that it will not be triggered.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further to this particular act is the power of the Minister to veto the prices offered to the farmers by the Australian Wheat Board, resulting in an even greater likelihood that the provision of underwriting is simply a facade in the market place. It is then important for the Senate to support the amendments of the coalition to maintain the 95 per cent underwriting provision. It is the last hope of salvaging for the industry some form of orderly marketing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to address myself to the Government's claims that it is replacing orderly marketing with commercial flexibility. It is hardly giving the Wheat Board commercial flexibility when the prices offered by the Board must be cleared by the Minister. It is hardly giving the Wheat Board commercial flexibility when the Board cannot borrow in the marketplace without the approval of the Minister. It is hardly giving the Wheat Board commercial flexibility when the Minister has control over the expenditure of the proposed growers' levy. It is hardly giving the Wheat Board commercial flexibility when the Government guarantee for the Wheat Board's raising first cash advancement payments is only $100m, when $500m is required to compete with the billion dollar grain merchants.
       </para>
       <para>
        So much emphasis has been placed on the Government's great micro-economic reform leap forward. It is rubbish and it is being done with mirrors. Irrational deregulation is being forced on the wheat industry whilst, on the other hand, the Government has failed in all areas of micro-economic reform. It has failed in privatising Qantas and Australian Airlines. It has failed to bring real competition to Australia Post and Telecom. There has been no micro-economic reform in the labour market, coastal shipping and the waterfront. Waterfront efficiency is less than half that in other Western nations. The waterfront does not even have to compete at commercial international standards, let alone in a corrupt world market, as the wheat farmers do. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has caved in to the Waterside Workers Federation and promised that any reforms will not adversely affect its monopolistic stranglehold on the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        On every front where micro-economic reform would threaten the perks of Labor's constituency of unions and bureaucrats, the Government has cast aside micro-economic reform that would benefit the nation as a whole. In desperation, the Government has turned on the efficient wheat farmers and the Wheat Board to attempt to prove its credentials on deregulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Either by sloppiness in drafting the Bill or owing to the Government's full intent, the Bill threatened all primary produce marketing systems. When the Bill first entered Parliament, the Government had included a proposed section 88 which would have ridden roughshod over State primary produce marketing boards. Section 88 took in not only wheat but read, `or any other products of the soil.' This section would have placed at risk the orderly marketing systems of every primary industry in Australia. It would have opened the way for across the board deregulation, regardless of its merits, in each industry of the rural sector. It could have wiped away the orderly marketing systems that rural producers strived for and operated successfully over many decades. While the Opposition has succeeded to some extent in averting this threat, the original clause demonstrated the sloppy manner in which the Government prepared these Bills for Parliament. This appalling preparation in turn reflects the Government's attitude towards the fundamental needs of the agricultural sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has had to prepare more than 40 amendments to these Bills in addition to the 40 amendments proposed by the Opposition in the other House. Many amendments relate to the very Bill which I understand was prepared over 12 months ago. This debate has been raging for 12 months and the Government could still not get it right when it tabled the legislation in the other House. It is a mockery and a myth, peddled by who knows, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is in some way an improvement on all the past Labor Ministers responsible for agriculture. He is not better. He is worse. He is probably worse than any of the Ministers in that treacherous Whitlam Government that hated farmers. I believe that Mr Kerin is not as open but is far more cunning and devious in his manner and in his ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worthy to mention the amendments being moved by the coalition parties. They are aimed at bringing some sense into the Bill. They are aimed at strengthening the Wheat Board's representation of growers on the Board. While I am opposed to the dismantling of the Wheat Board's existing powers to compulsorily acquire the Australian wheat crop destined for human consumption, the coalition amendments have my support if we are to have a deregulated market. However, I maintain my strong belief that this legislation is fundamentally flawed and I signal my support for the amendments that have now been coined the Fisher amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the other place the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) moved several amendments that have the purpose of returning to the Wheat Board the compulsory acquisition powers in the domestic market. Those amendments are now to be moved in the Senate and will gain my support.

        I realise that the wheat issue is complex and detailed. Many members do not believe it is a real issue in their State or electorate. Indeed, the events of yesterday's leadership challenge certainly changed many people's view. However, I rely upon the Greek philosopher Socrates of the fourth century BC when I say that it is an issue for today's politics. He said:

         â€”This evening we are debating the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and six associated Bills. If one were a Martian who had landed in this country for the first time one would think, because of the media comments and the events of Monday night and yesterday, that this legislation was something extraordinary in the life of Australian politics. Of course, that is not the case. If one were a migrant to this great nation one would think, because of those events, that this was actually the first occasion the Parliament had discussed matters concerning wheat. That is not the case. This is the eighth occasion that the Parliament has determined to debate, discuss and amend as thought necessary the wheat marketing legislation; legislation that controls and governs the marketing of wheat.

        As we have seen, it is remarkable legislation, not so much because it has come from one of the best Ministers for primary industry this nation has ever had-I will put that one on the record for Mr Kerin-but because of the events that occurred yesterday in both the Liberal and National parties' rooms. Yet again we have seen this legislation not only divide a disunited coalition of Opposition parties but also divide the parties as well. We saw the extraordinary reports in last week's newspapers that the previous speaker, Senator McGauran, was threatened with grievous bodily harm in the corridors of this building. Luckily for the good senator, some of his burly colleagues were in the vicinity, so that harm never actually came to pass.

We have seen many reports in our media about the division between the coalition partners. But if I am to be fair, and I always intend to be fair when I am speaking in this chamber, or in other places, I also have to recognise that the legislation has caused division within my own Party, too, both within the party room and between our State branches, our State governments and the Commonwealth Government.

        It is an issue of great concern. It is perhaps a greater issue for the Australian Labor Party not only because we are in government but also because we represent more rural seats in the House of Representatives, where government is formed, than any other political party in this Parliament. Too often people forget this-not only people out there in the electorate but also people who sit on the Opposition benches, people who go by the name of the National Party, which used to be the Country Party, who no longer represent the interests of country people. The Australian Labor Party is close to the nerve edge of what the people in country areas are thinking. If honourable senators do not accept what I have just said they should remember, when talking about deregulation-which is essentially what the Wheat Marketing Bill and associated Bills are about-that it was not this Government that commissioned the Bradley Committee of Inquiry into the Monopoly Position of the Australian Postal Commission, which advocated deregulation. It was not the Government that commissioned the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunication Services in Australia, which examined Telecom and which was criticised not so long ago in this chamber as not going far enough to deregulate vital means of communication for country people. It was not an Australian Labor Party senator who made that criticism in this chamber; it was a coalition senator who is reputed to be Irish, although he talks slightly differently from me. Perhaps his credentials could be checked one day. But I will not go to the extremes that some of my parliamentary colleagues from Western Australia have gone to.

        I will put it on the record that I was very pleased to see the photograph in today's Canberra Times of the two battlers actually shaking hands and making up. I think that their having made up is somewhat of a veneer because the divisions are still very much there. There are still differences between the coalition partners, despite the change of leaders and the forthcoming change on the front bench. We on this side of the Parliament look forward with eagerness to those changes to see who will get the nod and who will be knocked back. I am sure that people on the other side of the parliamentary benches will also be looking at those changes with extreme interest.
       </para>

        The wheat marketing issue has been around for some time. As I said in my opening comments, it is not the first time that the Parliament has discussed such legislation. It is the eighth time the wheat marketing plan has been reviewed. I do not think that the events of the last few days have been matched in the past but certainly past events have been controversial. I will not dwell too much on history because we live in a rapidly changing environment, with new technology being introduced on a daily basis. This is impacting not only on the lives of honourable senators-I know a lot of Opposition senators have still not come to grips with it-but also on the community, including people in the country areas. Technology has been increasing apace. Legislation has to try as best it can to accommodate those technological changes.

        We instituted a Federal and State royal commission into grain transport, handling and storage, the McColl Royal Commission, which reported to Parliament last year. It made substantial recommendations, not all of which have been accepted by Government. The recommendations that were put forward were purported to benefit the wheat producers. Another report of extreme interest to this debate tonight was one that the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC)-or, as some people refer to it, the `Industries Assassination Commission'-put forward to the Government. This report is perhaps a little drier in outlook than that which came from the Royal Commission. I am happy to say that the Government on this occasion did not accept all the recommendations put forward by the IAC.
       </para>

        The recommendations of both the Royal Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission were debated at length in the States. Meetings were organised by the Grains Council of Australia. I know that in my own State of Western Australia those meetings were very well attended because I attended some of them, in company with my parliamentary colleague on the Opposition benches, Senator Panizza. There was deep concern about what the Government might do in regard to the deregulation of grain handling, storage and marketing, particularly as it related to wheat. As I said, the meetings were exceptionally well attended and the resolutions that were carried were generally in opposition to what had been announced as Government plans.

        The fact that some of us sit on the government benches does not mean to say that we do not listen to the community. We did listen to the community and we did bring the concerns back to the Minister. I had a number of discussions with the Minister and his staff. I took part in a delegation from the Western Australian State Government led by the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr Julian Grill, who put forward in a very forceful manner the views and concerns of the Western Australian State Government.

         â€”The Minister actually did listen to him. Although the Western Australian State Government was opposed to many of the proposals advanced by Minister Kerin in this particular piece of legislation, it put its case in a frank and forthright way, rather than doing what the Opposition sought to do. Instead of sitting down and working out arguments and listening to proper debate, those opposite went away and sharpened knives. We were a wee bit different. We were constructive. We wanted to service our electorates, the wheat farmers in the rural seats-and not only the ones whom we represent, but also the ones whom those opposite purport to represent but from whom, unfortunately, they run away.

        It is obvious from the contributions made in this chamber in very recent times that a number of people, including honourable senators who are members of the National Party, have not actually yet read the Bill, despite the conflict and concerns that they have expressed. I do not want to go as far as to name the good senators whom I accuse of not having read the Bill, the Minister's second reading speech in this place, or even the amendments which were moved in the House of Representatives and which were accepted by the Government. One particular senator alleged that, through clause 88 of the Bill, the Government would control the marketing, storage and handling not only of wheat but also of every other grain material, including lupins and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        A good senator, standing up here and opposing the Bill but supporting the amendments, forgot that an amendment to stop the Government having those powers had already been moved in the House of Representatives and had been accepted by the Government. That is an appalling omission by a senator who is supposed to represent the State for which that senator was elected. I am sure that Senator Panizza, because he has grabbed for his newspaper, picked up the same thing that I picked up, namely, that the senator who made that comment did not actually know what the same good senator was talking about.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes even further than that. I am sorry to continue the embarrassment to our troubled parliamentary colleagues who sit on the Opposition benches. The contributions made here this afternoon and this evening showed that there were a number of senators who do not understand the powers which will be given or maintained when this Bill passes through this Parliament. We have been criticised on the basis that we are not doing enough to control the marketing of grain within the States. I suppose that, if farmers are of a mind that the Commonwealth Government ought to be doing that and they are making their representations to elected representatives who sit on Opposition benches, they have the right to put that concern forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, there is a distinct obligation on elected representatives, irrespective of which political party they belong to, to understand the constraints imposed upon the Parliament and the Commonwealth Government by the Constitution. Whether or not representations have been made to honourable senators on the Opposition benches, and whether or not concerns have been raised with them, and even if there is a will for us to do it, we cannot do it because the Constitution prohibits us from doing it. Unfortunately, we have to endure a whole series of speakers, many of whom just do not know what they are talking about.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is particularly unfortunate because of all the happenings of the past couple of days. I have a certain degree of sympathy for people when they get knocked off from the leadership positions because, let us face it, we are all in the same game and we know how tough the game is. When they get knocked off one can feel somewhat sorry for them momentarily, whilst we rub our hands with glee that it has happened. That they have been knocked off by people who do not know what they have been talking about on this very controversial piece of legislation is an indictment not only of the individuals who have made that admission here in the Senate tonight but also of their political parties and their decisions in their party rooms as well.

         â€”I apologise, Mr Acting Deputy President. Perhaps my comments earlier on were a bit biting and now that I am actually handing out compliments they cannot be taken. I will return to the Bill, which is the important thing before us. In talking about the Bill, I again commend my Opposition parliamentary colleague for his statement here in the chamber tonight that he will not now cross the floor and vote against the Government's legislation. There had been some thoughts that perhaps he might do so. I commend him for his admission that he has a pang of conscience about doing that. That is something that happens to us all, in all political parties. Not all the time do we agree with everything contained within majority decisions of our respective parties. I understand what Senator Panizza is doing, and I understand his conscience. Quite frankly, I do not agree with each and every thing that is contained within this particular piece of legislation.

        I know that it will not have the same impact in terms of the movement of grain throughout the States. It will not have the same impact upon my State as it will have in States like Victoria and Queensland. While there are some concerns on the part of the trade union movement in my State, I am aware that those concerns are of a much more serious nature in States like Victoria and Queensland. I met with some union officials who came to Canberra to put their concerns to us, and I understand their concerns. Those union leaders are doing what they were elected to do, which is fighting for the jobs of their members.

        On the one hand, we government members and senators are criticised because, it is alleged, we follow blindly the dictates of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. On the other hand, it is alleged, as has been alleged to me in the chamber tonight, that we are selling out the workers of Australia. That is the conflict we have to live with on this side of the Parliament. It is not quite as difficult as the conflict which people opposite have had to live through during the past few days and months. It is, nonetheless, a conflict that we have to live through.

        Many of us are, and will be, making strong representations to Government to protect those jobs in the future. There is a need to ask the Government to examine in depth and in detail the implications to Australia's road system if there is a general shift away from the movement of wheat by rail back to road in a deregulated environment. Whilst rail has to more or less support itself-although it is subsidised-at least State and Commonwealth governments get a return from that system. We get very little return from the roads system-certainly not the same level of return we get from rail. We will be making strong representations to that effect.

        I recognise the enormous contribution made by the previous Western Australian Minister for Agriculture to debate on this issue. I also recognise the strong contribution made by the current Minister for Agriculture. Earlier I mentioned clause 88 of the Bill and that an Opposition amendment was accepted in the other place. Strong representations were made on behalf of the Western Australian Government, and on behalf not only of wheat growers but also of grain growers to free up the provisions of this particular clause. Ernie Bridge did the job and did it well. He has a lot to live up to in following in the footsteps of Julian Grill. Looking at what he has done so far, he will certainly give Julian Grill a good march for his money.

I had rather looked forward to being joined on aircraft travelling to this place and home again by the now Leader of the National Party in Western Australia, Hendy Cowan. Unfortunately, it would appear that Hendy has now taken the decision that he is no longer quite so interested in being the candidate for the Federal seat of O'Connor in Western Australia. I think it is a great shame because whilst Hendy has made an unfortunate choice in joining the National Party, I think--

I am quite disappointed that Hendy will perhaps not be joining us here. I hope he reconsiders his decision. We might even look forward to seeing a reunification similar to that which we saw today when Mr Tuckey and Senator McGauran shook hands. We have witnessed, in the corridors of this place, differences between Mr Tuckey and Senator McGauran which nearly led to their coming to blows. Things get a lot more heated between Mr Cowan and Mr Tuckey in their home State.

        I intended to make some comments about previous speakers. I have already mentioned some of them. I draw the Senate's attention to the contribution made by my colleague Senator Parer. Senator Parer's contribution this evening was another frank admission that the Opposition parties do not know what they are talking about when speaking to the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and associated legislation. Senator Parer, rather than referring to the fine details of the Bill-and I hope that we will be able to do so in the committee stage-engaged in what is now traditional for him: union bashing. He jumped on the bandwagon and mentioned a whole number of irrelevancies about what happened during World Expo 88 and so on. He belongs to a political party which advocates deregulation. I think the Bill is controversial and historic. It will go forward with the support of all parties, although some amendments will be moved. I think it is a useful piece of legislation and I certainly hope that the debate in the community continues.
