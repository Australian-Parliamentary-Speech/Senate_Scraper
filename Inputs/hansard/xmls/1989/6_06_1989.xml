       Health Insurance

       To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate reject this legislation

        May we, the undersigned, seek your support to regain our right to choose the type of medical treatment we desire, e.g. Chelation Therapy (a cleaning out of blocked blood vessels in layman's terms) or any other treatment.
       </para>

        At present, this right is denied us as the present government has disallowed the importation of the necessary ingredients for this treatment.

        Chelation Therapy is:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. A prevention against heart disease.

        The medical profession obviously prefer the more lucrative By-pass procedure and deny the value of Chelation Therapy. Please take notice of satisfied patients who have had this treatment and give opportunity to those who desire to have it when needed. Thank you,

        I believe this is a matter of great urgency. We are dealing with seven Australian lives which will be in jeopardy if the bombing of Beecroft Peninsula goes ahead at noon. I think it must be discussed now. The Government must be made to realise that its actions are parallel to those of the Government of China towards protesters. In this case members of the community are concerned with what is going on in Australia, namely, the bombing of an area of Aboriginal significance which yesterday the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) stated should be made into a national park. The bombing is to go ahead and the military has responded by sending eight vehicles into the area to clear the protesters and arrest them. The military is being very heavy-handed. There is no need for it to bomb this area. This area, which is listed on the National Estate, has been accepted as being of unique historical and environmental interest. The Government and the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, in their bloody-mindedness have said that they must go ahead and bomb this area. Why is it being bombed?

He is debating the substantive motion and not telling us why we should now debate it. He ought to be strictly confined to the reasons why the Senate should stop debating the matters which are listed for debate today and debate his motion.

       </para>
       <para>
        ``(4) Without prejudice to any other provision of this Part, subsection (1) does not apply where the Minister, by written instrument, declares that for a specified period, and for the reasons stated in the instrument, Australia Post is unable to perform the services reserved in subsection (1) in accordance with the requirements in subsection 27 (4).

       <para>
        ``(5) A declaration under subsection (4) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment is to provide for an exception to Australia Post's reserved services contained in clause 29. What is significant about this amendment is that it offers the perfect opportunity for the Government to demonstrate its bona fides in the wake of the report from the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) released yesterday which recommended that there should be a two-month delay on a postal charges increase. The principal reason given for that recommendation by the Prices Surveillance Authority was that it was not satisfied that the Government had made progress in that area, and that Australian consumers could not be expected to bear a 2c increase when performance results were so poor. Professor Fels, who is the newly appointed and very well-respected Chairman of the PSA, is reported as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . poor industrial relations caused Australia Post's recent poor showing in Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . he recommended internal consultation and greater use of the Industrial Relations Commission to head off damaging disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        `This delay is intended as a warning that further price discipline would be required in future if necessary', he said.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite an average yearly increase of five per cent in postal volume, insufficient modernisation of postal facilities in Melbourne had placed extra pressure on workers, leading to tensions. This, in turn, had led to disputes, Professor Fels said.
       </para>
       <para>
        A spokesman for the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union blamed the poor delivery, as always, on understaffing, which, he said, had caused a drop in morale. The usual Pavlovian response is that the way out of the crisis is to increase the numbers in the work force and, presumably, the members of that particular union.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is significant that at this very time a report has been released indicating that unionisation levels have fallen to record lows, and that only about 42 per cent of the Australian work force now belong to trade unions. The reason for that is clear: workers in general no longer accept the proposition that trade unions are acting in the best interests of their members; they are simply acting in their own interests. While that remains the case, people will be very reluctant to join trade unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very significant that the Prices Surveillance Authority has addressed the issue in the stark manner in which it has. It was fully aware of the financial implications of a two-month delay, which will mean revenue forgone by Australia Post of about $7m to $8m. Nonetheless, the PSA sees it as being a very necessary move in order to enforce some discipline on the industrial relations practices of Australia Post.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against that background it is worth recalling what happened in the United Kingdom last year when there was a series of postal strikes which ultimately led to the Government invoking the essential services legislation that was available to it, and commissioning Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, an Australian company, to carry out deliveries of letters to various welfare recipients. That was done at a time of crisis, to ensure the continued flow of mail deliveries. That is precisely what this amendment has in mind. Where necessary, and where Australia Post is unable to perform those reserved services, the Minister should declare the reserved service inoperative.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a litmus test of the Government's seriousness on the issue. If the Government wants to respond properly to the Prices Surveillance Authority's clear warning and give a signal to the Australian community that it regards the justification for monopoly practices as being where the beneficiary of the monopoly practice is acting in the public interest, it will take the view that, where industrial disputation or other activities make it impossible for those services to be carried out, it will let private contractors come into the business. That has happened overseas. There is no reason at all why that cannot happen here.
       </para>
       <para>
        Essential services legislation applies in a variety of areas. It should apply in this instance. Our amendment would allow that to happen. Otherwise we will find not only that Australia Post is protected in certain areas but also that the definition of `letter' is expanded so that Australia Post's monopoly coverage is increased. It now has the capacity, as a result of the Australian Democrats doing their usual trick of siding with the Government on every issue in sight with an absolute blind determination to ignore the logic and merits of the argument--

         —Perhaps Senator Collins was not here last night, so I will tell him what happened. This is a classic example of the way in which the Democrats have approached this legislation. Last night the Democrats were invited to consider an amendment to Telecom's community service obligations as they apply particularly in the Northern Territory. Concern has been expressed by the Northern Territory Government that changing the definition to merely `accessible' instead of `available where it is practicable to do so' would impose a lesser obligation on Telecom to provide services, especially to remote Aboriginal communities. That representation was made to the Democrats and to us. Senator Powell last night said that this was the one amendment-bear in mind there are about 80 amendments to this package of Bills-that she thought might have some merit. She reserved her position until the Minister had spoken.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Evans then made what could only be described as an attempt to obfuscate the issue. At no stage did he address his mind to the distinction between `accessible' and `available'. My colleague Senator Reid made it clear that the Minister's response was inadequate. Senator Evans then sought further instructions and had his attention addressed to the subjective element in the previous wording which allowed Telecom to decide whether, in its opinion, it was practicable to deliver a service. The Opposition withdrew that. It then became an objective test: Telecom had to make those services available where it was practicable to do so. The Democrats then voted with the Government to defeat the amendment and therefore to impose a lesser community service obligation on Telecom. That is precisely the acid test. It is a classic example of how the Democrats have a blind commitment to the preservation of monopoly service at all cost, irrespective of the trade-offs and whether there is a genuine need for competition in the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regard it as a disgrace. As we will see during the morning, the Democrats will pay heavily for that sort of blinkered ideology. It is a little short of a tragedy that we cannot have a sensible debate and address issues on their merits because we have in the Parliament one group that, on occasions, is able to decide the fate of legislation and which is not prepared to consider these things with an open mind. It is not even prepared to argue the case, against a background of the actions of, presumably, Senator Cook and all of his ministerial colleagues who are now busy trying to kick Senator Childs to death on the issue of privatisation of the airlines.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that there comes a time when one has to be prepared to think through the logic of the argument and not simply maintain a fixed and blinkered ideological position. It is little short of a national tragedy that about the only outfit in the Parliament which is not prepared to do that is the Australian Democrats. If they are fair dinkum they will also take the point of view that I have put forward in this amendment: this is the opportunity to send a signal to the work force, to those unions which are not particularly interested in the national welfare, that if for no good reason Australia Post is not able to maintain delivery of an essential service, the Government may have a remedy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I recall the former and not lamented Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, Mr Punch, talking about the moral right to post a letter. It is clearly an essential service. If for any reason postal services are interrupted for any significant period-I do not pretend that a day or two is significant-the Government, via the Minister, should be able to direct that the services Australians take for granted should continue to operate by allowing private contractors to be brought in. That is not an ideological position. It is simply ensuring that services to consumers are not interrupted. In other words, it is putting the national interest ahead of an ideological position.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Democrats have any comprehension of what is involved and what the experience overseas has been when there has been such a disruption to an essential service, they will recognise the merits of the argument. I have little doubt that they will not even pay lip service to the merits of this argument. They will simply go on doing what they have done to date, that is, to oppose blindly every amendment we have put forward in this area, pretending that somehow our agenda is all about privatisation and that therefore excuses them from looking at the merit of the argument, from looking at what is contained in the amendments, from looking at what is in the national interest. There is not one word about privatisation in any of these amendments or in our policy. If they bothered to find out what we are about, they would discover that we are interested in more competition, that, where there is a reserved service and a monopoly provided, there is a trade-off. We cannot have both an absence of competition and a monopoly service which allows us to impose higher prices irrespective.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no regulator equivalent to Austel. Australia Post is very much making an ambit claim in this legislation to expand its territory enormously, to get into a range of competitive areas while at the same time holding on to its monopoly. If that is to be abused by the unions and others on perhaps rare occasions there should be at least an opportunity for the Government to say, `Well, you do that at your peril because we put the consumer interest first and we are prepared to invite private contractors to take up the slack'. That is the litmus test. If honourable senators are serious about wanting to preserve a monopoly in the interests of the consumers rather than in the interests of blind ideological commitment, they will support this amendment.

         —The Government rejects the amendment because, once again, we find that an ideological point of view is being put to us by the Liberal Party. It is not surprising that the Liberal Party puts an ideological point of view on industrial relations. Its history of industrial relations management in this country has not been one of applying practical good sense to situations capable of being resolved. It has applied ideological solutions which exacerbate the problem, broaden the dispute and create greater inconvenience to the recipients of the service and greater cost to the Australian taxpayer.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The amendment that has been proposed would be capable of doing that. If the amendment were passed and if at some future time we had a conservative government, that government would be clothed with powers which would enable it to intervene over the board of Australia Post and interfere in the carriage of an industrial dispute by the Board of Australia Post, that Board being the responsible body which ought to be accountable to its employees for its actions. The Government would be able to intervene over the Board and impose a set of circumstances which in its view would be aimed at resolving the dispute, but which in practical effect and from a long history of experience, would simply exacerbate the dispute. It would impose a secondary dispute on top of the original dispute and make the primary matter much more difficult to resolve. We know that the Liberal Party has a blinkered, ideological perspective on this. We know that the Liberal Party is dogged and doctrinaire on this. We know that the Liberal Party, in essence, dislikes unions and would rather abolish them so that it could regulate its work force in some imaginary and illusory way.

        Let me refer to the track record of the Fraser Government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. If we were simply to carry this amendment, we would open ourselves to replicating that track record in the future. I remind the chamber that in the late 1970s and early 1980s we had strictures under the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act such as `no work as directed, no pay'. What occurred then, in the practical real life, flesh and blood terms-this is not theory or doctrine; it is not wish fulfilment by the Liberal Party-was that this legislation was applied to a dispute which started for the most innocuous of reasons, as disputes normally do. This exacerbated the issue and there was the threat of a nationwide stoppage in which all workers of Australia Post would have been involved. The disruption to the nation would have been huge and the dislocation to the industry would have been massive. But do we hear from the Liberal Party that it thinks that was a bad thing? No, we hear from the Liberal Party-and we hear it again today in respect of this amendment-that that action would have been justified in order to bring the dispute to heel.

        I put it to the chamber that if there is a dispute, the first and overwhelming priority of a government is to ensure that the machinery for dispute settlement is in place, that it works and that the cause of the dispute is the one thing that is brought before the authorities and settled as quickly as possible. If that is done, the dispute is settled and we do not need this disciplinarian, big stick approach-an approach which we know from experience exacerbates the matter. If carried, this amendment would be a licence for political cowboys to apply political solutions to industrial relations problems. We all know that when that occurs, industrial relations problems become more severe. That is the experience and I have pointed to a couple of examples.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a couple of other reasons why the Government opposes the amendment and why we regard it as being ill-advised. Assuming it were to be carried, which organisation-let us postulate-is capable of providing to the public the services that Australia Post provided before it was suspended? I do not know of any organisation that would come to the fore in those circumstances. But if there were one-let us continue the flight of fancy behind this amendment-what would be the costs to the Australian taxpayer? How do we balance these costs against the potential to continue the dispute, because it would be seen that the dispute had been promoted to a different level and involved a wider group of the community? If this amendment were to be carried, those questions would remain unanswered for the simple reason that there is no clear answer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not suggest for one minute that in any dispute there would not be someone who would want to offer his services. But where we have a contentious and controversial matter, where people's livelihoods are involved and where the delivery of services is important, the key and fundamental point is to cool the parties down, get them before the Industrial Relations Commission and proceed through that format to settlement. To do this would invite volunteer organisations to come forward and offer to do the service. If that were the case, we would be facing an immediate exacerbation of the dispute. If those volunteers wanted to be paid, and a government was silly enough to fall for it, we would be in a position when the dispute was finally settled, if it were, where the workers originally hired to do the job would return to work and find that their positions were already occupied.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be the intention of the Opposition to create that sort of disciplinarian situation; but it is not in the interests of the community to do that. It is not in the interests of smooth and efficient delivery of the service for that to occur and it is not in the practical interests of dispute settlement for these powers to be there. What is sensible, realistic and practicable is for the board that has the reponsibility, the Board of Australia Post, to be accountable for its actions in terms of its responsibility to its own work force, to take responsibility for industrial problems that occur, to front up to the relevant authorities, to argue its case there and to bring about settlement. If the Opposition wishes to use this Bill to embark upon an attempt to impose its view of industrial relations on this instrumentality, it will not be in the best interests of Australia. Therefore the Government opposes the proposed amendments.

         —Thank you, Mr Chairman. I do consider it an indulgence in the sense that, to begin with, Senator Alston accused the Australian Democrats of not responding at all or, in one instance, of not responding adequately with respect to amendments that were before the chamber last night. I am as cognisant as anybody of the fact that we are lagging behind in our legislation. More significantly, I do not stand here as a representative of a Party still dithering around with a previous package of Bills which is highly significant in this economy and with orders to string out this debate. Therefore I have been quite succinct in my comments and intend to continue to be.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, in relation to why the Australian Democrats made decisions on the amendment specifically before the Committee as well as previous amendments, I now want to explain the context in which we are discussing these amendments. To a degree, on this particular amendment, the Minister for Resources has already outlined some of that context. Clearly in the industrial relations area we too have deep concerns about the sorts of processes that the Opposition is attempting to set in train in the debate on corporatisation, government business enterprises and generally on privatisation. We do not have a lot of sympathy for the Government in the sense that this debate is before us and the Opposition constantly makes these moves. The Government, by moving similarly down the track just a few steps behind the Opposition, brings this upon itself, as I have often said and as I first said, I think, when the Opposition, having succeeded in deregulating the transport area with regard to wheat marketing, then attempted to deregulate the entire labour market and thus develop the same sort of dissension in the community and confrontation in industrial relations as this particular amendment before the Committee at the moment would do.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the context is a context of a new front bench member in a coalition which has clearly decided that it will push the Government as hard and fast as it can down the deregulation track towards privatisation while it awaits the possibility of actually attaining government itself. That is of major concern to the Australian Democrats in terms of these particular government business enterprises. While we look at each of these amendments individually, the context always has to be in our minds. With regard to the specific accusation of Senator Alston that something that we have done has disadvantaged Aboriginal communities or any other remote communities with regard to the Telecommunications Corporation Bill, we must bear in mind that Senator Alston claims that his amendment-which we did not support-would have broadened the definition of community service obligations. That would be within the context of an attempt to be made later by Senator Alston to a subsequent Bill to gut absolutely the corporation as it is being established by the Government. We are concerned enough about the way the Government is establishing it and we certainly would not want to take it further. Senator Alston's so-called broadened community service obligations would be within the context of an arrangement in which such obligations would now no longer be a part of the operations of the corporation paid for by cross-subsidy et cetera, but up-front as a budget item every year. Can honourable senators imagine-we certainly can-the fate of those remote Aboriginal communities under that sort of system?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Alston talks in other public fora about the luxury that we can no longer afford. He talks about our ideological position on preservation of monopoly. That is an inaccurate assumption. We are concerned to preserve the monopoly to the extent that it is in the interests of the community and to the extent that these community service organisations are able to fulfil what we see as their community service obligations. It is not the Democrats who have a fixed ideological position; we leave that to the Government and the coalition. For instance, in the wheat legislation the coalition mindlessly opposed the position of both the Democrats and the industry. On the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, 43 Democrat amendments, which would have brought commonsense and decency into the debate, were mindlessly opposed.

        —by leave-Because of the obvious concern that has been expressed by the Australian Democrats and, indeed, others whose concern would have been triggered by Senator Sanders's statement that an Army practice bombing exercise was in immediate prospect this morning and that lives of Aboriginal protesters were at risk because a number of them were presently occupying the Beecroft firing range, I immediately sought clarification from the office of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) as to the precise situation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I am now able to report to the Senate that, as I guess might reasonably have been expected had the matter been the subject of discussion before it came to the floor of the chamber this morning, the matter is well appreciated by the Defence authorities. They were aware last night that a number of Aboriginal demonstrators remained on the firing range. Their locations are generally known, or were known last night. It has been proposed that this morning-and I understand this is now happening-a full scale sweep of the area take place to identify and remove from the Commonwealth firing range the people concerned. I am assured by the office of the Minister for Defence that there is no question whatever of any bombing or other firing activity taking place on the range unless they are, I was told, 150 per cent certain that there is no person exposed to danger or on the range environs. It is an understandable concern that has been expressed. We acknowledge that concern. The matter had already been brought very much to the attention of the Government and Defence authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The action that has been taken is as I have described it. Accordingly, I believe there is no need for further concern on the part of the Democrats or anybody else, although, of course, the policy issues are acknowledged by us to be still ones of public debate. That is a debate for another occasion. The substance of the motion this morning, as I understand it, was the concern about immediate risk to life and the immediate prospect of physical injury. There is no concern on that account, whatever the continuing concerns on the larger public policy issue might be. I hope that short statement will set the issue at rest at least for the moment.

The board should be accountable for the management of its employees. If the employees are in dispute, the board should be accountable and should do all things right and proper within its ambit to bring that dispute to an early close. Regarding the question specifically asked by the honourable senator, it is within the power of the board to make contracts as it sees fit.

Let me say that the board, in the face of an industrial dispute, ought to do all things right and proper to bring that dispute to a rapid conclusion. I argue this point frequently. I recognise that the honourable senator has an ideological blinker to it and is thus unable to receive the message. The message is simply that if one has an industrial dispute one must deal with the problem that causes the dispute, not layer on top of that problem other problems which would exacerbate and broaden the dispute.

        Is is not the fact that these sorts of placebo conciliation and consensus approaches have abjectly failed and that what is needed by any party to negotiations is a good hand? It is no use not even having a pair of twos and the other side knowing it because one will get taken to the cleaners every time. If one has the ultimate essential services power, one does not have to use it but it becomes a fairly useful tactical negotiating weapon. Why should a government not have that power as a last resort? It may never intend that it be used. But at the end of the day, unless the Government has some ability to impose its will, unless it has some cards to play that will bring recalcitrant unions to heel, it will have to give in to the demands of those unionists-as the Minister is really conceding-no matter how unreasonable those demands might be. The Minister is an experienced industrial relations negotiator. Why does he not want to strengthen his own hand?

Indeed, we can wallpaper this chamber in rhetoric. But I am a practical person. I like to deal with real things and get real results and achieve some output.

        There were a number of points that Senator Alston made to which I can respond. The first was a gratuitous observation about the state of law and my actual knowledge of it. I do not propose to engage in a debate with Senator Alston about that because it was a fairly gratuitous observation on his part. I thank him for the observation but I already knew about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point was a series of premises which were mixed up with some marginal facts to try to make a case in the form of a set of questions. Once again Senator Alston seemed to ignore the fundamental principle, which ought to be a fundamental principle of industrial relations: when politicians get involved in industrial relations the possibility of settling disputes goes out the window because the parties then have some sort of interest in parading their case on the political stage. If one has an industrial dispute, it ought to follow that one isolates what the issue is and that the parties who are involved-in this case it is the board of Australia Post; and presumably whichever fictional unions might, for the sake of this exercise, be involved-should be isolated. The issue should be isolated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Alston then went on about conciliation and all this consensus stuff; they were his words. I do not know what he means by that. Senator Alston is a lawyer and he knows as well as I that we have a Conciliation and Arbitration Act which requires compulsory arbitration. Therefore, the only option is not the one Senator Alston proposed in his question about conciliation. It is an arbitral proceeding in which, after evidence and argument, a decision is made and imposed. Senator Alston knows that but he chose to ignore it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me now come to the final question: `Why don't I want the hand of the player involved in this to be strengthened?'. That question presumes that the hand of the player is not strengthened. We have a confusion here about who is the player. Senator Alston wants the Minister to be a player. He wants a government to be involved in industrial disputes. We want the Board of Australia Post, which is accountable, to be the player. We want the Board to manage its industrial relations and take responsibility for its outcomes. That is the appropriate way to go. Otherwise we will have the level of industrial disputation in this country that we had in the Fraser years. No one wants that situation to return. In terms of the perceptions of ordinary Australians, let me say that the last poll I saw showed that an overwhelming majority of Australians believed that we were much better at resolving industrial relations problems than the Opposition was when in government. That is a perception borne out by what the statistics show as well. While Senator Alston has an ideological position-I acknowledge that; he is bound to put it; he has done so; he has done his job on behalf of his Party-let us get on with the Bill.

         —As Senator Cook departs, I will address this question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). Senator Cook has been saying that the Government should not be a player in industrial relations; we are talking about a poker game and the Government should be the banker. Let us put the employer at the table and see what cards it has. Why should not the board of Australia Post be given explicit essential services powers so that it can go outside its own work force if there is a need when a protracted dispute arises and it seems incapable of early settlement? That solution has been used in the United Kingdom on occasions, certainly in the last century, and in this country in this century, and is an obviously sensible fall back position to be used as a last report. Why should not the Board of Australia Post be given those sorts of powers?

         —It is difficult to pick up the threads of a debate when I have just come into the chamber, but this is not an issue that is squarely given rise to by the terms of either the substantive clause before us or the amendment. No doubt the debate has taken a fascinating course over the last half hour or so. I will take on notice the matter that Senator Alston has raised and I will ensure that the Department and Australia Post have a look at it. It probably does raise some interesting public policy questions. We can have a look at it in the longer course, but this is not the time to be doing it right now.

         —I want to make sure that throughout the rest of what looks like being a protracted debate on a large number of amendments on this package of Bills that Senator Alston does not jump up again and talk about inadequate responses from the Australian Democrats simply because, as I have said earlier, we want to see the passage of this legislation. I will make it clear, in accordance with the discussion that has already taken place on this amendment, that the amendment is within the context of what we see as the direction of the Opposition in making these decisions. Clearly this amendment, with its industrial relations implications, is a very good example. I will clarify that context by using Senator Alston's own words from a speech which he made to the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration in October last year. At the end of his very long paper he concluded:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In essence, therefore, my case is:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) Australia Post and Telecom are very powerful and economic institutions which do not presently operate in the public interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that point alone, I certainly draw Senator Alston's and his Party's attention to the research which is currently being undertaken by Telecom which indicates that while the public has some views about matters that might be improved, the public certainly sees the importance of the community service role of at least Telecom. I have every confidence that in spite of a feeling that every institution can be improved-this one no less-the public does understand the value and importance of both those institutions, as do the Australian Democrats. That is why in the whole business of government business enterprises we do not want to see the deregulation approach that the Government is taking so far down the track that these institutions will be utterly vulnerable, whether it is by stirring up industrial relations disputes, or whatever mechanism, many of which underlie the amendments which Senator Alston is introducing and dragging us through one by one. That is a very firm basis for our stance. On the same occasion at the Institute of Public Administration, Senator Alston made the following point:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Government has a valid political obligation to ensure that genuine community service obligations are met, preferably at public expense.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a point which I made a little earlier in the discussion on this amendment. Senator Alston's view, as the Opposition front bench spokesperson on this matter, is that we should not operate community service obligations by cross subsidy, but that they should be costed. That point has been clearly made in the same paper and on many other occasions by Senator Alston. They should be up front budgetary items. So that is an extraordinary double standard. Cross-subsidisation is a common procedure within that form of business which Senator Alston and his Party utterly agree with-the great free enterprise system-and yet he wants to deny it to government business enterprises which do have significant community service obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will reiterate some of the remarks which I made yesterday: indeed, to undermine these enterprises, in a sense, is to bring down their value and to make them more vulnerable to future political pressures towards privatisation. This is something which the Democrats do not support, and we will not support amendments which move in that direction. We are disturbed by a lack of real distinction between what governments should and should not pay for. Senator Alston is saying that the public should pay directly for the community service obligations of government business enterprises. We have seen this Government cough up big money for some of those wonderful private enterprise sector organisations which are supported by the Opposition. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent during this Government's term of office to shore up the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the banks and the oil companies. In the case of government business enterprises, we believe that we do need to preserve a range of their monopolies in the community's interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will continue to support those aspects of legislation where we believe that this is happening so that they can cross subsidise and community services can be provided as community services and not as welfare services which, as social security spokesperson for this Party, I have seen constantly turned into political footballs not just on a yearly budgetary basis but on a six monthly budgetary basis with only the squeakiest wheel getting the oil. Madam Temporary Chairman, certainly you would understand that in those situations it is very hard for small groups of people, in particular isolated people, to be squeaky wheels. We can just imagine what would happen to the availability of services to people in remote areas, people with disability and people living in poverty. Clearly if the enterprises can conduct their operations and fulfil their community service obligations from within, so much the better. They do not then become political footballs on a twice yearly basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        We reject this amendment and in almost full measure the large bulk of the amendments that Senator Alston is moving. I really do not want to be accused of not giving a sufficient response simply because I do not take up as much of the airwaves as Senator Alston. I am not looking for a more senior front bench position in a prospective future government.

       <para>
        The amendment is that proposed new section 76 be deleted. We have run through this argument several times, so I will not go over the same ground. I simply ask why the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), whilst it retains monopoly status, should be immune from suit. For all the reasons that I advanced yesterday, it seems extraordinary that a very profitable operation should not be able to bear the costs which might be incurred by its customers as a result of the negligence of OTC. Whilst Senator Evans can hypothesise about what will happen if a multinational suffers multimillion dollar losses, one could say, I think with greater validity, that it is much more likely that it will be a multitude of smaller customers of OTC who will suffer. In terms of equity and justice, I would have thought that their interests should prevail. There is no good reason why OTC should retain its immunity from suit.

         —I am happy to repeat, for the record, the kinds of considerations which lead the Government to continue to seek immunity for all loss or damages relating to the transmission, delivery or reception of a telecommunication in the legislation. The provision is limited to the areas where OTC provides a reserve service and does not extend to any service which OTC provides in competition. That needs to be understood as a threshold. The Government has decided that OTC should continue to have some immunity from actions in relation to reserve services because to do otherwise could place OTC in a really difficult position. OTC does not have control end to end over communications to and from Australia which pass over the networks of other countries. The idea of immunity in international carriage is not novel. Article 21 of the International Telecommunications Convention of Nairobi in 1981, to which Australia is a party, provides, in terms:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Members accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services particularly as regards claims for damages.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this international environment, unless OTC is granted immunity it could be left to bear the full brunt of actions which for practical purposes, whatever the legal situation might be, in the absence of this legislative protection, it is not responsible. I should also point out that, as a public carrier in the delivery of reserve services, OTC has no control over who its customers will be and thus has no capacity to limit the risk. That is really the essence of it and I make that clear for the record once again.

       <para>
        This amendment provides for the insertion in the charter of Telecom Australia, by way of an expansion of the objects of the Act, a paragraph which would lead to a more pro-competitive outcome. It seems odd to us that the objects of the Act should include a whole range of matters, including ensuring the basic service, maximising efficiency, achieving the highest possible levels of accountancy, optimising rates of expansion and modernisation, enabling all sectors of the telecommunications industry to participate effectively and promoting the development of other sectors of the economy through low prices. But nowhere is there any commitment to competition. We see this as an indication that the Government's ideological slip is showing. It clearly regards competition as a dirty word.
       </para>
       <para>
        The forces that drive the Australian Labor Party are obviously much more interested in notions of efficiency because they can be achieved behind public sector walls. To talk in terms of competition frightens the troops because it means that competition can derive from outside the parapets. That is anathema to many sections of the Labor Party. Nonetheless, we do not regard competition as an ideological tool. It is simply good sound commonsense. It got a very grudging mention in the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). We see no reason why it should not be included in the objects of the Act.

         —The amendment is opposed by the Government. It ignores the proposed complementary relationship between Austel and the Trade Practices Commission. It is clear from the Government's May 1988 policy statement that the Trade Practices Commission has the primary role of promoting and maintaining effective competition in all industries. Austel will work with the Trade Practices Commission to promote fair and efficient market conduct in relation to the supply of competitive facilities and services. To this end, the Government will appoint two members of Austel as associate members of the Trade Practices Commission. It is also the case that the proposed amendment ignores the clear statements of policy intent elsewhere in the Bill, especially subparagraph (a) (ii) and paragraph (c) of clause 70.

       <para>
        Our second amendment involves the removal of the expression `subject to the regulations' in the definition of `basic telephone service'. We can understand why the Government should want to define the basic telephone service and provide for a monopoly on it. But to allow for regulations to undermine the notion of basic telephone service, or expand beyond recognition the definition of basic telephone service, defeats the whole purpose of such a definition. It seems extraordinary that `basic telephone service' cannot be simply defined. To say that it means `subject to the regulations, a public switched telephone service', is really a concession that the Government at some stage will want to introduce a backdoor definition by way of regulations that will dramatically expand the concept in a way, no doubt, that the Australian Democrats would fervently support and in the way that the Commission for the Future was toying with until it saw reason some time ago. It seems to us that there can be no justification at all for the inclusion of that phrase. I invite the Minister to explain why it is necessary.

         —It is necessary for the Government to have power to use the regulations here so as to respond quickly to any technological changes relevant to the basic policy of the Government-that is to say, a continuation of Telecom's role as sole provider of the first telephone for three years, with a review of that policy to be completed by 31 December 1990. I need not remind the Committee that any regulations must be consistent with the legislation, particularly with clause 35 (a) of the Bill which makes the Government's stated policy very clear.

         —Senator Alston is correct when he imagines that the Australian Democrats would support, where appropriate, an expansion of the interpretation of the term `basic telephone service'. I stress the words `where appropriate'. Clearly, the Opposition would like a restricted definition of `basic telephone service'. This clause gives comfort to the Democrats in that, if it becomes necessary, as the Minister has said, not just through technological change but particularly through change in the perception and needs of the community, then it is important that movement be possible. Obviously, this amendment is designed to restrict the definition. The Democrats would not want to do that. More importantly, it is clear that the public would not want to do that.

        I remind Senator Alston that there is already some evidence that the public is far ahead of the coalition in this area. There is constant movement in the public's perception of what is basic in telecommunications. That is occurring all the time as new technologies are diffused into the community. As legislators we need to take that into account. What is a standard service in 1989 may well be seen at a later date-perhaps not too late a date-as being substandard. Therefore, we do not support this amendment and find this part of the Bill a considerable comfort.

         —I find the statement made by Senator Powell, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, both enlightening and breathtakingly myopic. It seems to me that what both the Government and the Democrats are saying is that it is proper for the Government to bypass the Parliament in redefining the most basic concept in this Act. If we leave out `subject to regulations', the phrase `basic telephone service' is defined in such a manner that it would have survived over the last 80 years. There have been a number of improvements in switching techniques as a result of technological changes. But at no stage has there been any movement away from the notion that a public switched telephone service supplied by Telecom to a customer by means of a telephone handset that does not have switching functions is not appropriate as a basic item. I could well understand why the Government would want to stick to that definition. It is a definition that has stood the test of time. To allow it to be emasculated and transformed, if the Democrats have their way, simply in response to political pressures whenever some tinpot outfit thought it was a good idea to have some bigger and better free service provided by government in the run-up to an election campaign, is a total abdication of responsibility on the part of any government.

        If there comes a time when the community, through the proper processes, decides in the parliament that it is necessary to expand that definition of `basic telephone service', I would welcome the opportunity for that debate to take place. But to think that somehow by sleight of hand, by electoral pressure applied by people such as the Democrats, the Government can convert the definition in a way that might ultimately be unrecognisable is an affront to commonsense. It is a concession on the part of the Democrats that they are not interested in the proper political processes, that they see anything that might have a vote in it, anything that might allow them to give another free hand-out at some stage, as the proper way to go. We reject that absolutely.

         —Perhaps I should say for the record that, as sympathetic as I am to the general policy stance that has been articulated by Senator Powell on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I think possibly the Democrats are reading a bit more into this clause than the structure of the Act will bear. The expression `basic telephone service' appears in only one place in the Bill-that is, in clause 47, in the context of the exclusive right of Telecom, pending the review in 1991 to supply that basic service. The particular concern that the Government has is essentially with the technology involved-specifically, the technology of the handset which is the sort of thing which is capable of changing quite rapidly. It is something coming on to the market which might not satisfy, for some reason, the description in the definition of a telephone handset that does not have switching functions. We may have something which does need a little bit more careful regulatory description to make clear whether it comes within that definition. Essentially that is the reason why this definitional clause has been expressed as it has rather than that the Government wants the flexibility to address some of the larger policy questions that may arise. Having said all that, I do not resile in any way from the basic points that Senator Powell has been making about the thrust and the policy flavour of this legislation on which we see eye to eye.

After all, if we are to take the Government at face value, the first phone monopoly is to be reviewed. That is what the May statement said. I have no doubt that the unions will not allow that in due course. But on the face of it, that clause is a commitment to review. If that is the case, how can one possibly suggest that there could be a need in the next two years to change that basic definition when it could simply be done in the course of the review and, subsequently, in the course of amending that section. Does the Minister contemplate anything at the moment?

        This amendment will remove the definition of common interest. This is a matter that hopefully, will be, looked at by Austel in the not too distant future-that is if the Government's structural adjustment committee has not already had its way and gutted Austel by way of reducing its budget, on which basis advertisements have appeared in the daily press. If its staff is to be cut back in the way that reports suggest and its budget is reduced even further, unless there is some windfall profit that derives from the fees that will be imposed by other complementary legislation, Austel simply will not have the capacity to give proper attention to this matter which is a very significant one.

       <para>
        We take the view that private networks should be allowed to flourish. The reason that they are flourishing to date is that it is becoming increasingly attractive for large and small corporations to bypass the basic network because of the overpricing that exists on long distance routes. That is clearly consistent with the experience in other countries as I indicated yesterday in my speech at the second reading stage. The American experience since 1984 indicates that long distance rates have fallen by about 40 per cent. So clearly there are enormous incentives for each of Telecom's 200 largest corporate customers to install their own private networks, and they are doing it in droves. This common interest provision is a desperate measure to frustrate the pace of change, to introduce artificial concepts and barriers to what would otherwise be a very significant move in the direction of rationalisation that would allow private networks to share capacity, that would allow customers to ensure that they use every element of the transmission process. But under the common interest group provision, one has to go through a series of hurdles designed to demonstrate that somehow there is a community of interest between users. That is an anti-competitive device-nothing more nor less-which means that the Government's approach to private networks is neither fish nor fowl because on the one hand it allows them and on the other hand it is doing its best to restrain them. We see that as a very unnecessary and artificial approach to take. Can the Minister give an assurance that, irrespective of the outcome of Austel's funding, it will be able to undertake this review in the very near future and that it will then report in such a way that the results are made public?

         —The Government opposes the amendment. It would negate the announced policy position of the Government, that is that the common interest group policy of Telecom should continue at present but be the subject of review by Austel and report to government. Any review of the common interest group policy raises extremely complex issues. It is of vital importance to the carriers because of the implications for the viability of the reserve services and for the operators of private networks. There are important efficiency considerations, but a balance must be struck between what could be seen as competing policy interests. It is the clear intention of the Government to retain the policy role in setting this balance. Austel's review of the common interest group policy will provide ample opportunity for all sectors of the industry to put a view on how the policy shall operate in future. I am not in a position to spell out further than that how that review will be conducted at this stage but, obviously, it will be sensitive to the various currents of opinion that do exist on this subject. There will be ample opportunity to debate the review and its implications before anything arising from it is set in concrete.

        Amendment No. 3a would remove the power of the Minister to give directions in relation to the common interest group policy. Again, we see no reason at all why the Minister should be intruding into the area. If Austel conducts its policy review in the not too distant future and reports back to the Government and, hopefully, the public, there will be an opportunity for the public at large to judge the balance that should be struck between the competing interests which Senator Evans talked about. To allow the Minister to simply give directions would mean that the Minister could override Austel, make the common interest group policy even more restrictive than it is at present and, effectively, negate the whole notion of competition that currently exists between private networks and the basic network.

        In other words, clearly there is a contemplation that in the very near future the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support will tell Austel what to do. Is that simply a mechanism for ensuring that the inquiry goes ahead and, if so, why is it needed by way of legislation?

        Amendment No. 4 involves a mechanism that would expand the general functions and responsibilities of Austel to include, firstly, promoting the general objects of the Act and, secondly, promoting and maintaining effective competition. We regard this amendment as of fundamental importance. If Austel is merely in the business of administering and regulating then it becomes part and parcel of the bevy of players who constitute the Telecom Australia preservation society. I am sure that it does not want to do that. I am sure that Austel and its Chairman designate regard its legitimate role as promoting competition in the best interests of Australian consumers. They are not in the business of protecting anyone. Therefore, in our view it would be of considerable comfort and support to Austel to be told, firstly, that it is in the business of promoting the general objects of the Act, which is a very common provision as the Minister will well know and recognise; and, secondly, that Austel should be given a pro-competition charter. If it does not have that, it will clearly not be able to act in the best interests of consumers, it will simply be the lackey of the Government or, worse still, simply looking after the interests of Telecom.

       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment No. 5 is a machinery provision. Amendment No. 6 would add a new paragraph to ensure that the functions of Austel include `regulating the manner in which information relating to customer use of reserved services is controlled'. This is a very important amendment because it ensures a level playing field to stop Telecom misusing information it might derive from its reserved services or using it to unfair advantage in the competitive services area. The Australian Democrats for a change should face up to whether they believe that a monopoly is a licence to exploit or whether a monopoly is to be conducted on certain terms which are fair to all. If it is the latter then a monopoly should involve certain obligations, one of which is not to misuse information or to take advantage of it to advance its own competitive service areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, the function of Austel should be to ensure that there is a real Chinese wall in place, that there is no economic cross-subsidy, that the arrangements are transparent and that Telecom is not able to take unfair advantage. The Democrats are not interested at all in the notion because, I suppose, it is over their heads. If the Democrats know anything about cross-subsidisation, they will know there is a distinction to be drawn between social and economic cross-subsidisation. Economic cross-subsidisation is frowned upon by the Trade Practices Commission and anyone else who is interested in competition. It is about ensuring that others do not misuse their monopoly position. That is what this amendment is squarely about. It will be interesting to see whether the Democrats understand that.

         —The proposed amendments are unnecessary. They ignore the specific provision in clause 68 (2) (c) and the extremely broad powers provided in clause 68 as a whole. Austel has sufficient powers to require all relevant information on reserved services to be published and to regulate the terms and conditions under which information will be provided to participants in the market. Clause 20, particularly when it is read in conjunction with clause 68 (2) (c), is broad enough to provide the necessary guidance to Austel, in the Government's judgment. We oppose the amendments accordingly.

        (7) Page 10, subclause 29 (3), line 12, leave out the subclause, insert the following subclause:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(3) Notice of a direction under subsection (1) shall be published in the Gazette within 21 days after the direction is given.''.

        (8) Page 10, after subclause 29 (3), add the following new subclause:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(4) The Minister shall cause a copy of a direction under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 10 sitting days of that House after the direction is given.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 29 currently provides that a direction given by the Minister to Austel shall be published in the Gazette. A direction to Austel is a very significant document, one that we believe should be given maximum public exposure. For it simply to be published in the Gazette would mean that it would become the province of those who spend their lives reading Government gazettes, but of very few others. It may be the Government's intention to ensure that the matter did not come to the attention of the media and others until some time later. We regard that as undesirable. Notice of a direction should be published in the Gazette within 21 days after the direction is given and the direction itself should be tabled in the Parliament. In that way, the Parliament will have an opportunity to debate the merits of the direction. Presumably it will then be able to ascertain from the Minister what created the need for that direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the clause is presently worded, it can only give rise to the suspicion that the Government and its advisers are anxious to avoid the glare of the parliamentary process by having something get only a one line mention. I should retract that, because subclause (3) requires the direction itself to be published. I presume we can take that at face value and that there would not simply be mention of the direction, but publication of its contents. It seems undesirable that it should be confined to the archives in that way.
       </para>
       <para>
        We urge the Government to reconsider the matter. Presumably it is interested in public debate. I would have thought the Australian Democrats would also have been interested in public debate. Unless the Democrats are prepared to give the Minister carte blanche, they would also be interested in having this matter put squarely into the parliamentary and public arena and not tucked away.

         —It ought to be appreciated that the really significant policy directions relating to things like value added services and customer premise equipment and so on are subject to parliamentary disallowance procedures. The directions we are talking about here are of a lesser order of significance altogether. As the clause says, they are essentially matters relating to the performance of Austel's functions and the manner of the exercise of its powers rather than the substantive decisions themselves. They might cover, for example, such matters as an equal employment opportunity policy or an industrial democracy policy to be applied by Austel in its internal administration. One would have thought that the particular mechanism that is here proposed for ensuring that those sorts of directions get into the public domain is perfectly adequate for the purpose. It is a time- honoured provision elsewhere around the system to require gazettal. That triggers public attention for those interested in these matters.

       <para>
        Parliamentary procedures are such that it is possible to pick up and bring to public attention in the Parliament anything that offends anybody in this respect, but the nature of these provisions are such that those kinds of offences are not likely to occur. We can understand the concern for parliamentary exposure and debate for the big policy issues, but this is stretching too long a bow.

         —Perhaps students of the arcane and the abstruse might be comforted by that, but I do not read subclause 29 (1) as confining the Minister's directions to equal employment opportunity policies and the like, although I have heard it said on a number of occasions. Certainly that has been the basis of discussions in the course of the draft Bill considerations. Nonetheless, on its face, that would allow some fairly wide-ranging directions to be given to Austel. We can all assume that the directions will be given on non-controversial matters, but they could equally be given on highly controversial matters. It all depends on the length of the chancellor's foot.

       <para>
        If the Minister takes the view that the exercise of Austel's powers requires it to conduct only one public hearing a year, what does it do-cellular mobile television services or common interest group? I would have thought that the provision is open to a very broad interpretation. If that is the case, one should not distinguish it from the other explicit policy directions that might be given. No good reason has been advanced for why it should not be tabled in the Parliament. We are not saying it should be a disallowable instrument, but simply that the Parliament should be in a position to know as soon as possible what is going on.

It cannot be claimed that publication in the Gazette of the Minister's directions in relation to the functions of Austel and the exercise of its powers is, as Senator Alston said earlier, burying it away from public gaze, or whatever term he used. The Gazette is the proper place for publication of such directions.

        These amendments would delete clause 33 (1) (d). Clause 33 relates to a policy statement of the Government and defines in various ways the areas of responsibility and the areas of protected services. Subclause (1) (d) provides:
       </para>
       <para>
        that the shared use and resale of simple carriage of communications over private telecommunications networks should continue to be restricted to prevent undue diversion of communications from public telecommunications networks.
       </para>
       <para>
        This provision goes to the heart of competition in the area. Private networks have grown up in response to the overpricing on the long distance routes. Australian consumers currently pay 20 to 30 per cent more than they need to. In the United States, for example, the figure is probably closer to 40 per cent. That is certainly the size of the reductions that have been achieved in recent years. Those reductions do not flow through in this country because Telecom Australia not only has a monopoly over the shared use and resale of the simple carriage of telecommunications traffic but also has the benefit of very restrictive provisions that provide for a common interest group policy in relation to the use of private networks. This clause would delete that prohibition on the resale of shared capacity in the same way that the Swedish and British governments are presently doing. Senator Gareth Evans will know from the Office of Telecommunications bulletins, that I have no doubt he continues to receive, that Oftel is considering this matter very carefully and is in the process of implementing its own recommendations because, after all, it is a toothed tiger and it believes that the most effective way of introducing competition into the system, of making the most efficient use of telecommunications capacity, is to allow for the resale of shared capacity. Until such time as we do that in this country, we will have surplus capacity going to waste because of these artificial and restrictive barriers that are put in place as a result of government policy decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments would simply free up the system and allow the most rational use of the telecommunications network. It would allow the use of shared facilities and it would therefore help to drive down those subscriber trunk dialling call charges more towards cost and, in that way, contribute very beneficially to the efficiency of the network. Unless and until that happens, we simply have to say that Telecom will remain a tiger in a cage, not of its own choosing but because those in the Government are too scared to let it out into the jungle where it would thrive, and are therefore not interested in achieving the optimum pricing structures for consumers. We move the amendments in the hope that the Parliament will make it clear that, at least in the way that this Bill is framed, Telecom's monopoly services should be kept to a minimum, the opportunities for competition should be maximised and the most efficient use of the network will result.

         —These amendments are totally unacceptable to the Government. The Opposition seeks here to remove from the Bill quite a basic tenet of the Government's policy decisions, that the shared use and resale of capacity over private networks should continue to be restricted. To allow unrestricted shared use or resale would permit the operation of competing common carriers in the Australian telecommunications industry and require a massive upheaval in Telecom's tariffs for leased lines, not to mention the damage that would be done to Telecom's ability to fund its community service obligations through the cross-subsidy. These are all familiar propositions that have been the subject of long debate. I think it would be tedious repetition for me to track through them again. These amendments raise the issues squarely, and they are unacceptable.

I am not going to get into an extended technical discussion of how that would be expected to operate in an environment where the prohibition did not exist. The policy issue is perfectly clear. It was spelt out in the May statement and the extended documentation accompanying that. I have nothing further to add. It would only prolong the debate unmercifully and not change the Government's policy position, as Senator Alston well knows.

         —We are addressing the Bill as a whole. Before we move on to Senator Alston's next amendments, I would like to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade a question with regard to clause 21, which has passed us slightly, on the issue of the price cap mechanism. If it is appropriate, I would like to do that now. In my speech in the second reading debate I expressed concern that the Government has decided to operate from a single basket. That is, of course, in contrast to the May 1988 statement by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, in which he said:

        There will be separate price control formulas for residential and business customers. The residential formula will limit both the increase in the average price of all standard services and the change in price of standard access charges.

       <para>
        Last week we had a statement from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) on price capping. In my speech in the second reading debate I expressed concern that the process which has been decided upon might not be the most appropriate. I think it is worth commenting that it might have been more appropriate to defer the question of the number and composition of the baskets until Austel had been formally established and, with any luck, a consultative process was able to be developed so that we are certain that the decision has been made appropriately. However, that decision has been made. Having looked at the Minister's statement and been somewhat dissatisfied, I wonder whether the former Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, can justify that decision a little more.

         —I addressed Senator Powell in relation to that problem in my reply in the second reading debate yesterday. I do not know whether Senator Powell was in the chamber at the time or has had an opportunity to look at what I said. I can only repeat now, in answer to her question, what I said then. For reasons of administrative practicality, the Government decided to combine the standard services for both sectors-business and residential-into a single basket subject to a common consumer price index-X control, as announced in the ministerial statement on 1 June.

       <para>
        My own ministerial statement back in 1988 foreshadowed that there would be separate formulas for the two sectors because, at that time, it was believed that that was the best way to limit the permissible change in the residential rental charge. However, we now believe that this objective is better implemented by placing within the one price cap formula a specific limit on permissible increases in the residential rental charge. I said a few other things in and around that subject but that is the essence of my response on that. We believe it addresses the policy concerns that Senator Powell has expressed on this issue. It is a matter of first thoughts not necessarily being best thoughts as one works one's way through the difficult administrative implementation phase of the package.

         —In relation to that matter, I heard the explanation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last night and I was not impressed. Apart from some assertions about having decided that it was administratively more convenient to combine the two sectors, I heard no justification for the change. I invite the Minister to make public any advice that he has received from the Department of Transport and Communications or elsewhere that would indicate where the task force went wrong in the considered judgment it made about the desirability of separate price caps and also to spell out what the consequences would be of a combined price cap. The way things are at the moment, given that the government business enterprise (GBE) statement did not even advert to the fact that the Minister had ignored his own advice, one is left with the suspicion that this is intended to muddy the waters to enable, within that single basket, changes to take place that will not be detectable and will allow for a considerable rebalancing without identifying whether it comes primarily from the residential or business component.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would have thought that the policy reason that drove the task force to make the recommendation it did was that it thought it highly desirable to have transparency between those two components so that residential consumers were able to assess whether their local call rates had gone up by any, and what, amount and the extent to which their local call rates might come down accordingly. Business presumably spends a lot more on long distance calls, proportionately and absolutely, than do residential consumers. I would have thought that the two were discrete groups deserving separate treatment. If the Minister is not prepared to make available any policy argumentation, one is forced to conclude that this is a deliberate blurring of the concept.

         —I want to make it clear that, while it appears that Senator Alston and I might be expressing the same concern, as usual, it is for opposite reasons. Our concern about the single basket relates to a quite different range of issues. For instance, we would say that perhaps it is appropriate in the circumstances to charge different prices for different goods demanded by different groups of consumers. Business places higher peak demands on the telephone system and the infrastructure, the basic network, must be available to meet those peak demands. Charging in a way which takes account of a telephone system with a large peak capacity can be justified. We can also justify in a number of ways keeping the price to members of the general public below the actual cost of providing that service. One justification is that each individual subscriber coming into the network brings a benefit, not just in terms of the calls that he makes but also in terms of the calls which he receives, which increases the use of the network and, therefore, its efficiency. As the percentage of the population with a phone increases, so does the value of having a phone.

        Senator Alston has talked about a muddying of the waters.

         —I make it clear that what Senator Powell is adverting to is what I think is now a discredited notion of social externalities that somehow suggests that when one has 94 per cent household penetration rates, as we do in this country, there is a measurable benefit that flows to existing subscribers. It is simply nonsense. Where one has a very low level of penetration, as there is in many Third World countries, quite obviously if one is able to install telephones in remote areas one can suddenly transform the accessibility of the service.

        That is not the case in Australia. There are something like 650,000 new connections each year. The rate of household formation is almost entirely in the city and metropolitan areas. The idea that, somehow, this has got anything to do with price caps I find quite extraordinary. So our concerns are simply that it is necessary to be able to understand the differential treatment that will be applied within that single price cap. Let there be no misunderstanding: I am sure that the Government is not for a moment suggesting that it will treat those two separate classes of consumers equally; it will not. Whilst the Minister ruled out timed local calls the other day, he certainly made it clear that he expected to see some rebalancing take place. If that is the case, we want to know whether that rebalancing is equally affecting those two separate consumer groups.

        Amendment 11 seeks to delete clause 35 (a), which again relates to a policy declaration and, in particular, that Telecom should continue as the sole supplier of the first phone until at least 30 June 1991. This is one of the great scandal areas. The task force itself was well aware of the cost to consumers of the first phone monopoly. It has been estimated to be of the order of $250m a year by way of loss of revenue. This derives from the fact that there is considerable overstaffing and overmanning in a whole range of areas, particularly in rural and remote areas but also within the customer access network.

        Anyone who has the misfortune to need a telephone connection will know that it is extraordinarily difficult to obtain it as soon as one would want it. The technicians always have an excuse for not being able to install the service straight away. I even had a personal experience of my own several weeks ago where a fault occurred in the local exchange. Because Telecom did not have me recorded as a member of parliament and, therefore, some sort of higher being, I was merely classified as low level domestic. I am not objecting for one moment, but I rang up as an ordinary consumer and was fobbed off. I was told, `We will report the fault and it is to be hoped that it will be rectified this weekend'.

         —Indeed, and it would have been critical if it had been two weekends later when my preselection came up. I could have blamed Telecom if I had lost my opportunity to continue to annoy Senator Evans on this matter. The fact remains that Telecom has this archaic policy which is designed to cater for technicians who do not want to work at weekends, of if they do they want to be paid triple time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Unless one is put on the VIP list, one does not rate. It seems that if one rings up and says that one is a member of parliament, one is put on the special list. But Telecom does not even have the nous to go and check who should be on that list. It does not put all doctors or all members of parliament on the list as a matter of course. It waits until they complain and, in effect, pull rank. If one rings up and says, `I am Mrs So-and-so and my phone is out of order', it says, `Too bad, see you on Monday'. If one says, `My name is Mrs Jones and I am a doctor', it says, `Well, your phone still won't be fixed until Monday, but next time around you will get instant treatment because now we know that you are a doctor and that you are complaining, we will put you on the special list'. That is an outrage. There is no reason at all why an outfit making a net operating profit in excess of $1 billion should not be able to fix our phones when we want them fixed.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is systematic of the problem with the first phone monopoly, which comes about because the technicians want to have exclusive rights to install, supply and maintain the first phone when there are obviously many technicians, either ex-Telecom employees or others, who are eminently well qualified to do the job, who would do it, presumably, much cheaper because they would be providing a competitive service, who would be prepared to work at weekends and after hours and who would meet the needs of the customer. That is what this is all about. The task force itself was highly embarrassed to be forced to come up with this compromise proposal that Telecom should continue to be the first phone monopolist until at least 30 June 1991. It at least had the decency to suggest that the matter be reviewed. But there is absolutely no reason why we should presume that the unions would allow any review to have a positive outcome. So what we are looking at is probably a fairly successful stalling operation which will result in Telecom maintaining the first phone monopoly in perpetuity or, should I say, until the next election, which is a very different time concept.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment No. 11 seeks to delete Telecom's first phone monopoly immediately. There is no need for a phasing out period. This would result in benefits to Telecom itself. Telecom would not have to carry all the technicians and others who are employed to maintain the monopoly in place. It has been suggested that this might even result in a reduction in staffing of the order of 10,000 people. None of those people would be out of work. A lot more work would be readily available to them. Such a move would also save Telecom heaps, probably something in excess of the $250m in welfare costs that have been estimated by the Australian Institute for Public Policy and others. In this context, I regard such a situation as a national scandal. It causes massive efficiency losses, it is indefensible in terms of policy commitment to efficiency and, therefore, it should be removed immediately. It does nothing to preserve the monopoly. It does nothing to provide an increased capacity to deliver the cross-subsidies for the whole range of deserving beneficiaries who presently receive it. It is simply a burden on the system, it is an imposition on Telecom and it is supported by this Government.

         —The Opposition proposes in amendment No. 11 and in amendment No. 20 to refuse to continue the first telephone monopoly of Telecom, as Senator Alston has indicated. It was a clear decision of Government that Telecom should continue to have the sole right to supply the first telephone, at least until 30 June 1991, so as to ensure that the industry development arrangements (IDAs) applying to first telephones could be implemented. Opening first telephone supply to competition, in our judgment, would mean that it would be impossible to make the industry development arrangements work and it would threaten the massive investment of the Australian manufacturers in plant and equipment associated with the new touchphone 200. The industry development arrangements and the continuation of the first phone monopoly are designed to give the local industry time to adjust from a regime of high protection to one more appropriately based on full participation in the international marketplace.

        The Opposition's approach threatens the future of the industry in this respect. We oppose it for that reason. There is much that one can say backwards and forwards about the merits, looked at separately and independently, of the first telephone question. There may, indeed, be some aspects of Senator Alston's concerns with which I would not strongly disagree. But this particular clause must be looked at and these matters must be looked at in the context of the IDAs to which I have referred. In that context, there is no question but that these two amendments must be opposed.

But the interesting thing is this: if Senator Evans raises the IDA arrangements which involve a five-year phase-out, is he really saying-which is what Senator Lewis has properly raised-that `at least' will mean at least five years and not just the two years that the clause purports to limit it to?

We understand the importance of the first phone monopoly to Telecom and in particular to the industry here in Australia. The Minister made a very brief reference. It is of concern to us that in this whole debate Telecom's local purchasing policy seems very much to have dropped off the agenda. Given our balance of payments problems, I would have thought that that would be an issue to which we ought to have been addressing ourselves more directly in this whole debate.

It may well be that he, as in the case of many other witnesses, chose not to have to undertake the regime which is applied to the protection offered by the Australian Federal Police on behalf of the National Crime Authority.

         —I have seen reports attributed to Mr Martin Tenni, the Queensland Minister for Mines, Energy and Northern Development. He blames the Federal Government for a reduction in exploration for gold in Australia. I must say I find that quite an extraordinary allegation coming from him because he presides over a tax on gold which is a pernicious tax in its own right. It is a tax either on the production or, if the profit level is high enough, on profit. It is a State royalty tax which, if he is concerned about taxes as a deterrent to exploration, he has it within his power to remove entirely and provide a stimulus for exploration. Of course, he has not done that. One must view the allegations he makes from the point that they are hollow if he does not propose to put his actions where his mouth is.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The truth of the matter of gold exploration is that we intend to make the activity of gold mining subject to normal company tax which all other industries in Australia are required to meet. To describe it therefore as a gold tax is taking a liberty with the English language because it is a tax on companies; it is a tax on gold mining. The royalty that I referred to a moment ago that applies in Queensland is in fact a gold tax. It is not the one that we are applying. The figures for exploration according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics are that exploration for gold mining was down in 1988 not by the 50 per cent that Mr Tenni referred to but by 18 per cent. By contrast I note that gold production is 45 per cent higher in the March quarter this year than it was in the previous March quarter. Gold is now among our top four export earners. It earned Australia $2.4 billion in 1987-88.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major reasons for the variation in exploration is that the world price of gold has fallen quite dramatically over recent months. The price has been falling in that sense since 1980. In January 1980 the price of gold hit $US850 an ounce. In January 1988 it was down to $US480 an ounce. Earlier this year the figure descended to between $US375 and $US400 an ounce. That reflects a decline in the value of gold on the world exchanges. That is the reason why there has not been a positive incentive for exploration. It is not the introduction of a tax on the companies that mine gold that this Government would wish to introduce. I would have thought that Martin Tenni would have understood the situation in terms of pricing.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, the Government decided in the May economic statement in 1988 that the exemption would end because there is no economic or other justification for it. It was a unique instance of a blanket exemption for an entire industry and for its entire income. Senator Walsh has often made the point that a significant proportion of overseas ownerships figures in gold mining ownership in Australia. The result is therefore that the exemption from taxation that these companies enjoy in Australia is transferred to overseas dividends. These dividends are taxed by foreign governments and thus they get the advantage that the Australian government should get.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, the Queensland Government imposes its own tax on gold. If the Queensland Minister is concerned he should do something about that. I might say about the Queensland tax on gold in the post-Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct situation in Queensland where Premier Ahern is saying that all things are now open, all things are now transparent, that Queensland still remains the State in Australia that does not reveal how much it earns from gold taxation. I have estimated it through my Department at about $5m a year in royalties. But there is nothing on the public record which discloses openly and in a way in which the community can check what in fact the Queensland Government earns in gold mining income. If it is an open and accountable government one would have thought that at least it would have done that.

Does this comment by Mr Hawke represent an honest and very public about-face on the promise of falling interest rates which Mr Hawke gave prior to the Western Australian election? Is the Minister prepared to give the many thousands of Australian home owners struggling under these interest rates some idea of just how long `for a while' might be? I note that the Prime Minister has also revealed that if he were in the same position as those having to run a family home under these record interest levels he would be hurt, angry and looking to take it out on the Government. Does this comment by Mr Hawke indicate the Government's support for the increasing number of protests against it which are occurring around Australia over the interest rates issue? In particular, does the Government support some of the proposals being adopted by those meetings such as an interest rate cap?

         —I make it clear for the record that I am hearing the question for the first time. I did not draft it. I wish to God I could draft some of Senator Schacht's questions! I am able to respond briefly on the subject of the Polish elections because they are a matter of major international interest. The outcome of those elections, the first round of which took place on 4 June, involves the first in postwar Poland in which genuine alternative candidates to the Communist Party's nominees have been allowed to stand in some 35 per cent of lower House constituencies and for the newly created Senate. The initial reports suggest that in the context of those elections Solidarity has gained a majority of votes in the constituencies it has contested and that many of the party officials holding senior government posts may not be elected. It is, in fact, a pretty stunning result as has been widely acknowledged in the media reports this morning.

       <para>
        Electorates in which no candidates gain a clear majority in the lower House will go to the polls again for a run-off between the most successful candidates on 18 June. Of course the Australian Government welcomes those elections in which the Polish people have had some real choice for the first time and of course we would be seriously concerned if the process of introducing political pluralism into Poland were to be retarded in any way. There has been some speculation about that. I think it is premature to go further than to acknowledge the existence of that speculation. If there were to be action of the kind that has been feared in some quarters that would obviously involve a fundamental human rights question once again in respect of which it is entirely appropriate that other governments around the world express their views. Obviously, the internal situation in Poland has a larger significance as well for the stability of the Eastern bloc as a whole; and indeed, as a result, for the whole of Europe.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I find it quite extraordinary that Senator Chaney should have intervened in the way he did to suggest that there was something inappropriate about this question being asked. I am sure that Polish community members here will take very closely into account that reaction that has come from the Leader of the Opposition as demonstrating a grotesque insensitivity on his part.

I refer to the current situation in China and ask the Minister whether the Government has any contingency plans to deal with a significant rise in requests for political refugee status from the thousands of secondary and tertiary students from China currently studying in Australia and from the thousands of Chinese students who, while not formally enrolled in any institution, are undertaking studies at the request of the Chinese Government or party organisations. Upon what basis will the Government decide as to the refugee status between one student and another, given the indiscriminate killing currently under way in China? Have any applications currently been received with regard to political refugee status from any students studying in Australia?

         —My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has already expressed to the Chinese Ambassador the Government's deep concern at the response of the People's Republic of China (PRC) Government to political demonstrations by PRC citizens. The Government is closely monitoring the situation in the People's Republic of China as it evolves and the implications for PRC nationals now in Australia. The Government has decided to extend the temporary entry permits of PRC nationals legally in Australia as at 4 June. Applications should be made at any Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs office around Australia. Temporary entry permits will be extended until the end of July within the same category as the applicant currently holds, such as student visa or visitor visa. This will allow a breathing space while the situation in the People's Republic of China becomes clearer.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is still too early to talk definitely about refugee status in Australia. I must stress again that events in the PRC are still unfolding and accordingly the Government is not in a position to give its final response to the serious situation there. The Government will consider the need for any further policy response in the light of the situation as it evolves. There are a number of visas which have been issued to persons who have not yet arrived in Australia. At this stage we intend to honour all valid visas. The current situation in Beijing means that immigration activity in the Embassy will be spasmodic. It is my intention that these activities will return to normal as soon as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Applicants will be treated like any other applicant for refugee status. Applications will not be determined on the basis of a class of people, but on individual merits. They will be considered on the basis of individual claims. It has not been brought to my attention yet that anyone has applied for refugee status, although in some cases I would not think that that would be long in coming. It is estimated that some 15,000 people from the People's Republic of China are in Australia. Of those, 4,000 are visitors, 476 are on temporary permits, 10,600 are on student visas and there are 300 others, totalling about 15,405. If there were a substantial application rate we would need contingency plans to deal with them. The current system for processing onshore refugee claims, which amount to between 500 and 700 a year, would obviously have to be revamped.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suggest that it is still a little early to say what the situation is, but we will meet our international obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocols. We have no intention of not meeting them. I cannot predict what will happen in China; there may even be a change of government. I have no idea what the situation will be down the track.

         —Mr President, I certainly do not mind Senator Chaney looking at it. The question seeks facts and I have some facts available about the changes in the balance of foreign and domestic equity investment. The table shows that the Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) Society increased its domestic equities from 25 to 28 per cent and its foreign equities declined from 17 to 13 per cent. Australian Eagle's domestic equities increased from 33 to 41 per cent and its foreign equities declined from 15 to 10 per cent. Hambros' domestic equities increased from 23 to 31 per cent and its foreign equities declined from 14 to 11 per cent. BT Australia Management, which is a significant name in the context of something that happened yesterday-not in the House I hasten to add-increased its portfolio exposure of domestic equities from 26 to 37 per cent and decreased its foreign equities from 26 to 13 per cent over the shorter period from December 1987 to June 1988.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Only a very few funds did not increase their holdings of domestic equities relative to foreign equities over that period. One which did not increase its holding of domestic equities over foreign was Baring International, which held no domestic equities in either period. I understand that that firm is or was advised by Dr Hewson. Another one which decreased its holdings of domestic equities in that period was Elders. It decreased its domestic equities from 16 per cent of its total portfolio to 13 per cent.

        The figures flatly refute a tatty little table prepared by some management consultant and eagerly hawked around the Press Gallery yesterday afternoon by Mr Connolly. I also table, as it has some relevance to this issue, a letter I received today from Rothschild Australia. It says on the bottom of the letter that copies have been distributed to Mr Connolly, Senator Bishop and Senator Haines. I also have an article from the Australian Super Review of January 1989 on the mix of equities. The article gives the views of some 27 fund managers. I will quote just a few. The AMP referred to `Not selling out of shares after the ``crash'' and holding a high proportion of quality shares paying franked dividends'; Armstrong Jones spoke of a `Slight reduction in exposure to equities; increased emphasis on quality of equities and imputation shares'; and Barclays spoke of `Reduced exposure to overseas equities; increased liquidity arising mainly through reduction in fixed interest investments'. As I mentioned before, Baring International does not have any domestic equities. BT Australia Management stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from changes to investment decisions due to changes in the overall economic environment, clearly the most important exogenous impact on investment decisions was the May Statement. The result of this was not to change our overall investment style. It has clearly made Australian stocks paying high franked dividends more attractive to superannuation funds.

        I recommend that article to both Mr Connolly and Senator Bishop for their study and edification.

         —Again, I am amazed that Senator Puplick has not taken a point of order on a question which is unequivocally and directly related to Bills which are on the Notice Paper and might well be debated later in the day. I presume the reason Senator Puplick has not taken a point of order is that he is frightened that Senator Bishop will bump him down to No. 4 on the Senate ticket instead of No. 3 if he stands up to her. However, I will not try to have the question ruled out of order on the grounds that it very clearly is out of order.

        Senator Bishop might be able to find a handful of people who have been disadvantaged; I do not know. But what she ought to concentrate on is the damage which her stupid, ill-considered amendments will do to superannuation policy, investment in the Australian economy, employment creation, growth and everything else. That is what she ought to consider-the big picture. Having consulted the Hansard of last Thursday, I am now in a position to tell the Senate that Senator Bishop misinformed it again yesterday. She asserted that I did not point out the restricted ambit of her amendments until after 10 o'clock on Thursday night. I in fact pointed it out at 9.30, before she moved her stupid amendments. In her no doubt written speech, which she had been programmed to deliver, she said among other things:

       <para>
        We did not support the Democrats' amendments because they did not go far enough . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, the Democrats' amendments, in terms of the ambit of coverage, went further than hers did. I pointed that out as well. One of Senator Bishop's problems is that she comes in here programmed to give some silly, inaccurate speech in support of incompetent amendments and does not even listen to what was said earlier, which reveals quite clearly-even Connolly has now been forced to acknowledge this-that her amendments are defective in the sense of the ambit of their coverage. They are also highly defective in a policy sense.

I do not know whether Senator Bishop can find a handful of people who, on a superficial examination, might have been adversely affected. However, I might add that one of the pluses of the present high interest rates regime is that the people who have investments or some holding in funds which are overwhelmingly concentrated on interest bearing securities will have reaped quite substantial windfall gains over the last six months or so. I am not saying that therefore it is a good thing that, for a variety of reasons, the Government has had to have a tight monetary policy which has pushed up interest rates. Nevertheless, it is a fact that people who are associated with those sorts of funds would have reaped very substantial windfall gains from the recent high interest rates. I do not know whether Senator Bishop can produce a handful of people who, superficially, may have been disadvantaged by that, but I recommend that she look at the bigger picture and at what her amendments will do. They will encourage Australian superannuation funds to invest in foreign businesses instead of Australian businesses. They will encourage them to invest in the central business district--

         —In the earlier part of Senator Crowley's question she compared what individuals contribute to environmental difficulties with that contributed by industry. While it is true that in the big picture industry is contributing a great deal, it is not really appropriate to minimise the contribution that individuals can make in terms of repairing damage to our environment, in particular when one looks at water quality. The experience in the United States has shown-the best example is the city of Los Angeles, which has some of the worst environmental problems in the world, particularly with air and water pollution-that programs designed to encourage householders to take more care and concern with the environment can have extraordinary effects. The city of Los Angeles is even now phasing out the use of backyard appliances that use petrol. It has a program that is much wider than anything that has ever been envisaged in Australia.

        The poster which the Government, in conjunction with the Australian Conservation Foundation, has sent out around Australia to mark World Environment Day contains 20 ways in which ordinary householders can assist with these problems. They include such simple things as turning off taps while cleaning one's teeth and using fluorescent lights rather than electric lights because they obviously use less energy. There are a whole number of programs which can be used by ordinary householders.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one comes to industry, obviously it becomes more difficult. The three main ways in which the Commonwealth gets entry into the environmental field at present have been through the external affairs power, via World Heritage, through export controls, which we have over a number of issues important for the environment, such as sand mining, where we are always getting into some arguments, and through advice over foreign investment about which we have had one argument in very recent times. There are very few ways in which the Commonwealth can get into the act. In recent times it has been suggested that we ought to use the corporations power to do that. We have received opinions a number of times which suggest that there are ways of frustrating the corporations power, which makes its use by the Commonwealth somewhat difficult. Nonetheless, I will seek yet another opinion, given the current interest in that issue, to see whether it might be possible. In the event that it is not, then either we have to keep extending the three entrees that we have now, or we have to look some time in the future, particularly with the problems which the greenhouse phenomenon will bring to Australia, at increasing Commonwealth powers via a referendum. It is something I floated some weeks ago but which I suggested was some time off.

Further, as the Government has advised Australians to leave China, and as the airports have been swamped, is the Australian Government making other arrangements to evacuate Australian citizens?

         —The Australian Embassy in Beijing has been in very close contact with Australian students in China for the duration of the crisis there and is presently confident that not only all the Australian students but all Australians in Beijing are safe. Yesterday, 5 June, the Embassy collected some Australian students and brought them to the Embassy. Certainly, the Embassy will be permanently available as a sanctuary should that become necessary. The current travel advice issued by my Department advises that all travel to China should be postponed until further notice. It also advises that non-diplomatic Australians in Beijing should leave as soon as flight bookings can be arranged.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are presently giving consideration to further upgrading that advice in the light of the continuing very tense, very volatile and potentially very dangerous situation in Beijing. We are giving consideration to means by which diplomatic dependants, non-diplomatic staff and other Australians in Beijing might be able to be got out if the situation deteriorates further and if it proves difficult to get international airline bookings out of there. This is under very active and constant review at the mission level in the Embassy and at the level of departmental consideration and in consultation with other relevant departments, Qantas Airways Ltd and so on here in Australia. Beyond that I cannot really report in any more detail as to what the situation is except to say that we have it under very close review.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not only the situation in Beijing that is giving rise to concern; it is also the situation in other parts of China. Tensions in Shanghai are very high at the moment with reports of large demonstrations and blockades-as yet, no military action, and we hope very intensely that this will be maintained without further violence and bloodshed breaking out. Similarly, there are reports from other cities of similar tension. As yet, there are no reports from elsewhere of military action, and again we hope that that will continue to be the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        More generally, we have sought assurances from the Chinese Government about the safety of Australians. That was part of my message to the Chinese Ambassador, Zhang Zai, in my conversation with him yesterday. I am now able to advise the Senate that the Ambassador was able yesterday to see a senior official from the office of the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs in Beijing to communicate to him in detail the Australian Government's response, including the full text of my message to the Ambassador yesterday, and in particular, to communicate our concerns about ensuring the safety of Australians in Beijing. The reply on that particular question-the subject matter of Senator Chaney's question to me now-regarding the safety of Australians in China, was that they would be safe so long as they strictly abided by the rules of martial law. That may or may not be regarded as a satisfactory response. Certainly, we are concerned about the situation and we are giving close consideration now, as I have said, to further upgrading the advice and the action we will be taking to ensure that it is possible for people to leave China.

         —Yes, I have seen the article in the Melbourne Age of 25 May under the heading `Device could let Met coast to fuel savings'. It refers to what Senator Maguire has referred to in his question, the metromiser, which is a device that has been developed by the South Australian Institute of Technology from research grants that the national energy research, development and demonstration program (NERDDP) has provided since 1985 totalling in excess of $530,000. Those grants have enabled research to go into the development of fuel conservation systems for railways. It has been led in this case by Associate Professor Ian Milroy whose research team is developing two systems under what they call the metromiser concept.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The metromiser will improve the fuel efficiency of urban train systems. In fact, 30 Adelaide trains are expected to be operating on the system by July. The long haul metromiser is for non-urban systems. Fuel savings of between 10 and 25 per cent have been achieved, with expected payback periods on installation costs of as little as two years for the suburban metromiser and one year for the long haul metromiser. Since the savings are in fuel efficiency-particularly on the Victorian system for which they will be used, which is an electrified system-there are real savings in energy output by the instrumentalities generating electricity. Since they are coal fired generators, that adds to a reduction in coal fired energy which I think all of us are pleased to see.
       </para>
       <para>
        Professor Milroy and his team are to be congratulated for their achievement because, besides the local benefits that accrue, successful trials of this system are being undertaken in Canada and it would seem there are further export opportunities available. Improved management and conservation of energy and the funding of projects such as this are high priorities for research, development and demonstration under the national energy research, development and demonstration program. In the transport area alone, $15.1m has been provided for research, development and demonstration methods of traffic and transport management leading to fuel efficiency, conservation and substitution for petrol and distillate in vehicles. That is a major aspect of NERDDP. While I am on that subject may I say that the draft Liberal-National Party resources and energy policy, under section 6.4 which has the heading `Research', states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Assistance to the electricity sector provided by National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program will be reviewed. Australian research institutions will be encouraged to undertake commissioned research into the electricity sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The word `review' is often a synonym used in these terms for `cut out'. I hope it is recognised that the role of the NERDDP is to find other methods of fuel efficiency for energy conservation, and to reduce our reliance on petroleum as a fuel. Although I do not have any expectation that the Opposition will ever be in power, I draw attention to the fact that if ever it did get there it would reduce these sorts of programs.

Is the Minister further aware that our prawn exports to Japan have fallen from 11,821 tonnes in 1982 to 7,178 tonnes in 1987 and that this fall in sales and prices has been brought about primarily by the 1983 reduction in quality control standards that allow up to 37 per cent of a carton of Australian prawns to not accord with its label?

         —Senator Devlin's question goes to the heart of one of the most basic elements of consumer protection in this country, and that is the protection of consumers from unsafe goods and products. As well as doing that, there is a need to ensure that the market is kept in a healthy, competitive environment, free of such unsafe products and goods, so that competition is as equal as possible. To this end, the Trade Practices Act is pivotal in protecting consumers from unsafe goods and products. It does so by adopting a national, effective regime of recall and product safety provisions; it does so by protecting people against unsafe goods; and, as I say, it does so by a comprehensive, national recall system. As Senator Devlin has said, this system has been in operation for almost two years-in fact, it has been in place since 1 July 1986. I should note, at this point, that the system was introduced and passed through this Parliament despite the objection of the Opposition. It should also be remembered that the provisions apply only to goods supplied after that date. Despite the fact that the system has been in operation for this limited period, and has applied to this limited range of goods, it has had quite an extensive operation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are talking about a regime which provides mandatory standards of quality for goods to meet. Those standards are imposed nationally and uniformally. There are also provisions which allow for individual goods to be declared as unsafe. This assessment is made on the judgment of whether they will, or may, cause injury to individuals. The first step in that process is an interim ban, followed by a permanent ban if the Government is sure that such goods will cause those injuries. In addition, and importantly, an immediate ban can be imposed when there is imminent risk of death or injury because of the unsafe product.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's policy over the last two years has been to embark upon the voluntary recall process as the primary alternative. The Government believes that the best way effectively to ensure total, if not substantial, recall is with the cooperation of industry. Voluntary recalls have been our first step. We have often used the immediate ban process as well as a mandatory recall, if there is inadequate compliance with the voluntary recall that is often arranged between government and industry. I should also say that these powers have been used with care and on the advice of experts in a whole range of fields. We have informal arrangements with State electricity authorities when it comes to unsafe electrical goods. We also have these sorts of arrangements with the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of Community Services and Health when it comes to vehicles and therapeutic goods respectively. The main area of food and consumer goods is governed by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a great degree of success in the utilisation of these provisions. In the period from 1 July 1986 to 25 May 1989 there has been a total of 560 recalls. Of those, general consumer goods amounted to 99, electrical goods 34, foods and beverages 17, motor vehicles, parts and accessories 117--

         —I am not blaming Senator Cook. I am not criticising him at all; I am stating a fact. Senator Cook negotiated an agreement with the Tasmanian Government. A new Tasmanian Government will come to power. As I understand it, the agreement that has been created now allows for logging in six of the nine National Estate areas which were referred to by Senator Cook in the agreement that he had with the Tasmanian Government. Studies will be carried out in all of those areas to determine what alternatives to logging there are for them in the future. The question of compensation ought not to arise because Mr Field and Dr Brown are quite convinced that in the interim there will certainly be enough timber to go around. In the long term, what we are about is establishing just what resource there is which would enable the State of Tasmania to take pressure off National Estate forests.

I ask the Minister: What constitutional rights are guaranteed to the States under the Australian Constitution, especially with regard to the environment? Secondly, under what constitutional power did the Commonwealth prevent the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission building a dam? Did the decision of the High Court of Australia in that case not depend on constitutional power contained in section 51 (xx) of the Constitution?

         —I am certainly not qualified to give Senator Coulter a legal opinion. That would be crazy. In respect of the first part of the question as to what constitutional rights are guaranteed to the States, there is quite a considerable argument amongst constitutional lawyers as to what they are. I would refer the honourable senator to, I think, section 100 of the Constitution which deals with inland waters. My recollection is that there is considerable disagreement as to whether even a power like that amounts to reserve power. I am not qualified to resolve that debate. The honourable senator asked under which constitutional power had the Commonwealth prevented the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission from building a dam. If one goes back to that case one will find that the Commonwealth argued powers under section 51 for race, acquisition of property, external affairs and corporations, which is quite a range of powers. In answer to the third part of the question, the decision of the High Court depended, in part, on the corporations power. I will not outline how environmental protection legislation under section 51 might be circumvented. The last thing I wish to do is to give people a blueprint as to how they might get around future action to be taken by a Commonwealth government. I have already indicated that I intend to seek a further opinion on the use of the corporations power. I do not intend to make legal opinions available in the Senate. I doubt that the Commonwealth ought to weaken its own position in future cases by advertising what it will do.

        —by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented. During Question Time Senator Sheil made the extraordinary suggestion that I had made some public statements supporting the Chilean Mr Buschmann's deportation from this country on the ground of various political characteristics and activities upon which he had embarked. I have had quite a lot to say about the naive romanticism of those who think that Mr Buschmann is some sort of freedom fighter against the Pinochet regime. I have said that his weapon is the gun, not the ballot box. I have pointed out the extent to which he has made clear that his commitment is to armed struggle, regardless of the process of democratisation at work in Chile. Equally, on several occasions I have made clear the total unacceptability of Mr Buschmann's calls in Australia for fund-raising to buy arms and, indeed, for the assassination of the current President of Chile. All of that is clear and on the record. I have been at absolute pains in all my statements on this matter to make clear that none of that has anything to do with the question of deportation.

      <para>
       Mr Buschmann is presently subject to a deportation order signed because of serious breaches by him of Australian immigration law involving a false statement about the purpose of his visit to Australia and failure to disclose his earlier exclusion from another country. That law is being applied by my colleague Senator Ray and the Immigration Department in exactly the same non-discriminatory way as it is to all entrants to Australia, and without any reference to the matters I have referred to above.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matters referred to above were the matters I have just summarised in the prefatory remarks I made. I hope that clarifies the matter for the record and that Senator Sheil will not in future be taken in by the propaganda of the extreme left wing in the way in which he manifestly has been on this occasion.

       <para>
        Senator Tambling has asked that I supply more details concerning the answer which I incorporated into Hansard on 1 June. This was in answer to a question he asked on 31 May about recent allegations made by Mr McMahon of Ansett regarding a lack of consultation of the Darwin Airport Redevelopment.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the answer I gave on 1 June was accurate, I am happy to provide more information.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am advised that according to a report of a person who attended the breakfast which Mr McMahon hosted and addressed, Mr McMahon's basic concern was that a new development of Darwin facilities costing $65m was not justified.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am told that his position was that Ansett was reluctant to pay for space in a terminal and for facilities which Ansett would not need. He indicated that if charging arrangements at the new Darwin terminal were not acceptable to Ansett, then they would seek to lease land at Darwin for the construction of a dedicated Ansett terminal.
       </para>
       <para>
        In developing the proposal for new facilities at Darwin, the Federal Airports Corporation consulted with both Ansett and Australian Airlines on the facilities needed and the lease conditions in the new Darwin terminal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ansett has written to the corporation seeking exact conditions and rental costs in the proposed new development and I am advised that the corporation will be responding shortly to their letter.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage, the issue is one for the Federal Airports Corporation and Ansett to resolve. I reiterate from my answer on 1 June, the issue of a separate Ansett Terminal Development was not raised in discussions held between Ansett and Australian Airlines on facilities and lease conditions before Mr McMahon made his remarks on 31 May. I have no doubt that if Ansett seriously proposed to build its own terminal, it would discuss it with the corporation.

The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following reply. All ADF members serving with UNIIMOG are in receipt of a difficult post allowance. This allowance is paid to compensate members for such factors as adverse climate, isolation, lack of medical facilities, presence of disease, absence of normal facilities, restriction on movement, and local leave problems. ADF members currently attached to UNIIMOG receive $5,780 per annum as difficult post allowance.

In addition to difficult post allowance members receive the following Australian allowances: separation allowance, $3.44 per day; transfer allowance, $335 to $410; and an outlay allowance-an interest-free loan of $1,500.

       MILITARY EXERCISE ON BEECROFT PENINSULA

         —In addition to the answer I gave yesterday to a question by Senator Haines I said that I intended to seek further advice. On the question of Aboriginal concerns, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs advised that it has no knowledge of the suggestion of 200 sites of Aboriginal significance on the Beecroft Peninsula. Defence is aware of 25 sites on the peninsula, 90 per cent of which are middens. Of those sites 70 per cent have already been disturbed and the environmental impact study on relocation of the facilities to Jervis Bay will extensively address Aboriginal concerns. The only Aboriginal site in the impact area of the exercise under question is called the drum and drumsticks-some rocks which are out to sea. They have not been used as a target since 1986 when the Aboriginal community notified the Department of their significance as a sacred site. There are no other sites of which the Department has knowledge in the impact area.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In regard to the history of the Beecroft Range, it has been used as a bombardment range for 50 years. The range was in use as recently as over the last couple of weeks for naval gunfire training. HMAS Torrens on 29 May, 31 May and 1 June 1989, and HMAS Brisbane on 30 May 1989 fired a total of 100 five-inch shells. No complaints were received on the occasion of those firings. In terms of regular use, 70 naval gun support serials per year are held over 60 days. That amounts to a total of 930 rounds into the impact area over the year. There are 100 serials per year by the Royal Australian Air Force. That will be increased as the F18 comes into service. Most of those use cannons although there are some bombs. The Army's involvement includes rapier surface to air firings and artillery firings as required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Between January 1986 and the end of March 1988 the Beecroft Peninsula was closed to the public for these purposes for 193 days. The peninsula is used about seven days a month. This exercise is hardly a great shock or different from the way in which these exercises have been conducted in the past. In terms of community consultation, a public meeting was held in Currarong-the settlement closest to the range-on 10 May 1989 to provide local residents with information about the exercise. Aspects of the exercise such as night firings have been tailored to minimise public inconvenience. A media release was issued before the commencement of the exercise, a copy of which I will table. I would also like to table a copy of the draft land management plan for the Beecroft Peninsula. That plan which has been in the public arena for a couple of years has been extensively discussed with the Aboriginal community, the south coast environment group, the Vincentia Progress Association, the Shoalhaven Combined Progress Associations, the Currarong Progress Association and the Callala Beach Progress Association. There has been extensive community consultation on that plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of public safety and demonstrators, which have received so much publicity today, the impact area of the range is surrounded by a large safety area from which the public is excluded when the range is in operation. In total some 12 demonstrators have been found on the range both yesterday and today. It is believed that some demonstrators remain on the range. The Defence Force is giving the Acting Minister for Defence an absolute assurance that the exercise will not commence until it is certain that no persons remain on the range. The search for remaining protesters is continuing.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the environmental considerations for the firing, the Defence Force management plan for the range requires that any damage to the range as a result of an exercise is repaired. All unexploded ordnance also is cleared from the range. Given the present wet conditions, the scale and nature of the exercise have been modified to minimise any potential damage. None of the heavier 155-millimetre guns will be used. All guns are being airlifted into and out of the range to avoid the need to tow them over wet ground. The guns will be fired from a prepared hard standing area.
       </para>
       <para>
        One other thing to mention about Aboriginal concerns is that Mr John Zakharov of the Australian National University is currently conducting a study of Aboriginal law on the peninsula; that will be made available as soon as it comes to hand.

I have some answers from the Chief Executive Officer of the National Crime Authority. At his own request, Mr X was released from witness protection on 22 September 1988. At the time of his death Mr X was facing charges in New South Wales in respect of which he had been granted bail. As the Authority understands it, Mr X went to Kings Cross in the early hours of Saturday 3 June and administered heroin to himself. He then went to sleep. At 6 p.m. that day his companion sought to wake him. She was unable to do so and reported the matter to the police at 7.40 p.m.; he was found to be dead. The post-mortem has not yet been held. The death is being investigated by New South Wales police, but as the Authority understands it, at this stage there is no evidence of foul play. On 16 November 1988 the Authority received information that Mr X's life was in danger. He was so informed on 17 November 1988 by an Authority investigator when it was suggested to him that he move from his address at that time and take every effort to conceal his whereabouts. In fact he did not move until February 1989. At this stage the Authority has no comment to make on any implications Mr X's death may have on the South Australian reference.

        This is a very important motion. I am delighted to see that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is with us today because he will be speaking in this debate. In fact, Senator Evans seconded the motion to refer the whole question of funding of the airlines to a special committee established at the Australian Labor Party (ALP) National Conference last year. That has some significance because it is quite clear that in recent years the airlines have not just been in a holding pattern but have been in a terminal decline. There are some in the Government ranks who are aware of the magnitude of the problem and do not see it simply in desperate political terms. It is very interesting that the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, was finally prevailed upon to come forward on the Face to Face program last Sunday-once again an example of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) leading from behind. He clearly twisted Mr Willis's arm to the point where it was obvious that Mr Willis had to cooperate. We will no doubt see further evidence of forced cooperation from people such as the honourable member for Maribyrnong, Mr Griffiths, whose committee has met, I think, on only one or two occasions and who will now be prevailed upon to come up with something to satisfy his political master. Indeed, so desperate is Mr Griffiths to get himself up front that I have no doubt at all that he will have no ideological difficulties with Mr Willis's proposal.

        Credit must go to the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, for identifying the drastic plight of the airlines as long ago as May 1988 when he pointed out, in demolishing some of what he described as the great lies about public enterprise, that Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines have been net losers for the Government. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The second big lie of the current debate on public and private ownership is that the Government has benefited financially from its public enterprise investments. In the majority of cases this is absolute rubbish. Public enterprise is often a net drain on the Budget and only in rare cases produces a return which is commensurate with the amount of capital tied up in an organisation. Assessed against capital injections using a 6 per cent real discount rate the dividends paid by Qantas and Australian Airlines have produced cumulative net losses for each organisation of $882.1m and $704.8m respectively over the period they have been owned by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a national disgrace and an absolute disaster, not just for the airlines, not just for consumers, but also for the Australian economy and the taxpayers who have to fund those airlines. Indeed, I think Senator Walsh pointed out that the dividends paid by the airlines in recent years have been about one-half of the capital injections, which in themselves have been modest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why is it that economic logic should point inexorably in the direction of the sell-off that Senator Evans and his other economic cohorts would fervently like but the Government has simply been fiddling while the airlines burn? The reality is that there is a vicious factional brawl going on. Unfortunately, Senator Childs has his preselection coming up this weekend, so I suppose he has to make a short term strategic retreat. One can imagine that there will be no shortage of left wing colleagues who will once again ram yesterday's ideology down the throat of this Government. What Mr Hawke is on about is no Damascus road conversion; nor indeed is Mr Willis, one of the most conservative of Ministers and one who has been a `big government is beautiful' ideologue for many years. He would not have a bar of this sort of discussion unless he was persuaded of the desperate plight of the airlines and the state to which the public sector has sunk under this Government. Not only has it been drained of funds but it has also been hung out to dry on the rack.

        There is no other explanation of why James Strong left Australian Airlines recently apart from the fact, as the Chairman, Ted Harris, made plain to the press conference, that the airline could not afford to hold him. He took the opportunity at that time to point out--

He made it clear that no-one could blame James Strong, no-one could expect that people would stay in a government owned airline while it was being bound hand and foot by government regulation. Although the salary package has apparently been increased to about $250,000 from the figure paid to Mr Strong of $106,000, even Mr Harris is pessimistic about the prospects of finding an adequate replacement. So these are mere bandaids.

        It is quite clear that Australian Airlines will go from bad to worse. Qantas will not be able to improve its fleet and buy those aircraft that it desperately needs unless it gets that $600m injection that Senator Evans's Caucus discussion paper on government business enterprises made so clear was necessary. That was more than 12 months ago. Once again, nothing has happened. What we know is that Qantas has a gearing ratio of about 80 : 20. It is not a commercially sound ratio. To his credit, Senator Walsh has made no bones about that fact. He pointed out that the approach of the Left-pretending that because a business is in government hands debt-equity ratios really do not matter-is simply another means of protecting the airline from commercial pressures which will inevitably result in its being risk averse. What will happen then is that it will simply get further and further behind. While Ansett is able to swallow up East-West Airlines Ltd, Australian can go nowhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Mr Harris also made clear, if the airline did want to engage in any acquisitions, it would have to go through a whole series of committees; presumably the Caucus committee would be the first port of call because that is what happens under this Government. One does not simply approach a Minister; one goes to the Caucus liaison committee or explains it to the relevant back bench group. If one can get one's way across that hurdle, one might be allowed to see the Minister because one is then in a position to tell him the deal has been done. That appears to be very much what this whole exercise is about. That is why we have had people such as Senator Button and Mr Dawkins coming out in recent days supporting poor old Ralph, who has put his neck on the chopping block.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that the Prime Minister is determined to thumb his nose at the ALP National Conference. The resolution was quite clear-that that special committee was simply to look at public sector funding options and was to report back to the National Conference before any further action was to be taken. Yet I do not think any of us has any illusions that this Prime Minister does not have the courage or the intestinal fortitude to confront a hostile National Conference, that the advice given to him by people like Batchelor and Hogg is clearly that he would not win. Therefore this whole exercise is about circumventing the proper processes of the ALP. If that is what we are on about, I think Senator Gareth Evans should come clean and tell his factional opponents that this is a new ball game, that the Left is not going to get its chance to garner the numbers at the National Conference. What the Prime Minister is on about is finding some way of avoiding that confrontation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tragedy is that even if the Prime Minister were to get his way, we would have a very pale imitation of a privatisation policy for this country. It would be one driven by political expediency and by the desperate need somehow to establish some credentials on micro-economic reform, which have been blown out of the water in recent days. The editorial in today's Australian not only makes it clear why the Government cannot afford the airline but also makes the following very true statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is hard to escape the impression that the Government will consider biting the bullet on airline privatisation because it wants to save money, but will not attempt fundamental micro-economic reform that would produce even greater benefits for the community.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A Hawke Government locked by the Party into a rigid opposition to any privatisation is easy to depict as yesterday's government. It can be depicted as a prisoner of outmoded ideology.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hawke is aware that now is the time for micro-economic reform. Privatisation is a high profile and symbolic issue. The test will be whether the Government retains the will to govern and takes the tough decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is the statesmanship. After reading editorials and hearing all of the informed commentators in this country telling the Government that there is a desperate need to embark on fundamental micro-economic reform, all we have had are a few false starts, certainly in the coastal shipping and waterfront areas, and now a last desperate attempt by the Prime Minister to get this item back on the agenda once more. I do not know whether he expects some plaudits if he can somehow pull off some compromise, but it is clear it will be against the wishes not only of his Party but also of the many who have reservations about the extent of the motivation for this particular proposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government were serious about what Mr Willis is now espousing, it would be done tomorrow. If this Government was able to make decisions on its own account, it would make them. It would not have to wait and do deals behind closed doors; it would not wait and decide whether it can confront or circumvent the National Conference. It would not worry about what the major players in Caucus had to say; it would not worry about allowing people such as Mr Howe to say as recently as March of this year, `I do not think privatisation has any support within the Labor Party'. It would simply take the tough decisions. But, no, it allows policy to be driven by people such as Mr Saunderson, who have long-held and hard-formed views about the undesirability of privatisation. It lets these sorts of debates go on and be agonised over in the community to a point where the Prime Minister is forced to stop the haemorrhaging.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is that the sort of leadership we want in this country? Is that the way to tackle a critical issue? It is as though the Prime Minister had not read Senator Evans's Caucus discussion paper, as though the Government had not looked at what Senator Walsh has had to say time and again about the desperate plight of the airlines and about the need to demolish some of the spurious arguments that are put forward to justify keeping a whole range of public sector enterprises in government hands. As Senator Walsh says, `The assumption that because an organisation is in public hands it will serve the public interest is fatally flawed'. I think he has been a voice in the wilderness, a voice of economic rationality. Obviously, he is not heeded by this Government unless it gets into extremis, and it is clearly reaching that point now. Paul Kelly has said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The dangerous gulf over privatisation has reached the point where there is mounting evidence of the inability of Cabinet to manage the Party and pilot through majority positions for its economic reform. Anti-privatisation is not a policy in itself, the issue is the viability of these presently wholly owned government airlines.
       </para>
       <para>
        This debate has been dragging on for years. That is the tragedy; that is the real political problem that this Government faces. What we are now looking at are some sorts of bandaid solutions that will enable the Government to limp through to the next election. We stress the need for the Government to ensure the future of Qantas and Australian Airlines by selling them to the public as supported-belatedly-by a whole raft of economic Ministers; to recognise not only the political reality but the economic imperative of that outcome; and to recognise that there are no second best solutions, that the painter must be cut, as Mr Willis puts it, and, better late than never, recognise the wider virtues of privatisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the Government has been twisting in the wind on this issue for some years. One has only to go to some of the statements that have been made over the years by various Ministers to see what intellectual contortions they have had to embark upon. It is quite clear that, from people like Mr Keating through to the Prime Minister, there has been a great deal of agonising-not driven, I might say, by any genuine concern about whether privatisation makes sense in economic terms, but simply driven by where the numbers are. Mr Keating, a few years ago in the House of Representatives, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No matter where one looks, whether it be at TAA or the other authorities, there is no case for the Opposition's argument in economics except, simply to indulge ideologically in a Thatcherite, vandalistic splurge to try to destroy these authorities . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the sort of overblown and overflown rhetoric that Mr Keating blows around:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth. We are about refurbishing them and keeping them strong. We are not about wrecking them and selling them. The great public services they provide will continue to be provided while ever this Government has the breath to defend them.

         —Wonderful stuff, not only hollow but hypocritical, because since that time Mr Keating has become a silent but supportive advocate of privatising the airlines. He is not prepared to go up front and tell anyone about it, but he just occasionally whispers to colleagues that it is not a bad idea. This is the great economic rationalist. This is the man who found it necessary to say, in Churchillian language, `We will fight while ever this Government has the breath to defend those public enterprises'. That sort of rhetorical overkill will come back to haunt this Government. Mr Hawke adopted the words of former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, speaking from the Costa Geriatrica in the twilight of his long and distinguished career. Macmillan talked about selling off the family silver. That sort of expression has been cheaply adopted as though it were somehow an intellectually respectable argument against privatisation. Jumping on the band wagon, Mr Hawke said that privatisation was:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . a one-off fire sale; a sale of the century of your assets, the assets of the people of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent times there has been not one word on why he has done that volte face. Of course, the reason is that he sniffed the wind. He is very perturbed indeed that all the intellectually responsible commentators in this country have been urging the Government to take that tough decision, and until now he has not been able to deliver the goods. There is no reason to think that somehow the Government is about to recognise that economic reality. All that it will do is back off. Looking at the terms of an amendment to be moved by Senator Evans, it would seem that even now we have a back-off:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the continued viability of Qantas and Australian Airlines . . . and ensure by the most efficient means their capacity to fund forthcoming fleet expansion.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a pathetic come-down. I hope that Senator Evans has the courage to say what he said on television the other night-that he does not change his mind. If a gutless Prime Minister wants to change his mind, let him swing. If the Prime Minister does not even have the courage to withstand the heat since Sunday and to let Ralph Willis be taken to the cleaners by the back bench, let him do it. If Senator Evans has an ounce of intellectual integrity, he will make clear what he has said consistently over the years-that privatisation is an economic virtue and an imperative; that he knows that the airlines must be sold off. If he is now going to have the gall and hypocrisy to get up here and pretend that somehow all can be well by some sort of restructuring, some bandaid, some last-minute injection from the intensive care unit, it is quite clear that Senator Evans's claim to intellectual responsibility is nil. I would have hoped that he would have more integrity than that and that he would simply go through the motions, if he is forced to, in supporting something that clearly has been drafted not by him but by others. But the significance of this, overwhelmingly, is that once again the Prime Minister has thrown in the towel. He has put his foot in the water and been burnt to death. He is not even prepared to stand up and say so; rather, he sends people like Senator Evans in here to try to water down something that the Prime Minister and all the major economic Ministers in this Government were saying was a wonderful idea as recently as yesterday. I very much look forward to hearing Senator Evans's explanation.

During the past six years the Government has systematically worked to put the operations of its transport and communications enterprises-especially the airlines-on a sounder financial--

          —On a sounder financial footing, and to make them more efficient, more flexible and more businesslike. We have given that task a high priority because of the strategic importance of these enterprises in the Australian economy. It is not a task which we only recently started. Early in the life of the Hawke Government, essential capital injections were given to Qantas and Australian Airlines. When we came to office Australian Airlines, Qantas and the Australian National Line were all grossly undercapitalised. They had been starved of equity capital under decades of coalition neglect and their scope for future development was severely restricted. At the outset we took decisive action to provide the injection of equity that was so badly needed. That allowed the airlines to take advantage of the tourist boom and the massive growth in air traffic that came with it. In 1983 Australian Airlines had a paid-up capital of only $40m, and $25m of that had been injected only in the very last days of the Fraser Government. The airline's debt to equity ratio was over 90 : 10, which imposed a severe burden of high interest payments at a time of declining business in the airline industry. In the two years 1981 to 1983, Australian Airlines' losses amounted to more than three-quarters of what had been its paid-up capital.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         This situation was completely untenable and was immediately addressed by the Hawke Government through an equity injection of $90m in our first Budget. That made the airline financially viable and put it on a competitive basis; and it has not looked back. Profits earned by Australian Airlines since 1945, when it was established, from all sources amounted to $176m. Eighty per cent of this amount, $143m, has been earned since 1983. Since 1945 Australian Airlines' dividends to the Commonwealth have amounted to $66m, of which $28m has been paid in the last two years. In other words, for the first time in over 40 years Australian Airlines is making decent sustained profits. In 1987-88 Australian Airlines earned $1.1 billion in revenue for an operating profit of $66.6m before tax. After tax and extraordinary items, that amounted to a return on equity of 21.5 per cent. The airline has been able to expand and diversify its operations and to improve the quality of its service. None of that could have been done without this Government's early financial support.
        </para>
        <para>
         The improvement in the performance of Qantas is also striking. The Hawke Government has provided Qantas with an injection of $60m in capital, more than two-thirds the amount that had been provided in all the previous 37 years in which the airline had been operating in government hands. Since 1947, when the Commonwealth acquired all of the shares of Qantas, the company has earned profits from all sources amounting to $564m, of which, however, $485m, or fully 86 per cent, has been earned since 1983, when the Hawke Government came to office. A similar picture applies to dividends. Since 1947 the company has declared dividends amounting to a total of $137m, with $92m out of this amount being paid again since 1983. In the 15-month period ending 30 June last year, Qantas earned revenue of $3.9 billion for an operating profit of $272m before tax and an 11.6 per cent rate of return on assets. Obviously these indicators of Qantas's performance within the environment created by the Hawke Government are quite spectacular.
        </para>
        <para>
         Business is booming for our airlines and the outlook remains extremely encouraging. This situation has come about in large measure because of the vision, reform, policy settings and initiatives of this Government. It has not come about by anything the Opposition did in over 40 years of neglect, waste and policy mismanagement bordering on dereliction. Both Qantas and Australian have very large expansion programs over the next five years which, indisputably, amount to clear testimony to the staggering success that this Government has had in creating a proper commercial environment for the airlines to operate in. By ending the domestic two-airline agreement, we will have full competition in the domestic aviation market, with new entrants by the end of next year. Internationally, there has been tremendous growth in inbound tourism in which Qantas has played an extremely valuable role for this country. However, there is very tough competition building up from overseas airlines which will put a lot of pressure on Qantas. To meet this situation, Qantas plans to spend about $6 billion, mostly on new aircraft, virtually doubling the present size of its fleet. For its own part, Australian Airlines will be spending almost $2 billion. By any measure, these are very large investment programs which will have to be financed largely by retained profits. Both airlines will obviously have to borrow a substantial sum of money as well.
        </para>
        <para>
         In this respect, of course, it will be recognised that the current budgetary situation is such that we are trying to restrict the amount of government borrowings in capital markets. That was evidenced by the decisions announced as part of the Loan Council process a couple of weeks ago. Indeed, the amount that the Government sliced off Commonwealth authorities' global borrowing limits was $1,150m. On any view, that represents a very substantial cutting back of the borrowing potential of the airlines which themselves constitute a large part of that statutory authority borrowing requirement.
        </para>
        <para>
         While the capital requirements of the airlines are realistic and necessary, there is some flexibility available in the short term, because higher gearing can be sustained under government ownership than would otherwise be the case. That is not to say that one can maintain a gearing ratio which is wildly out of kilter in the longer term, but certainly in the short to medium term one can sustain it. I have always readily acknowledged that in all the debates that I have had in the past about the significance of that gearing factor. While there is no immediate urgency which would in any way justify or require the sort of knee-jerk, bandaid solutions being espoused by the fire sale merchants on the other side-not that they have stayed in here to hear the reply to the debate-this Government has recognised and acted upon the need to place the airlines on a commercial footing. Our achievements in this area are on the record. We are committed to a very close further analysis of the capital needs of the airlines, and we are committed generally to further reforms. This contrasts quite markedly with the do nothing approach of the Opposition when it was in government. As I have said, the airlines were starved of funds, subject to intervention, moreover, which stifled the initiative of management and resulted in very poor performance and negligible returns to Australian taxpayers.
        </para>
        <para>
         What are we doing now to address these capital needs and related issues? The Government's position is quite clear. We are not sitting on our hands doing nothing; nor will we contemplate, by the same token, the simplistic approach that the coalition is advocating which is all about walking up to the stock market to put a price on our airlines and hastily flog them off in the market dealer rooms. What we have done is set up a public sector airlines funding review to fully canvass all the issues which are and must be on the table when considering the future of these airlines. The process is one of extensive and wide-ranging consultations with all interested parties. The detailed terms of reference of the policy review were decided by the Australian Labor Party National Executive and released last August. The committee was elected in December. Since then, it has invited and received submissions from a wide range of individuals and organisations, including party units, trade unions, Qantas, Australian Airlines, members of the public and the Department of Transport and Communications. It has heard oral evidence from, among others, the two public sector airlines, and it has requested further details, especially from Qantas and Australian Airlines. The committee's terms of reference require it to examine the full range of capital-raising options available to the airlines. They also require the committee to examine the implications of adopting any of these options for the future activities of the airlines.
        </para>
        <para>
         The issues that have been raised in discussions to date in the committee have included the airlines' capital needs to meet the projected growth in demand for air travel; further expansions of the airlines' activities into such related areas as tourist resort development and aircraft heavy maintenance; the capital requirements necessary to fund these investments for growth and diversification as well as to enable Qantas and Australian Airlines to compete effectively in prospective, more competitive domestic and international aviation environments and to protect themselves against financial difficulties in the event of any future downturn; and the prospects for additional equity capital and for borrowing on the account of the current shareholder in the context of future economic, financial and political constraints on the Government and of competing Budget priorities. They have also considered alternative means of providing the necessary capital for growth, including employee share ownership, subordinated debt, joint ventures, Australian Industry Development Corporation funding, airline amalgamation and the provision of equity from strategic corporate investors. They have also considered whether the publicly owned airlines, now and in a future deregulated industry, have any important social roles which cannot be satisfied in other ways. In other words, the full range of technical issues about capital formations and fundamental issues of principle about whether social needs are being addressed and satisfied in a way that might not be possible were these enterprises to be in the private sector are on the table manifestly as part of this policy review; and, moreover, all of them are being actively considered and discussed. At this stage, the committee is waiting for further information on these and other issues before proceeding to consideration of its report.
        </para>
        <para>
         It should be abundantly clear from what I have said about the submissions made to date that the issues to be considered and resolved are extremely complex ones. They simply do not lend themselves to quick fix generalisations or conclusions. That is something that I have always personally acknowledged in my own efforts to get some rational consideration of these issues. It is the quick fix, demonstrating the cheap and nasty solutions which are, of course, so obviously appealing to those opposite and to people like Senator Alston-who has just strolled insouciantly back into the chamber, having missed most of the substance of what I have said, to pick up the concluding remarks. The committee will continue to work towards a soundly-based and well-informed report and recommendations, even if that does take a little bit longer than was originally anticipated.
        </para>
        <para>
         I support and have confidence in the committee's work. During my previous incarnation as Minister for Transport and Communications, I was, as Senator Alston has not been loath to point out, closely involved in the debate then occurring on this issue. From my own fairly extensive study of the issues involved, I came to strongly believe three things, which I spelt out in a speech in May last year and which I repeat: first, that some of our major wholly publicly owned enterprises are facing serious capital formation problems, in particular, the two airlines; secondly, that their relative position in the marketplace-and perhaps in some cases their absolute viability as well-will rapidly deteriorate unless answers can be found to those problems; and, thirdly, that there are simply no obvious soft options for the solution of these problems.
        </para>
        <para>
         The question then arises as to what would happen to these enterprises if the issues that are mentioned were not fully addressed and the best solutions not implemented. If the equity required by Australian Airlines and Qantas to fund their capital expansion programs is not provided, either by equity injection or through access to the loan market, the simple reality that has to be faced is that they will not be able to grow and take up the opportunities which do exist in their respective rapidly growing markets. Progressively, but inexorably, private sector airlines would increase their share of the domestic and international aviation markets at the expense of Australian Airlines and Qantas. In that environment, Australian Airlines and Qantas would stagnate and others would grow. As the others grew, the public enterprise share would diminish accordingly, which is something that is not dear to the hearts and minds of those who are wedded to the virtues of public enterprise ownership.
        </para>
        <para>
         These are the kinds of consequences that flow from failure to provide the airlines with the capital injections they need. The problems are there. I frankly acknowledge it. The Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, was frankly acknowledging it the other day. Others who have commented on this subject have always acknowledged it. They simply have to be resolved if we are not to bear the stigma-as I said last May-of letting our enterprises slide to second-rate bit-player status at severe, long-term costs to the whole country.
        </para>
        <para>
         I say these things-I repeat them in the way that I have said them before-because I think it is important to demonstrate that we are not turning our faces away from the need to rigorously consider the needs of the airlines; the need to ensure the continued viability of Qantas and Australian Airlines; the need to ensure, by the most efficient means, their capacity to fund forthcoming fleet expansion. We need to consider all of those things. But the point that I am making is that we are not closing our eyes or our minds and becoming obsessed with other considerations at the expense of those realities. We are committed to ensuring that the airlines do not slide down into second-rate bit-player status. But, in order to avoid that outcome, we are taking the time to do the job properly. We do not see it as a simple business; we do not see it as a quick fix exercise. We see the issues as enormously complex-as issues which have to be addressed sensibly on a case-by-case basis. We will arrive at the correct conclusions in the interests of all Australians and we will do so without any assistance at all from the feeble, empty, rhetorical posturing of those opposite.

        <para>
         The need for the Government to ensure the future of Qantas and Australian Airlines by their sale to the public, as suggested by the Minister for Transport and Communications and supported by the Prime Minister.

         Senator Evans has moved the following amendment:
        </para>
        <para>
         Leave out all words after `ensure', insert `the continued viability of Qantas and Australian Airlines, and ensure, by the most efficient means, their capacity to fund forthcoming fleet expansion'.
        </para>
        <para>
         I indicate, at the outset, that we will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Evans; neither will we be supporting the urgency motion moved by Senator Alston. This motion clearly indicates the rather sad state of the debate about the Australian economy. The Hawke Labor Government and the Liberal and National parties are all playing a rather childish game about who is going to sell off the family silver the quickest. The Liberal Party of Australia has already indicated that it will flog it off to almost anybody at any price. The Hawke Government, of course, does not as yet have permission to do this but it has established a committee to have a look at the situation.
        </para>
        <para>
         A lot of attention has been paid to the editorial in today's Sydney Morning Herald. I think what has not been said about that editorial is probably its most valued virtue-it shows the massive paucity of argument in respect of privatisation. The editorial, entitled `Willis and Airline Privatisation', states:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . Australia's public accounts would look better with the airlines and their borrowing out of the public sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         This is the argument: it `would look better'; it is a matter of appearances. The Australian Labor Party, which deregulated the financial market and which floated the dollar, is certainly interested in making things `look better' to the international deregulators and privatisers who now have a stranglehold on the Australian economy. The editorial goes on to state:
        </para>
        <para>
         While they are owned by the Government, the airlines' borrowing and investment adds to the public sector's `deficit'. If they are moved to the private sector, their borrowing and investment will be seen to be part of the much-needed resurgence of private investment.
        </para>
        <para>
         That quote is well worth repeating. This is what the editorial actually says, extraordinarily enough:
        </para>
        <para>
         While they are owned by the Government, the airlines' borrowing and investment adds to the public sector's deficit. If they are moved to the private sector, their borrowing and investment will be seen to be part of the much-needed resurgence of private investment.
        </para>
        <para>
         This really means that if the Government borrows or allows Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines to borrow more to provide them with the capital expansion they need, this will be a bad thing because it will add to the public sector deficit. However, if Qantas and Australian Airlines are sold to private owners and these owners borrow, that will be a good thing. That is the level of the simplistic argument being trotted around in major editorials on this matter. It is a childish exercise and I think it shows the paucity of the arguments available in this area. It does not matter, according to the view espoused by the Sydney Morning Herald, if private overseas borrowing is largely responsible for our foreign indebtedness which, in turn, is the reason that most Australians are in danger of being thrown out of their homes which they can no longer afford. It does not matter, according to this particular view, that private companies are able to get tax deductions on their borrowings, thereby causing the Government to lose billions of dollars in tax revenue. All that matters is that we please the international financiers who now control this economy. There is a belief that everything that is private is thereby automatically good. These were the types of arguments which Senator Alston was trotting out again today.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Opposition has suggested, by its arguments, that this approach is a self-evident truth. The Labor Party is moving agonisingly towards the same conclusion: it is not the economic truth of the argument that matters, because the argument does not have economic validity; what matters, as the editorial quite rightly points out, is the appearance. Australia, of course, must be seen to be in the private sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         The question that ought to be asked with regard to this mania for privatising is: what do the ordinary Australians get out of the exercise? The Sydney Morning Herald editorial is cagey in regard to information. It states:
        </para>
        <para>
         Freed from the constraints of the public sector, the two airlines may become more efficient.
        </para>
        <para>
         So, maybe there will be some efficiency gains if we now flog off the silver and eat with our hands! It seems to me, quite frankly, that we would get the same rate of efficiency that we saw when the Government deregulated the financial markets and admitted 16 foreign banks into this country. In that case, the banks attacked the smaller users of the banking system with a plethora of charges and higher interest rates. On the other hand, their big corporate borrowers have never had it so good. The banks can now arrange for these borrowers to borrow money from overseas, thereby enabling them to get cheaper interest rates. On top of all that, the Government gives them a tax deduction while, of course, the people who have had to borrow within the domestic market are being squeezed.
        </para>
        <para>
         What are the efficiency gains we are supposed to expect if Australian Airlines and Qantas are flogged off by the Hawke Government or by the Peacock alternative? One would have thought that some attention would have been paid to the two airlines and their respective places in the market. That, however, was carefully avoided. We discover, if we have a look at Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia-the two competing domestic airlines-that Australian Airlines currently has the largest share of the market. It has achieved this position by using a whole range of innovative packages, such as the introduction of its business class, which Ansett is now imitating. Both airlines have to exist in exactly the same market and they are both subject to the same core fare regulatory regulations set by the Independent Air Fares Committee. The public airline, Australian Airlines, is doing very well in an exercise where it is competing fairly and squarely with a very efficient and effective private airline. We did not have any discussion of that exercise. The same thing applies to Qantas which is, again, a very efficient airline; an airline which has the best safety record of any international airline anywhere in the world. It is an airline that people want to travel on. It is efficient; it is effective. It has managed to penetrate and open up new markets for this country. It has been a major asset to our thrusts, particularly into America and the European Community where it has set a view about Australia that has been very useful for other private sector companies to follow.
        </para>
        <para>
         We are talking about flogging off two very efficient airlines. If we are going to do that, at least let us have some arguments as to why we will do it. Let us have some arguments that actually suggest that there may be something to gain out of this particular exercise either for those airlines or, from the point of view of the Australian Democrats more importantly, for the ordinary Australian taxpayer. At the moment we have not had that. We can ask a whole range of questions. Indeed, we agreed very firmly with the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council when, in talking about the privatisation mania that is going on, it made the point that if any government enterprise is to be privatised it should be mandatory to provide a consumer impact statement in which the following types of questions have to be answered: is the enterprise efficient or inefficient? That is a reasonable question. The question as to whether Australian Airlines and Qantas are efficient or inefficient was not answered here today. Perhaps Senator Short may be able to answer that one. The next question to ask is: will private enterprise be more efficient? Of course, the problem for Senator Short, if he wishes to actually get into it, is to explain why a very efficient private airline, that is Ansett, does not have the market share.
        </para>
        <para>
         The next question to be answered is: does the organisation provide goods or services which can be seen as basic to the well-being of the community, for example, transport, communications and so on? That question is very pertinent in this context. The next question is: is there cross-subsidisation of the price of the service under the public arrangements? If so, what agreements can be reached about continued cross-subsidisation? Again Senator Alston ignored this particular question. Quite frankly, as a senator from Queensland I am very concerned at the notion that we will have cheap fares on the Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne run but on the Brisbane-Longreach run, the Brisbane-Mount Isa run, the Brisbane-Townsville run, the Brisbane-Cairns run, the Brisbane-Rockhampton run, the Brisbane-Mackay run, and the Brisbane-Toowoomba run, we will all pay higher air fares. That is what the National Party of Australia is supporting. Or is it?

         It is interesting that its members are not participating in the debate. That is what will happen in that deregulated private market. The Government will reap the rewards where the people are, that is, on the major trunk routes, and it will shove up the prices where they are not, that is, on the rural routes. But this happens to a very large country. We have seen to date the benefits of cross-subsidisation whether it be in the area of telephones or transport. My Party supports very strongly that notion of cross-subsidisation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council asked: if cross-subsidisation of services is to be discontinued, what will the Government do to assist those consumers who can no longer afford those essential services? If there are to be direct subsidies, what will be the cost to Government? Of course we found this out when we actually got into the Telecom debate. The Government wanted to sell off the profitable bits because private enterprise does not want to buy something that is actually losing money. The Government is left with all the bits that cost money and that means that it has to tax more. What sense is there in that? There is absolutely no sense at all. In this area that is what we will be doing. It will be the taxpayer who will have to pay while Elliott or Bond-I do not know who-will make the profits. We should get down to the real economic argument of who is going to gain. The answer is: the big corporate companies. Who will lose? It will be the ordinary taxpayer. That is what privatisation is about.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again the question can be asked: will the Government regulate to ensure maintenance of services to minority groups? If so, what will the regulation cost the Government? I have already referred to those questions with regard to the rural sector. Another question is: what will be the changes in pricing structure and who will be affected? That is fairly obvious. Another question is: what controls and accountability will the Government maintain? Will a new regulatory authority be required? What will be the costs? Again, the taxpayer will pay for all of that of course. Another question is: will there by any government savings? The answer is: none at all.
        </para>
        <para>
         Another question is: what will be done with the proceeds of the sale of shares? Of course they will disappear within the year. We will have nothing left and we will be paying the bill. Another question is: to what extent will any form of privatisation or corporatisation of a specific enterprise increase the likelihood in both the short and long term of concentration of ownership? Of course the final argument is raised in the question: how will we prevent that? Why would we want to prevent it? What we have now is a competitive context. What we would have under privatisation would be a monopoly. It is not an advance. It is going backwards in this country to the detriment of the ordinary taxpayer.

          —The matter which the Opposition has brought to the Senate for debate today is a matter of real urgency, namely:
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The need for the Government to ensure the future of Qantas and Australian Airlines by their sale to the public, as suggested by the Minister for Transport and Communications and supported by the Prime Minister.
        </para>
        <para>
         On Sunday the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, was reported-I repeat it for the Senate's benefit-as saying:
        </para>
        <para>
         The ALP would have to face the stark choice of either finding the funds for the airlines, at the expense of other priorities such as welfare, or privatisation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Willis expressed the personal view that the privatisation route was the correct one and that both airlines should be sold 100 per cent to the public. It is an approach, I stress at the outset, with which the Opposition fully agrees. Amazingly we have in this debate today an amendment moved by Senator Evans on behalf of the Government which absolutely shoots down everything that Mr Willis, the responsible Minister, supported by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said on Sunday. The amendment that has been moved by the Government does not ensure the future of Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines by their sale to the public. Indeed it deletes all reference to the sale of either airline. It talks instead about the continued viability and the question of ensuring their capacity to fund forthcoming fleet expansion.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, out of the motion of the Opposition has been expunged entirely by the proposed amendment by the Government any reference at all to the fundamental issues that Mr Willis addressed when he raised and put back on the political agenda on Sunday the question of the privatisation of the airlines. Rarely would we have seen in any government such a major retreat and such an abandonment of the responsible Minister and, by implication, the Prime Minister of the day, such as in the pusillanimous amendment that has been moved today. Today the Government has come up with an amendment. I might say that it has been moved by Senator Evans who was the predecessor Minister for Transport and Communications to Mr Willis. In December 1987 when Senator Gareth Evans was the Minister he said:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . the choice between finding extra cash for public enterprises and spending on health, welfare and other social areas was a real one.
        </para>
        <para>
         `There is a real choice,' he said.
        </para>
        <para>
         `It's not a rhetorical device on my part to say we face hard choices between what we spend our scarce budgetary dollar on . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         That was the whole implication of what Senator Evans said when he was the Minister. But he got rolled by the Left and the trade union movement as has so often happened with this Government. He got rolled for saying precisely the same things and expressing the same sentiments as has Mr Willis. What has he done today? He has had the hide to come into this chamber and move an amendment which negates everything that he ever said as the Minister, which negates everything that the current Minister said two days ago and which negates the support that Mr Willis received from the Prime Minister two days ago and yesterday from three of the other senior Ministers of the Government, namely, Senator Button, Senator Walsh and Senator Gareth Evans.

Once again, we have seen a major sop to the left wing of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Senator Childs will like the amendment all right as will Senator Bolkus, Mr Hand, Mr West and Mr Howe. But what are Mr Willis, Senator Evans, Senator Walsh and Senator Button going to say? They have been stranded like whales on a beach with this amendment. Even the Prime Minister has been stranded, unless he has not already started backing away from his support for Mr Willis on Sunday. From reports in today's paper it looks as though he could be doing that.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         This is a matter of urgency for several reasons. The intrinsic, economic and public policy merits of, and the need for, the privatisation of both Qantas and Australian Airlines nowadays are fully recognised in the community and by the senior economic portfolio Ministers of this Government. I say to Senator Macklin, in response to the rhetorical question he posed, that that debate has been and gone and like the troglodyte Left of the Labor Party the Australian Democrats have been left trailing in the wake of it because he has never opened his mind to see what the advantages of privatisation will be and what enormous costs to the community and the use of resources that large scale public enterprise brings. The Australian Democrats, along with the troglodyte Left of the Labor Party, have been left by years in the public and community debate and perception of this whole issue. That debate is over and it is about time that Senator Macklin and his Party woke up to that fact. The longer he does not wake up to it, the better from my point of view. He is going to go at the next election anyway; this will make sure that he goes even more dramatically.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Willis and his predecessor, Senator Evans, are both firmly on the public record as advocating the sale of both airlines to the public as the only means of ensuring that they will have access to the capital injections required to enable them to maintain an increase in funds and, therefore, be competitive in a highly competitive marketplace. That applies particularly to Qantas which has to compete with all the other international airlines of the world. The airlines themselves have urged the Government over a long period to privatise them for the very same reasons as those that have been advanced by Mr Willis and, before him, Senator Evans. They have been endorsed by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), and, on occasions, by Senator Button. But despite the overwhelming reasons in favour of privatisation of the airlines and the strong support of the Government's most senior Ministers, the Government has refused to act. Why? Because the trade union movement, which is the real determinant of what this Government does, has vetoed such an action. It was the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Simon Crean-not the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or the responsible Ministers-who announced the decision on privatisation after the debate at last year's ALP National Conference. Mr Crean announced, `Privatisation is dead'. He told the Government, `Your policy plans aren't acceptable to us. Your policy is dead'. The Government lay down before Simon Crean and said, `Okay, Simon, if that is what you say, then that is what will be done'. What a way to run a country. Who is running this country? Certainly it is not the Government.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is not only the trade union movement which is frustrating the ability of the Hawke Government to govern. On privatisation the Cabinet itself-Senator Bolkus is the only Minister in the chamber, but he knows this very well; he is part of the division-is bitterly divided on the issue. Since Ralph Willis put the privatisation of Qantas and Australian Airlines back on the political agenda last weekend, at the behest of the organ-grinder, the Prime Minister, he has been assailed publicly by at least two of his senior ministerial colleagues. Stewart West was reported as saying last Sunday, straight after Mr Willis spoke, that he did not think a sell-off was warranted and he did not think that the Left would think that it was warranted. Another influential left wing member, Mr Hand, claimed that there was overwhelming evidence from Labor Party members rejecting Mr Willis's privatisation arguments. The convener of the socialist Left, Senator Childs-it is a pity that he is not in this debate today-said--

          —Yes, they would not let him near it. He said that members of the parliamentary Left and the unions would fight any privatisation proposals. The Victorian socialist Left member, John Saunderson, dismissed Mr Willis's statement by describing him as doing a `Rambo Ralph'. I have never really thought of Ralph as a Rambo, but obviously the socialist Left does. Even worse for Rambo Ralph, the administrative committee of the Victorian branch of the ALP only last Friday unanimously endorsed its traditional anti-privatisation policy. It is significant that that administrative committee in Victoria is cross-factional. Less than three months ago, the Minister for Social Security, Brian Howe, told the seminar in Canberra:
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         I don't think privatisation has any support within the Labor Party.
        </para>
        <para>
         Yesterday, one day after his ostensible support, the Prime Minister appears to be starting to back off as well. So it is quite obvious that Mr Willis has a major task ahead of him if he is to succeed in having the ALP change its stance on privatisation. The Prime Minister was brutally and unceremoniously dumped on the issue at the ALP National Conference only 12 months ago. He had argued hard for privatisation at that time. He lost badly. His Party repudiated him and in many respects I believe that he has never recovered from that defeat at the Hobart conference. Not that Mr Hawke was always a supporter of privatisation. We do not have to go back all that far to find him vehemently opposed to it. Honourable senators should remember, for example, how he campaigned on a scare campaign of privatisation during the 1985 South Australian election. On 21 November 1985 in this Parliament, he stated:
        </para>
        <para>
         As anyone who thinks about the issue of privatisation knows . . . it would mean higher prices, higher costs, higher taxes and higher fares . . . It is quite clear that in South Australia, as in Australia as a whole, privatisation would be an expensive and disastrous experiment.
        </para>
        <para>
         He went on the same anti-privatisation binge earlier in 1985. At the time of the Nunawading by-election, he had this to say about privatisation:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . is a one-off fire sale, a sale of the century, of your assets-the assets of the people of Australia. They would transfer them into the hands of a privileged few, to the cost of every one of us.
        </para>
        <para>
         Other Ministers made comments at that time in similar vein. They reflected the traditional Labor Party archaic approach-an approach really of the early twentieth century to public ownership. Senator Collins knows that as well as I do. It is that early twentieth century approach towards public ownership that is still very deeply embodied in the platform of the Labor Party despite the concerted efforts of the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers to have it altered at the 1988 National Conference. Indeed, the ALP's determination to stick with its early twentieth century approach to public ownership was strengthened by that conference. I will read from the platform that was produced following that conference. Under the heading `Public Sector', it is stated:
        </para>
        <para>
         Labor is committed to the maintenance of the Australian public sector. We totally reject conservative proposals of privatisation of public enterprises and services which would lead to-
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         weakening the sense of national and public identity associated with bodies such as the ABC, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank;
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         Labor is committed to the provision of essential community services, including communications, health, education and transport, through the public sector, and will strongly resist efforts to privatise such services.
        </para>
        <para>
         Indeed, the conference moved a resolution, which states:
        </para>
        <para>
         a recognises that a fundamental tenet of the labour movement is a total commitment to full ownership and control of enterprises in the public sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         b acknowledges that Qantas and Australian Airlines are likely to require substantial capital injections in the near future, in order to maintain their viability and market share.
        </para>
        <para>
         In taking those two clauses together, the National Conference was saying, `Yes, we will pour a lot of money into Qantas and Australian Airlines but we will still have them 100 per cent publicly owned'. That is the essence of this whole debate. The senior Ministers responsible have said that that is just not possible. Therefore, I say to all members of the Hawke Government: there is an urgent need for them to support Mr Willis-and the Prime Minister, if he is still of the same mind-on the proposal to sell Qantas and Australian Airlines to the public. That is the only way to ensure the future of both airlines.
        </para>
        <para>
         This debate is about more than just the future of the two airlines; it is also about whether the Government has at last managed to pluck up the resolve to take the hard decisions necessary to enable Australia to make its way in a competitive world and to start reversing the slide into which the Government's incompetence, ineptitude and lack of resolve have plunged it over the past six years.

          —As Senator Macklin pointed out in his contribution and by way of interjection since, the interesting thing about this debate is that neither Senator Alston, who moved the motion, nor Senator Short, who has just spoken in support of it, made a case to the Senate as to why we should agree with the motion. Both honourable senators spent in excess of half an hour talking about politics. They did not talk about airlines. However, they made a number of points to which I will address myself this afternoon in response, rather than talking about airlines.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         Senator Alston said that this debate was about `micro-economic reform'. I agree: certainly the subject of this afternoon's debate is one element of that. He said also that privatisation was `an economic virtue'. Well, there is a sweeping statement. If we needed any further elucidation of this afternoon's debate, Senator Short supplied it when he concluded his address by saying that the debate was not simply about selling the airlines to the public; it was about the capacity of governments to take hard decisions.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Alston quoted at length from an Australian newspaper editorial. However, he did not quote the part that said that this Government had `pushed through more economic reform than any other in Australian history'. That is a matter of fact. The Opposition's approach to the sale of the airlines, like its approach to all public enterprises and indeed economics generally, stems from the example of Thatcherism in Great Britain. It makes no secret of that. The former Leader of the Opposition sent a congratulatory telegram to Mrs Thatcher on the achievement of her 10 years in government saying that her Government had set an example of economic reform for the rest of the Western world to follow. Dr Hewson is now the exponent of that line. However, I would point out that, in respect of Dr Hewson's position, an article was published in the Australian Financial Review in the last week or so by David Clark which I thought pointed out very thoughtfully and accurately the problems associated with micro-economic reform. The article talked about Mr Clark's former relationship with Dr Hewson and the fact that `like Malcolm Fraser at Oxford, John Hewson left no political or social mark whatsoever'-that is, on the university which he attended. Mr Clark went on to say of Dr Hewson:
        </para>
        <para>
         It is also alleged that he dreamed up the idea of taxing paper-boys, and idea which the Fraser Government was forced to drop post haste.

         The article went on to say, and I agree with this:
        </para>

          —With only 15 minutes left for this debate, Senator Short does himself no credit with his fairly transparent effort in time wasting. I listened with great patience to about seven minutes of quotations from articles by the lead speaker in the debate. David Clark went on to say that indeed micro-economic reform and fiscal policy were difficult areas. However, the Opposition relies on knee-jerk responses to the easy area-that is, monetary policy-in exactly the same way as the Thatcher Government has implemented it and on which it has been congratulated formally by the Australian Opposition.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         Senator Short said in his contribution-and I will comment on this in a minute-that the Australian public should be told of the great cost of not privatising. There is also the cost of a knee-jerk response to selling off everything and not looking at the alternatives that are available. That is exemplified in the economic policy that he supports-that is, Thatcherism and a Thatcherist economic approach. There has been a cost in that too and I will talk about it in a minute. It is not simply a matter of saying, `We will deregulate everything and then forget about it' or `We will sell off everything and then forget about it; the market will take care of it' because, as Senator Macklin pointed out, there is another side to that story to which senators representing the Northern Territory specifically-at some stage I would be interested in Senator Tambling's views on this-simply cannot afford a knee-jerk reaction. They cannot afford a knee-jerk reaction to selling off public utilities such as Australia Post and Telecom Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         In this nation we have a few basic problems with knee-jerk reactions to such proposals. We are a nation of scarcely 16 million souls spread across 3 1/2 million square miles of continent in a highly dispersed, highly urbanised population-an urbanised population where the great wealth and production of the country are centralised and located in a small number of areas, but where all Australians have the right to receive the same basic services no matter where they live. Otherwise, this dreadful urbanisation from which we suffer in this country-and which to some extent is greater than in any other westernised nation-will continue to be exacerbated. Even in my patch of the Northern Territory, half of the total population of 150,000 are located in one city-the city of Darwin, where I live. The kinds of policies that will be espoused by the Opposition-the knee-jerk response that it wants to sell off the farm and deregulate-will have a major cost to the isolated Australians who choose-and I say full marks to them-to live in places other than Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, and particularly Sydney and Melbourne.
        </para>
        <para>
         In order to confirm Senator Macklin's worst fears, I refer honourable senators to a contribution to the airlines debate made by the General Manager of Ansett Airlines of Australia, Mr Graeme McMahon, in the Australian of 24 May this year-remarks which I, as a Territorian, found offensive, foolish, intemperate and disturbing. I make those comments as a person who, arguably, has been carried more miles by Ansett Airlines in the past two years than any other passenger in Australia. I can leave Senator Tambling for dead. I still live in the Northern Territory as distinct from Senator Tambling who lives in Canberra. If there is any other passenger who has travelled more miles on Ansett than I have, I would like to meet him because he would have my sympathy. According to the Australian, Mr McMahon spoke about abandoning the two-airline agreement and indeed deregulating-a policy I support with care and reservations. The article said:
        </para>
        <para>
         New airlines may find it impossible to compete with low fares against Ansett and Australian Airlines because ``we will knock their heads off as soon as they stick them up'', the general manager of Ansett, Mr Graeme McMahon, has warned.
        </para>
        <para>
         The article went on to say:
        </para>
        <para>
         In Australia, fares to some smaller centres, such as Darwin, were likely to treble, while centres such as Launceston could lose the big jet aircraft which serve the main routes.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr McMahon said aircraft which flew almost empty into Darwin before Christmas ``to carry out public servants before the wet'' would in future fly only if they could be made profitable by higher fares.

          —Senator Short would like to make it a separate issue. The Opposition has a completely knee-jerk reaction. If it is deregulated it is good or, to quote Senator Alston, `Privatisation is an economic virtue'. That is a sweeping statement-`privatise under all circumstances and we have to be better off'. The Opposition keeps on denying that it has a privatisation policy with respect to public utilities such as Telecom. It was only yesterday that I heard an Opposition senator stringently deny that the Opposition had a policy to sell off Telecom. Perhaps Senator Alston will have to revise his sweeping statement that privatisation is an economic virtue. Apart from issuing a warning to Northern Territorians about where they are going to be under a new deregulated policy, Mr McMahon is reported as saying:
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         ``The US has lots of large markets which do not exist in Australia,'' he said. ``Deregulation in Australia will bring some discounts, but the heavy discounts which applied in the US are just not on.
        </para>
        <para>
         I agree with Mr McMahon that it is not valid simply to make easy comparisons between what happens in Australia in the airline business and what happens elsewhere in the world. That point was very effectively made in respect of privatisation, as with deregulation, by a very good research paper entitled `Airline Privatisation and Deregulation International Survey' which was produced very recently, on 24 April 1989. In the introduction to that paper-I do not have time to quote more than the introduction-the writer says:
        </para>
        <para>
         In assessing overseas experiences from an Australian perspective, it is important to recognise the difficulties of determining the applicability of overseas results to the Australian context. The long standing operation of the two airline policy, including quite recent decisions (such as those made on the eve of the creation of the Federal Airports Corporation to grant long term leases on airline terminal space to Ansett and Australian Airlines) has left a legacy of preference and market dominance for the two incumbents which may not be readily erased.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a conclusion with which I completely agree. As Senator Evans pointed out in his contribution to this debate, it is very cute of the Opposition to come in here this afternoon and talk about the alleged lack of activity of this Government in the area of airline deregulation and privatisation, as it always does, when under the Government of those opposite the two public airlines were not only not sold off but allowed to become absolutely moribund. There was not only no policy from the Opposition to sell them off to the public but also no policy of supporting them. So they took a nosedive.
        </para>
        <para>
         In respect of Senator Alston's remarks earlier about this Government achieving nothing in terms of micro-economic reform, I point out to him that when this Government took office the Australian steel industry, for example, was dead in the water. It was this Government that repaired the damage done by the previous incumbents in government. The Australian motor vehicle industry was completely overhauled by this Government. We saw achievements in micro-economic reform; motor vehicle tariff reform; protection reform in the area of textiles, clothing and footwear; general tariff reform; and agricultural reforms. The editorial in the Australian said quite accurately in that section not quoted by Senator Alston-he refused to quote it-that this Government has established in its relatively short period of government a greater degree of economic reform than any previous government in Australia's history. The reality is that knee-jerk reactions to fire sales, which the Opposition is promoting, are not going to succeed in terms of solving the problems in the airline industry in the same way that knee-jerk reactions will not succeed in any area of micro-economic reform. I will quote from the final paragraph of this very good article by David Clark, which outlines the problems associated with micro-economic reform. He states:
        </para>
        <para>
         Finally, there are limits to the degree of reform which governments, parliaments, industry, unions and society can digest in a certain time-particularly if there is no vision behind the reform drive.
        </para>
        <para>
         I might add that Mr Clark's remark about no vision behind the reform drive was in reference to earlier remarks he made about the complete lack of vision of Dr Hewson. This Government will succeed in the area of putting health and prosperity into the operations of those airlines in the same spectacular fashion as it has achieved in all of the other areas of micro-economic reform acknowledged by the Australian that this Government has established in its seven-year history.

       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom Australia has no need to have an exclusive right to supply, install and maintain public telephones. Telecom endeavoured to persuade the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunication Services in Australia that it made a loss on public telephones of the order of $40m. As I recall it, the Davidson inquiry was sufficiently concerned about the accuracy of that submission to call in, I think, Coopers and Lybrand, which took a contrary view. Since that time Telecom has continued to maintain that this is some sort of burdensome obligation that it bears in the public interest. I do not accept that it must inevitably lose money on public pay phones. There are a number of ways in which it could improve the service and performance of those phones. It is very odd that it has not yet introduced credit cards for public pay phone users in the way that has been the case in the United Kingdom for several years, and certainly in Japan, where telephone credit cards as a personal accessory item are very popular. People will often buy them on the basis that it gives them a credit facility for some hundreds of phone calls in advance. They have become a very good source of revenue for NTT. I see no reason at all why Telecom should not have moved already in that direction other than the fact that because it is a monopoly it does not feel under any pressure to respond to those consumer demands or preferences.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, I see no reason at all why there should not be competition in the provision of public pay phones. Certainly, Mercury provides public pay phones in the United Kingdom. There is no reason why the provision of these phones could not be subcontracted out to local councils and municipalities. I am sure that private contractors would be more than ready to service them. Vandalism could be significantly reduced as a result of credit card facilities being generally available and not just available to special and frequent users of long distance telephone services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our amendment, therefore, is concerned, firstly, with the competition benefits that would derive from opening up that system and, secondly, with one eye to the responsibility to ensure that people in areas where it might otherwise be uneconomic to do so are nonetheless provided with public pay phone facilities. That could be done quite simply by cross-subsidy arrangements, either by way of a levy being imposed on carriers or even by a government subsidy, although I tend to favour the former. On that basis we propose that Telecom should have an obligation to supply, install and maintain public pay phones where there is a community need as determined by Austel. Certainly in the United Kingdom, British Telecom (BT), as I understand it, willingly accepts an obligation to locate pay phones wherever Oftel deems it desirable. The experience to date is that BT very much welcomes the opportunity to achieve saturation coverage in a whole range of rural and remote areas-although that term has a different meaning in the context of the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the fact is that it is desirable, as a marketing exercise, for the dominant carrier to have that sort of universal coverage. I do not subscribe to the view that if this system were open to competition Telecom would immediately vacate the field or move out of the uneconomic areas. I have no doubt at all that Telecom would be very keen indeed to maintain public telephones around the nation as much as possible, even to the extent that they might cost it a bit on the deal. The public relations benefits would be very significant and I have no doubt that, with the efficiency opportunities that would open up from competition, Telecom could significantly reduce its costs of servicing those pay phones.

         —The proposed amendment to impose the obligation on Telecom Australia to supply, install and maintain pay phones where there is a community need is quite unnecessary. Telecom's community service obligation to provide public pay phones will be mandated through the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and Austel's specific powers to ensure that Telecom provides public pay phones when and where they are needed. That is provided by subclause 68 (3) of this Telecommunications Bill. The requirement to provide public telephone services on a universal basis is logically supported by a degree of monopoly in this area. That is the principle of the Bill, it is what we support and, accordingly, we cannot accept the amendments.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        These amendments move into the domain of fantasy, particularly when we consider amendment 22. This is the amendment to subclause 48 to insert the proposal which obliges Telecom to supply, install and maintain all public pay phones, subject to its obligations where there is a community need; otherwise the supply, installation and maintenance is to be open to competition. The Opposition is suggesting that the supply, installation and maintenance of public phones should be fully competitive, but where a public pay phone is not provided because the commercial returns are not high enough, Telecom is to be directed to provide the service. Thus, we are confronted with a proposition that Telecom is to fund loss-making public pay phones out of revenue from a fully competitive market; while competitors have no such obligation. That is just a further example of the old maxim which still has so much currency on Opposition benches, `Capitalise your profits; socialise your losses'. The Government rejects this amendment for all the reasons which should be totally self-evident.

         —The Australian Democrats reject these amendments as well. They are amongst the most transparent of the amendments which the Opposition is moving, in terms of the last comment made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Early in his remarks Senator Alston said that the Opposition does not see why a loss should be made on public pay phones. He went on to move these amendments, one of which provides that in areas where pay phones will make a loss Austel will make Telecom Australia provide those phones. What the honourable senator is really saying is, `Where pay phones don't make a loss, we want them handed over to our mates in the telecommunications industry in the private sector'.

        This is about the best example of what, from my vague memory of primary school history, used to be called blackbirding by the squattocracy. The squattocracy were people who went into the rich Western District of Victoria-from which they have now emerged in the form of the National and Liberal parties, all too often-and picked the eyes out of the areas which were to be opened up by surrounding watercourses and waterholes so that the rest of the land was pretty useless to anyone else who came along because they could not get water. I think that was called blackbirding; it was certainly picking the eyes out of things, and that is clearly what is being proposed in this amendment, as it is in many others in this series of amendments.

        It is extraordinary to suggest that one of the ways of making pay phones more profitable and equitable is by the sale of credit cards. I want to know how the inhabitants of Housing Commission flats in North Melbourne are expected to benefit from this kind of exercise. It is clearly the sort of exercise which benefits people in the business community and the better off. As for claims that maintenance could be less expensive for Telecom in a system where the only public telephone booths which would be run by Telecom would be less numerous and probably scattered all over the place, it seems to me it would be a very inefficient system if Telecom only serviced a few sporadic booths in areas of poverty or isolation. Again, bearing in mind that according to Senator Alston in the best of all worlds there would not be the ability to cross-subsidise, and all these costs would have to be upfront at every Budget, I have to ask how much this would cost, and has the National Party component of the coalition really looked at the implications of this exercise?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats have been critical of Telecom in the past on the question of public pay phones. We are concerned that the provision of pay phones appears to be being reduced in some low socio-economic areas, or in areas where people do not have their own telephones or are moving constantly and awaiting telephone installations. We draw the attention of the Government to that fact, and express our hope that the provision of pay phones in such cases will be regarded as a priority in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to make a personal comment. I often find that the siting of public pay phones is most inappropriate. They seem, particularly in country towns, to be placed on that side of the road where the hot sun will blaze down from midday. I had the experience of almost fainting in a booth one afternoon in a northern Victorian town. Conversely, in southern areas they seem to be placed on the windiest, coldest corners. A more humane approach to the siting of pay phones might lead to more profitability because people might find them a bit more comfortable to use.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also think that the technology of public pay phones could be improved. I know this is part of the point that Senator Alston was making when he referred to credit card phones. There is a need to improve technology relating to public pay phones. What we see around the world demonstrates that there are better technologies available. With those qualifying remarks, we clearly see-as the Government obviously does-public pay phones as an integral part of the community service obligation, and we would not want to see them taken out of the jurisdiction of Telecom.

         —It is enlightening that the best that the Australian Democrats could do was ask a rhetorical question about the cost of public pay phones. They clearly do not have any real interest in the subject other than to extend the community service obligation involved. So I will ask that question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade--

         —If the Democrats are not interested in knowing what it costs, it is nice to understand that public debate should proceed on that basis. I find the cost an important factor in determining whether there is a burden to be borne by Telecom Australia; whether new technology, cheaper maintenance and a range of other facilities might dramatically reduce costs-not just to Telecom but to the consumer; and, to the point that there is a need for a subsidy, that that subsidy could be dramatically reduced.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The suggestion that somehow the poor will not benefit from a credit card arrangement strikes me as fairly bizarre, unless Senator Powell is suggesting that some people simply cannot help themselves and need to be protected by government. The fact is that if there is a consumer demand for the product it is not the responsibility of Telecom to deny that demand. In every other area of life there are those who can afford services before others. The fact that the middle classes might be in a position to afford video cassette recorders does not constitute discrimination against the poor, according to my definition of the word, any more than the fact that some people can afford to buy colour television sets when others make do with black and white, even though the latter may be small in number these days. The same goes for any form of new technology. To suggest that somehow that is socio- economic discrimination is cloud-cuckoo stuff. To the extent that the credit card revolution is able to reduce the cost of vandalism and the cost to consumers and taxpayers, I would have thought the Democrats would welcome that. To the extent that it generates surplus revenue which would then be available to improve the technology of blue phones, as we now see them, and other facilities that might be put in place, it is also in the consumer interest. To pretend that none of this brave new world stuff should take place because there might be some people who do not want, or even worse choose not to have, credit cards, I regard as economic and social nonsense.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask the Minister when he deigns to return to the table to indicate the accurate and reliable figure for the cost of public pay phones. It is a matter of serious community concern that Davidson was not satisfied on the subject. Presumably, the task force was not able to get an accurate figure on the subject. Again, we are simply asked to accept that this should be an area of monopoly protection when we have no sensible idea of what is involved: whether it needs to be a community service obligation at all; or whether overseas experience does not suggest that there might be a number of people who would be prepared to contract to provide public phones in economic and uneconomic areas. In other words, each individual contractor could accept an obligation to cross-subsidise within its own arrangements. There is nothing particularly novel about that. The Government could simply put out public telephones to tender. Any range of people could accept the tender. Part of the tender obligation is to provide public phones in certain areas determined by government. If some of those are stand-alone profit makers and others are loss makers, so be it. The tenderer has to decide at what price it is prepared to accommodate each of those arrangements. I regard that as rational, sensible and ultimately in the community interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        I invite the Minister to obtain, not necessarily immediately but in due course, an accurate assessment of the current cost of the pay phones that Telecom presently provides. I hope that we can have a bit more than a guesstimate when, at least, there has been quasi-scientific research done on the subject and that we will be given more than an approximate figure.

The cost of the pay phone community service obligation is being analysed in the current Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics study on costs, taking into account the cross-subsidies involved. That will be provided in due course. I cannot be more precise about it. We appreciate the significance and legitimacy of the question. I am not being impolite, but there is no point in making these figures up. It has been the subject of a lot of argument over a long time, as Senator Alston would be aware.

       <para>
        These amendments would add, after paragraph 35 (d), a further declaration of policy which would make it clear that the intention of the Parliament is that all telephone users in rural and remote areas should be able to make telephone calls free of charge to the nearest regional office of each Commonwealth government department or agency. These amendments are so blindingly obviously designed to accommodate those who might otherwise have difficulty in affording the cost of calls to such agencies as the Department of Social Security, the Commonwealth Employment Service and others that I would have thought the Australian Democrats would find it impossible to oppose them. This will be the acid test: if they are really interested in social equity and social justice, they will recognise the compelling virtue of the amendments. I do not think I need to say much more, other than that there are very many people in rural areas who find a discrimination against them when, quite often out of necessity to make inquiries of welfare agencies and the like, they make what for those in metropolitan areas would be a local call, but for the privilege of which they have to pay a long distance call charge. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Sheil for bringing this matter to my attention. Certainly it is deserving of support by us all.

         —The Government is fully appreciative of the special need of telephone users in rural and remote areas to have direct and reasonably priced telephone access to government agencies. Indeed, Telecom Australia has introduced a regional 008 service in addition to the Australia-wide and State-wide 008 services previously available. This will increasingly provide the means for organisations to be accessible to their rural and remote clients at the local call rate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The usage charge to organisations which lease the regional 008 service is less than that for the State-wide 008 service, as one would expect. Initially, the service is available to government departments and government authorities offering community services. It will progressively be made available to business organisations as existing network limitations are overcome, with the aim of its being generally available by 1991. Increasing availability of call diversion and distant exchange line facilities is an additional means, which it is worth mentioning at this point, for services not present in a remote centre to be accessible at a low cost to customers in and around that centre. So, of course, the principle of access is acknowledged and Telecom is doing something about it. The first port of call in doing something about it is creating a mechanism for use by government departments. Given these special arrangements that are already in place and which are being enhanced, as I have indicated, we do not consider it appropriate that we should legislate to provide free telephone calls to certain groups of people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill does specifically address the means by which community interests can make representations to Austel to ensure that the carriers meet their responsibility to provide access to their reserve services on an equitable basis. That is a further line of call for people who may have some lack of appreciation of the speed with which Telecom is moving to implement the region-wide system in a way that will meet the objectives to which Senator Alston refers. This is another example of just a little bit of grandstanding. We all acknowledge the desirability of the 008 services being applied. They are being applied in practice. The access is there. Senator Alston's amendment is not needed to produce that result.

         —I make an impassioned plea to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to reconsider-I am not just grandstanding-on the grounds of equity for people. One has to consider that a person in a city can ring the whole gamut of government departments for the price of a local call, but people in remote areas have to pay subscriber trunk dialling (STD) rates to do so and often have to wait, while listening to music, until they get through to the right person. That seems inequitable to me. Also, people in remote areas are really being taxed twice in this instance. The cost of putting up a building in the central business district of any metropolitan area is very high. Telephone subscribers in remote areas contribute towards that building through their taxes. But on top of that, they have to pay STD rates to make phone calls to government departments.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government is supposed to service all people. As has been mentioned in debate on a previous amendment, Telecom puts telephone boxes in remote places for the convenience of those people. Just on the ground of equity, I make the plea for 008 numbers to be provided. This was suggested to me by a most perspicacious constituent; it is not just an idea that has been promoted in order to grandstand and get publicity. If the Minister is worried about the cost of it, the equipment is already there. It is rather like the situation when a military campaign is written off. It does not cost any more to provide the service. If there were an additional cost involved, one can imagine that that would be offset by the equity provided to people in remote areas. The precedent has already been set for 008 numbers for the wives of Defence Force personnel. The Australian Taxation Office has 008 numbers, although it is rather peculiar that it may have an 008 number listed in the metropolitan telephone book, but not in regional ones. For example, it is not listed in the Gold Coast phone book that it has a 008 number for Brisbane calls.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that the Minister is saying that technical amendments are being made to improve the system. But I just cannot see, on the ground of equity alone, how the Government could not support an amendment such as this to give the people in the bush a chance to ring at a local call rate government departments that have a high degree of public contact. It is so easy for people in the cities to do that but so much harder and more costly for people in the bush. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Australian Democrats will not support this amendment just on the one ground of equity for rural people.

         —This is perhaps an example of part of the debate earlier in this chamber with regard to the question of who benefits and who is disadvantaged by privatisation. Clearly, if the Opposition were to have its way fully with this legislation and in other areas, the scenario would be that people in rural and remote areas would be disadvantaged because, clearly, their services would be the uneconomic ones which, under a user pays system, would cause those users to pay even more.

       <para>
        As we have already heard from honourable senators on both sides of the chamber, there are measures under way to increase the use of 008 services. I believe that those measures are supported by everybody in this chamber. It is interesting to ask a question that I have asked before, but this time I ask it of the Opposition. Has the Opposition costed this proposal-that is a question often asked of the Australian Democrats-and is there any perception in the moving of this amendment of the economic costs, since most of the other amendments we have been given here have been put on that basis?
       </para>
       <para>
        I have had personal experience of the cost of contacting most of the government departments which are not as yet using the service. Many of my constituents in rural areas who have to contact government departments, such as the Department of Social Security, rather than just the local regional offices-for example, in times of emergency-have found that it has become a much less expensive exercise since the extension of boundaries for subscriber trunk dialling (STD) calls and since those calls to community centres have been made on a more rational basis. Being conscious of costs, many departments call back clients who have left their names and given their numbers. I think this is something which could be done in the meantime. While it is important to encourage the development of the sort of process which is taking place, I do not believe it is an area in which we should legislate. We must accept the fact that the technology is under way and that it is a process which will be implemented by government departments as they find it necessary. It is already being implemented, as Senator Sheil has said.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should also encourage more offices of governments to become more regionalised. On that principle there would be fewer costs. Normally the more heavily used client contact departments, such as the Department of Social Security, the Department of Community Services and Health and so on, are regionalised to a greater degree. Given the STD boundary changes and the community call changes which have taken place, the impost for most people is not quite as high. I have contacted some people in the remote areas where it is high, and they have told me they have had no problem in getting the Department to call them back so that they could then discuss their problem at the Department's expense, which is clearly what the amendment is designed to do.

         —I do not think I have ever heard such woolly thinking as that which we have just heard from the Australian Democrats. I also believe that the stance taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has been totally inconsistent. For example, would the Democrats knock back a 008 number to the electorate offices of senators if that was what was offered to them to enable their constituents to make appropriate inquiries? Let me assure honourable senators that that offer has just been made to me by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West). It has also been made to a number of honourable senators who need to service people from rural and remote communities. In order to service our constituents' needs properly a 008 number will be installed in our electorate offices in the near future-in fact, those negotiations are currently under way. The Minister for Administrative Services has authorised it, has accepted the need for it and has in fact put it in place.

        Senator Powell mentioned that there were a number of service phone numbers for various departments that already need to utilise the 008 facility. We are well aware that such needs arise for rape crisis centres, women's referral centres or social welfare oriented organisations and groups. Most of those receive a Commonwealth government subsidy for their operation, and the Government is happy to pick up the cost of the installations in that regard. I believe that this is a matter of consistency. The Government should accept that there is a need for servicing the community. The proposals that have been promoted for some time by Senator Sheil, both through questions in this place and through notices of motion, and in a number of other proposals, can only mean an improvement of government services and answerability and accountability to the community generally.

         —Before I depart this chamber and, with a bit of luck, these shores, I would like to say a few words. What the Opposition is seeking is a massive increase in the extent and cost of Telecom Australia's community service obligations. I was reasonably polite about the impact of the amendments and how the issues that they raise might be otherwise addressed. But at the end of the day this is what it really comes down to: the proposed amendments are totally at odds with the rest of the Opposition's approach to this in terms of effective commercial operation, and they are totally at odds with Senator Alston's views on that substance. There is a degree of terrible political cynicism about these amendments in terms of the way in which they have been moved. Whilst I do not want to be other than gentlemanly in my normal appreciation of Senator Alston's motives in raising issues about telecommunications, where I know he has a deep, intense and abiding passion to do the right thing for reasons of high principle, I think he was nodding just a little when it came to moving these amendments. The issues he is concerned about are effectively being addressed in practice. To put in this sort of proposal would be to cut across any effective capacity for the sort of commercial operation that we are talking about, for the price of winning just a few passing super- ficial plaudits. We accordingly reject the amendments.

         —His usual hyperbolic approach. I wish to respond to some of the comments made by the Australian Democrats, because I regard them as breathtaking in their cynicism. The Democrats have said that, because the costs of technology in delivering some of these services are falling, that then becomes a reason why we should not hasten the process, no matter how worthwhile it might be to do so, no matter how deserving people's needs might be, no matter how much it makes obvious commonsense and no matter that the Government is already in the process of implementing them. In other words, on this one occasion the Democrats are arguing that technology will take care of the problem and that over time costs will reduce to the point where these services are affordable. This is completely at odds with their social approach to all these other issues, where they are constantly pleading for special benefits and for concessions to be made to those who might have economic difficulty in otherwise affording these services, yet they are prepared to put forward these half-baked proposals irrespective of cost. That they then have the cheek to suggest to us that somehow we should address the question of cost when the Government itself has indicated that Telecom is in the process of introducing these sorts of arrangements I find hypocritical in the extreme. All we are seeking is for the Parliament to declare its intention. That would then provide Telecom with a bolster that would enable it to deliver on the program that Senator Evans has said is already in place.

If we have any comprehension of what is involved in amending legislation, surely we know that, if we move to strengthen an Act in a particular place, that remains the change to the legislation, irrespective of what changes might be made elsewhere or what another government might do to that Act at another time. For the time being, the amendment that we propose-like the one we proposed last night-would strengthen the current Act. That seems to be what the Democrats say in all their rhetoric, but when it comes to the crunch it is the very sort of thing they reject on the unholy ground that somehow we have a hidden agenda.

        I do not want to have to say it again and again: we are concerned about delivering efficient and effective telecommunications services at the lowest possible cost. I do not regard privatisation as a high priority area in achieving that aim. I do regard competition-and therefore deregulation-as very important in driving down the cost of those services and at the same time ensuring that we can deliver to those in need by cross-subsidy arrangements. Certainly, that can be done not only, as the Democrats suggest, by off-budget subvention but just as easily by a levy on all telecommunications users. To suggest that, somehow, the fact that at some time people talk about the privatisation of Telecom is an excuse for rejecting something that one would otherwise wholeheartedly support on the merits strikes me as extraordinary and as forfeiting any respect in this place on these issues. We will therefore be dividing on this amendment to expose the hypocrisy of the Democrats' approach.

This amendment highlights the policy commitment that telephone users-and I stress the word `users'-in rural and remote areas should be able to make telephone calls free of charge to the nearest regional office of government departments or agencies. As Senator Sheil has pointed out on a number of occasions, the use of 008 numbers is envisaged. My understanding of the increased facility and technology that is available is that the use of a 008 number might not be free of charge but is in effect subject to a local call charge to the agency or the department that the user may be seeking to call: the consumer or the user in the remote area makes a call at a local charge; the additional costs are then picked up by the department or the person who is registered as the holder of that 008 number.

        Therefore, there would be no loss of revenue to Telecom Australia in the operation of the intent of this amendment and it would greatly assist people in rural and remote areas of Australia. For example, let me point out that in the Northern Territory there are dozens of Aboriginal communities where it is necessary for Aboriginal citizens to make extensive use of Telecom services in dealing with government departments and agencies such as the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Community Services and Health. I can assure honourable senators that those Aboriginal constituents in the Northern Territory do not like standing at public telephone boxes with dozens of coins listening to the recorded music while they wait for departments to engage in their discussions or, alternatively, as Senator Sheil pointed out, in the expectation that there will be departmental easy returns. Often the people dealing with those departments have to go through a number of referral agencies within the department before they can get the appropriate services that they require.

        I believe the intent of this amendment to strike at the very provision of policy, to provide for telephone users in these remote areas to be able to make those calls, is the important issue that is at stake. I am surprised that we do not enjoy the support of the Democrats on this amendment.

To the telephone user a 008 call is definitely a free of charge call, just as Senator Tambling has pointed out. However, I simply asked-I was not complaining-whether the Opposition had costed this amendment. I did so because so often I have been asked that myself, and I am interested to know the cost to the economy-that wonderful economy which Senator Alston wants to help so much by his deregulation and the privatisation which somehow he seems to be walking away from this afternoon. I just asked a question, and it has not been answered. I think that is interesting. It is not a cost I object to. I am promoting a free of charge system in the form of a reverse charge system. As I have said, it is encouraging that the 008 system is proliferating. It is a system which needs to take its time to proliferate as government departments organise themselves to use it. That is prefectly appropriate. In the meantime, I have not ever had a call of complaint from a Department of Social Security recipient to my office saying that a reverse charge call to the department had been refused.

Having been in my office and listened to the Australian Democrats' version of the 008 system, I thought I had better come into the chamber and throw in my bit. From what the Democrats have said about the 008 system, it is obvious that either they do not know what they are talking about or they have never been in areas where they need to use it. The Democrats have no representation from remote areas, and that is quite obvious from what they have said about 008 numbers.

       <para>
        Contrary to what Senator Powell has said, the 008 system is far more widespread than she imagines. She spoke about technology coming on, but what new technology is involved with the 008 system? As far as I know, it has existed in the United States of America for the last 30 years, and in Australia for 10 years or more. It was brought in mainly by private enterprise in the first place. The big hotels in the accommodation industry have had it for a long time. Even Government departments have had it for a long time. Parliament House in Western Australia has had it for at least five years. One can ring one's member of parliament from way out in the country at the cost of a local call. Even the State taxation department in Western Australia has had it for many years. It was always a pleasure to ring at government expense that Department to complain about one's tax valuations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Living in a remote area, I know how important that is. The Australian Democrats have tried to sell us the idea of the reverse charge system, but they have not told us about any costings of their own and they want to know whether we have done any costings. Living in a remote area, I have had plenty of experience of paying phone bills. I know that any operator connected calls made through the reverse charge system, or calls made through the operator as opposed to using subscriber trunk dialling (STD) cost nearly twice as much. There is a minimum time charge of three minutes. The person wanted may not be available. On a reverse charge call, the receiving end does not have to accept it. In the reverse charge system, one cannot nominate the person to whom one wishes to speak. If a reverse charge call is made to a government department, that department will probably accept the call and then it has to start hunting around looking for the right person.

         —Senator, do not go on about that one too much. The departments still take their time. He is probably at his morning or afternoon tea break. By the time it is discovered that he is not there, a bill would have been run up for a minimum of three minutes; if one slips over that three minutes, one has to pay for six minutes. That would be far beyond the cost of a call to a 008 number, which costs the subscriber the price of a local call, the rest being picked up by the department. The cost of a call to a 008 number starts from when the phone is picked up, not from when someone has run round looking for the person the caller wants to speak to. It is far less costly to have a 008 number than it is to receive reverse charge calls. Further, having a 008 number with STD dialling is far more convenient.

        ``36. It is the intention of the Parliament that the carriers should have the exclusive right to supply public switched telephone services.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment seeks to omit all those reserved services that are specified in the clause other than that in paragraph (a), which is public switched telephone services. What this is about is quite simple. Accepting the Government's present approach and accepting the pseudo-justification that is constantly put forward for the maintenance of the monopoly, it makes sense in those terms to allow Telecom Australia to remain a monopoly provider of the basic telephone service. But it is another thing altogether then to attempt to justify the monopoly on the basis of non-core services, some of which are entirely commercial, for which it is not appropriate at all that Telecom should have the exclusive right to provide. We would not have any objection to Telecom being a competitor for those services, but it is my understanding that public switched data services and text and video services are not big revenue earners for Telecom. They could not conceivably affect Telecom's economic capacity to deliver its community service obligations or to provide revenue to support the burden of the cross-subsidies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Integrated services digital networks (ISDN) is a classic area of gold plating in which Telecom is desperately keen to sink many millions of dollars. The numbers I have seen recently suggest that it wants to spend something like $200m over the next few years on ISDN and perhaps up to $1,000m over the next decade. Again, that is a very big commercial decision. That is going to cost Telecom money. It has nothing to do at this stage of the game with providing any excess revenue to support the monopoly and, therefore, it is not a service that needs to be protected by way of reserved services. Leased circuit services, again, go to the heart of the monopoly in one sense, but there is no doubt that ultimately it is a very inefficient way of providing for the operation of leased circuit services to insist that they be provided only by a monopolist. Therefore, we take the view that they provide an opportunity to introduce competition into that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as public mobile telephone services are concerned, that is little more than a scandal. It is an area in which the task force itself could see no justification until it was bludgeoned over the head by the Government and the Caucus Liaison Committee. It eventually came up with a compromise that would allow Telecom to retain the monopoly rights for the time being, subject to a review by Austel, which, hopefully, will take place in the not too distant future. But it is indefensible. If one looks at international experience, one sees that in almost every Western country there are at least two providers of the cellular mobile telephone service. Public mobile telephone services, being a generic term beyond that, are in dramatic demand, which Telecom is not currently able to meet. Its wants to spend a lot of money to try to keep this area of activity to itself and there are a number of competitors very anxious to get into the game. The result of their entry would be that the cost of these services would be driven down dramatically. The costs in the United States I think are approximately 40 per cent cheaper than they are in Australia at the present time. There is no reason to doubt that those kinds of efficiencies could be achieved here in due course, once other competitors are allowed into the market. Our amendment, therefore, would involve stripping the monopoly areas back to the basic network, which is what Telecom is supposed to be all about. If it wants to get into all of those other areas, let it do so on a competitive basis. Let us talk about ways and means of maintaining the cross-subsidy arrangement but it does not need to be done under the transparent guise of a monopoly over a whole range of areas which do not presently generate much revenue at all for Telecom.

         —The Government, of course, opposes this amendment as it would restrict the scope of the carrier reserved services to public switched telephone services. As we announced in May 1988, the carriers are to be provided with continued regulatory protection of their monopolies in specific services, and the criterion we used in terms of which ones should be protected was essentially that the question had to be asked whether opening them to competition at this moment would impose excessive adjustment burdens on the carriers or on their customers. On the basis of those already stated policy objectives of the Government, we oppose the amendment of Senator Alston.

        This is an amendment to clause 39, which provides the exceptions to the reservation of networks to the carriers. As it is presently worded, clause 39 (b) provides that there shall not be exclusive control over:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a telecommunications network operated, or intended to be operated, by the Australian National Railways Commission or a State or Territory transport authority. . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Our concern is that there are State and presumably Territory governments that provide various forms of competitive services, sometimes uneconomic in the strict sense, through their acceptance of their own community service obligations. We take the view that the States must be allowed to capitalise on their investments in communications networks and be able to establish improved communications facilities. The current provisions of the clause would preclude State and Territory governments from using existing networks, such as railway lines, and establishing additional facilities for their use in order to deliver essential services to the community. We therefore move the amendment in order to enable those State and Territory governments to continue to provide telecommunications services that might otherwise be exclusively the preserve of the carriers.

So it has that particular problem associated with it. But the policy position of the Government is that we believe that existing arrangements should be allowed to continue.

        That arises from a concern we have that, as presently worded, the existing holders of commercial television and broadcasting licences would be able to provide pay television. We believe that that is not what the Government has in mind. Indeed as Senator Lewis's press release made clear that would be pre-empting the decision on the Future Directions document and the Minister's statement that we expect to be forthcoming shortly. Therefore on that basis we think it is necessary to clarify that position by inserting:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . in accordance with the Broadcasting Act 1942 or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 as the case may be, . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        If that is done it will mean that Telecom's exclusive rights to provide television networks will not extend to the activities of the commercial radio and television networks. This provision would otherwise enable the networks to become the prime providers of pay television services and exclude newcomers. We do not believe that that is a desirable or, indeed, a policy approach or the approach that the Government has in mind.

         —In brief: we on the Government side understand the intention of Senator Alston's amendment. However we feel it is unnecessary. In essence what we have under clause 39 is the facilitation of the continuation of the network. The services to be provided, however, are governed by other parts of the Bill. We do not see-not only because of this particular Bill but also because of other legislation, for instance, the Radio Communications Act 1983-that the carriers will be allowed to introduce pay television. As a consequence we think that the proposed amendment is not necessary.

        ``(1a) AUSTEL shall monitor the boundaries of the public switched network and recommend to the Minister such changes as it considers appropriate.''.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are both amendments to subclause (1) of clause 42. They would delete the words `or any other network' and insert after subclause 42 (1):
       </para>
       <para>
        AUSTEL shall monitor the boundaries of the public switched network and recommend to the Minister such changes as it considers appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        We take the view that the Government's approach involves giving Austel the charter of protecting the boundaries of the network but that it should not simply be confined to doing that. It should have a pro-competitive charter. More importantly, whilst we accept that regulations might provide for determining the boundaries of public switched telephone networks we cannot see how there can be any justification for extending that to any other network. Again it seems to be a backdoor approach which might be innocuous on the surface but would have a far reaching effect. It is bad enough protecting the monopolies but being able to eat away at any other network would give the Government an absolute power to limit or cripple any new or existing network. We are not clear what the Government has in mind by inserting those words. We seek to delete them. We hope that Austel's monitoring activities would be confined to the basic networks. If the Minister is not in a position to respond I would ask him at least to come back to us on the question on what is intended by the words `or any other network' in clause 42 (1).

         —Generally the Government opposes both proposed amendments. With respect to the first one we see a need for flexibility to respond to technological changes in this particular area. The amendment may not intend it but its direct result would hamper the proper, efficient and flexible administration which we have in telecommunications policy. With respect to the second amendment, clause 22 allows Austel a specific function of monitoring and reporting on the appropriateness of the boundaries between the reserved and the competitive facilities and services. As a consequence we do not see the proposed amendment will add anything to that. The particular role that Senator Alston wants to have accommodated as an advisory role will in fact be monitored under clause 22. Senator Alston asked for further information.

        Amendment No. 17 is a machinery provision. The substantive amendment is to insert a new clause 43 (5) which would provide that:

       <para>
        A carrier may arrange for another person to supply, install or maintain equipment, lines and other facilities that are connected to, and within the boundaries of, a telecommunications network operated by the carrier.

       <para>
        The effect of that would be to enable Telecom to contract out without needing the approval of Austel and to limit Telecom's exclusive right to supply, install and maintain telecommunications facilities. We do not see why Telecom should have any God given right to provide those services especially if they can be delivered at a lower cost by private contractors. We would therefore like a specific provision to that effect.

There are provisions already within the Bill to allow for assignation of the rights that Senator Alston is concerned about. I do not think that adding this particular clause adds anything further. If Senator Alston is concerned about whether the carrier can in fact assign some of these exclusive rights, the short answer is that there is nothing in the Bill that prevents it from doing that.

        This amendment refers to Telecom's veto power. Clause 46 (3) provides that Austel shall not grant an authorisation for the provision of facilities within the boundary of a network without first seeking the approval of the carrier. We regard that as quite unjustified and unnecessary. Austel should make the decision based on the economics of the industry. The public interest is best served by it making an independent judgment. It should not be beholden to Telecom. There are no guidelines or conditions provided that would give any assistance to Austel and there is nothing specified to indicate on what basis Telecom should be entitled to lodge an objection. We see this as the ultimate in an abuse of power. We do not see any reason why the carrier should have that absolute right of veto and we therefore propose the deletion of clause 46 (3) (a).

I would like to say, in respect of this amendment, that the Australian Democrats are somewhat relieved that it has been determined that Telecom should be the basic network. It seems to us, in this instance in particular, along with a number of others, that it is appropriate on that basis that the legislation should stand. Much to our relief, given the policy decision that we should have a national network-I believe that most of the industry is in favour of that policy-off which the private sector will feed and make a profit and given that this network is part of the national infrastructure and ought to be recognised as being important for that reason, if for no other, then it is appropriate that Austel should have this kind of voice in the authorisation process wherever facilities within the boundaries of that network are being proposed.

       <para>
        Amendment No. 23 is a machinery provision. Amendment No. 24, to clause 55, introduces a new provision that the regulations shall not provide for or in relation to service delivery standards in such a way that value added services directly or indirectly become reserved services. What we have in mind there is keeping the Government honest. We do not want the goalpost being moved so that the boundary line is extended outwards so that value added services suddenly become yet another area of monopoly protection. We do not want to see value added services turned into reserved services under the guise of technical standards.

They would have the significant effect of severely limiting the community service obligation process, or any flexibility, development or growth in the community service obligation definition over time. I reiterate that our concern about the need for community service obligations to be in a sense evolutionary is reflected by the public view as is currently being determined by a pilot project of research by Telecom itself, which no doubt in time will become a public exercise. We certainly look forward to that.

        Amendment No. 25 is a tidying up amendment. The heading of the clause suggests that Telecom should not have an exclusive right to supply satellite-based services but the clause omits the term `satellite-based'. We think that that is a significant omission. We presume that it is unintentional, but we want to make it clear that Telecom has no exclusive right to deliver satellite services and facilities, that that is the exclusive preserve of Aussat under this legislation. We believe that the clause should reflect the heading.

       <para>
        Amendment No. 26 would include proposed sections 18 and 23 in clause 68. It refers to directions that Austel might give to the carriers in relation to the supply of reserved services. We believe that the clause omits Austel's ability to give general directions under clause 18 and that it should allow Austel to give those directions as to its general functions. We also believe that it should have the ability to give directions to the carriers in relation to technical regulations. If it is able to do that, it will be able to ensure that the scheme of the legislation is complied with by the carriers. As it is presently worded, the clause is selective and, therefore, defective.

       <para>
        The amendment seeks to introduce the expression `or proposed technical standards' into clause 68 (2) (a). As it is presently worded, the direction may require a carrier to publish or otherwise make available certain technical standards. We take the view that the carrier should be required to publish any proposed technical standards which it might have in mind. Otherwise it can ambush its competitors. We think there is a need to ensure that all suppliers are provided with timely and advance notice of network standards and information. Otherwise the carriers are unfairly advantaged through their access to infrastructure and formation which assists or is capable of assisting their non-competitive services. Therefore, we would like to ensure a level playing field in that manner, so that ultimately all the players are put on an equal footing.

        This amendment seeks to delete the whole of part 4-in other words, clauses 70 to 104-which deals with value added services and private network services. The Opposition has in mind that there should be another less intrusive and less interventionist regulatory regime. Rather than requiring any person interested in having a new service licence to apply for a variation of a class licence, Austel would simply monitor the situation and, where necessary, would be empowered to call on new applicants to show cause why they should not be prohibited from providing new services and facilities. Obviously, such people would need to be given an opportunity to be heard and to argue why their service should not be declared a reserved service. Ultimately, such persons should have automatic rights of appeal, by way of requiring Austel to reconsider the matter, and ultimately to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Austel would be empowered to order disconnections or to refuse to allow new connections. It would be able to order a reconnection if for any reason the service had already been disconnected or if it had ordered a disconnection, pending the hearing of a matter and was then not satisfied that any offence had been committed. We do not believe that any irreparable harm would flow from such an approach. It is technically feasible to connect and disconnect both value added services and private network services.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe there is a fundamental difference of approach between what we propose and what the Government has in mind. As the current regime is worded, it would require Austel to become involved in the minutaie of licences where there is no danger of any interference with the reserve services and-as it is expressed in the United States-no harm to the network. In most instances such new services would be uncontroversial and there would be no potential infringements against the basic network. The Government's regime is a classic bureaucratic solution which would require every new applicant to obtain a variation to a class licence and be put through a whole range of procedures which would no doubt require the usual mountain of paperwork and perhaps even the retention of expensive lawyers in order to ensure that Austel was ultimately satisfied. We regard that as an inefficient and costly approach and one that is not necessary. The hands-off approach, which would be just as effective, would give Austel the overriding power to monitor the situation and to intervene only where necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end of the day we do not see that there are many fly-by-night operators likely to be attracted to the telecommunications industry. Those who are in the game are there to make a profit, to operate in the medium to long term and to turn a dollar over a period. It is very difficult to imagine that anyone would deliberately set out to sabotage the network and his own reputation or to try to flout both the spirit and the letter of the boundary provisions for basic network services. Of course, it would always be possible for someone so minded to commit an act of sabotage, whether or not a licence had been or was about to be granted. The mere requirement for legal formalities does not provide any additional protection. We see this clause as a quite unnecessary layer of regulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our amended clause 81 would require the carriers to provide equal access and a level of network functionality to all aspects of the basic network. It would require that preferential information and access not be given to the carriers' own competitive enterprise but that there be fairness between competitors. Our proposed new clause 82 (3) is very important. The carriers would be required to publish a statement of any bulk discounts, rules, or variations, which must be cost based and equally available to all. We believe that there is some blurring in the Government's provisions that does not satisfy the demands of the industry or consumers for transparency in this area, and we think it is necessary that those specific obligations should be placed on the carriers. It is important, if there are problems, that the carriers apprehend them. The carriers would be empowered to approach the Federal Court and obtain injunctions to restrain any abuse of the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, we consider that the current provisions in relation to transparency are inadequate and that in addition the three areas in which the carriers-Telecom in particular-would be required to maintain accounts and records should be supplemented by additional requirements which would enable the ready identification of the cost of Telecom meeting its community service obligations and the cost of and prices charged for reserved services used in the carrier's competitive activities. Unless those provisions are explicitly contained, we believe there is scope for fudging the issue. We do not believe that it will then be possible to ascertain, with any degree of accuracy, the nature and extent and, most importantly, the cost burden of Telecom's CSOs. We do not believe it will be possible to ensure that there is no economic cross-subsidisation between Telecom's reserved and competitive services.
       </para>
       <para>
        We regard the amendments as very necessary and important. They would provide all the necessary protections that we believe are essential, but at the same time they would do away with much of the unnecessary bureaucracy and paperwork that is clearly involved in the Government's approach. No doubt it is inspired by the Department, which always likes to keep control of these matters, and no doubt Telecom itself has a vested interest in ensuring that it has advance notice. The real vice, of course, is that, having created this bureaucratic solution, it is necessary to impose licence fees on all applications for variation in order to fund the very regime that is unnecessary in the first place. We regard this approach as imposing unnecessary and costly burdens which can be done away with without any detriment to the consumers and replaced by adequate safeguards which will be just as effective.

         —The Government believes that the class licence proposal is a simple concept. The system legitimises a range of services without requiring each operator to apply for an individual licence. We see that as a consequence of that there will not be the costly and burdensome practice of individual licensing. We also see that it will allow automatic approval to all currently recognised value added services. We anticipate that the means of amending a class licence to recognise new services will be flexible and open. Class licences, therefore, cover all services provided in accordance with specified conditions, and compliance with those conditions confers an automatic right to offer the services.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think Senator Alston covered the point, but the licensing of these value added services using a class licence mechanism will give us a simple means of ensuring that value added services do not intrude on the monopoly services reserved for both Telecom Australia and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. As a consequence, this should be able to protect the cross-subsidy capacity of Telecom to fund its community service obligations. It should also protect OTC's revenue so that OTC can meet its ongoing commitment to fully fund Australia's international network facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        We see the licence system also being used to protect the rights of private providers of value added services from anticompetitive behaviour by carriers in the value added services market. We as a government cannot agree to the removal of the class licence mechanism for a number of reasons. As the Senate would know, in May 1988 the Government announced in a ministerial statement entitled `Australian Telecom- munications Services: A New Framework' that Austel should protect the reserved services and ensure that the introduction of genuine value added services is not inhibited unreasonably by the activities of the carriers. To reverse that would have a number of consequences. First, it would be an act of bad faith with industry. Secondly, without the licensing mechanism-I am sure honourable senators will agree-Austel would have difficulty in ensuring that in an industry which is dominated by statutory monopolies the supply of value added services is opened to full competition. We see the class licence mechanism as having the advantage of being minimalist in its regulatory procedures. As part of the system, regulatory requirements are met automatically without the need for individual licensing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also ask the Committee to note that the option in the amendment relating to declarations of services that are reserved would require the continual examination of individual services on an ad hoc basis to determine the nature of the value added input, if any, with the consequent potential for bottlenecks in the decision-making process. Through the class licence mechanism and the variation procedures that are available within it, we have a simple means of advising changes to the conditions under which services may be provided, including the liberalisation of technical conditions relating to the network functions. The value in the class licence system is that it provides a highly visible means of imposing specific regulatory requirements on the carriers. Their visibility is quite important. The requirements relate to carriers when they operate in the value added and private network services market. For those reasons and for the principle that we see the class licensing system as a much more flexible and open one, we do not accept Senator Alston's alternative proposal.

       <para>
        Amendment No. 29 would involve the inclusion in the objects in part 4 of an additional paragraph `to regulate the manner in which information relating to customer use of reserved services is controlled'. This amendment is designed to ensure that the carriers do not take unfair advantage of sensitive information gained via their reserved services. It seeks to ensure a level playing field for value added services and private network services in an area where Telecom Australia is able to compete. It also reflects our desire to give Austel a charter to regulate the use of such information and to protect competitors from unfair carrier practices.

Clause 20 most particularly refers to the general functions of Austel, one of which is the protection of competition from unfair practices of carriers.

        Amendment No. 32 will impose a 21-day time limit for Austel to notify carriers of class licence applications to enable the carriers to express a view on harms to the network and any monopoly infringements. We consider that it is desirable to impose a time limit rather than allow Austel simply to have an unlimited period of time in which to consider the application. Amendment No. 33 imposes a 48-hour time limit for Austel to accept the application. Amendment No. 34 reverses the consequences of a failure by Austel to consider the application in time. It would turn a deemed refusal into a deemed approval. We regard this as very necessary. It would impose a discipline upon Austel. The only reason why Austel would not be able to comply with these obligations would be if the government chose not to provide it with adequate funding. We think it would be a very useful way of ensuring that the government delivers the goods. We think it is intolerable than an applicant should fail by default-through no fault of its own-and in those circumstances it is only right and proper that, in the event that Austel is not able to deal with the matter within a set period of time, the application should be treated as having been approved.

We ask the Senate to take into account that the Government will be monitoring very closely the operation of Austel.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We also note that in its operations the Government has made Austel accountable for its decisions. One of the grounds of accountability, through appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, will be to protect natural justice for persons who make applications to Austel. Given this regime of accountability together with the Government's commitment to monitor the operations of Austel and the excessive administrative burdens and constraints that arise out of amendments Nos 32, 33 and 34, the Government is opposed to these amendments.

        Amendment No. 35 is simply another provision that would reverse the onus so that any application for the variation of an existing licence would be deemed to be approved at the expiration of the period which is allowed under the Act for such consideration. We believe that if it is not approved in that time, that is not the fault of the applicant and the variation should be deemed to be approved.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment No. 35a would allow Austel to reconsider an application for a class licence variation. It is difficult to imagine that the Government has deliberately set out to restrict the rights of applicants for class licence variations, and this amendment would simply bring the structure of the Act in line so that an additional class of persons would have the entitlement to have Austel reconsider the position. Amendment No. 35b would then allow for an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should it become necessary to do so.

        Amendment No. 37 seeks to delete clause 94 (2). This provides for a value added service or a private network service not to be taken to be supplied under a class licence even though no declaration in respect of the service has been given or has effect under section 91. That seems to us to be quite a nonsensical provision because it effectively allows Austel to disregard all of the provisions that precede the presumably considered making of a declaration. We wish to know why it is that in that situation Austel should be in a position where it can simply ignore the declaration. We ask the Minister accordingly to explain that provision.

         —Amendment No. 37, as Senator Alston says, would remove an option for services to be taken as not complying with class licences even though no declaration has been issued. The Government sees the removal of this subclause as limiting Austel's range of actions to deal in a timely manner with services not complying with the appropriate class licensing system. As a consequence, of the effect of the amendment, we oppose it.

         —Regarding amendment No. 38, we consider it very important that there should be equality of access to information and that there should be an explicit prohibition on carriers providing or making use of reserved services information for their competitive activities. In other words, we think it is necessary to establish and formalise a Chinese wall. We do not accept that Telecom can be relied upon simply to accumulate a whole batch of information obtained in the course of operating its reserved services and yet somehow not make that available to its own divisions engaged in competitive activities. History is replete with examples of this happening and we think it necessary that there should be explicit legislative restraints on future activities of that sort.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to amendment No. 39, we think it is necessary that there should be a public disclosure of any discounting arrangements to ensure, once again, that Telecom's competitive activities are conducted in a normal commercial manner, that they are priced according to cost and that they are equally available to all. Otherwise, we consider that there is a very real danger that Telecom will do what it has done in the past, and that is, provide deep discounts in order to gain contracts under the specious justification of somehow complying with its community service obligations but, in fact, taking unfair decisions that, if it were competing in an open market, would be subject to scrutiny by the Trade Practices Commission. We think it is necessary that there be a full disclosure of any discounting arrangements so that the community at large can judge whether Telecom is indeed providing services at a competitive price.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to amendment No. 40. We believe that it is necessary for parties to be able to approach both Austel and subsequently an arbitrator in order to resolve any disputes that may arise. We do not believe that that facility should be available only to the carrier. We think that that is a one-sided solution and that the only fair and equitable approach to be adopted is to allow all parties who are aggrieved by the decision to apply to the Federal Court.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not wish to canvass amendment No. 41 in any greater detail. I think I have made it clear previously that we regard the transparency arrangements as necessary to ensure that the cost of Telecom's community service obligations is explicit. It is not sufficient simply to specify the cost of its activities relating to the supply by the carrier of public reserved services or leased circuit services. We think that it is necessary to ensure that fundamental dichotomy between reserved services and competitive services. To the extent that there is still any lack of clarity about the cost of Telecom's community service obligations arising from either the Bureau's study or any other disclosed information in the annual reports or elsewhere, we want an explicit accounting requirement that the cost of CSOs is made clear.

         —I think that amendments Nos 38 to 41 can be responded to together. We see the amendments as being unnecessary and somewhat repetitious. Clause 68 of the Bill gives Austel the power to require carriers to publish, or otherwise make available, information relating to or derived from reserved services. The general provision in clause 98 is geared towards attacking discrimination in the area about which Senator Alston is concerned. Clauses 68 (b) (ii) and 68 (b) (iii), for instance, give Austel the power to require a carrier to publish the discounts available in relation to reserved services and the terms and conditions on which such discounts are supplied.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is a requirement in proposed amended clause 98 (3) (b) that carrier discounts have to be cost based and available on an equal basis to all. Basically, we see Senator Alston's amendments as being unnecessary. As I have said, Austel's powers under clauses 68 and 98 will ensure that publication is made and that competitors are protected from unfair practices. One could also refer the Committee to clauses 20 and 21, which strengthen the need not to adopt Senator Alston's amendments in that that anti-competitive behaviour is addressed in those clauses as well.

        We regard it as important that it should not be just Austel which determines technical standards but that commercial operators should be empowered to initiate or request such standards. Amendment No. 44 would enable a request to Austel to be acted upon within a set time with a power for reconsideration. Amendment No. 45 would enable an appeal on technical standards to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Amendments Nos 46 and 47 are consequential machinery provisions.

         —The Government opposes these amendments. We see that Austel does have a role in encompassing the whole question of technical standards. We see Austel's function, as stated in clause 23, as ensuring the safety and quality of services, and standards come within that. The Government also sees very clearly that Austel would be failing in its statutory duty if it did not respond promptly to any legitimate requests for a new standard to be made. As a consequence, therefore, we do not see the need for the amendments.

       <para>
        As it is currently expressed, division 4 provides for an elaborate regime of permits for customer premise equipment. We believe that that is not necessary and that there are ways in which the area can be supervised by providing punishment for wilful breach of technical standards. It should not, however, apply to competitive services. Presumably no rational competitor would want to cause harm to the network. On that basis we believe that the regime as set out is unnecessarily bureaucratic. It provides yet another justification for the imposition of fees which becomes a self-defeating exercise. We do not see the need for this type of approach.

         —The Government opposes the amendment. We see it as gutting division 4 of part 5 of the legislation, a division which is geared towards protecting retailers, suppliers and consumers. The provision obliges equipment suppliers to obtain a permit before they can conduct themselves in the market. If the Opposition amendment were carried there would be inadequate regulation of the area-it would be deregulation gone wild-with consequent risk, as I said earlier, to retailers, suppliers and consumers. We see the system of accreditation as being one which is fundamental to ensuring that those interests are protected. Accordingly, we oppose the amendment.

We are saying that the regime that we are proposing in the Bill is geared towards protecting retailers, suppliers and consumers. We are also saying that, as part of the Austel arrangement, Austel will take over the regulation of the permit system and will be expected to conduct this part of its operations with minimal delay. We see that this system of permits is one that should be followed in order to ensure that the equipment is of a safe and adequate standard. We also ask that the chamber take into account that Austel will be able to accredit manufacturers to self-certify their equipment, thus speeding up the whole process. So what we are talking about is a system which has a regime to ensure certain standards but which also has the flexibility to allow for self-regulation to a minimal extent.

We are talking about private sector suppliers and a public sector network, a network which Senator Alston has actually threatened in moving earlier amendments to enable the development of private networks much more readily than the legislation will allow. So I find those comments rather extraordinary. We do not support this amendment, but I felt it worth commenting on this occasion.

        ``(4) AUSTEL shall publish guidelines which shall describe the knowledge, qualifications and experience required by an applicant for a cabling licence under subsection (1).''.

       <para>
        Clause 130 involves applications for cabling licences. It is yet another example of unnecessary regulation. There is no reason at all why there should be a need for cabling licences any more than there ought to be a need for permits to be granted to suppliers and manufacturers of customer premise equipment. Cabling licences are simply a means of keeping a finger on every person who operates in the industry. There is no reason to presume the worst about persons who are providing cabling equipment or, indeed, carrying out cabling operations. We see this as yet another example of a bureaucratic solution to a problem which could just as easily be solved by Austel monitoring the industry and taking action where necessary against potential offenders.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment No. 49 would add the following sub-subclause:
       </para>
       <para>
        Austel shall publish guidelines which shall describe the knowledge, qualifications and experience required by an applicant for a cabling licence under subsection (1).
       </para>
       <para>
        So if it is necessary for a licence to be issued at all, at least persons should know in advance what the qualifications and criteria might be. If this is done, one would hope that there would be a minimum of bureaucratic intervention and a minimum of paperwork. But I, for one, do not have any confidence that that will be the case. Therefore we think that, at the very least, it makes sense that there should be a public indication of the minimum requirements for applicants for licences.

       <para>
        The scheme of clause 131 is that Austel may include conditions in a cabling licence which would require customer cabling in relation to which the licensee has performed cabling work to be inspected. We do not see why that inspection should be carried out by the carriers or Austel. There is no reason at all why it cannot be carried out by private contractors, either under supervision or reporting arrangements with Austel or simply of their own accord by private arrangement with the licensee. It provides yet another monopoly guarantee to the carriers who will no doubt as a result of this clause, if it is carried, need to have a separate division to provide for a whole host of cabling licence inspectors. This work could just as easily and much more effectively be carried out in the private sector. Therefore, we move that the restriction of the monopoly service to the carriers and, in particular, to Telecom be deleted. The work should be done by persons independent of the carriers who do not have a vested interest in finding fault and who are simply interested in ensuring that cabling work is properly carried out. That can be done without any free kick for Telecom.

It may well be that Austel may pick up that expertise in the future, but the reality is that Telecom has it now. Another reality is that Austel will be able to regulate the inspection of cabling work by Telecom to ensure that Telecom does behave with the minimum necessary encumbrance in order to provide safety and quality. Accordingly, we think that the mechanism is in place for Telecom to do it. Having Austel oversight these practices does give protection to industry and consumers. We oppose the amendment.

        Amendment No. 51 relates to the deemed refusal of cabling licences, where Austel has not been able, at the expiration of 30 days, to consider, or indeed, to approve an application. We regard this as yet another outrageous provision where, through no fault of an applicant for a cabling licence, the licence can be refused. That situation is quite unfair. There is no need for that to be the case. It is an incentive to bureaucratic inefficiency and delay, not that I would make any presumption that Austel would be so minded or, indeed, so inefficient. But the reality is that Austel will have a lot on its plate. One can hardly say that the approval of cabling licences will be a matter of high policy for Austel to consider. To the extent that it is a technical matter, in most instances requiring pro forma approval, it is highly likely to be put at the bottom of the pile. In a situation like that, it can be seen that injustice can arise in respect of applicants for cabling licences.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the deemed provision is reversed and there is a deemed approval at the expiration of the period, then the environment will be transformed. We regard it as very necessary to impose those disciplines upon Austel and, ultimately, the Government, to ensure that Austel has the facilities and resources properly to consider such applications. If there is such a deemed approval, then applicants will be satisfied and will be content to wait for that period, knowing that they will get speedy justice. That would satisfy the interests of all parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the clause is allowed to remain as it is, and if the Government opposes the amendments with the support of the Australian Democrats, once again it will be clear that the Democrats have no interest in ensuring that consumers, users and service providers are treated as they ought to be treated. Rather, it will be clear that the Democrats are either slavishly following the line fed to them by the Government or perhaps, even worse, that they have not even bothered to query what it is that underlies this provision. Their track record to date of not supporting our amendments to reverse deemed refusals is, I think a disgrace. I would invite them, on this last occasion, to consider what possible harm could flow from a deemed approval arrangement which is common in other circumstances and which would be the only fair and proper way to deal with applications of this sort.

But he will learn not to be so sensitive. As one who has done this many times before, I know that one's sensitivities and nerve endings tend to become toughened. It is incredible for him to be taking an exercise like this quite so personally. As I said earlier in the debate I do not want to take the time of the Committee going over and over the same issues. We have looked at this legislation and we have satisfied ourselves that, although it is not perfect in terms of the aspects I raised earlier in the committee stage, we are not prepared to go down the track that Senator Alston wants to go down-that is, to move amendments, most of which gut or reverse the propositions put in the legislation.

I find it regrettable that once again the Australian Democrats have not addressed the real issue in the brief debate that we have had on this particular clause. The fact of the matter is, as I have already invited Senator Powell to consider, that this is the last occasion on which we will deal with deemed refusals. But we have had a number of opportunities previously, none of which have been taken up by the Democrats, to indicate why it is that there is justice in a deemed refusal provision. I have not heard one word from the Democrats which would in any way explain how that sort of arrangement can do anything other than pander to inefficiency, to encourage Austel, through no fault of its own, to dally over making such decisions. In the event that such decisions are not made in time then the applicant will be the sufferer. I simply find it extraordinary that the Democrats do not seem to grasp the issue at heart.

       <para>
        Amendment No. 54 is an amendment to clause 152 to refer matters to the Ombudsman. As I recall it the May statement made a very clear distinction between policy matters and consumer matters. It said that it should be the responsibility of Austel to deal with policy matters and that it should be the responsibility of the Ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints. That strikes me as a sensible dichotomy. I do not see why Austel, given the whole range of burdens that will be imposed upon it, should have to take up what can quite often be very substantial quantities of complaints even though quite often they are relatively minor in themselves. We know that already the Ombudsman's time is taken up with many hundreds of complaints about Telecom related matters. I think the figure in the annual report was something in excess of 20 per cent of the total complaints relate to telecommunications issues. These include issues of service, issues of connection, issues of fees and issues of non-receipt of itemised accounts and billing. These are all matters that should not pre-occupy an independent regulator. They are matters that essentially should be dealt with by someone who has a special charter to deal with consumer complaints.
       </para>
       <para>
        We therefore find it odd, in the extreme, that Austel is not given specific directions to set those priorities out clearly but may simply so decide to transfer certain complaints to the Ombudsman. That lack of clarity is regrettable. We therefore add a subclause that provides:
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsection (1) does not apply if the matter is one which raises issues of regulatory policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, that matter could not be referred to the Ombudsman where such issues arise. But clearly where consumer complaints arise Austel would still retain the power-and ought to in ordinary circumstances-to transfer those complaints to the Ombudsman.

        In essence what the provisions in the Bill do is to provide for flexibility between both Austel and the Ombudsman. As a consequence we leave the fine tuning of the delineation of functions to be handled in a cooperative way between those two authorities. It is a rational way of handling complaints. It is one that Senator Alston says is not firm and embedded in the legislation. But it is quite clear what the policy is and what the spirit of the legislation is. The degree of flexibility that is allowed by the Government's proposal is one, as I said, that will accommodate fine tuning situations.

         —In rising to speak very briefly to this amendment which basically deals with consumer complaints and in rising to support the Australian Democrats' stance which continues the provision for flexibilities as far as consumer complaints are concerned, I would just like to backtrack very briefly on something that Senator Alston said previously. Senator Alston actually made a complaint about Telecom. He said that his telephone was not working and that he sought to get it fixed over the weekend, but Telecom was not prepared to do that because it thought he was an ordinary person.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would just like to relate something that happened to me a few years ago when I certainly was a very ordinary person, just as I regard myself as being now, incidentally. I also had a phone which was out of order. I felt that it should be fixed even though it was the weekend because I happened to have an elderly relative with me who was not in the best of health. I put this to Telecom and the phone was fixed so that it was working over the weekend. I wondered whether Telecom in Western Australia is different from Telecom in Victoria which seems to be the State in which Senator Alston has had his experience. I contacted Telecom in Western Australia this afternoon to see exactly what its policy was with telephone repairs over weekends. It regards a weekend service primarily as an emergency service, but it does have a great deal of flexibility. Saturday is regarded as emergency call day, but can be regarded as a regular call day for people who cannot be home on other days. In fact, last Saturday in the north Perth region, which is the region within which I live, Telecom dealt with 176 faults. That would cover about one-third of the metropolitan area. It had 15 men working out of a possible 60. On the previous Saturday it actually fixed 360 telephones. Sunday is regarded as a life and limb service day. The servicemen try not to come out on Sundays whenever possible; however, Telecom is considering extending that service too.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the amendments which Senator Alston is putting forward had got through-they would cause more deregulation and would put us well on the way to privatisation-he seems to feel that the service would be improved. I do not know whether he has ever tried to get a washing machine, water heater or fridge fixed over the weekend by private people. From my experience and the experience of other people, I can tell him that that is extremely difficult to do over the weekend in the private sector.

         —If the honourable senator wants to know the facts, they are that Telecom has an explicit policy-I will provide details of this to the Senate at a later time-that makes it very clear that it does not regard itself as under an obligation to provide services at the weekend except in cases of emergency. It does that because it takes a lowest common denominator approach when it does not need to take that approach. Perhaps the real reason is that it is reluctant to accede to exorbitant union demands which would probably involve the payment of triple time at weekends. But for whatever reason, it takes the view that it should only provide reasonable services at reasonable prices. It interprets that to mean that there should be no surcharge able to be paid by those people who might actually be prepared to pay at weekends.

        One can quibble about whether there is a desperate need to have a phone connected over the weekend other than in times of emergency, but if there are people around who are prepared to pay for it, it seems to me that that should be a choice available to consumers. It is not a matter for Telecom with its billion dollar profit figure to somehow decide that it should take an across-the-board approach that restricts those options.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whatever Senator Jenkins might have discovered about the situation in Western Australia, it cuts no ice with me at all in terms of my experience in Victoria and the subsequent follow-up that we have gleaned from discussions with Telecom's corporate relations department. I will table the policy as it has been explained to me. All that the Democrats are doing, once again, is feeling the need to provide a Pavlovian response to any criticism that might be made of Telecom because they have a misguided notion that if anyone is able to sustain a valid criticism of a service, somehow it might jeopardise the retention of that service in the hands of the public sector. Yet again, Senator Jenkins trotted out this pathetic line about some threat that might derive from privatisation. That is the ultimate obsession of those Democrats who are interested in public sector issues. They are terrified of the notion of privatisation. They have no concept of what might be involved in privatisation other than that it is an unholy transfer of power from one sector-good-to another sector-bad.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we are about, as I have said constantly in this place and elsewhere, is producing results for consumers that will deliver more efficient outcomes at lower prices. That is not necessarily achieved by privatisation. We saw what happened in the United Kingdom when a monopoly was replaced with a duopoly. In my view, that is not necessarily a satisfactory outcome. What is needed is a competitive environment in which there are very real structural incentives for prices and service to be provided much more efficiently and at a lower charge than at present. Unless and until the Democrats come to grips with that, the sort of response that we have had-the response of throwing one's hands up in the air when anyone criticises the public sector on the basis that somehow it is a Trojan horse for privatisation-will be treated with the contempt that it deserves.

       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment No. 55 seeks to amend clause 155 (3) which enables reports to be provided to the Minister. We do not quarrel with reports being provided to the Minister where Austel has conducted an investigation and made certain findings. We think that it is right and proper that a report should go to the Minister and that it should deal with the conduct of the investigation concerned and any findings that Austel might have made as a result of that investigation. However, we think it is equally important that that report should be able to be put into the public domain unless there are good reasons why it should not be. A good reason obviously would be if, in the opinion of the Minister, any material in the report could prejudice any legal proceedings that had commenced or were about to commence. The Minister should then have the ability to remove that sensitive material from the report. Otherwise, we believe that there should be a requirement for the report to be tabled by the Minister within 10 sitting days of its receipt. Such an outcome would engender widespread understanding of any investigations that Austel might have conducted and enable the Parliament to formulate appropriate responses, rather than allow the matter simply to go quietly to the Minister. In that case if the report contained something which did not meet with his approval it could be put away, never to be seen again. We do not regard that as an efficient use of Austel's time, nor do we regard it as being in the public interest.

         —The Government opposes the amendment. We see it as inappropriate as well as counterproductive. Basically, we are looking at a system under the legislation which would allow for policy issues, as well as investigation reports, to go to the Minister. Much of that would be part of the general policy formulation process of government and would encompass investigations outlined in clause 148 of the Bill. It seems that under the Opposition's proposed amendment we will find Parliament involving itself in the day to day administration of policy issues which are quite appropriately the responsibility of the Minister.

        In terms of the role of parliament-obviously parliament does have a role-which can be fulfilled by the effective scrutiny of Austel's annual report, it should be recognised that clause 181 (2) (b) require Austel to report on complaints, investigations and results of investigations within that annual report. So there is provision for indirect scrutiny, scrutiny which can be effective without being counterproductive in that it will not mean that Parliament and the development of policy will be hampered by the sort of proposal that Senator Alston is putting up.

        Amendment No. 56 relates to negotiations that Austel may carry out into the supply of or failure to supply telecommunication services, the connection of or a failure to connect customer equipment, or the performance or supervision of the performance of or failure to perform or supervise the performance of cabling work. Austel has the ability to carry out investigations in three distinct areas. What concerns us and why we move the amendment is that having made those investigations there does not seem to be any ability to give effect to its findings. We therefore propose that Austel be given the power to issue such directions and take such action as are reasonably necessary as a result of its investigations. I will be grateful to hear from the Minister whether there is some clause that we have overlooked that would give Austel the power to act on any adverse findings that it might make, or whether it is simply to be a toothless tiger.

        Clause 153 enables it to refer a matter to the Trade Practices Commission on the basis that it does not pursue its own investigation, whereas clause 148 envisages Austel completing an investigation. We are concerned with what happens after its completion. I thought that the Minister had conceded that clause 153 does not deal with that point at all.

         —I accept the point, but Senator Powell is suggesting that Austel is able to refer a matter to the Trade Practices Commission under clause 153, but clause 153 does not apply once the investigation has been completed. It applies to before Austel commences an investigation or while an investigation is in progress. It may decide not to investigate or not to investigate the matter further. It does not cover the situation where the investigation has been completed.

        This amendment seeks to delete the provision relating to associate members. We take the view that this is an unnecessary bureaucratic solution. By all means, let us have a chairman and two deputies, but we think the notion that somehow the Minister can appoint any number of associate members is quite offensive. It is an invitation to stack Austel. It can dilute all the good work that might be undertaken by the chairman and the deputies and, most importantly, it can confuse the area of responsibility. That is why we have moved for the deletion of clause 160.

I also make the observation that during consideration of a previous piece of legislation not that long ago-this exposes some of the debate that goes on here-the Opposition saw the need for more associate membership in regard to the Australian Securities Commission. We oppose the Opposition's amendment.

        Amendment No. 58 would require the annual report of Austel to contain copies of each direction given under the Act by the Minister, and the particulars of any investigation carried out under subsection 148 (3).

Failure to include those matters would have given an incomplete and misleading picture to the community.

        The second part of the amendment, relating to the reporting of investigations, is also not accepted. There is a need for flexibility when it comes to matters such as the reporting of investigations, particularly ones which may be continuing, as is proposed by Senator Alston's amendment.

         —I hope this is the ultimate amendment to be considered by the Committee, and it comes back in a slightly amended form to give the Australian Democrats one last opportunity to make a provision in the Telecommunications Act which would ensure that those persons living in rural and remote areas who find it necessary to be in contact with government agencies and departments have the opportunity to do so for the price of a local call-in other words, to make a 008 call.

        I understand the Democrats are now saying that they like the idea of a 008 call, presumably because they think it is nice and cheap. But apart from that, it would be something that should be specifically written into the statutory obligations for each and every government department. Apart from the number of trees that would be involved in making that sort of amendment across the board, I would have thought that by putting in into this Act, which is required to be taken notice of by every government department and agency, in one simple message the intention of the Parliament would be made plain, because that is what section 35 says, and it would be well understood and acted upon by those government departments and agencies. It seems that the Democrats are going to play the game by saying that somehow they want to go off on a frolic of their own and amend a whole series of other Acts, and in the meantime not even support this amendment. If that is so, I welcome the opportunity to expose their lack of interest and concern for those telecommunications users and subscribers in rural and remote areas who will be left lamenting as a result of the Democrats' failure to support this very sensible amendment.

         —The object of this amendment is to ensure that people in remote areas can make a call to a government department for the price of a local call. That is why we have agreed to the change in the wording. I realise that by putting this provision into the Telecommunications Bill we cannot very well command Telecom to implement it because, after all, the people who will have to pay will be the departments that have been rung up. However, I think that it is a good statement of principle to have the provision in this legislation so that any connections that are made are capable of carrying 008 number calls. I do not see why the proposed amendment should be opposed. If it is necessary to amend all the other pieces of legislation-such as those relating to community affairs, health, social security, and so on-then so be it. It is simple to amend that legislation. I urge the Australian Democrats to support this amendment, even if it is an amendment in principle, in order to let the departments know that we want equity in public services for people in the bush as compared with those in the cities.

         —I seek guidance from the Committee as to whether a further amendment might satisfy the concerns of the Australian Democrats. If one were to add at the end of the current amendment `and at their expense' it would then be clear, I think, that the intention of the Parliament, as expressed through clause 35, was that the burden of 008 charges would be borne by government departments. If that were so, surely no-one could suggest that government departments and agencies could blithely ignore that statutory prescription. In those circumstances I invite the Democrats to consider whether such a further amendment would meet their concerns.

         —I do not see that the suggested additional words of Senator Alston make any difference since there is no way that the provision could operate at all, other than at the expense of the government departments concerned. Senator Alston's other amendments have been opposed because of the Australian Democrats' perception of damage that they would have done to the package as a whole. On the other hand, this amendment has the potential to do nothing. Senator Alston puts the case that this would put a policy forward for implementation but it would be implementation by relevant government departments. That is really the operative point.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I believe that we have already heard from the Government on this point. That was so long ago that I am not even sure whether the Minister who was then at the table was the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who is there now. The availability of 008 calls is on track for completion for everybody by 1991-which is really a very short time away. So if it comes to wanting to push Telecom it seems to be that such a push is already felt and is a commercial imperative anyway. To extend the availability of 008 makes good commercial sense for Telecom as a provider of that service, particularly in the new framework of competitive service provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The approach we take to this is that this amendment would not actually achieve anything-certainly not before 1991 when provisions will be universally available for 008. It comes under the heading of leading a horse to water but being unable to make it drink. The Democrats believe that action needs to be taken, as Senator Sheil commented, with regard to the appropriate government departments. As we have already heard, some government departments already are implementing or have implemented a 008 system. The Australian Taxation Office, Department of Administrative Services and Telecom itself have already been mentioned in this debate. Clearly, if we are talking about equity, other departments immediately come to mind, two of which we will be dealing with this week in this place. They are the Department of Social Security and the Department of Community Services and Health. At that time the Australian Democrats will seek either to extend the availability of 008 services or, picking up the spirit of the amendment, the impetus for which I understand comes initially from Senator Sheil, to give people, wherever they live, universal access to their government department. Today everybody has that access through a reverse charge call.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the Democrats will be doing with the relevant legislation, at least concerning those two government departments within the week, and others as they come before us, is to implement procedures, by way of amendment or whatever other practice is available to us in this chamber, to ensure that, where and whenever possible, the access which already exists through the use of reverse charge calls is extended to the use of the 008 system, so that people, wherever they live, are able to make calls to those departments, if not free of charge, certainly at the local call rate. For that reason, it might be worth the Minister reiterating, in case I am wrong, the Government's position on what I see as a useless amendment to this piece of legislation in that, while the 008 provision will be universal by 1991, that still will not guarantee that government departments will implement this for their clients. We prefer to take the matter directly to each government department, as some government departments have already taken it up.

         —I would like again to lend my weight to Senator Alston's comments on the 008 system. I cannot understand the Australian Democrats' position on it. I think they heard of 008 only this afternoon. Senator Powell seems to think that it is a major engineering feat to put 008 calls into the telecommunications system. As I have said, the 008 system has been around in Australia for 10 to 15 years that I know of. The Western Australian Government, which is the State Government that I know best, has had these provisions throughout the 1980s. What is the big deal about providing for 008 calls? There is nothing to be added to the carrier network; the service is simply provided on request by a customer, whether that customer is a State government department, a Federal government department or a private person. I know of plenty private businesses in the same household that have 008 numbers. It is no great engineering feat to provide such a number. If we provide for that in this legislation, what have we got to lose?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are various types of 008 numbers, whether the subscriber is a department, a private person or a business. As I have said, the hospitality trade uses these numbers a lot. Some can be rung only from inside the State and others can be rung from right around Australia. This has never been a burden on Telecom Australia. Someone has to pick up the cost of the calls. The user picks up the local call rate and the rest is picked up by the department, the person or the business whose number it is. I would like the Minister to comment on whether he thinks it has ever been a burden on Telecom. The only burdens on Telecom that I know of, if they are burdens, are the free service one can use to inform it that a phone is out of order and the free long distance service one can use to inquire about accounts or something like that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats have told us again about the reverse charge system, which I have always believed to be rather inconvenient. I would ask Senator Powell whether she has ever used the 0176 service lately. With the rationalisation that has taken place in Telecom around Australia in the last 12 months, whereby Telecom has fewer operators on 0176 and has a system by which virtually any 0176 operator in Australia will answer a caller, it can take 10 or 15 minutes before one can get hold of an operator.

         —That is right, the customer is not important. Telecom is more interested in the caller who uses subscriber trunk dialling (STD). A manually connected telephone call, by which one rings and asks the operator to put one through, or if one uses the booking system, involves such a great cost that one is discouraged from using it. Telecom wishes to discourage one from making those calls. When Senator Evans was Minister for Transport and Communications, some time ago, he said that in the old Parliament House. So I cannot agree with the Democrats' idea of going back to the outdated system of reverse charges, and I think it is time that they learned the error of their ways.

         —Senator Powell objects to the amendment because, she says, it does not do anything; she thinks it does nothing. When Senator Evans was here as the Minister, he said the bottom line was that the implementation of this amendment would cost too much. The two positions are incompatible. If the amendment does nothing, it does nothing. But if it will cost too much, it will do something. I was able to point out to the Minister that the cost to Telecom was virtually revenue-neutral and in fact Telecom would probably make money, because it would collect its fees from the departments. The Democrats have indicated their acceptance of the principle of the amendment. They have also said that they would be happy to see it introduced in the Acts concerning the various departments, particularly the ones that will come up later this week and early next week. Why should they not accept the principle of it to apply in the Telecommunications legislation so that everyone could be forewarned as to what our intentions are?

       <para>
        It should also be noted by Senator Alston and by Senator Panizza that Telecom is in fact improving the provision of regional 008 services with the introduction of what will be called the Intelligent Network 008 Service in 1991. As I said, any customer with an automatic telephone service has 008 access at the moment-regionally, State-wide and Australia-wide. These three 008 services are available uniformly throughout Australia. Telecom has generally 12 regions to a State and Telecom's regions may not necessarily correspond to those regions of other organisations. Once the Intelligent Network is in place then, through some configuration, Telecom will be able to tailor its regions to suit customer distribution.

        To respond to Senator Alston's remark, `What is the objection to it?', basically the first point I made was that what the Opposition and other senators want to achieve will not be achieved by an amendment to this particular clause in this particular Bill. That is the basic objection. I should also state-and this is not because Senator Walsh was near here earlier on-that what we have before us is very much an uncosted proposal. Although Senator Alston presents himself as a good, rational, economic manager, I think it is quite important to note that no costing has been put to this particular proposal by him, not only in terms of what it might cost Telecom-and the argument there is that it may not cost Telecom anything-but in terms of what it may cost Government departments. The Government opposes the amendment for those reasons.

         —Previously I have had occasion to draw to the attention of the Senate some of the work of Dr John Ellard, the doyen of Australian psychiatrists. Recently he wrote another article which I wish to bring to the Senate's attention. It is entitled The Drug Offensive and provides Dr Ellard's very clear views on this matter. As honourable senators would know, Dr Ellard is the editor of Modern Medicine of Australia. In this article Dr Ellard points out in the opening paragraph that there have been a number of drug offensives in history, not only the one that we have had for four years in Australia which has cost us more than $100m. He drew attention to the drug offensive waged by Britain in the nineteenth century against China-a drug offensive which resulted in the importation into China, against the wishes of that country, of 5,240 tonnes of opium in 1879. And so it goes on. Because I think that this is a very worthwhile document, I seek leave to table it so it will be made available to honourable senators.

         —As an Australian senator I visited China in 1985, 1986 and 1987. My optimistic observations from these three visits were summarised in a speech that I gave in the Senate in December a year and a half ago. This speech was widely circulated in China and Australia and it marked a special high point in the excellent relations between our two countries over the past very positive decade. However, the events this week in China have cast a totally unwelcome dark shadow across all that has been developed during the past decade. In response to the terrible slaughter in Beijing by government decision during the weekend of 3 and 4 June, yesterday I wrote a letter to my friends in many parts of China. Sadly, I now read my letter to China so that my views are clearly recorded here in the Australian Parliament and understood by the Australian people. The letter reads:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The horror and tragedy of the madness in Tien An Men causes me to write this letter. After a decade of enlightenment what an evil reversal this represents. I appeal to you on the basis of all that is good and sound.
       </para>
       <para>
        I write to you in the spirit of international understanding. I am a friend of the Chinese people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not address this letter to named individuals in China-those who welcomed me in China, those who travelled with me and those who visited me in my home and Parliament in Australia-because I do not wish to embarrass you any more than the events of the past week in Beijing surely have done already.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until this past weekend, we in Australia were prepared not to interfere, but to leave Chinese internal decisions to China. But the most recent government decisions and their effects reach far beyond China and they touch us all and we must respond.
       </para>
       <para>
        For six weeks we have read the newspapers and watched the television reports day by day. We watched for the statements and the actions of Zhao Ziyang and we took note of the statements of Li Peng and Deng Hsiaoping. All along, I hoped there would be rational dialogue and a sensible outcome based on an open accountability to the people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I supported Zhao Ziyang's dialogue with the people in Tien An Men. I hoped this kind of dialogue would openly and publicly sift the rice from the husks and lead to truth and justice acceptable to the people being implemented by government and students alike. On the basis of this agreed truth and justice I could see the eventual peaceful dispersion of the students and a return to normal life.
       </para>
       <para>
        The grievances of the students were directed against:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) corruption currently covered from sight by the inadequate accountability of government agencies to the people, and
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) `emperor' lifestyles of a privileged elite inconsistent with equity principles, and the immoral reliance on secrecy to protect these privileges.
       </para>
       <para>
        To gain a solution, the students justly saw
       </para>
       <para>
        (3) the need for a free press to expose these errors and hypocrisies and to assist the people's representatives to find a constant stream of solutions to them; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (4) the need for freedom of speech and freedom of association to allow corruption, hypocrisy and privilege to be factually exposed and justly eliminated; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (5) the need for a guarantee of freedom for the people to enable them to ensure the government was making decisions in the best short-term and long-term interests of the ordinary people and not lost in inertia nor serving the interests of the tiny minority with government power.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my opinion, it is correct that this movement is genuinely about freedom and democracy. I use these two terms in a contemporary Chinese sense, as concepts appealed to by Sun Yat Sen and by people's parties in China ever since.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is insulting to the people of China for any autocrat in Beijing to twist these terms as if they had only foreign meanings or as if `freedom' and `democracy' as used by the students somehow exposed them to be `traitors' pursuing non-Chinese and foreign goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should add, however, that it appears that some of the students failed to recognise the element of anarchy in some of their actions and some students were disrespectful to the government leaders of China. But how can this provide any excuse for the government killing students! Would any father or mother seeing indiscipline or disrespect in their child resort to bloody slaughter whether to punish the child or to deter the other children. No, never!
       </para>
       <para>
        It is with great horror that we have now in these past few days witnessed the government's decision to order elements of the People's Liberation Army with tanks and with armed infantry to fire on and kill the people whom they should be dedicated to serve. What a perversion!
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia, amongst the people across the whole nation, there is a wave of revulsion from this event in Beijing and an angry contempt for those in power who have made this decision autocratically, secretly and with ruthlessness and barbarity.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the first time since the late 1970s, the exciting and positive decade or so since the arrest of the Gang of Four we have seen, at one stroke, the optimism and openness and affection for China and China's development put under the dark shadow of this deadly tragedy in Tien An Men.
       </para>
       <para>
        This evening the Australian Prime Minister spoke, I believe, for all of us in Parliament (of all parties) and for the Australian people when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``I'd consistently hoped that the more moderate and intelligent line of my very good friend Zhao Ziyang, would have prevailed . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It is only the line of Zhao Ziyang and those who think like him that can provide a lasting resolution of these issues, because Deng and Li Peng may believe that what they have done has brought this issue to an end. It hasn't, and it can't, and it won't.
       </para>
       <para>
        The nonsense that's been spoken now by the authorities, about them putting down a minority section of renegades is patently false . . . It's not the dregs of society, and it's very hard to talk about your students-not only in Beijing, but around the country-as the ``dregs of society''.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mean this is patently a nonsense. And there is also evidence available to us of a degree of hesitancy and, indeed, revulsion, in sections of the People's Liberation Army, and which is not surprising. I mean, you imagine the feelings of these young men in uniform being asked now and required to shoot down their fellow citizens, citizens who have been acting peaceably and not making unreasonable demands; students and people who are not questioning, in a sense, certain fundamentals of Chinese society, but expressing simply a fundamental human desire for the freedom of expression and the opportunity to participate. Now, those things are not going to be able to be put down in any permanent sense, so it will be a combination, in my judgment, of the pressure of international opinion and the intrinsic impossibility within China of holding this position.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Our pain in Australia at this event must be only a small reflection of the pain of the Chinese people. Theirs is a pain mixed with fear; a pain which saps confidence for the present and hope for the future. We weep alongside those in China who weep. Our resolve together is for justice and truth and the truth will set us free.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, a country without confidence for the present and without hope for the future will achieve much less than its actual potential.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why the present situation must be remedied. It must be reversed. We are concerned that this week's events have put in jeopardy the admirable goals outlined for China in Zhao Ziyang's Report to the thirteenth Party Congress in October, 1987. I remember well that Report-that five-year and 50-year plan for China-because at that time I was in Beijing, indeed I was in Tien An Men.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remedy for the Cultural Revolution's ten lost years required the trial of the Gang of Four and their open, public and just dismissal. The recompense now required against the autocratic decision to kill the students who loved China and who asked for freedom and accountability to the people, this recompense will eventually be no less exacting.''
       </para>
       <para>
        My letter, written yesterday, ends at that point. In conclusion, I can only urge the Chinese authorities to stop the present madness which, if it continues, may consume China in the disaster of civil war. As the days go by we in Australia will watch for the safety of Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qili, Wan Li and their families and all those who, like them, love China and serve the people. We will hope for their reinstatement to the senior positions of authority they had until these recent events and which they held securely and capably as they served the people.

         —Today at Question Time I asked Senator Cook a question requesting him to take certain action on behalf of the northern prawn fleet. Tonight I want to put on record the exact problems that are facing the prawning industry at the moment. The prawn trawling industry in Australia is in the situation where a relaxation of the export packaging standards has led ultimately to a drastic decline in export sales and prices received by our northern prawn fisheries, which include fisheries in north Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Prices received by northern fishermen have fallen drastically. Australia was once ranked in the top three quality exporters; we are now ranked between 15 and 20. This is having a disastrous effect on the prawn export industry and on Australia's domestic processing performance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The origins of the current situation on quality control relate back to recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce in its report on the development of the Australian fishing industry which was tabled in April 1983. The Committee recommended a review of export regulations to allow the export of lower grades of selected species. This led to the Government relaxing the standards of fish and whole raw prawn export packaging which had the apparent support of at least some sections of the industry. The relevant regulations came into force in 1983. Since that time individual fishermen exporters have been fighting to reverse this decision. With the lowering of quality standards, Australian processors and fishermen with export licences were encouraged to send a greatly increased proportion of whole prawns overseas where processing could be done much more cheaply with lower labour costs, and so forth. As a result, the number of processors operating in Australia dropped dramatically.
       </para>
       <para>
        The percentage of our prawn harvest that went to export markets initially rose from 50 per cent to 90 per cent. The lowering of standards meant that we have been offering a product with insufficient quality control to primarily Japanese buyers-some of the prawns go to other nations such as America-who are particularly discerning in their purchases. Other countries, notably China and Taiwan with their farmed products have risen up the quality rankings while we have dropped lower and have given up our market share almost by default. While this slide in uniform product quality was occurring in Australia, our international competitors were developing their aquaculture programs which produced prawns of uniform quality, size and weight. These products are far more preferable to Japanese buyers who can be confident of opening a carton and knowing that what is on the label outside is exactly what is inside.
       </para>
       <para>
        With our current prawn export standards, there is a marked degree of tolerance between the label and the contents. Prior to 1983, an A-grade tolerance of 5 per cent was the maximum allowable. It is currently 15 per cent. Therefore, when contemplating buying any Australian product, the buyer knows that in any carton he can rely only on obtaining 85 per cent at the grade for which he paid. The aggregate percentage content of a carton permitted to differ from the outside label rose from 15 per cent to 37 per cent. This means that more than a third of a carton of Australian prawns could consist of product which is out of grade, has defects, or is even a different species altogether than is marked on the carton. This means that a Japanese buyer who is intent on quality and reliability would be taking quite a punt on any Australian export prawns. Our prawn exports to Japan have decreased from 11,821 tonnes in 1982 to 7,178 tonnes in 1987. The adverse effect this has on the price offered is obvious. After the regulations came into force, this was not readily identified by the individual industry players because the correct market signals were hidden behind movements in the exchange rates. However, the situation has now deteriorated to such a degree that the effect of the export packaging regulations is clearly seen by the vast majority of the industry to be undesirable, and the reason for their drop in sales and prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        Twelve months ago, a fisherman would have received between $10 and $12 for a kilo of banana prawns consigned to Japan. This year, he is being offered around $6 a kilo. The American market is even worse, offering about a dollar less than Japan. The fisherman is in the untenable position of either investing in expensive, and often unavailable, storage facilities, or caving in to the buyer's market and therefore jeopardising other Australian sales. Not only has the price dropped substantially, but also our fishermen are far more subject to the vagaries of the market because of their inferior quality controls. They face an unstable and fluctuating market which saw, at one stage, falls of a dollar per kilo per week in the price of black tiger prawns and banana prawns. So today we have 4,250 tonnes of prawns sitting in north Queensland in boats, cold stores and refrigerated places with little or no chance of a healthy market return because of Government regulations which have effectively downgraded the product we are offering, in a market which is quality sensitive. On last year's prices, that represents at least $40m of lost export sales in the last two months. I know that will worry Senator Walsh in his quest to get our balance of trade figures down.
       </para>
       <para>
        An important point to remember is that the aquaculture product which is so much preferred to the unreliable and mixed bag which we are currently offering, would not be nearly as popular if we were to offer a higher and more uniform packaging standard. Ocean caught prawns are generally superior in taste to the prawn farm product, and will attract a premium if correctly graded. Should we upgrade the quality standards to pre-1983 levels, we would virtually be able to name our price and, in addition, encourage the expansion of domestic processing operations for value added products. I remind the Senate that the need for post-harvest technologies and opportunities in Australia was stressed in the recent report by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) entitled Casting the Net.
       </para>
       <para>
        Should the regulations be changed to enforce a higher quality product of whole prawns in cartons, then we would automatically receive a higher price for the export product which would subsidise producers for a lower domestic price, and see a rebirth of onshore processing and the benefits of increased employment in the processing and related industries. As the shadow Minister responsible for regional development, I see great advantages in encouraging value adding industries such as fish processing plants in our regional areas, which suffer from lack of employment opportunities and a lack of economic development initiatives. ASTEC's report Casting the Net was also very strong on the need to aim for greater value adding enterprises to boost the economic contribution and future of the Australian fishing industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is my hope that this balanced, politically non-aggressive and industry-favoured interpretation of a serious problem in the Australian fishing industry will be given every consideration by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). A number of fishermen who are prawn exporters have approached me to see whether the relevant regulations can be changed in order to restore their industry's market performance, and I am sure that the Government will want to assist them. The need to increase our quality controls and inspection services in the fishing industry is urgent as it is severely retarding the efforts of our fourth largest primary product export earner. The fishing industry currently earns approximately $775m a year in export sales. The fact that 4,250 tonnes of prime export product is sitting in cold storage in ports and boats in northern Australia does nothing to assist the viability of the northern prawn industry or to contribute to easing our balance of payments problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to the Minister responsible that this is a serious matter which needs the Government's immediate attention. It concerns the individual export licensed fishermen as well as the fleet operators and processing establishments. All recognise the problem and most would like to see action along the lines of the restoration of pre-1983 levels of export standards in order to restore the industry's export performance and to return the ocean prawn to its deserved popularity. Unfortunately, in a case like this, it is not sufficient merely to say that individual fishermen and exporters could take greater care with packaging their product and impose their own quality controls. Unless Australian standards encourage a greater degree of uniformity and accuracy, and are enforced by the Australian Export Inspection Service, the fisherman who produces a top export product is penalised by the person who does the minimum to meet the lower standards currently required.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is at present no incentive, monitoring or control to justify the marketing of a top quality product, as the price will always be reduced to the lowest common denominator. Standards should not be formulated to suit a particular short term market requirement for a quick profit alone. Low quality products and low prices are easily found in world markets and do nothing to benefit industry in terms of efficiency, long range stability, sound management and, ultimately, profits. A senior fish exports inspector, at the time of the proposal to lower standards, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        If the history of prawn standards is examined and understood, it is obvious that this proposal, if fully accepted, will take the industry further behind in the commercial markets than Australia was in 1974 when massive prawn rejections occurred overseas.

       <para in-line="1">
        —The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. In the case to which Senator Sanders referred, both quantities of uranium supplied from South Africa and Niger to Euratom had a peaceful uses obligation attached and were in the U3O8 form. Because the obligations involved were identical, swapping these quantities had the same effect whether it was regarded as a swap of origin or of obligation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) These words appear in one of the documents to which the Senator refers. The document purports to be an unofficial translation of a telex from the Euratom Supply Agency to the German nuclear firm, Nukem.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. Three important observations should be made:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Although the document referred to is a Euratom paper, it is a discussion paper prepared for use within an advisory committee to one of Euratom's agencies. It is not a statement of Euratom policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The concept of physical origin is not relevant to the application of IAEA and Euratom safeguards. These apply to all nuclear material subject to those safeguards regardless of origin. Physical origin loses its relevance from the safeguards point of view once the discrete physical identity of a shipment of uranium in the form of yellowcake arriving from a country of origin has been lost, for example by commingling and treatment with material from other countries in a bulk chemical process. But a quantity of nuclear material equivalent to that from the country of origin will be subject to the same safeguards obligations as the original material.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) It is correct that Euratom Safeguards do not verify, record or track the physical origin of nuclear material, but Euratom undertakes tracking of and accounting for nuclear material subject to certain bilateral agreements. As the recipient of nuclear material subject to such agreements, Euratom assumes specific safeguards obligations as required by the countries either supplying or processing the nuclear material concerned. Euratom assigns a safeguards accounting code to the material to enable it to satisfy the obligations it has assumed, as the material moves through the fuel cycle. The separate codes assigned to nuclear material subject to Euratom's agreements with Australia, Canada and the US effectively ensure that this material is at all times accounted for as being subject to these agreements and treated accordingly.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10) Origin swaps within a recipient country's jurisdiction do not affect the application of IAEA safeguards or the fulfilment of bilateral safeguards obligations. The ground for concern with origin swaps is their possible misuse as a means of facilitating the flow through the international fuel cycle of some nuclear material, such as South African uranium, in contravention of some countries' foreign policies forbidding the importation of such material.
      </para>
      <para>
       At no time has there been any suggestion that Australian obligated nuclear material has been involved in an origin swap designed to facilitate the flow of nuclear material produced in South Africa from Euratom to a country outside Euratom for whatever purpose. The Government would be most concerned at any such suggestion.
      </para>
      <para>
       The papers to which the senator refers imply that the origin swap involving nuclear material from South Africa and Niger which allegedly occurred in February 1986 did not require or receive the approval of the Euratom Safeguards Directorate. This would not be surprising given that a swap of physical origin within a particular jurisdiction would have no safeguards significance. Euratom and IAEA safeguards would continue to apply to both quantities of nuclear material and Euratom's tracking of and accounting for nuclear material subject to certain bilateral agreements would not be affected.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since that time Euratom has taken action against such swaps. European Commissioner Mosar, in his response to the report of the European Parliament's Committee of Enquiry into the Transport and Handling of Nuclear Material which was released on 4 July 1988, said that ``Where the particular question of origin swaps is concerned, I want to repeat that . . . the Commission had already taken steps to exclude them, well before the Transnuklear affair.''
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has been informed by Euratom that discussions have been held between the European Commission and the European nuclear industry, as a result of which agreement has been reached that origin swaps should not take place.

       (1) Excluding salaries and at December 1988 prices, it is estimated that the exercise will cost about $114m. Approximately $78m of this would have been committed to single Service and other Joint exercises and routine aspects of operations and training planned for 1989. Thus the additional cost to the Defence Force of conducting KANGAROO 89 will be in the order of $36m.

       (6) Kamaria was discussed at the Joint Press Conference given by the Minister for Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force on 8 November 1988. A copy of the map showing the fictional geography of the country was given to members of the media attending the press conference. In summary the Minister emphasised that Kamaria was totally fictional and bore no relationship to any real country. He also noted that it was located to the north of Australia in recognition of the geographic and historical facts that an adversary could only mount operations against Australia through the northern archipelago. The four fictitious southern islands of Kamaria simply represent the operational vectors consistent with these facts.
