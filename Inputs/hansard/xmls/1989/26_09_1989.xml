       Rumania, whose human rights record had been worse than that of South Africa's even before she embarked on a diabolic village destruction program, deservedly attracts worldwide condemnation.

       (2) if found that Rumania violates these agreements, the signatures representing Australia jointly or singularly be withdrawn from the thus invalidated documents;

       Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;

      <para>
       The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacists.

       Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to ensure adequate remuneration levels for pharmacists so that they may be able to provide a high quality health care service which is the right of every citizen of Australia.

      <para>
       That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.

       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

       Health Care for the Elderly

       Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.
      </para>
      <para>
       If open not-for-profit Health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, those costs need to be shared equitably. Some Health Insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.

       Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to:

       Television Transmission, Tasmania

       Home Ownership
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.

       1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.
      </para>

They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely; (a) The Union Jack-itself the creation of 3 Christian crosses represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its place in space; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901 and each point depicting a State and the Territories of the Commonwealth.

      <para>
       5. They are certain that any change to its form or to its acceptance as the sole Australian National Flag will produce division in the Australian community.

We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or `N.V.E.' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and
      </para>
      <para>
       2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walter's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and

       3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;

      </para>
      <para>
       The 23rd of August 1989 is the 50th anniversary of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. This pact, signed by the foreign ministers of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, included three secret agreements by which eastern Europe was divided into Nazi German and Soviet spheres of influence, paving the way for World War II.
      </para>
      <para>
       The pact led to the Soviet annexation of formerly independent Lithuania. Until the force of this pact is removed, it will be difficult for Lithuania and those other occupied nations to regain their rights of self-determination.
      </para>
      <para>
       With this in mind, and appealing to an international sense of justice, your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled will call on the Government:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) To demand that the Government of the USSR renounce the pact.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) To demand that the Government of the USSR accede to the wishes of the Lithuanian people in their expressed wish for national sovereignty and independence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) To demand that members of the Soviet secret police (NKVD later the KGB) be brought to trial for carrying out vast deportations of Baltic citizens which brought death or displacement to over one-quarter of the population of the Baltic states.
      </para>
      <para>
       And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before the Senate amends the National Health Act to increase the maximum general patient contribution for prescribed drugs supplied under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from the present $11 to $12.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increase in the general patient contribution from $11 to $12 is estimated to achieve savings of $10.0m in 1989/90 and $17.0 in a full financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides that the increase take effect from 1 October 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will note that the Government has continued to support those in need by maintaining both free pharmaceutical benefits for all pensioners and the concessional beneficiary rate of $2.50. In addition the government has retained the provision of free scripts for the chronically ill under the safety net provisions. Individuals or families who record 25 scripts in any calendar year receive all additional scripts free of charge.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill further provides for the annual indexation of the general patient contribution in line with the March quarter ``All Groups Consumer Price Index''. The annual adjustments will occur on 1 August to coincide with the issue of the PBS schedules.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment will thus link the general patient contribution rate to the rate of inflation to address the rapid growth in the costs of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme through increased prescribing of high cost drugs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increase in the maximum general patient contribution is one of a number of measures that the government has taken to restrain the growth in expenditure of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the past 12 months. In 1988/89 this expenditure under the scheme increased by only 8.5% over the previous year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes to patient payments announced in the Budget are consistent with the Government's desire to maintain the viability and effectiveness of the scheme with assistance targeted to the most needy.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill is to make clear what kinds of State and Territory laws apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. Recent decisions of the High Court have raised problems with section 64 of the Judiciary Act. The Government has decided to seek legislation to remove these problems and to resolve long-standing uncertainties as to the extent of the Commonwealth's implied constitutional immunities from State law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legal position of the Commonwealth in relation to State legislation is at present very unclear. The Commonwealth has acted on the view-supported in a number of High Court judgments-that the Commonwealth, its servants and agents and many of its instrumentalities, have extensive immunities from State legislation based on implications in the Constitution. However, there has been longstanding uncertainty as to the scope of these immunities. For example, in 1953 in The Commonwealth v. Bogle (1953) 89 C.L.R. 229 at pages 259-260, Mr Justice Fullagar, whose view was shared by 3 other Justices, including the then Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon, said that a State Parliament `has no power over the Commonwealth' but added that the Commonwealth may `become affected by State laws'. These principles have been subjected to criticism by some eminent writers. A proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to the matter of Commonwealth immunities was discussed at the 1985 Brisbane meeting of the Constitutional Convention but no agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States. In its final report last year, the Constitutional Commission recommended that no alteration should be made to the Constitution, recognising that the matter could be adequately addressed through Commonwealth legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the early years of Federation the Commonwealth Parliament addressed the issue of the Commonwealth's immunities in the particular area of civil liability. Interim legislation was enacted in 1902 modelled on colonial legislation which provided remedies against the Crown. This legislation was replaced, in substantially similar terms, by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 which is still in force. It provides that-
       </para>
       <para>
        `in any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 64 applies only to civil proceedings to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party and not to criminal proceedings. In criminal proceedings the legal position still depends on the scope of the Commonwealth's implied immunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until 1986 the Commonwealth acted on the view that section 64 of the Judiciary Act had a very limited effect in subjecting the Commonwealth to State and Territory legislation to which it was not otherwise subject. Much Commonwealth and Territory legislation was drafted on that basis. However, the High Court's decision in The Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd (1986) 161 C.L.R. 254, means that section 64 of the Judiciary Act subjects the Commonwealth, and also Commonwealth instrumentalities, to a wide range of State and Territory legislation as if the Commonwealth were an ordinary person. Section 64 can even subject the Commonwealth to State legislation that does not bind the State, and in some cases to Commonwealth legislation that would not otherwise apply to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        This result was almost certainly not intended by the Parliament that enacted the Judiciary Act in 1903 at a time well before the burgeoning of legislation of all kinds. As a result of the Evans Deakin decision, the Commonwealth is subject to the risk of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities under whatever legislation the States and self-governing Territories might enact from time to time in relation to ordinary persons. The decision in the Evans Deakin case would also apply to self-governing Territory legislation and to Imperial legislation still in force in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interests of the community, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, the legal position should be clarified and those risks removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has examined alternative methods of framing such legislation. One approach considered was to enact Commonwealth Acts from time to time listing by name all the State and Territory Acts and subordinate legislation and instruments that should, or should not, apply to the Commonwealth. However, that approach would be impracticable. Very substantial resources would be needed to monitor existing, and new, State and self-governing Territory Acts and subordinate legislation (including local government legislation). There would inevitably be delays pending the enactment of the Commonwealth legislation. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth could have incurred obligations or liabilities, or rights could have accrued. It would be undesirable to seek to avoid such obligations or rights by means of retrospective legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that the only feasible approach is to specify in an Act some classes of State and Territory legislation (defined to include any relevant continuing Imperial legislation) that should apply to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, and to have regulation-making powers to deal with other classes of laws and with any special problems-the regulations being subject to Parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. This provides the necessary flexibility to respond quickly to new State or Territory legislation. The Bill follows this course.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to outline the main provisions of the Bill. I mention, first, that the Bill treats self-governing territories other than the Australian Capital Territory-that is, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island-as though they were States. The Bill does not affect the position under Australian Capital Territory laws since they are either covered by section 27 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 or are Ordinances made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 that can be amended if necessary by the Governor-General in Council to clarify the position of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill set out exhaustively, except in relation to Australian Capital Territory laws, the extent to which the Commonwealth is to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, the Commonwealth will continue to be subject to the Commonwealth and non-self-governing Territory legislation that applies to the Commonwealth of its own force.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the following classes of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation are applied by the Bill to the Commonwealth:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) legislation concerning procedure in civil litigation; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) legislation codifying, modifying or extending the common law with respect to liability in tort. State legislation on contributory negligence in actions for damages for negligence is one of many examples of tort laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Bill any changes in the existing position will only apply to events or circumstances occurring after the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill. Also, the Bill will only have the effect of applying a State, Northern Territory or Norfolk Island law to the Commonwealth if the relevant State or Territory is itself bound by that law.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of laws codifying, modifying or extending the common law of tort the Bill makes an exception for provisions declared by regulations not to apply to the Commonwealth. This will enable the Commonwealth to be exempted from unforeseeable kinds of State or Territory legislation, although any accrued rights existing at the date of the regulations will not be affected. The Government will consult the Governments of the States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island concerning any proposals to make regulations to exempt the Commonwealth from laws that would otherwise be applied to the Commonwealth by the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides for other State, Northern Territory and Norfolk Island laws to apply to the Commonwealth if prescribed by regulations under the proposed Act. Since the contents of future legislation cannot be predicted, the Government does not consider it appropriate for legislation falling outside the listed categories to be automatically applied to the Commonwealth. The only feasible approach is to include a regulation-making power to include further State and Territory legislation. When required, regulations can be made quickly, but will still be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. Regulations applying laws to the Commonwealth would not have retrospective effect except where the applied law itself has a retrospective operation. Even then, the law would not be applied to operate from a time before the commencement of the provision of the Bill that makes it applicable to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will be consulting the States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island to identify the various additional classes of State or Territory legislation that they would wish to see applied to the Commonwealth by the regulations. For example, the general motor traffic laws (except in so far as they provide, for instance, for the licensing of vehicles) will be applied to the Commonwealth so as to preserve the present position under the longstanding High Court decision in 1925 in Pirrie v. McFarlane (1925) 36 CLR 170. The Government does not intend that this Bill should be used as a means for the Commonwealth to avoid the operation of such laws. A similar comment applies, of course, to the application of general criminal laws to Commonwealth servants and agents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until special occupational health and safety legislation is enacted by the Commonwealth, regulations will also be made applying occupational safety laws to the Commonwealth for the purpose of making the Commonwealth subject to an action in tort for damages for breach of a statutory duty. The regulations will not apply the associated offence provisions to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will, therefore, continue to be civilly liable under these laws so that the practical result would be the same as in Strods v. The Commonwealth [1982] 2 NSWLR 192 where the employee succeeded in an action against the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of difficulties in formulating an appropriate general description of the classes of contract laws that are to apply to the Commonwealth, the Government has decided to apply to the Commonwealth specific classes of contract laws by the regulations. Examples of laws that will be applied by regulations include sale of goods laws, the Statute of Frauds concerning the enforceability of contracts, laws with respect to unconscionable contracts and laws with respect to the frustration of contracts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regulations will also be made applying to the Commonwealth laws for the securing of the payment of moneys payable to sub-contractors. The Subcontractors' Charges Act 1974 (Qld) was held in by the High Court in the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd to be applied to the Commonwealth by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903. Although the general effects of that decision are considered undesirable by the Commonwealth, the particular law in that case is of a kind that, in general, should apply to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 7 sets out exhaustively the extent to which Commonwealth servants and agents are to be subject to State laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill deal with the application of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws to Commonwealth corporations. While some Commonwealth corporations such as the Australian Postal Commission share the Commonwealth's immunities from State legislation, many do not do so, especially if engaged primarily in commercial activities. However, it is often very uncertain whether a particular statutory corporation shares the Commonwealth's immunities. The present tests involve factors such as the degree of Ministerial control. They are very difficult to apply. The Government considers that any Commonwealth statutory corporation should be immune from State legislation only to the extent (if any) provided by or under the legislation establishing the corporation or other legislation. However, the Bill provides that, in respect of laws existing at the commencement of the proposed Act, immunity can be given by regulations made under the Act before its commencement. (Such commencement would be deferred for one year to give time for the making of regulations in all appropriate cases).
       </para>
       <para>
        An exception is made in the Bill for the Repatriation Commission which is, in substance, a Department of the Commonwealth and is therefore treated under the Bill as part of the Commonwealth rather than as a statutory authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides for complementary amendments to section 64 of the Judiciary Act. Section 64 will cease to operate in relation to rights created by a written law where the Commonwealth is not subject to the provisions of that law in accordance with the Bill or otherwise. The States will also be placed on the same footing as the Commonwealth in relation to the provision. However, section 64 will continue to apply in relation to unwritten laws-for example, the common law of tort which, in the absence of section 64, would not apply to the Commonwealth or a State because of the maxim that the Crown `can do no wrong'.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”In the last few days we have seen three major developments which will very significantly assist the efforts that we are all making to eliminate these abhorrent weapons from the face of the earth once and for all. The Government Industry Conference Against Chemical Weapons held in Canberra last week significantly advanced the cause of the early achievement of a major convention in this respect in half a dozen ways. Firstly, the mere existence and the internal dynamics of the conference, which brought together nearly 70 countries and 95 per cent of the world's chemical industries here in Canberra, did a great deal perhaps to restore the flagging spirits of the Geneva negotiators who have been, after all, working away at this issue for nearly 20 years now, so far without a great deal of progress to record. The atmospherics-the sense of shared spirit and application to the task-were, although intangible, a very important factor.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Secondly, we had a collective statement by the world's chemical industry represented in Canberra of its commitment to assist governments and bring about a total ban on chemical weapons through a comprehensive convention. It was the first such statement of its kind. It was far reaching in scope and a very important indicator of the will of that industry to contribute to the process without which, obviously, it would be very difficult to make a workable universal convention stick. Thirdly, associated with that, we had another development, the agreement by the industry to establish an international forum supplementing existing formal arrangements which would involve representatives of the chemical industry, not only from the developed world, but also from the socialist bloc and the Third World.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourthly, we had the identification of a number of steps that could be taken as interim measures prior to the conclusion of a convention to help create, in a sense, an environment of confidence for the ultimate achievement of that ban. The measures that have been announced by the Secretaries of State, Baker and Shevardnadze, in the last few days and by President Bush just last night are exactly the kinds of measures that the conference discussed last week and agreed would be extremely helpful in that respect. Fifthly, we had the announced or reported agreement by a number of countries to implement measures right now in advance of the convention but which are consistent with it; for example, the Australian decision announced last week to establish the nucleus of a new national secretariat on chemical weapons to start doing right now all the things that will need to be done in the context of a universal convention. Finally, we had agreement last week to bring the momentum up to as much of a gallop as we possibly could so far as the conclusion of the convention was concerned with the general acceptance that 1990 was the critical year and that there was an excellent prospect that the substantive outstanding issues would be able to be resolved within that time frame providing everyone got down to the task in the way that I have indicated the conference was confident would occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        Supplementing that very important exercise last week, since then we have seen bilateral discussions between Messrs Baker and Shevardnadze in Wyoming, in which the contribution of the Canberra conference was, incidentally, acknowledged, during which agreements were reached that will expedite work towards concluding the chemical weapons convention. The parties agreed, as has been reported, on a data exchange, a verification experiment, a cooperative effort with respect to the destruction of chemical weapons, including reciprocal visits to monitor each other's destruction operations, and agreement on some procedures for conducting challenge inspections.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, last night President Bush announced in the United Nations that his Government would accord an even higher priority to achieving a chemical weapons convention than it has in the past. He made quite specific a number of commitments as an indicator of the United States Government's seriousness. President Bush said that the United States would destroy 98 per cent of its chemical weapons stockpile within eight years of the entry into force of the Convention provided the Soviet Union also adhered to it, that the United States would totally eliminate its entire stockpile within 10 years after entry into force of the Convention provided all chemical weapons capable states became parties by the eighth year, and that it would reduce its stockpile to less than 20 per cent of its current levels, as the negotiations continue, again provided that the Soviet Union did the same.
       </para>
       <para>
        Needless to say, Australia very much welcomes these announcements and developments of the last few days at the bilateral superpower level. I make the point, however, that when we are talking about chemical weapons we must have solutions which are multilateral and universal in scope. This is not an area of disarmament or arms control the running of which can be left to the superpowers. Multilateral diplomacy is crucial. That is why, again, last week's exercise in Canberra-of which I think Australia can be very proud-was so important for advancing the cause which we all believe in.

I also refer to the Government's disgraceful pre-election bribe in the face of threatened job losses at the Kodak plant in the Federal electorate of Wills. Is the Government aware that next month the Dunlop company is proposing to close down one of its Melbourne shoe factories with up to 500 job losses? As an Australian grown multinational corporation does Dunlop have a stronger claim to assistance than does Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd as the Australian subsidiary of a United States multinational company with a $20 billion global turnover? In order to ensure orderly queueing by those many fragile Australian manufacturing companies fighting desperately to survive in the face of record high interest rates, will the Minister please spell out the criteria which the Government has applied to the Kodak welfare hand-out? In view of the Minister's suggestion to Senator Lewis that if and when a decision is made on this matter he will announce it, precisely what did he mean when he first answered Senator Lewis's question by saying that he was a party to the Cabinet decision? What decision was he referring to? If the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility is indeed not yet dead, does the Minister support the right of the Treasurer to dump all over the decision and to distance publicly himself from it as he has manifestly done?

But, in fact, it is not a very smart question because, like most questions we get from the Opposition, it is steeped in profound ignorance. Senator Alston used the Dunlop footwear example. Pacific Dunlop Ltd is consolidating its footwear operations at two sites rather than at about six. That is the reason for the closure of that plant. The second thing that the honourable senator ought to know, which his shadow Minister for industry might be able to tell him, is that if there is any industry which is really assisted by government in this country with enormous levels of assistance, it is the footwear industry. He ought to know that. The honourable senator has based a very clever question on an example which is totally ignorant, as one would expect from this Opposition.

         â€”Mr President, this is an extraordinarily noisy Opposition this morning. Senator Alston then asked what was the decision I referred to in my answer to Senator Lewis-the decision of Cabinet to which I was a party. The normal procedure is for Cabinet to make decisions about various things and, at an appropriate time, for the Minister responsible to make an announcement about that decision. That is precisely what I will do. I guess that Senator Lewis ought to get all these questions back and reshuffle the pack. When I announce the decision he can ask them again because he, Michelle Grattan in the Age, or any other journalist who has commented on this question, do not know what is in the Cabinet decision. That is their problem. The simple fact of the matter is that when it is appropriate to announce the Cabinet decision, I will do it.

He has been able to issue a press release and all that about this stuff. The fact of the matter is that it is not a Minister's obligation to censor the press in respect of things it wants to write. I am not going to say anything to the press-it can write that. If the press happens to be ill-informed, that is bad luck. Senator Alston's allegation in his supplementary question that the Treasurer publicly dumped on this decision is not true. Honourable senators should read the report of the Treasurer's press conference of Friday to see what he said about this. Senator Alston, in ignorance again, is relying on speculation about what the Treasurer's attitude might be to this issue. The Treasurer dealt with this matter at his press conference on Friday, and he did not dump on the decision. Both the honourable senator's question and supplementary question are based on ignorance and ill-informed speculation-and that is not unusual. If Senator Alston is an aspirant for Senator Chaney's job in the Senate he will have to do better than he has done in this Question Time.

         â€”Come on! The main concern of the Government, however, is to resolve the whole issue. If the issue is resolved promptly, welfare concerns equally will be resolved promptly. On the basis of resolving the whole issue, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, wrote to the Saudi Arabian Minister for Water and Agriculture on 7 September. In so doing he outlined a series of propositions which should resolve this issue, put our long term trade on a predictable footing, put it on a scientific basis concerning quarantine matters and mutually address what are emerging as the common concerns between Australia and Saudi Arabia. It is against that background that I will now go to the particular questions Senator Jenkins has asked.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the case of the first question, preliminary advice from the shipowner involved is that the Government's policy of conducting formal inquiries into voyages which return with an overall mortality result of 3 per cent or higher may need to be implemented in relation to some of the recent consignments which have been re-routed from the original port of destination in the Persian Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer to the second part of the honourable senator's question is no. The ships masters' reports are provided on the basis that confidentiality is maintained by the Government. However, the Government provides detailed statistics on mortality rates, without revealing the ships involved, to the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, as well as to researchers involved in projects aimed at improving understanding of animal welfare problems in the live sheep trade and at developing new standards. On that basis we will give Senator Jenkins an aggregate figure, but we will not identify individual shipments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The mortality data provided after the E1 Cordero has unloaded will be subject to the constraints that I mentioned a moment ago. I understand that the shipowner is still involved in commercial negotiations. He has asked that information provided to me be protected and I intend in all the circumstances to protect the confidence of the advice passed on to me. Senator Jenkins referred to a new quarantine protocol. Saudi Arabia has not proposed a quarantine protocol to Australia.

The contents of that decision and the details relating to it will be announced in due course. Regarding guarantees being given by the company, the Government or anybody else relating to the retention of the plant in Coburg, at this stage no guarantees have been given by the corporate headquarters of Kodak International. That is a matter which is subject to further discussion, as all these matters are, as I have indicated in answers to earlier questions. I read the comments reported on the front page of the Australian newspaper yesterday which were made by some executive or other of Kodak, but there are all sorts of reports emanating from all sorts of sources and their validity or otherwise is not a matter which I would seek to determine by press comment. I do not place much credence on those reports in some of the articles in the press.

         â€”It was reported a few weeks ago that Mr Peacock, who had floated the idea of a different taxation treatment for interest received and interest paid, had admitted to being approached by business figures voicing their objections to his proposal. Of course, it will be no surprise to learn that one of those business figures was the Federal Liberal Party President, Mr Elliott. Once Mr Elliott got on to Mr Peacock and twisted his arm, it was clear that the proposal was going to be dropped like a hot brick. Of course, it has already been dropped like a hot brick by a number of people in the Opposition, such as Senator Stone, Senator Chaney and, I think, Dr Hewson. But it is not surprising that the idea did not appeal to Mr Elliott because the First Boston report on the value of fully paid ordinary shares in Elders IXL showed that the company has a total net debt of almost $2.2 billion.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I was asked by Senator Foreman whether the business figures' opposition to the proposal was the same as the Government's opposition to it. I do not believe that it is. The business community's opposition, and in particular Mr Elliott's opposition, to the proposal arises from self-interest. The Government's objection to Mr Peacock's partial indexation proposal is that it would cost around $3 1/2 billion or $4 billion in revenue; and it would create major distortions in investment patterns, particularly when it was considered in association with the Opposition's stupid idea to abolish the capital gains tax for assets that have been held for more than five years, thereby providing an even greater incentive for people to speculate in real estate instead of investing in productive enterprise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, and maybe most importantly of all, the Government is critical of this proposal because of the enormous technical complexity involved in it. If Mr Peacock wanted to give the tax evasion-avoidance industry a kick-start, he probably could not have done anything better than to put up this proposal. As I have said, we need not fear. John Elliott got hold of Andrew Peacock a few weeks ago, pushed his arm up his back until at least his neck, and we will not see any more of this stupid proposal when the Opposition finally produces its taxation and expenditure policy, which is supposed to be next week or the week after but which I do not expect to see this side of Christmas.

         â€”Is the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications aware that while the Prime Minister was in Port Pirie last week he clashed with an elderly man who had the temerity to challenge him about his disastrous mishandling of the pilots dispute? Did the Prime Minister dismiss this man with the words `silly old bugger'? Is it a fact that this encounter was filmed by an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) news cameraman who was later told by the Prime Minister not to use the film? Is it also a fact that the incident was not shown in ABC news coverage but was picked up by the ABC's 7.30 Report and screened in some States, and certainly in Queensland where I saw it? I ask the Minister, after those factual questions, whether he approves of the abusive terms in which the Prime Minister referred to the elderly gentleman in question.

Subsequent to that, the decision was vindicated when a leaked report from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries detailed a number of specific cases where the rules clearly had been abused and taxpayers' money had been improperly handed out to various National Party apparatchiks in Queensland. That report was leaked. Of course, it was very clear that it would be irresponsible to continue to allow Federal taxpayers' money to be maladministered by Queensland authorities in the way it clearly had been.

        I understand that the author of that report has since been sacked by the Queensland Government, which is the sort of thuggish behaviour we have become accustomed to from National Party governments in Queensland and which I expect will be resumed very shortly now that Mr Ahern has been replaced. There was, I understand-I did not see it myself-a report on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television news last night that the Queensland Public Accounts Committee which had been investigating this matter would have its report either delayed or possibly not presented at all. I am not too sure about those facts and I do not know whether that has any direct relationship to the fact that Mr Cooper is now the Premier and that perhaps he may have had a few drought loans as well. I will see what I can do to find the information requested by Senator Crowley, but the administration of the drought relief scheme was in the hands of the States and the one lever that effectively the Commonwealth had-which was to require certain information prior to the grant of any additional funds-is no longer available because the program itself has been terminated. I will see what I can do and let Senator Crowley know.

         â€”I am advised by the Minister that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is operating on the following basis so far as foreign pilots are concerned. Where the operation is undertaken under the provision of an international agreement, flight crew standards remain the responsibility of the foreign regulatory authority. In circumstances where it is agreed that the CAA should accept regulatory responsibility, certain licence validation procedures are required. This involves theory examinations appropriate to the routes to be flown, with an oral examination in lieu of a written examination in appropriate circumstances and a demonstration of competence in the aircraft prior to revenue services. That is in the context of foreign aircraft being flown by foreign pilots.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Where it is a matter of foreign pilots flying Australian-registered aircraft, the foreign pilots are required by the CAA to meet the standards of knowledge and skill required for the issue of an Australian air transport pilot licence. This assessment is made, I am advised, after an analysis of the theory, knowledge, flying experience, foreign licence and aircraft endorsements of pilots individually, the environment in which the pilot has previously operated and the one in which he or she will operate in Australia. It is also based on an analysis of the capability of the training and checking organisation of the Australian domestic airline in question. Examinations, flight training and the testing required are then identified by the CAA and the airline is advised of the requirements. Once we have the initial analysis the determination can be made of what is required by the CAA and the airline can then be advised. When the requirements have been complied with an Australian first-class airline transport licence is issued to aircraft captains prior to unsupervised revenue operations. Similar arrangements apply for co-pilots at that standard.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am told, and it is fairly evident, that there have been a lot of uninformed comments about the arrangements that have been put in place by the CAA to deal with the current difficulties. The bottom line is that the CAA will not authorise any operation in Australia until it is completely satisfied about the safety of that operation. We are very conscious of the very fine safety record that this country has had in aviation and the Government and I remain absolutely confident that the CAA, in this difficult time, is behaving as responsibly as we would hope and expect it would.

         â€”My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is the Minister aware that the dividend imputation system has been criticised for inducing companies to pay out too high a proportion of their profits in dividends and retain too little for investment?

         â€”There has been some criticism of the dividend imputation system for the reasons that Senator Schacht has stated. However, it is ill-informed criticism because it ignores the fact that companies can retain control of profits for re-investment within the company providing they issue franked bonus shares or take advantage of dividend re-investment schemes. The Elders IXL Ltd announcement, in my view, has more to do with Mr Elliott's desperation because too many shareholders are accepting his-that is, Harlin Holdings Pty Ltd-bid for their shares, and he is trying to provide shareholders with an incentive to hang on to their shares. There is an alternative interpretation and that is that Mr Elliott will be a major beneficiary of a further bonus issue of shares which Elders has recently announced. In the past he has been a very major beneficiary of bonus shares particularly, of course, because of the little rort he has been pulling for the last six or seven years by issuing to himself and a number of other directors-including the endorsed Liberal candidate for Barker in the next Federal election-one cent paid shares which, although they probably receive no dividends themselves, attract bonus shares in exactly the same proportion as do fully paid shares.

       </para>
       <para>
        The basic 1c paids don't get dividends, of course-that would be stretching things. But the 821,427 free ordinary fully-paid Elders' shares they gave to Elliott in the company's numerous-amazingly numerous-bonus issues do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr McCrann concluded the article as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Intriguingly, Elders has been one of the most prolific bonus issuers on the lists-six since 1983, and all but one on very ``generous'' terms. And it just happened to make two in the 12 months after Mr Elliott got his big lump of 1c paids in 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is an alternative interpretation of the motive. Of course, it is most unusual for a company which has just announced a major fall in profit, as Elders IXL has done, to simultaneously announce yet another bonus share issue. This is the seventh in a period of six years.

         â€”By way of preamble, simply as a senator from the island State of Tasmania, which is beset by particular difficulties as a result of this dispute, I must say that the withdrawal by major domestic airlines of discounted air fares has created great turmoil amongst Tasmanians. From that point of view I have taken a particular interest in the comments by the Trade Practices Commission. There is real cause for concern in relation to its effect both on people who have already purchased their tickets and, obviously, on those who are unable to fulfil their expectation of purchasing at reduced prices.

        The Trade Practices Commission is investigating this matter. On 25 September it wrote to the two airlines seeking their comments. Any refusal to honour existing tickets may contravene some of the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974, including the prohibition on unconscionable conduct. It is in that context that Professor Baxt's comments have to be seen.

       <para>
        I am advised that the Trade Practices Commission also considers that the possible concurrent withdrawal of discounts could amount to an arrangement in relation to prices in contravention of section 45 of the Trade Practices Act. Comments have also been sought from the airlines on this point. A number of articles have appeared. I do not know whether the letter from Mr Tambling, First Assistant Commissioner, Fair Trading and Consumer Protection Division, to the airlines has been published but I am quite willing to table it for the interest of Senator Durack and other senators.

       </para>
       <para>
        1. Is it a fact that on 7 June 1989, three days after the Tiananmen Square massacre, UNFPA allocated $76 million to the PRC for its population control program?
       </para>
       <para>
        Allocations of funds by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) are agreed to by the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The Governing Council comprises donor and recipient governments. On 7 June 1989, the Council's Committee of the Whole recommended by consensus that its plenary session adopt a proposed program of UNFPA assistance to China. The cost of the program was US$57 million over five years commencing in January 1990. The plenary session subsequently agreed to the recommendation.
       </para>
       <para>
        UNFPA has stated that all projects under the proposed program, as in all UNFPA-assisted programs, will be undertaken in accordance with the principles and objectives of the World Population Plan of Action. The Plan of Action states that population policies should be consistent with internationally and nationally recognized human rights of individual freedom, justice and the survival of national, regional and minority groups; that respect for human life is basic to all human societies; and that all couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibility the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Is it also a fact that the US Government strongly condemned this action and reiterated its stand not to fund UNFPA because of UNFPA's support of the PRC's population control programs, which involves violations of human rights, including coercive abortions and involuntary sterilisations?
       </para>
       <para>
        The US Delegation was the only one to speak against the proposed UNFPA China program for 1990-1994. The US did not, however, block consensus. The US delegate simply stated that the reason for withholding the US annual contribution to UNFPA for the past four years had been UNFPA's participation in China's family planning program. He did not indicate which aspects of the China program the US ``strongly opposed'' or mention, as suggested by Senator Harradine, ``violations of human rights, including coercive abortions and involuntary sterilisations''.
       </para>
       <para>
        The US decision to withhold funds from UNFPA has been based on its interpretation of a law first adopted by the US Congress in 1985, which states that no US funds shall be given to an organisation that ``supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization''.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision is not based on any clear evidence linking UNFPA with coercive population activities in China. Most US opponents of funding for UNFPA object to any UNFPA association with the Chinese population program at all on the grounds that funds are fungible: this is, the availability of UNFPA funds for population programs may enable the Chinese Government to use its own resources for other purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other donors with equally strong human rights concerns and policies not only support UNFPA's program in China, but have substantially increased funding since the US decision to withhold funding. In regard to this it should be noted that UNFPA does not regard abortion as a suitable family planning method and it does not fund any abortion programs in development countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. By contrast, is it a fact that the current budget doubles the amount Australia pays to UNFPA and that Australia's delegate at the UNFPA meeting on 7 June 1988 gave strong support for the payment of aid moneys for China's population control program? Why has no reference made to the political environment three days after the Tiananmen Square massacre, when that body paid an amount of $76 million to the PRC Government?
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's voluntary contribution to UNFPA's 1990 core budget will be A$1.25 million compared with A$680,000 for its 1989 core budget. This demonstrates the importance Australia attaches to helping developing countries solve their population problems and the confidence we have in UNFPA's ability to deliver effective programs in a way that does not violate human rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Committee of the Whole at the UNDP Governing Council (which is also UNFPA's governing authority) Australia, along with Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Bangladesh and Romania, spoke in support of UNFPA's proposed China program. The Australian statement, with its emphasis on the humanitarian nature of UNFPA's proposed China program, gave two reasons for supporting the program. The first was that a co-ordinated world-wide effort to come to terms with population problems would be incomplete without a UNFPA program in China, the world's most populous country. The second was the program's emphasis on maternal child health and family planning at grass-roots level in poor and remote areas, where the infant mortality rate is still too high.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 7 June Committee of the Whole meeting was a non-political working meeting to consider proposed new UNFPA population programs for the Philippines, Algeria, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, El Salvador, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Panama, Sao Tome and Principe, Togo and Zimbabwe as well as China. No delegates, including the US, made any mention of the political environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. I ask the Minister in view of the fact that he ignores the evidence that has forced the United States Government to cut off funds to the UNFPA regarding the coercive program in China, is it a fact that he agrees with the excuse of AIDAB that the Chinese Government has stated that coercive population activities are illegal in China? Are we to take the answer by the Chinese Government because after all it said nothing happened in Tiananmen Square?
       </para>
       <para>
        For many years the Chinese Government has consistently asserted that it is firmly opposed to coercive population activities. Chinese officials have acknowledged that there have been instances of coercion, but they argue that these have been atypical and the result of overzealous cadres and have not been with the approval of the central Government. The Chinese Government also maintains that it punishes those responsible for abuses. There have been newspaper reports of such punishments being meted out.

        This dispute, which is causing so much damage to Australia, has been going on for more than six weeks. Over that six-week period we have seen a government which seems determined to make the dispute worse rather than to see it brought to a constructive end. I have moved this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders because of the enormous damage which is being done not only to Australia as a nation but also to a whole range of individual Australians who are seeing their life's work destroyed by the length of this dispute and by its effect on tourist traffic in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        From a national point of view, we have had some extraordinary descriptions of the impact of this dispute on Australia. We have seen the tourism industry as one of the hopes of our nation's recovery. We have relied externally on farming and mining for many years but tourism has become a most significant contributor to our hope for recovery. The leader of Japan's travel industry has described the pilots dispute and its potential to deter tourism as worse than Chernobyl. The Chairman of the Japan Association of Travel Agents has said that the pilots dispute ranks with the killings in China's Tiananmen Square or the Chernobyl accident in its capacity to deter tourists. A series of estimates has been put forward as to what the dispute has cost Australia so far and what it is likely to cost Australia. According to a national survey which was referred to over a week ago, the dispute had so far cost the national economy nearly half a billion dollars and 15,000 jobs. It was expected to reduce the number of overseas visitors next year by one million and slice $3 billion off foreign exchange earnings.

        I am sorry that Senator Button does not bother to read the articles by Professor Richard Blandy that have appeared in the Australian. He was referred to one of them in Question Time today. Professor Blandy, in an extremely good summary of this dispute and the damage it has done to Australia's industrial relations system, set out the cost of the dispute. He put down a series of calculations which suggested that the cost could be about $3 billion for the tourist industry by the end of this year. Those substantial national figures hide the fact that this dispute is destroying a substantial number of minor players in the tourist industry. By that I mean people who do not make the headlines and who do not have the clout to visit the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to seek support-people who run tourist buses; people who run restaurants; [Bpeople who run motels; people who provide goods and services for tourists. In my own State of Western Australia a firm that provides catering services to domestic airlines is losing between $8,000 and $10,000 per week. That firm has had to lay people off work.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are the sorts of examples that can be multiplied one thousand times. We say it is time that the Parliament made its view known about the way this Government has handled this dispute. It is not a dispute in which the Government has stood back. It is a dispute in which the Government is intimately involved. The Government owns one of our major airlines. Australian Airlines is totally government-owned. That airline is a major participant in this dispute. The Government has pursued an interventionist stance. From the first days of this dispute the Government has been involved not at the level of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris), or the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), but Mr Bob Hawke has personally supervised and taken control of the Government's approach to this dispute. His intervention has been an absolute disaster. The major interest that is being protected by the Prime Minister is not the national interest. We can look at what has been protected by the Government and we can see that the accord ranks first and that, essentially, the Government is protecting the central plank of Labor policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not see that in a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders I should detail all of the concerns which underlie our belief that the Government should be censured. I just wish to outline to the Senate that there are significant reasons why this matter should be dealt with now and why Standing Orders should be suspended. The Government has shown an absolute contempt for the people who operate businesses in North Queensland, Central Queensland, the south of Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia who are seeing their livelihoods destroyed by the prolongation of this dispute, largely thanks to the intervention by this absurd Government. The involvement of the Government has been preferential. The Government has, as usual, shown preference for its mates. Again, that is a matter which I would like to expand upon in a substantive debate.

        There is no doubt that this country-or barnyard as George Orwell would have described it-is not one in which all animals are equal. Some animals are very much more equal than are others under the Hawke regime. That is a matter of deep concern to the Opposition. I ask: How many Australians feel that they are as important to Mr Bob Hawke as are Mr Kelty and Sir Peter Abeles? For those reasons I seek the support of the Senate for the suspension of Standing Orders. I believe it is time that this Government was censured. I hope that that might be a factor in getting the Government to change its ridiculous approach to this dispute.

         â€”I will offer a brief comment. Earlier in Question Time Senator Button cited the uniqueness of this dispute; indeed, I think we would concur that it is a unique dispute. One aspect of that uniqueness has been the extraordinary ineptitude and partisanship of the Government in this dispute. The Australian Democrats believe it most appropriate that this chamber proceed to consider whether it censures the Government on its handling of the dispute and will therefore support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.

        Senator Ray argues that there has been inadequate time to prepare a response to the censure. The Government has had six weeks and has used the whole of that six weeks, and would use more weeks given the opportunity, to continue its position which is quite well-established and quite well stated. I imagine that there will be no inadequacy on the part of Senator Ray to defend the Government's position in this censure motion. The Australian Democrats will support the suspension of Standing Orders.

         I must say that the words uttered by Senator Ray in responding to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders certainly demonstrated the first point that I intended to make in this debate; that is, that this country is slipping into a Third World status. If ever there were a graphic illustration of the contempt that this Government has for Parliament, it was in the words that were expressed by Senator Ray, `We will be censured, but so what'. In other words, the democratic process, the process whereby a chamber of this Parliament indicates to the Government that it regards the Government as worthy of censure, is something which is regarded as nothing by Senator Ray. Who should be surprised at that when we look at the other Third World attributes of this country under Bob Hawke's prime ministership?
        </para>
        <para>
         The truth of the matter is that the people sitting in this chamber today are seeing an Australia which, for the first time in generations, holds out for its people the hope of a worse, instead of a better, future. We have had six years of Labor government, six years under the accord, and the seventh is under way. In four of those six years Australian wage and salary earners have had lower earnings. In other words, their wages have gone up, but inflation has gone up even more, and in four of Labor's six years real incomes in Australia have declined. According to the Budget, in this, the seventh year of the Labor Government, real incomes will decline again. The Government will tell us that this is part of Australia's national economic recovery. The truth of the matter is that during those same 6 1/2 years we have seen an enormous ballooning of our foreign debt. This country is in a perilous situation as far as foreign debt is concerned. In last month alone, we had a further $2.6 billion deficit in the balance of payments figures. That is another Third World characteristic. We have declining incomes for people, increasing international debt and, of course, an inflation rate which is way out of line with that of our trading partners.
        </para>
        <para>
         Now we can add to that a Third World air service. After six weeks of this dispute, the Government is presiding over an air service which consists of the cobbling together of elements of the armed forces and of the airlines. People have been brought in from overseas, some of whom have not been able to pass the Civil Aviation Authority safety checks. Less than half of airline capacity is being met. We have reports of near misses. We have a circumstance which is an absolute joke in a modern country. This Government has presided over this circumstance and, in our view, has utterly contributed to it. All of this, in our view, has come about by courtesy of the leadership of Mr Bob Hawke. This debacle of a dispute is an amalgam of prime ministerial arrogance and the strong Labor streak of governing for its friends and not governing for the Australian community.
        </para>
        <para>
         In terms of the arrogance of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), which has been demonstrated throughout this dispute by his behaviour, let us look at the most recent example, and the Labor Party's response to it, raised today in Question Time by Senator Stone. On one element of our national television service yesterday we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister referring in a certain way to an elderly citizen of this country who had dared to challenge his approach to the airline dispute. What did the Prime Minister call that person?

Can honourable senators imagine Mr Ted Harris being referred to in those terms? Of course not. Instead, we have this arrogant Prime Minister treating with contempt a citizen who had the rare opportunity to challenge a prime ministerial view.

         What about Labor's streak of governing not for all the people but for the select, for its friends? This dispute has thrown up Labor's complete subservience to the views of Mr Kelty and Bob Hawke's subservience to the views of Mr Kelty and the accord. Mr Hawke's craven capitulation on stand-downs is just the latest example of who calls the tune in this Government. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, led by Mr Kelty, put limits on the stand-down of strong unionists in the airline industry. The Government has thereby agreed to cough up the taxpayers' money to pay for the privilege of ensuring that there are no stand-downs of Mr Kelty's and Mr Hawke's friends. That is the way this dispute has been conducted. There has been a capitulation to Mr Hawke's friends and no consideration of the national interest. The Government alone is to be condemned for this extraordinary compensation decision which totally ignores the hardship being faced by people in the tourist industry. Why is it good enough for Sir Peter Abeles's request to be met and the request of thousands of others to be left? After all, Mr Williams of Hamilton Island has been fairly vocal about the damage which has been done to him. This is but one example. There is no suggestion that he and his suffering should be relieved by taxpayers. No, that is something to be left until later when the tourist industry is being rebuilt.
        </para>
        <para>
         I suggest that Mr Hawke and Peter Dowding should compare notes. In Western Australia we have had the glaring example of Western Australia Inc. No one in Western Australia would suggest that the Labor Government of Western Australia treats all its citizens equally. If one is one of the high flying businessmen who joined with the Western Australia Government to form Western Australia Inc., one gets special deals every day. Hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars have been handed over to Labor's mates. Now the same pattern is developing in the Federal jurisdiction. Today we heard from Senator Button, who has watched Australian firm after Australian firm close down and who has pursued policies which have required the restructuring of Australian industry. Suddenly, he will not even tell us whether or not a decision has been made to pay $60m to an American company which has threatened to close down part of its Australian operation. The whole pattern is re-emerging: assistance for Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd but not for Pacific Dunlop Ltd which has relocated one of its major factories-the Ansell factory-offshore. It did so very unhappily, as the Minister would know, but there was no question of compensating that company. The factory has gone to Asia, has it not, Minister?

          â€”I think the matter is far more sinister than the mere electoral advantage of the Prime Minister. It goes to the whole question of governing Australia not for all the people but for Labor's friends. I think the Australian public are getting used to that. They are used to that being a central part of the way the Government has operated. We censure the Government because this extraordinarily damaging dispute need never have been. In the Opposition's views, it could have been a guide as to how Australia could solve its problems instead of making them worse.

        </talk.start>
        <para>
         In my introductory comments on the accord I mentioned the difficulties that Australia faces: declining real incomes and increasing debt based on declining or stagnant productivity. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures for Australia show that between 1987 and 1990 productivity will decline by 0.2 per cent a year. Our trading competitors have increasing productivity. The only way for Australia to solve its economic problems is for that to be changed. What we need, if we are to solve Australia's problems, is a surge in productivity. What the pilots dispute could have provided was a perfect demonstration on how to improve efficiency and incomes and benefit consumers. Instead of that, the tourist industry has suffered a dreadful blow. I have already referred to the huge losses to that industry.
        </para>
        <para>
         What could the Government have done? It could have said to the parties, `What this country needs is an increase in productivity and prosperity. What it needs, therefore, is for the pilots and the airlines to accept that the airlines need to be more efficient and if those efficiencies can be obtained there is room for better pay for the airline pilots'. That is the simple message that can be put out. It can be made more complicated by admitting that the pilots are people who are in international demand. Australian pilots are regarded well internationally and there is a very strong market for their services internationally, as we have found with many of them being recruited overseas. The basic economic message that the Government should be trying to promote is that if parties get together, work cooperatively and improve productivity, there is room for increased wages instead of declining wages, which is the gift that Mr Hawke has given the people of Australia through the accord.
        </para>
        <para>
         There should have been an attempt to engage the parties in constructive negotiations to demonstrate what can be done to solve Australia's problems. Instead, there has been a totally negative and destructive approach from the Prime Minister and the Government. The Prime Minister in particular has cemented in the dispute. I will go through the issues in respect of which the Prime Minister has made a negative impact regarding the settling of the dispute. From day one, what was his response? He referred to a declaration of war on the pilots. Before there had even been an industrial dispute, when there was simply notice of an ambit claim for a 30 per cent increase-do not tell me that the Prime Minister is not familiar with ambit claims: they are made as a regular part of trade union activity under our arbitration system-the Prime Minister's response was, `Well, boys, this time it's war'. He declared war without attempting to find out whether the matter could be dealt with in a sensible and productive way. That was his term for the pending dispute; it was the term he used when the dispute was a few days old.
        </para>
        <para>
         The dispute is before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which is something Bob Hawke is supposed to support and uphold. However, he has left the Commission powerless. He has given it no authority to enforce its decisions. If the Commission proceeds to arbitrate this dispute next Thursday, as it has promised it will, just what authority does it have and what pressure can it put upon the Government? I understand that it can impose a fine of $1,000. I doubt whether that will have very much influence on the parties. It may, in fact, deregister the Federation. I do not think that will have any influence on the parties.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government and Bob Hawke have left the Commission naked. We have been suggesting for years, just as Mr Willis said in the Parliament two years ago, that if we are to have a centralised system it has to have effective compliance procedures and changes should be made to the Act. We have been saying, `Let us make those changes to the Act. Give the Commission authority and power to enforce its decisions'. What has happened? Nothing. The Commission has been left naked by its friend the Prime Minister.

         We had the Prime Minister's immediate support for the cancellation of awards. Again, within a day of this dispute being heard-indeed, on the very day that the pilots were called upon to show cause-we had the cancellation of their awards-unprecedentedly quick action by the Commission fostered by the Prime Minister, driving the parties away from the Industrial Relations Commission. It is fascinating that, even before that decision was made, Bob Hawke was supporting the direct use of common law against the pilots. That is a very interesting proposition because until now Labor has consistently opposed the use of common law in industrial disputes.
        </para>

         The amazing thing about this use of the common law in industrial disputes is that it was immediate and it was threatened before the Industrial Relations Commission dealt with the hearing of the dispute. It was done quite differently from the way it was done in those other great disputes which have done so much to illuminate Australian industrial relations-the dispute at Mudginberri and the Dollar Sweets dispute. In the case of Dollar Sweets-the case of a small business man being oppressed by the trade union movement-the dispute went on for nearly six months before there was resort to the common law.
        </para>
        <para>
         In this case, the threat of common law action by the Prime Minister preceded the cancellation of the pilots' award. Compare that with the statements the Prime Minister made when the Mudginberri dispute was on. The present Prime Minister was the Prime Minister of Australia at that time. He was as much in charge of the Government as he is today-that is, he sat under Mr Kelty's thumb even then. What he was saying at the time of the Mudginberri dispute was that the use of harsh legal sanctions was counterproductive. He totally opposed the use of the remedies which he has encouraged in the pilots' case. That is just one of the many examples of prime ministerial hypocrisy and cant in this whole dispute. He has turned the whole of his tradition and Labor's tradition on its head. He has made immediate resort to the common law his starting point in the handling of this dispute and he has totally turned his back on everything he has said about this issue in the past.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think most Australians believe that one of the most significant deficiencies in the Prime Minister's approach to this dispute has been his abuse of the pilots. We have the most extraordinary situation where the Prime Minister has talked of the pilots as being no more skilled than bus drivers. He said on 22 August:
        </para>
        <para>
         The greedy pilots are no more special than bus drivers.
        </para>
        <para>
         He said that the pilots annoyed the hell out of him. He said that the pilots spent only eight hours a week at the stick. He said:
        </para>
        <para>
         It is a different game this time boys; you go out and it is war.
        </para>
        <para>
         That was the Prime Minister talking on 22 August.
        </para>
        <para>
         His abuse of the pilots, his categorisation of them as people who are unskilled, or not very skilled, and not requiring any special reward is clearly absurd. Look again at the hypocrisy of this man when he sends a personal letter to the pilots, within a matter of a few weeks of the abuse that he has dished out to them, telling them that they are decent, responsible individual Australians, `many of whom began their careers in your distinguished profession with splendid service in the Defence Forces of this nation'. He went on to say:
        </para>
        <para>
         We recognise fully your important contribution to the progress and prosperity of our nation. I am glad to put that acknowledgment on the record.
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not think the Prime Minister got very many satisfactory responses from that letter. They had put up with week after week of abuse from this strutting man and their response to this letter of commendation from him was contemptuous.
        </para>
        <para>
         We then have the Prime Minister's embrace, as the only option out of this dispute, of the use of private contracts. If ever the Prime Minister stood condemned, it is by his condoning of private contracts on the basis that the pilots should be denied representation. It has never been any part of the Opposition's approach to industrial relations that people should be put under pressure and refused representation. The Opposition's industrial relations policy specifically acknowledges that if one is moving into a voluntary agreement-and I stress voluntary-then the parties are entitled to be represented so that their interests may be protected. Our policy goes further than that. It says that if the parties wish they may be represented in those negotiations by the trade union of their choice. In other words, we do not take it out of the hands of any employee to determine who shall represent him in negotiations. We take the view that that is a matter for the employee. Therefore, if the pilots wish to speak through the federation, that is their choice and not the choice of the employer.
        </para>
        <para>
         That brings me to my next point. What is quite extraordinary about this dispute is Labor's complete abrogation of any regard for the principle of freedom of association. The Prime Minister goes around as a great exponent of the International Labour Organisation, as a man who has been tipped to head up the International Labour Organisation-we are told that he is going to be the Secretary-General of the International Labour Organisation-and here we have a situation where the primary objective of the Prime Minister is to crush this particular Federation.

          â€”In response to Senator Collins who calls `Hypocrite!'-and I will perhaps have more to say about him later-I point out that the right of the pilots to be spoken for by the Federation is being denied by this Government. It sits very oddly with the whole of the history of the Prime Minister and his attitude to these matters in the past. Again, I accuse him of hypocrisy in that regard. We turn to the use of foreign labour as strike breakers-another interesting precedent from the pilots dispute. It is a great way to get the parties together and negotiate-to bring in strike breakers from overseas. How will the Government respond when there is next a dispute on the waterfront and it is thought that we could bring in some Korean waterside workers or perhaps some from the United States? After all, in the United States our colleagues on the waterfront there manage to load and unload ships twice as fast as the Australians using the same equipment. Will we be able to bring in a band of waterside workers from the United States or Korea? The list goes on.

          â€”I am indebted to Senator Collins for reminding the Senate of Senator Stone's excellent exposition of this point on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television, which was of great assistance in exposing again the Prime Minister's hypocrisy in this dispute. We have the refusal to have any mediation. A succession of parties-sometimes from the Opposition, people in industry, the pilots themselves-have suggested that in this intractable dispute we might use some mediator. Sir Laurence Street has been suggested by a whole series of commentators. There has been a total rejection of that suggestion from the Government. I have already addressed the matter of selective compensation. The truth is that nothing could be more designed to prolong this dispute than the simple fact that the Government has been prepared to subsidise one side, one element, of this dispute. There is, therefore, a reduction of the pressures which would normally apply in the marketplace, to which the Government has thrown these parties, to go to the negotiating table.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         Of course, there is the Government's failure to use its position as the owner of Australian Airlines. The Government is the owner of not half but nearly half of the air services which are so badly affected. It has stood by and allowed this situation to run on and has made no intervention of the sort that has been advocated by the Opposition, which would at least have tested whether negotiations could have produced a constructive solution.
        </para>
        <para>
         Finally, I touch on the question of safety. We have a situation where, as I said before, we are operating the airline services in Australia on a cobbled up basis. No one can be satisfied that we are maintaining the exacting and highly successful standards which have always applied in Australia. I suggest that this is a matter which should have weighed heavily with Mr Bob Hawke. Instead, we have this total bull-headed and pig-headed opposition to negotiation, even though for weeks there has been a clear readiness on the part of the pilots and the airlines to make changes which would form the basis of successful negotiation and outcome, and, on the part of the pilots, a clear readiness to return to work and to negotiate.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Opposition has never advocated surrender to union blackmail and we have not in this case. In his desperate attempt to cover his own failed interventions in this matter, the Prime Minister has tried to label us as the partners and friends of the pilots. From the first day of this dispute the Opposition made it clear that it would not accept gun at the head demands of the sort that were originally made by the pilots. We made it clear that if the pilots remained within the arbitration system, there should be an effective sanction to ensure that they could not just engage in indiscriminate industrial action. We have made it clear that we support the use of common law remedies-as we always have, unlike the Prime Minister. We have made it clear that we support the use of the Trade Practices Act-as we always have, unlike the Prime Minister. We have made it clear that we support that great armoury of things which can be used in industrial disputes to reduce the suffering of the community-as we always have, unlike the Prime Minister. But the substantial difference is that we have seen this dispute as a classic situation where negotiation was possible because both parties had so much to gain, and so much to lose by the continuation of the dispute.
        </para>
        <para>
         What did they have to gain? The airlines had to gain the productivity improvements that are essential as they move into a deregulated environment. That does not require the artificial intervention of arbitration, of the sort which is now likely, the sort that has recommenced this week. It requires the application of the mind of management to the running of the organisation and the running of that organisation in the most efficient way possible. On the part of the pilots, we have a readiness to acknowledge the need for changes in work practices and for increases in efficiency. That is the basis on which the pilots may get increased remuneration.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is an extraordinary situation for the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), to say at Question Time today that it was all right outside the system for a wage rise of 40 per cent to be obtained if it was backed by productivity. That is a very interesting bearing out of the range of possibilities that are open in this dispute. If that is so, why in the world has the Government continued to harp on the question of wage guidelines when clearly there were good economic outcomes for the airlines and for the pilots? For the airlines there were efficiency gains which are essential to them, and for the pilots there were efficiency gains which are essential to pay increased wages which they seek.

        <para>
         This has been a disaster of a dispute for Australia. It has cost Australia hundreds of millions of dollars already and in the long term it will probably cost us billions of dollars. It is a dispute which comes at a time of economic crisis. We condemn the Government and particularly the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, for his mishandling of this dispute.

          â€”I am told that on the office wall of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, in Melbourne, there is in pride of place a letter from Norm Gallagher of the Builders Labourers Federation which says, `Congratulations, fellas, we tried to wreck the wages system too'. Senator Chaney has used a lot of his time criticising the accord. The accord is Government policy and the Government will be sticking to that policy in terms of centralised wage fixation systems, subject to such flexibilities as can be introduced into the system and were introduced in the last Industrial Relations Act passed by this Parliament.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         In the course of the last few weeks Senator Chaney and other Liberal senators have raised a number of matters of public importance regarding the pilots dispute and have used those debates as an excuse for trying to salvage the Liberal Party's industrial relations policy. It is now recognised that Senator Chaney's character is such that when he sees a window of opportunity he takes it, as he did with his former leader in this place. On this occasion he has taken the opportunity to move a censure on the Government without warning. This is very much a recycled issue.
        </para>
        <para>
         I will deal with one or two of the main points which Senator Chaney made. First, he began by saying that it was time for a censure motion because under the present Government the future for Australians will be one in which they will be worse off rather than better off. As evidence of that, he cited that in four out of six years Australians have received lower real incomes-lower by one per cent a year-and that that was said to be part of Australia's national recovery. It is, because due to that policy half a million more Australians are in employment and earning money than were in employment under our predecessors. Those people and their families understand the benefits of that policy, or should do so. An article in the Australian Financial Review on 13 September this year talked about the redistribution of national income from wages to profits which has taken place under the present Government. The Australian Financial Review writer, Michael Stutchbury, states:
        </para>
        <para>
         This fact seems to be conveniently forgotten by those who are now squawking for an abandonment of any centralised rein on aggregate labour costs.
        </para>
        <para>
         I assume that in the squawking category he includes Senator Chaney. He continues:
        </para>
        <para>
         By correcting what in the 1970s was seen by these same people as the Australian economy's fundamental imbalance (the so-called real wage overhang), the Accord has underwritten the corporate profit boom which in turn is funding the current surge in business investment.
        </para>
        <para>
         The current surge in business investment is fairly relevant to the fundamental philosophical points which Senator Chaney made. Investment levels in this country at the time of the Fraser Government averaged 2 per cent improvement a year. Under this Government in the last five years there has been a 10.5 per cent improvement in investment in Australian industry. Of course, that is a difficulty in terms of the current account. But the fact is that that has been the level of investment and that goes very much to the question of productivity which Senator Chaney has been bleating about. The empty promise in Senator Chaney's rhetoric is that somehow a government of the 1970s-a Liberal government under which investment and productivity levels and so on were at record lows in this country-will be reborn and will introduce enormous productivity changes which will result in increased wages, for some people perhaps.

          â€”Senator Chaney asks whether I have asked how many Australians feel that way. It all depends who one asks. Senator Chaney knows that. He gets psyched up when he goes back to Perth, talks to a few of his mates and thinks he is talking to Australians. The second issue which Senator Chaney went to was the question of industry support. He says that I would not say anything about Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and tried to suggest that this was a case of governing for Labor's friends. I do not know what that means in the context of the Kodak dispute but it is another pen picture, a bit of Opposition front bench demonology which Senator Chaney likes to engage in to psyche himself up for speeches in here and which is not of much relevance to the question at issue. The suggestion here is that somehow I have watched, as Senator Chaney put it, hundreds of Australian firms close.

         I must say that I have watched a hell of a lot open compared with when he was in government. I have watched 200,000 more people gain employment in manufacturing industries than when those opposite were in office and I have watched factories open all over the country. That is because of the restructuring process is taking place throughout industry-something which would be new to those opposite because it just did not happen in their time in government. There was no restructuring of the manufacturing industry then. In fact, the catalyst for restructuring has been the reduction in tariffs and other mechanisms adopted by this Government. In so far as that reduction of tariffs has occurred-65 per cent since 1970-not one percentage point reduction has occurred under a conservative government. Yet those opposite tell us about the difficulties of restructuring and what we ought to do about it.

         Then Senator Chaney went on to make the point about Pacific Dunlop not being helped with its restructuring. Pacific Dunlop is very well helped by industry assistance measures in Australia and I do not want to follow Senator Chaney up that course because it is part of the demonology of his speech. I guess he gets to the point of what he is trying to say in respect of this issue when he says that the pilots dispute would have provided an example. The Government, or somebody, could have said to the pilots, `We want better pay from the airlines and better productivity from the pilots.', and so on.

         I remind the Senate of the circumstances in which the airline pilots dispute started in this country. The Pilots Federation now says, `We deeply regret the damage done to the tourism industry, but it is beyond our control'. Between February and April this year, prior to this dispute, the Federation's newsletter had this to say:

         A major reason for the stop work being called was to inform you of the major battle ahead. It will be a real battle as we will be fighting the Government, the arbitration system, the companies and all the vested interests in Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Federation talked then about `prolonged industrial action', and also put pressure on its employers for a 30 per cent pay increase-an average increase in pay of $24,000 per pilot. It told its members, through its newsletter, the following:

         At some stage in one's working life the potential to face a non-income period exists. By careful planning beforehand the full impact of such a non-income period can be dramatically reduced. Be prepared to adjust your lifestyle during the non-income period, e.g. eating at home is cheaper than eating out. Some may see this period as an excellent period to go fishing, start a lawn-mowing business-

        <para>
         and so on. That is the atmosphere in which the Australian Federation of Air Pilots approached this dispute.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Chaney waffles on about the desirability of conciliation. Is there any room for conciliation when the attitude is, `We are going to have a prolonged fight. We can go fishing. The people who are stood down in the tourism industry can't go fishing, but we pilots can. We can take a holiday and go fishing while this country is being held to ransom'? With all the planning by the Pilots Federation for prolonged industrial action and a non-income period, as it called it, it now says, `Any question of damaging the tourism industry in Australia is beyond our control.'.
        </para>
        <para>
         Those are the words with which the pilots dispute started, and the claim for 30 per cent increases is still there. Senator Chaney talks about an ambit claim when he well knows that only last week the President of the Industrial Relations Commission, when inviting the pilots to put their position to the employers-the airlines-said that it would give the pilots the opportunity, effectively, to abandon that 30 per cent claim. They have not done so to date. The pilots want 30 per cent; others are prepared to accept much less under the terms of the national wage guidelines and principles.

          â€”Senator Crichton-Browne would be hard put to make anybody cry-or laugh, for that matter. I am making the point that these were the circumstances in which this dispute came about. The pilots were saying, `We don't care about anybody else. We've got to be prepared to stick it out for months on end. We want our claim. We're ready for a battle with the industry, the Government, and the vested interests including tourism interests. We're ready for all of that'. They talked of prolonged industrial action for a 30 per cent pay increase. This is the same Federation which, last November, said, `We have the best pay and work conditions in the world', while in February and March of this year it has said, `We want those conditions to be 30 per cent better'.

         What is the Government's attitude to all of this? It is simply this: as distinct from 1981 and 1982, we are confronted with difficult economic circumstances internationally. The Liberal-National Party Government of Mr Fraser let the wages system blow out. It allowed a wages system which produced a 14 per cent wage increase in one year and a 16 per cent in the next. That is what happened in 1981 and 1982 under a Liberal government. What happened as a result of that? Three quarters of a million Australians were thrown out of their jobs and had to walk the streets.

          â€”Oh yes, says Senator Lewis, our Prime Minister was at the back of all of that. Your Prime Minister was at the front of it, old son. Why was he at the front of it? It was more important for him to flit off to London to attend a royal wedding than confront the issues facing him here. When he flitted away to London to a royal wedding, none of those opposite knew what to do. And none of them would know what to do now, because they are incompetent. That is the truth of the matter. In those years there were 14 per cent and 16 per cent increases in wages and massive unemployment as a result, from which it has taken this country years to recover, yet the Opposition comes in here advocating the same sort of recipe. It says that we have been nasty to the pilots, who want a 30 per cent increase. If the pilots are given a 30 per cent increase, other increases will follow and unemployment will rise. People will be thrown out of jobs. That might be what those opposite are about, but it is not what we are about. We are not about seeing thousands of people thrown out of work because of the indulgence of a select group of employees, the air pilots, and the results that will flow through to other employees. It is as simple as that. That is not what this Government is about. That is why the accord and the wages system are important at this difficult time. They are important not only in stabilising employment but also in shifting the emphasis on increased profit shares on companies, which have led to very big increases in investments and which will lead to increased industrial capacity and so on into the future-things we have not enjoyed in the past.

         I find it a bit funny that those opposite come in here, after they had seven years in government when none of these hard issues were tackled, and lecture us about how they will tackle them if ever they get into government again.

         In the last few days the Industrial Relations Commission has been active in trying to arrange a discussion about this dispute. The Government welcomes that. We hope the parties approach the dispute in a constructive way. The Industrial Relations Commission President also invited parties not to comment publicly about the issues in the dispute. Senator Chaney, seeing a political opportunity, has leapt in. He has not acceded to that invitation from the President of the Commission at all. There have been plenty of comments from all sorts of political spokesmen, including some from the Opposition. Many of their views have changed. Only on 25 August the Leader of the Opposition said:

        <para>
         That is what Mr Peacock said-the Government is correct. One has to go beyond individual parochial interests and look at the national interests. A month later, when the Liberals come back from their electorates, having found that the tourist industry is feeling the pinch a bit-we know the industry is feeling the pinch; people in various parts of Australia have been sadly inconvenienced by this dispute-they say, `The Government ought to be censured for what it has done in relation to this dispute'. The Opposition started off by saying that we were correct in sticking to our guns but, when Opposition members feel a bit of pressure on them out there, they come back and say, `The Government should be censured for this'. That is an example of the Opposition at work.

That represents a substantial change from the position that he put at an earlier stage. Of course, the most substantial change of all is the bipartisan support which was given for the Government's approach to this issue earlier and the backing away from that for pragmatic, unprincipled reasons. The Opposition has again seen a bit of potential mileage. Every time one of those issues arises in Australian politics one can tell what the Opposition is going to do. It listens for the loudest noises and it supports them. It is not a question of supporting any principle. It listens for the loudest noises and then comes back in here and moves censure motions on the Government. That is not about the process of government; it is about the process of perpetual opposition, to which I believe the Opposition is condemned.

It is, undoubtedly, the most serious industrial dispute to have afflicted this nation in decades. Its ramifications are absolutely profound. It raises the gravest of questions about the motives of the Government and the pilots. It reveals serious inadequacies in our new industrial relations legislation and the machinery of its implementation, namely, the Industrial Relations Commission. It exposes the grave inadequacies of the alternative industrial relations model which is propounded by the Opposition and which would be introduced should the next election bring a change of government. It has compounded an already deep balance of payments crisis. It has devastated the lives of Australian small business-people. It has seriously affected the lives of almost every ordinary Australian.

        <para>
         I reiterate: It is the most serious industrial dispute to afflict our nation in decades. The realities are, of course, that no party is without blame in the handling of this dispute. It has become the most complex of issues. It has seen dramatic shifts in logic and in position, so that it has become so confused that the public must indeed be utterly disillusioned at the power and motive of government in maintaining order in our community. Although no party in this dispute is without blame, the final responsibility rests with the Government and in this case the Government is either unable or unwilling to resolve this dispute. The attitudes of both the Government and the pilots have forced a situation of general impotence. Never have we seen a dispute where there has been so much floundering on the part of all of those who we assume to be responsible for resolving difficulties in our community. We all feel utterly impotent in addressing this dispute because of the complexities, some of which have been directly and deliberately contrived by the Government.
        </para>
        <para>
         The pilots started off by saying they would negotiate but not within the system, not before the Industrial Relations Commission and not concerning the size of their wage rise. Some negotiation! This attitude appears to be softening somewhat and hopefully on Thursday we will move closer to a more rational position on the part of the pilots and on the part of all those involved in the dispute. The Government has made many bellicose statements concerning this dispute. We have heard the now famous declaration of war against the pilots by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We have heard the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, say, `We will never negotiate'. Just days ago Mr Willis said that he is not certain whether the Government will necessarily appear before its own Industrial Relations Commission two days from now. Today the Prime Minister has said that his Government may not necessarily accept the decisions of the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission when it meets on Thursday.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Industrial Relations Commission will finally hear the dispute this week, but the Prime Minister now says that the Government will not necessarily abide by the rulings of the Full Bench of the newly established Industrial Relations Commission-that massively overhauled centrepiece of Australia's new industrial relations system; the jewel in the crown of the Government's industrial relations policy; the organisation which the Government now says is irrelevant. The Government raises doubts that it will accept the decision of the Full Bench of that Commission.
        </para>
        <para>
         Every Australian is an owner of Australian Airlines and as far as this owner is concerned, I want the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate between my airline, its management and my ex-pilots. There should be, and I believe there is, no uncertainty about that in the minds of the majority of Australians. Why has the Prime Minister changed from the magician who once created conciliation out of conflict in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to the warmonger of the industrial relations system? The current public attitude of the Government is inexplicable. The only way it can be explained is by the assumption that there is some hidden agenda being worked through. What is the real agenda? The negotiations all seem to be with Sir Peter Abeles and Ansett Airlines, a company which, I am advised, has not disclosed its financial circumstances for the last eight years at least. What is the Government doing? Is there a Hawke-Abeles agenda which we do not know about? Is there a pre-privatisation and deregulation strategy? It certainly looks that way to the Australian Democrats. There is no logical explanation beyond this hidden agenda which explains the Government's pattern of behaviour in relation to this issue over the last six weeks. Assuming there is such a strategy at work, how would it be put into action? Several actions which have already taken place would be very advantageous to the owners of a privatised, deregulated airline in this country. The destruction of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots as a strong entity would be in their favour. The consolidation of the relative advantage of the majority of pilots over the few-the few being the 400 or so who are now being removed from the system-and the wastage of that surplus of 400 is the productivity trade-off.
        </para>
        <para>
         Today's announcement that advance purchase discounts have arbitrarily been scrapped by the airlines no matter what the agreement was with the customer when the ticket was bought has also added to the general atmosphere of discontent, frustration and distrust of the airline system as it now stands. It is hard to imagine how the public could be more confused and rightly more distrustful than under the circumstances that now exist. The overwhelming perception of the public in all this is one of greediness on the part of all concerned-to start with, the pilots, and now the airline management. What about the greed of those outside the wage fixing system? What about the greed of executives, such as those in the semi-government organisations, some of whose salaries have recently risen by as much as 100 per cent? There is an atmosphere of pervading greed and malevolent distrust. The public is very frustrated by the apparent abandonment of the newly-established industrial relations system, in particular by the very Government that created it. The Government heralded into place one year ago a new industrial relations system to replace that which it claimed was grossly inadequate after 75 years of constant amendment and abuse. This industrial relations system was put in place by this Government one year ago and is now brought down by the same Government without any explanation or rational reason other than some hidden agenda that serves the needs of industrial magnates in this country. The Australian Democrats are determined to persist with this exposure.
        </para>
        <para>
         What about the attitude of the unions? The ACTU has not backed the pilots but has backed the management of the airlines. The union movement as a whole is not happy with the way in which the Government is handling this dispute. Gross disagreements are beginning to appear within the union movement as to what is unfolding before its eyes. Strike breaking by the military and by imported labour does not sit well with the union movement in this country. It flies in the face of the traditions of how we have resolved industrial disputes in Australia in the past.

         What about the Government's decision to compensate the airlines for losses incurred during this dispute? We believe that this compensation sets a dangerous precedent which needs the most thorough of examinations. The Government is compensating public and private companies for losses incurred in a dispute which was initially beyond their control. It is now in their power to accept the ruling of the Industrial Relations Commission and possibly put an end to the dispute. They are saying that they will not agree to do that, but they will put their hands out for $100m of taxpayers' money. The Government will hand out $100m of taxpayers' money to big business-and that is an important qualification-and only big business in this country. In fact, the hand-out is to Abeles and Murdoch. If the Government is determined to compensate big business, why is it not willing to compensate those whose very existence depends on the airlines, such as those in small businesses which are going bankrupt, which are being financially ruined? Their lives are being massively disrupted by this dispute. Big business has some chance of survival. I do not know what the profitability of Ansett Airlines is, but I am sure that it is vast. I know that the profitability of many small businesses, businesses that are going to the wall in their thousands, is marginal.

        <para>
         What about those airline employees whose lives are being massively disrupted? What about the Ansett employees who have been required by the airline to anticipate three weeks of next year's leave; whose bills have all arrived at once and they cannot pay them? If people such as the individual I spoke to last week were stood down-but there has been an agreement between the unions and the airlines that there will be no stand-downs-they could claim on the mortgage insurance policies to which they may have been contributing for several years and meet their mortgage repayments. But the only way in which they can do that now is to take their recreation leave in anticipation of next year's leave. The person I spoke to has been told by the airline that if he were to resign and take other employment to feed his family and to pay his mortgage, he would have to pay back to the airline salary in lieu of next year's leave which he has already taken.

         There are thousands of people who are equally inconvenienced by this dispute. Is the Government considering compensating them? Of course it is not. It would be insane to attempt to compensate everybody who is inconvenienced by this dispute. Can it seriously consider compensating State governments for the impact of this dispute? Yet the Government is saying that it will compensate its own airline, and Sir Peter Abeles and Rupert Murdoch, with our money. It is an extraordinary situation, yet Senator Button as Leader of the Government in the Senate and Senator Robert Ray as Manager of Government Business resent the fact that we are moving to censure the Government. What an extraordinary state of affairs.
        </para>
        <para>
         What about the Australian Airlines employees who are being forced to take long service leave? They are being told to take long service leave irrespective of whether they need it, irrespective of whether they and their wives were making arrangements to go on long service leave in six months time. Of course they do not have any choice. It is the only form of income which these people will have access to in these extraordinary circumstances. Senator Button said earlier in Question Time today that this was a unique situation. That was his excuse for not answering questions about it. Of course it is a unique situation. We have never seen the likes of it in the history of our nation. Who will fund this compensation? The taxpayers will foot the bill. Will the Government try to tack the $100m on some obscure section of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which will be before the Senate in a couple of weeks' time? How will the Government get the $100m? I am advised that the so-called slush fund, or, in other words, the Advance to the Minister for Finance for urgent and unforeseen expenditure-what an appropriate name!-will be tapped into by Senator Walsh to pay his mates. There is only $174m in it. About $60m is already committed and the rest will go. How will the Minister obtain funds if there really are further urgent and unforeseen circumstances? Presumably he will come begging to the Senate for them. There has been no consideration of what will happen under those circumstances.

         The Government is adopting an adversarial approach similar to the industrial relations policy espoused, ironically, by the Opposition-a policy which would, if continued, lead to a dramatic wages break-out. One of the real ironies of the situation is that the Government has abandoned its stated, formulated, legislated form of industrial relations and has shifted to the alternative model, pursuing it in the interests of wealthy business. In doing so, ironically, it exposes the weakness of the very model that we will receive should there be a change of government.

The Government has helped the airlines with their hidden agenda on the reform of the airline industry.

The realities are that in 1987 the Willis Bill, supported by the Australian Democrats, contained the very elements which would have resolved this dispute. Those elements were taken out because of the outcry and the threat from the New Right to bring down the Bill and send it to the wall at a cost of $9m. It can be reasonably argued that the pilots dispute brings the effects of that system into focus. As I have said before in this place, we are experiencing industrial chaos of the type that the Opposition's industrial relations policy will inflict upon Australia.

We have had revealed the gross inadequacies of the Opposition's formula and model which would be put in place should there be a change of government.

         The pilots have a powerful union which has attempted to exercise its muscle. It is a powerful union because so few people are trained to do the job. The use of international flights and Air Force planes has been provocative and inadequate, as we are now all painfully aware. This has been the most destructive industrial dispute that Australia has seen in many years. Its long term effects will be horrendous and wide-reaching. Many innocent third parties will be sent bankrupt and Australia's economy and international reputation will suffer for decades.

         There are many contradictions in the Government's position in this dispute. There has never been any way out of this dispute other than that which is proposed for next Thursday-that is, to talk, to listen, to accommodate and to compromise. That is the very essence of industrial relations; yet it has taken six weeks, mainly through the deliberate jeopardy of the Government, for that process to be put in place. The Australian Democrats support this censure motion. We believe that it is just and appropriate to censure this Government for its gross mishandling of one of the most critical disputes that we have faced in decades.

          -During the debate speakers have touched on a number of issues, not only the issue of industrial relations but also some other quite fundamental issues facing Australia. However, one thing has been accepted-that is, the devastating consequences to industry, small businesses, employment and the personal lives of thousands and thousands of Australians. This industrial dispute has caused havoc and has ravaged many thousands of small businesses particularly in my State of Tasmania. I make a plea for the State of Tasmania because Tasmania, of all States, has been most severely affected, so much so that the Premier of the State, on behalf of the Government-the Opposition has indicated the same-has written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seeking compensation for losses to the State's tourist industries and other industries which depend on regular, reliable, commercial airline services for their very existence.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         What concerns me is the selective nature of the compensation that has been dished out thus far by the Government itself. What further concerns me, from the answer that was given to my question this morning, is the response that the Government has given to the letter of the Premier of Tasmania. The response that the Leader of the Government (Senator Button) has given me shows that the Government has not made a decision on that request. It seemed to me that the Leader of the Government was not even aware that this letter had been written and this request made. However, I will concede that Senator Button did acknowledge Tasmania's special dependence on these regular and reliable air services. I am not the only member of Parliament from Tasmania who is critically aware of the suffering and pain that has been caused in my State as a result of this particular dispute.
        </para>
        <para>
         Unfortunately, the Leader of the Government's reaction and response to this censure motion was inadequate. He attempted to paint a very good picture of the increase in employment over the last six years since this Government came to power. Indeed, he stated that over half a million more jobs have been created in that time. I do not think that ought to pass without comment, because most of those jobs are part time jobs and are for women who are being forced into paid employment to ensure that the family can live.

          â€”Can survive and, indeed, pay the mortgage. Interest rates have skyrocketed and have placed an enormous burden on families both young and old. For the last 10 years in my own State not one new full time job has been created for males. This is a matter of tremendous concern to me as a representative of the State of Tasmania. The Government talks about real wages. What are real wages? When I came into the trade union movement 30 years ago the basic wage was still in awards. Indeed, the basic wage component existed for another five or six years. In the history of the development of real wages, that wage was to enable its recipient to feed, clothe and house a family. The total wage then came in. I was against the total wage, but it came in. What I warned of at that time has occurred. Underlying all of this Government's economic policies is the tragic fact that it is demanding that a family have two incomes in order to make ends meet. That is a disgrace. It gives no true freedom of choice for mothers to devote the time they want to the upbringing of their children.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         I raise that because a lot has been said in debates on this issue about the question of real wages and about the question of productivity. Very little has been said about the question of equity, about the question of need and about the right of a family to exist on one income and for that income to be adequate for that purpose. Have I heard that around this chamber today? No, I have not. It is about time we heard more about it. The people of Australia are getting sick and tired of the economic doubletalk that we hear from the Government. I ask the Opposition to rethink what it is talking about in its laissez faire approach to the system of industrial relations. I ask it to consider whether its proposals will ensure a degree of equity for the person I was talking about. Will those who are in the cream industries, the profitable industries, get the cake? Will it be a case of the survival of the fittest? Is that what we as members of parliament seeking a just and fair society ought to be on about?
        </para>
        <para>
         I should like to turn to a couple of other questions that have been raised following the comments I have made about the survival of the fittest. I ask the Opposition whether its reliance on section 45d would have worked in this particular case. Has it worked? It was open for action to be taken under section 45d. Indeed, the Prime Minister and Government Minister appeared to be indicating as much. Orderly industrial progress depends on the desire of the parties to the system to see the system work. That is the answer. If the parties to the system are not prepared to see the system work they have two options. One is to opt out of the system and the other is to have in place in the industrial relations legislation compliance provisions which will ensure that the system works. One of the problems-I have said this over a number of years-of the emasculation of the compliance provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and now the Industrial Relations Act is that we have extremes. Some say that we should go to section 45d of the trade practices legislation, others that we should have no provisions at all as to compliance. My view is that one of the problems of the industrial relations system now is that over the years the compliance provisions have not been maintained or enforced. I believe it is in the best interests of the trade union movement itself to ensure that this occurs, otherwise it will be faced with the imposition of legal sanctions which operate from outside the industrial relations system.
        </para>
        <para>
         In this case it is my view that neither of the parties to the industrial dispute desired fully to see the system work. I say it is an industrial dispute because section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution says that the Parliament has the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth in relation to the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. Clearly it satisfies the latter criterion and the former because the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is a registered industrial organisation. It seems to me that the Federation of Air Pilots had no intention of seeing that the system worked, because it knew the guidelines that had been laid down by the industrial relations system, and yet, as early as February this year, the Federation gave a warning to the effect that it would make this claim, which it knew would be outside the guidelines.
        </para>
        <para>
         The other party, the airlines, knew that a deregulated environment would occur next year and that such an environment entails the survival of the fittest. The airlines knew that a number of pilots would have to be shed, to use the euphemistic term. They knew that certain actions would need to be taken. Indeed, we saw one of those actions taken recently with the axing of the Friendship fleet which services north-western Tasmania. Anybody could foresee that the airlines and the pilots would be at loggerheads and that there would not be the ready availability for the matter to be determined within the system of conciliation and arbitration. One wonders why, under those circumstances, the Federation of Air Pilots remained a registered organisation; indeed, one wonders why certain other actions were not taken by the Government to forestall what was obviously going to be a crucial and protracted dispute, having a devastating influence on the whole of Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         Due to time limitations, I will just touch on another aspect which may have been mentioned in these discussions but which has not been discussed at length. I raise this aspect not only as a trade unionist but also as one concerned with the defence of this country and with the utilisation of the defence forces for the purposes for which they were established-namely, the defence of this country. I refer to a letter that was published in the Australian on 22 September 1989 by Air Vice-Marshal B. H. Collings. It raises the question as to whether the use of the Australian Defence Force is for the purpose of giving assistance to the civil community or whether it is an aid to the civil power. They are very important questions in my mind which I have not heard addressed in depth. Approximately 10 years ago I raised the issue of the use of the Australian Defence Force as an aid to the civil power. I can see a case for the ADF to assist the Tasmanian community. There is no other alternative for Tasmania. There is no road transport; there is inadequate sea transport. I want to read what Air Vice-Marshal Collings said. I do so for the purpose of eliciting from the Government at some stage a response about this question. The air vice-marshal said:
        </para>
        <para>
         Some commentators have expressed mild concern that all might not be kosher in this matter, but they have failed to grasp the full implications of this misuse of the ADF.
        </para>
        <para>
         There are two instructions to the ADF concerning the use of ADF in support of the public; these instructions are issued on the authority of the minister. The first concerns the use of the ADF in giving assistance to the civil community and the second concerns aid to the civil power.
        </para>
        <para>
         In the case of assistance to the civil community, the ADF can assist civilian organisations under a cost recovery policy which is subject to the minister's prerogative. The main circumstances under which such assistance can be given are: It must be of training value to the ADF, or There must be no suitable alternative, or, It must be in support of an event of national significance.
        </para>
        <para>
         The air vice-marshal went on to elaborate. As I indicated, unless I misunderstand him, clearly so far as Tasmania is concerned there is no suitable alternative. Air Vice-Marshal Collings explained what is meant by `an event of national significance'. He then went on to say:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Prime Minister, in his letter to the airline pilots, talks of the ``national emergency created by the federation of Australian airline pilots''. Perhaps, then, the ADF is being used in aid to the civil power, i.e. to maintain law and order by assisting the civil authority, i.e. the Government, in action against an unlawful action of a section of the community.
        </para>
        <para>
         If this is the case then the ADF would have to be ``called out'' by an order of the Governor-General-in-Council. Was this done in this case?
        </para>
        <para>
         So the letter went on. I invite honourable senators to read that letter, which I think is of considerable significance to the consideration of this issue by the Government and the Parliament. As I said, I raise that issue not only as a trade unionist but also because of my concern about the use of the Australian Defence Force.
        </para>
        <para>
         In conclusion, I wish to re-state that we are all seized with the enormity of the effect that this dispute is having on the lives of ordinary Australians, on small businesses, on employment and on the tourist industry. I believe that it is acknowledged that my State of Tasmania is suffering the worst because of its geographical situation. I believe that there is need now for the Government, whether it is maintaining its position or not, to provide compensation not on the selective basis on which it has done so already but as it has been requested to do. I invite the Government to take that decision and make the declaration today so that people in my State can have some confidence in the future. At present they lack that confidence.

          â€”in reply-In a sense, the closing words in this debate from Senator Harradine reflected the great concern the Opposition has about a number of matters, including this industrial dispute. Indeed, I opened my own contribution to the debate on the censure motion which I moved against the Government by referring to the general decline in living standards and the pressures on people in the community, at a time when Australia's international debt is increasing. I described it as something of a Third World scenario, and the airline debacle that we have been debating today is a part of that Third World pattern which should be strange and alien to Australia.

        <para>
         In the light of the obligations which the Senate has I do not wish to make a lengthy response to the speakers who have taken part in the debate. With respect to Senator Button's reply on behalf of the Government, I reject his attempt to put the Opposition in alliance with the pilots. I simply remind the Senate that from the very beginning the Opposition made it clear that it did not support gun-at-the-head industrial relations negotiations, and did not support this particular claim. What the Opposition does support is a constructive discussion between the employers-the airlines-and the employees which would do something to achieve the productivity improvements which can be achieved. The pilots have obviously been used quite inefficiently in many respects, and it is open to the airlines, as they admit, to increase greatly the number of flying hours per pilot. Some of the gains that are thereby obtained can fund wage increases for the pilots.
        </para>
        <para>
         It was fascinating to listen this morning to Senator Button responding to my question about whether a contract with an individual pilot which effectively gave him a 40 per cent pay increase for flying the same number of hours as are on his current roster is outside the wage guidelines.

It will be a tragedy for Australia if employers and employees cannot go down that track without the risk of blowing the whole wage system out of the water. In the end, that is what the Government would claim-that even in the circumstance where members of the Australian work force can greatly increase their efficiency and earn substantially increased amounts, they should not be paid those increased amounts because that would cause a flow-on and do great economic damage to Australia. What an indictment of the system of industrial relations and what a terrible barrier to solving Australia's problems. If we are to solve the problems of our international debt, high interest rates and the declining living standards that are the lot of the people about whom Senator Harradine was expressing concern, we have to become a more productive country. We have to learn to work together and share the benefits of working together. It is absurd to say that the strait-jacket of the accord, which has delivered declining wages because our productivity is not improving, is a satisfactory system for Australia.

         In this particular dispute we find that as recently as today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has returned to his abusive mould. At a time when the Industrial Relations Commission has, on its own initiative, re-entered this dispute and asked the parties to desist from comments while they exchange views, we find the Prime Minister again abusing not just the Opposition-after all, we expect to be abused by the Prime Minister-but also the pilots, at a time when I would have thought the objective was to get the parties talking constructively either inside or outside the confines of the Commission. The action of the Prime Minister today simply underlines the key concern that we have that this disastrous dispute, which is inflicting so much hardship on so many Australians, has been lengthened and exacerbated by an impetuous and self-willed Prime Minister who has shown no judgment and who, to this very day, seems to make his primary objective the destruction of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots instead of a sensible return to work on proper terms.

         Senator McLean used this debate to make some points against the Government which, in general, I found very acceptable. He also made some points against the Opposition. Let me at least briefly acknowledge those points. I think Senator McLean, as do so many people, misunderstands the basic thrust of the Opposition's approach to industrial relations. I must say that if there is that misunderstanding I have to take my share of the blame for it as I am the spokesman for the Opposition in this area. It is no part of our industrial relations approach to have lawlessness and a lack of accountability in either the centralised system-the system under the Industrial Relations Commission-or the system of voluntary agreements which we believe would add to the effectiveness of our country, and improve working conditions and productive output. The Opposition says that the present system is deficient in the way that Senator Harradine mentioned in his speech. It is a deficiency that has been acknowledged by the Government but that the Government is not prepared to fix. When the Pilots Federation was before the Industrial Relations Commission and it defied the Commission, there was nothing effective the Commission could do about it. Our policy is not to have an ineffective system; it is to have an effective system. If one is within it, it should have effective compliance provisions, and I think that general principle was endorsed by Senator Harradine in his comments.
        </para>
        <para>
         There seems to be an inadequate understanding of voluntary agreements. We are talking about circumstances in which the employer and the employee believe that they can get a better deal for themselves by talking together outside the system. Those people who can see ways of improving the productivity of their operations are the sorts of people who will go down that track. If a powerful trade union or a bullying employer tries to overbear the other side of the employment equation, then the other side may seek the protection of the centralised system. That is part of our policy. It is a mutual opting out policy; it is not a unilaterally opting out policy.
        </para>
        <para>
         The only other point I want to add is that for that to make economic sense the Opposition of course accepts that employers and employees must not be in a position where they can do sweetheart deals and load the cost on to the public. Until now that has been possible in the airline industry. The two-airline agreement gave Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd a monopoly. It has enabled them to operate simply on a cost-plus basis, and to hell with Australian consumers. We say that a deregulated competitive environment removes that privilege and enables an agreement to be hammered out in a realistic economic environment.
        </para>
        <para>
         I turn very briefly to Senator Harradine's concerns about real wages and equity and the problem of the single income family. In response to Senator Harradine, I say that Australians need to understand that our individual welfare is dependent upon our country growing in the way that countries around us are growing. We now know that Hong Kong, in per capita terms, will be a richer country than we are, as will Singapore. We know that our previous status as the economic giant in our region is declining. In relative terms Australian living standards are going down. We have to unlock Australian productivity. The Business Council of Australia says that Australian firms are 25 per cent less efficient than European firms. It says that the difference is the lack of an enterprise focus in industrial relations. Nothing is more important to the people that Senator Harradine has sought to speak for today, the same people that Senator Walters and the other Tasmanian senators speak for, that same constituency-the single income family; the battlers of Australia-than that Australia should become a more productive country. It is only by adopting a positive attitude in issues such as the pilots dispute, which was an opportunity to enrich Australia instead of impoverishing Australia, that we will do something for the constituency that Senator Harradine talked about today.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Harradine referred to the Trade Practices Act. We believe that the Trade Practices Act would be applicable if there were any truth in the allegation made by Ansett through Sir Peter Abeles and by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, that threats were being used to prevent pilots returning to work. We made public statements making it quite clear that the Government could have obtained an injunction under section 45d restraining anybody from acting in that thoroughly obnoxious and illegal way. In fairness, I should say that the Federation strongly denies such tactics. The point is that if the Government believed what it said, there was a legal avenue available to it to protect those pilots who wished to return to work.
        </para>
        <para>
         This is a most unhappy dispute, which is impacting with great cost on very many defenceless Australians, who have been deserted by this Government. It is tragic that the Prime Minister's arrogance, his vanity, his abusiveness, his determination to crush the Federation rather than see this dispute settled, have prolonged the dispute and the damage. I commend the censure motion. I demand that the Government change its approach to this dispute for the sake of Australia.

         â€”On Friday, 15 September, the management of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd in Coburg, Victoria told its work force that the Hawke Federal Government was prepared to give Kodak a package of some $12m per annum for five years, totalling $60m, and that the Cain Government in Victoria was also prepared to dig into taxpayers' pockets with a grant of $6m to enable Kodak to make a greater contribution to the international profits of Eastman Kodak of the United States and, in so doing, to retain its work force in Coburg in Victoria and not to dismiss some 400 or 500 people whose jobs were apparently at risk because of this decision by the United States company.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The simple fact is that the Hawke Government is in the process of bribing Kodak Australasia with taxpayers' funds. It is not as if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) were digging into his own pocket and providing his money to bribe Kodak. He is using taxpayers' funds not to close a section of the Coburg plant which is right in the middle of his electorate of Wills in Victoria. Why? As I said, it is because Eastman Kodak in the United States threatened a partial shutdown of the Victorian operation, with the possible loss of some 400 to 500 jobs out of the 1,500 jobs which exist in the plant. Eastman Kodak said that the reason for this was that the Australian company was not making a sufficient contribution to United States profits, to the profits of the parent company, and so the decision had been made in the United States to close down a section of the plant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make it perfectly clear that I am not critical of Kodak Australasia's management and work force. In fact, Kodak is a successful example of what might be called the new manufacturing culture, characterised by total commitment to quality, high productivity and multiskilling. I went to see this plant a couple of years ago when I first took over this portfolio. I was most impressed by the plant. I was most impressed by its research and development. I was particularly impressed by the attitude of the management and of the work force. There is no doubt that Kodak Australasia is a company of which we can be proud. At present it exports to Thailand, Taiwan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua Guinea and the Pacific Islands, and currently, until the end of year, to the Middle East in competition with the Kodak European operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The company management claim, and I have no reason to doubt it, that it is the second most efficient Kodak plant in the world. It is second by a very narrow margin. The Australian management of this company is doing the best by its work force in seeking taxpayers' funds to supplement its revenue. I am not critical of it for seeking that. My criticism is directed at the Government, at the Prime Minister and at the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, in particular, for agreeing to make this grant. It is directly contrary to all that Senator Button has been saying for 6 1/2 years as the Minister for Industry of this country. It is directly contrary to something that he said about a fortnight ago, as I will point out in a few minutes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The future of Australia's Kodak plant was under threat because the United States parent company, Eastman Kodak, is apparently under threat itself. The United States management was concerned that its international profits had been so poor that it may become the subject of a takeover bid, so it decided that it needed to restructure its operations worldwide. The United States management looked around and discovered that, although the Australian plant was the second most efficient in the world, the company could gain greater profits by using the Brazilian plant because the Brazilian Government was prepared to make very substantial subsidies to the Brazilian operation. The decision was made in the United States that the company would close down the Australian export operation and hand that over to the Brazilian plant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Government has decided to match, or perhaps to better, Brazil's bribe by providing Australian taxpayers' funds to the profits of the United States company. That is it in a nutshell. The Hawke Government is in effect paying Eastman Kodak Co. USA a contribution towards its profits in return for its not closing down a section of its Coburg plant. There is no other word for it: it is a bribe. Contrary to everything that Senator Button has said for 6 1/2 years as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, about not making hand-outs but having Australian industry become more efficient in its operations, the Government has made this decision. What happens if Brazil decides to match the Australian bribe or to up the ante?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button brought forward this plan to Cabinet. Apparently it was supported by the Prime Minister, no doubt because the plant is in the middle of his electorate and no doubt because he was anticipating the horrific figures of the current account deficit of last month-a deficit of $2.56 billion. That is the amount this country is down the drain in relation to its imports over its exports. The Government must have been aware that it would be an horrific figure. Quite frankly, the Prime Minister has clearly panicked. So the Government has decided to pick up this bribe, not worrying that, for example, last year Ansell International, makers of rubber products in Australia, closed down its Australian operation, with a very substantial loss of jobs and a very substantial loss of export income. That company exported condoms all around the Asian market. It has closed down its plant and moved its operation to another country. But this Government did not bribe that company. I will come to other operations which this Government has also not bribed.
       </para>
       <para>
        But now at this desperate stage when the Government is getting very close to an election, suddenly it starts to hand out taxpayers' funds for this sort of thing and that is why I am critical of it. It is the sort of thing that a government does in the death throes of an operation when it knows it is going down the drain and it grabs every opportunity it possibly can to survive on the political field. That is exactly the nature of this decision and it is why I am being so critical of the Government. Senator Button, having brought forward to Cabinet this plan which was prepared by his Department, when asked by a journalist about his contribution to this decision, said, `I had a part in the decision. That's all'. What a pathetic, typical attempt by Senator Button to distance himself from this decision of bribery. In the process he has totally destroyed his credibility. This decision destroys Senator Button's credibility as a genuine, good Minister for Industry in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        For four of the last 6 1/2 years people have been telling me what a great Minister for Industry Senator Button has been. Now he has destroyed whatever credibility he established. He sacrificed his integrity to political expediency. I understand that in the Cabinet Mr Hawke and Senator Button were supported by the Victorians as were Mr Howe, Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Robert Ray and Mr Duffy. No doubt Mr Hawke overrode opposition from the Treasurer, Mr Keating, who has made it perfectly clear what he thinks about this decision. He has publicly distanced himself from it, stating that the decision was `a judgment of government, not mine'. Of course, that is a ridiculous statement by the Treasurer because the Government makes decisions and all Ministers are responsible for government decisions. That is what Cabinet Government is all about. So whether Treasurer Keating supported the decision or not, he is responsible for it.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I mentioned before, Pacific Dunlop, an Australian owned multinational, recently closed its Ansell rubber operations in Victoria, and export income and jobs were lost. No bribe was made to prevent that. Smorgon Consolidated Industries and Gillette (Australia) Pty Ltd have also shed jobs in restructuring and Gillette closed down its manufacturing of razor blades in Australia. No bribe was made to prevent that.
       </para>
       <para>
        What test, principle or rule did the Government apply to give Kodak Australasia taxpayers' money, but not these other companies? None at all. Senator Button was asked repeatedly today to tell us the principles so that we can all get into the queue and so that all these manufacturers--

We have been saying for years that the Government must apply its mind to these areas.

       <para>
        Senator Button has used all the rhetoric along the same lines. He says that we must not allow industry to dip into the taxpayers' trough, yet at this last desperate minute, as the Government moves towards the next Federal election, it starts to hand out these sorts of funds to industry. I ask: Will the Government set out the principles, if any, which will operate to enable companies to drink at this trough? How deep are the taxpayers' pockets that will keep providing these funds? Where will the money come from? It will come from the pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers' pockets, not from the people who are smart enough to have companies offshore for the handling of their income. I ask: Was this decision a reaction to the massive current account balance for last month which Cabinet would then have anticipated, or was it a reaction to the furore over the Prime Minister's inept handling of the airlines dispute? Did the Government announce it at this stage knowing that it probably would not receive a great deal of publicity in view of the current airlines dispute? Was it politically inspired because Coburg is in the Prime Minister's electorate? Was it done to stave off the ever increasing numbers of jobs being lost in manufacturing around Australia until after the Government gets through the next election, or again using taxpayers' pockets to cope with the political problems of failed policies? Only last week Senator Button attended the Manufacturing Outlook Conference. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the final page of a speech which Senator Button made to that conference. He set out a summary of the things which he had said previously.

        In summary, I think we can identify seven fundamental elements necessary to provide a policy environment conducive to the development of a robust globally competitive manufacturing sector. These are:

       <para>
        first, the re-establishment of a favourable macroeconomic environment;

       <para>
        second, further steps towards removing current biases in the taxation system;

       <para>
        third, continued action in reducing industry protection;
       </para>
       <para>
        fourth, the continued flexible use of industry policy to correct for market imperfections (such as those associated with R&amp;D, venture capital and the dissemination of information); and to ensure that the maximum benefits are obtained from the Government's considerable purchasing power (e.g. frigates, submarines and Partnerships for Development);
       </para>
       <para>
        fifth, the development of an educated, well-trained and multi-skilled workforce with flexible working practices and with remunerations in line with skills and productivity;
       </para>
       <para>
        sixth, further microeconomic reform and efficiency improvements in key service sector industries, notably those of coastal shipping and the waterfront, but also key public sector enterprises; and

        finally, the extensive review and reform of the morass of business regulation which is inhibiting development

       <para>
        In conclusion, I would like to note that much has already been achieved under this government. Much more, I believe, than previously in Australia's history. Perhaps our greatest achievement has been to persuade the community that government hand-outs and regulation are not the route to long term international competitiveness, and that change is essential.
       </para>

        Nevertheless, there is still much room for improvement in attitudes and a long way to go towards what I would describe as a satisfactory productive and internationally oriented industry culture.

         â€”Senator Button, with his usual very articulate rhetoric, sets out seven very important points in the summary of his speech. I agree with them. I do not say that they are in the order of priority that I would give them. He lays down a path which, if the Government would only follow it, would bring about some recovery of our desperate current account deficit. The first one is `to re-establish a favourable macro-economic environment'. If this Government would only drive down inflation, drive down interest rates, set a macro-economy, lower taxes, lower interests rates and get rid of inflation, then of course manufacturers and small businesses in particular would have an opportunity to get up and have a go. But who would invest in a business in Australia at present? Who is going to borrow money at 23 or 24 per cent in order to develop a business in Australia at present? Who is going to put up with a work force standing over him in the way in which the work force of Australia does under this Government's accord in order to get wage rises that are totally unearned? Who is going to make an investment when all he needs to do in this country at present is invest his money in some sort of a building, watch its value grow and then take those profits in due course? It is even better nowadays in that a person does not even have to do that. He can stick his money on deposit and earn a return of 18 per cent or better. Who is going to worry about long service leave, holiday pay, the 17 1/2 per cent loading, and all the problems, by investing in business? Very few people would, as Senator Button has discovered. As I said, Senator Button sets out a program of which I approve, although I would not necessarily recommend it in the same order when we get into government. There may be other things that I would want to do as well. It is unbelievable what he then said in his speech. In conclusion he said:

        He said to the conference, `We've taught the people of Australia, we've taught industry, we've taught the community, that government hand-outs are not the route to long term international competitiveness', at the very time that he and his Department were preparing a submission to Cabinet to give $60m of taxpayers' money to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. He has been caught out. Time after time I have pointed out in this Parliament and in press releases that we cannot follow Senator Button's rhetoric. Senator Button's rhetoric is good, but his performance is pathetic. This Government's performance is pathetic. I have offered him excuse after excuse. I have said, `Perhaps his colleagues have let him down. Perhaps Minister Willis will not adopt the micro-economic reform proposals that he should be adopting. Perhaps Treasurer Keating will not let the Australian dollar float properly. Perhaps that is where Senator Button has been let down'.
       </para>
       <para>
        But Senator Button is No. 3 in the Hawke Ministry. He is second only to Mr Lionel Bowen and third to the Prime Minister of Australia. It is Senator Button's responsibility. He cannot excuse himself and say, `My mates are not performing the way I want them to perform'. It is his responsibility. He must stand before the people of Australia who are being destroyed by the decision to hand out $60m of taxpayers' money to Kodak to be passed on in due course to Kodak Eastman in the United States of America. Senator Button was telling this conference a nonsense. He has demonstrated that the easiest profits that can be made come from the taxpayers' pockets and that under the Hawke Government the hand-out mentality that he was referring to is in fact alive and well. The cargo cult mentality is alive and well under this Government. As one editorial put it:
       </para>
       <para>
        The more disturbing implication is that, in its senility, this Government has decided that the level playing field is too remote a concept and that-with an election around the corner-it should instead move into Lady Bountiful mode.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button, who now has the task of negotiating the deal to meet the terms and conditions placed on it by both sides, is faced with implementing a decision which flies in the face of all his policy initiatives to wind back protection and establish a level playing field. The Government is yet to produce-and indeed, the Government will not produce-a set of guidelines or reveal the guidelines for this extraordinary deal. Will this sort of help be available to Australian companies, or to selected subsidiaries of multinational companies only? How will the funds be supplied by the Government? Will this bribe be in breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? How will we argue the Uruguay Round in relation to GATT when we are bribing a multinational company with $60m of taxpayers' funds?
       </para>
       <para>
        How will the Government overcome that? I suggest that it could use the secret partnerships for development process, about which Senator Button, only reluctantly and under great pressure from this Parliament, gave us some information in November 1988 but for which he has refused repeatedly to provide any legislative backing. It is a secret process and I suggest to the Parliament that that may be where the Government will find this $60m. I will bet that the Senate will not get an opportunity to have a look at the deal when it comes through. I bet it will be done secretly, under the lap in some way or other, so that we are unable to debate the matter and find out what principles the Government applied in providing the funds. If the Government has spare funds-I suggest that with a monthly deficit of $2.56 billion it does not have any funds-it could use those funds to get the basics right: to improve the macro-economic fundamentals, such as lower interest rates and inflation; improve the labour market; provide a flexible labour market and restore the rule of law; remove unnecessary regulations which are an impediment to business; reduce taxes by reduced government spending; and provide a more productive and innovative Australia through micro-economic reform. Those are the things that I and the Liberal and National parties say we will do in government and which the present Government ought to be doing. In fact, in many respects they mirror the rhetoric of Senator Button in his speech to the Outlook Conference about a fortnight ago. If the Government will not attempt to implement such policies, it might at least start implementing some part of Senator Button's policy or get out. If the Government has run out of ideas, it ought to get out and let us have a go.
       </para>
       <para>
        Industry, which is continually being lectured by Senator Button in terms of its shortcomings, is entitled to ask whether Senator Button has lost his marbles at this late stage. He has lost responsibility for reviewing industry matters. The responsibility for the Industries Assistance Commission-soon to be renamed the Industry Commission-has gone to Treasurer Keating. Senator Button has lost responsibility for that, and it appears that soon he will lose responsibility for the Business Regulation Review Unit. Senator Evans is trying to get Austrade off him, and the Prime Minister appears to have taken control of industry policy with this banana republic decision to bribe Kodak with $60m of taxpayers' funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even today Senator Button could not get it right in relation to Kodak. The Minister was wrong when he said, in answer to a question asked by Senator McGauran, that Kodak has no competitors in Australia. There are at least three major competitors covering the sale of film, photographic papers and chemicals, and also major competitors in franchised photo processing. Indeed, there have been allegations that Kodak has engaged in predatory pricing practices to dominate the domestic film processing and finishing industry in order to guarantee domestic sales of its photographic papers and chemicals. I do not know whether there is any truth in those allegations, but the allegations are being made widely around this place at present. A number of us have had telephone calls from people around Australia in the photographic development and printing process who are saying, `We are concerned about the Kodak retail operation and whether this $60m will be used to finance Kodak's retail operation, which is competing with us. We are paying our taxes. Kodak has its hand out for $60m, yet Kodak is in there trying to undercut us in the film printing business'.
       </para>

        It has further been alleged to me-again, I have no knowledge of the truth of it-that last year Kodak and/or its subsidiaries in the film laboratories lost $5m. As I have said, I do not know whether there is any truth in that allegation, but I have raised the matter in the Senate to ask that the Minister make sure that there is a guarantee that these taxpayers' funds will not be used to cross-subsidise Kodak's film processing activities in this highly competitive field at the expense of its Australian processing competitors. I hope that, now that the Minister is aware of these allegations, he will raise them with Kodak in his negotiations.

        I conclude by saying that, after 6 1/2 years of decline, Labor has resorted at the death knock to bribery in a desperate attempt to retain or gain some electoral support. Not surprisingly, this Hawke Government is seen by the electorate as being morally corrupt, tired and confused. Its Ministers are out of touch; they have lost any desire. Recently, Senator Button talked about the possibility of being in Paris after the next election. Senator Walsh has talked about resigning. He is tired and fed up. He is sick of it. This Government is tired. Perhaps Senator Button, with his reputation in tatters over this deal, should retire now rather than await the defeat of the Hawke Government.

         â€” I rise briefly in the adjournment debate simply to correct the public record. Senator McLean in the censure debate earlier today stated, to my surprise, I must say, that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had made a statement today indicating that the Government will not necessarily support any decision that the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission might bring down on Thursday in relation to the pilots dispute. As someone who has followed and is currently following the debate very carefully, I was somewhat startled by this information. It was news to me. I simply want to advise the Senate that I have been to the Prime Minister's office and checked on this. I have been categorically informed that the Prime Minister has not today made a statement of any description about the attitude the Government might adopt in terms of the Full Bench decision on Thursday. In fact, I am informed by the Prime Minister's office that the Prime Minister has not made a statement in relation to that matter in the way suggested by Senator McLean, period.

         â€”I rise briefly to compliment Senator Lewis on his comments relating to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and to add to the very potent point he made. It has been brought to our attention by many on the retail side of the industry, that is, the film processors, small business people-and there are thousands of them-that they are very concerned about the proposed $60m subsidy to the Kodak firm. It is bad enough that small business has to face high interest rates and high inflation rates. Senator Button says that Kodak has no competitors. He is utterly wrong. Thousands of small film processors are now seeing one of their major competitors with its hand out for $60m. No-one should doubt that the film industry is very competitive. There is almost a price war going on on the retail side of the industry. It has been brought to our attention that Kodak has been behaving in a price predatory manner. It has a film processing plant at Coburg and it has major contracts. I believe that it has the Coles contract, the K-Mart contract and several large chemist contracts in the film processing area. But around its dominance of the market many small film processing businesses have sprung up. They are competing directly with and undercutting Kodak, which is where it is losing out in the domestic market.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It has to be made clear to the Government in its negotiations with Kodak that this $60m hand-out is not going to be used to cross-subsidise to the disadvantage of Australian small business people. As the position stands, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is utterly incorrect and just shows that he has not got a handle on this issue at all when he says that Kodak has no competition. This is of serious concern to small business people in this country. When Kodak gets this particular subsidy, hand-out or bribe, as it has been described, it is incumbent upon the Minister to alert the Trade Practices Commission to the fact that Kodak should not indulge in price predatory practices against the thousands of small businesses in Australia. It is nothing more than a bribe. The question has to be asked time and again-and the Government has to answer it-whether this subsidy will be used to cross-subsidise domestic operations to the detriment of small business people in Australia.

        â€”The Minister for Housing and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Australian marketing approval was given on 21 August 1986. Although doubts were raised subsequently about the data on which this approval was based, further bio-availability studies were carried out in Australia and these proved to the satisfaction of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee the bio-equivalence of Glimel and Daonil, the original brand of Glibenclamide.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) The delisting of certain brands of drugs on 1 April 1989 was a result of the Government's generic pricing policy. This policy provided that brands of an item should be priced within 20 cents of the lowest price brand, provided that brand was reasonably available in the market place. Market availability was assessed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority (PBPA) following the receipt of detailed data provided by alternative suppliers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The generic pricing policy was only part of a package of Government measures which was designed overall to encourage the development of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Australia. Other parts of this package provided for longer patent periods for human use pharmaceuticals and higher prices in return for increased Australian activity.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most manufacturers accepted the package and agreed to price reductions under the generic policy. However, some companies did not and preferred to have their brands delisted. The manufacturer of Daonil was one of the companies that did not accept the Government's generic pricing policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       After it became clear that Daonil would be delisted, discussions were held with the Australian Diabetes Society concerning the availability of the alternative brand. In discussions with officials from the Department of Community Services and Health, the Australian Diabetes Society confirmed that they were satisfied with the testing undertaken to confirm the bio-equivalence of Glimel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) At its meeting held on 25 and 26 July 1988, the PBPA considered the implications for individual products of the Government's generic pricing policy. On 29 July 1988, the Authority recommended to the Minister that certain prices should be reduced, or if companies did not agree to the reduction, brands should be delisted. The Minister accepted the recommendation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Drug companies were advised in writing on 4 August 1988 of the requirement to comply with the Government's generic pricing policy by reducing prices of certain products to within 20 cents of the price of available alternatives. Separate pricing negotiations were held with individual companies, therefore decisions in relation to delisting varied between companies but all companies were advised of those decisions by the end of September 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further protracted negotiations were held between January and March 1989 without a resolution being achieved. As a result the delegate of the Minister signed the instrument delisting these drugs on 16 March 1989 with effect from 1 April 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Final costings are not available at this stage for the total publicity campaign because a number of payment invoices are still outstanding. However, on the basis of payments made to date, along with estimates of outstanding commitments provided by the Office of Government Information and Advertising, the final cost of the generic advertising campaign is estimated at $636 000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The generic pricing policy, of which the delisting of 12 brands formed a small part only, is estimated to achieve full year savings in excess of $12m. No separate estimates were made for each drug.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) There has been no reduction in pharmaceutical industry incentives as a result of the refusal of some companies to accept the generic pricing policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Estimated expenditure in 1988-89 under the PBS on the drug Glibenclamide is $6.1m, including payments by patients. It is not possible to indicate what proportion of the expenditure will be directed towards the Glimel brand of Glibenclamide because of a long-standing policy of not releasing market share data.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) As the Government's generic pricing policy remains in place, it is likely that negotiations will occur from time to time with drug companies over PBS prices. There is no current proposal to delist any brand.

A comprehensive review of the potential for using products made from recycled and unbleached paper has now been initiated. As announced by the two Ministers on 5 September 1989, the review will look at such issues as the qualities of recycled paper products, the costs involved, the positive and negative aspects of using recycled paper and what suitable uses can be identified. The review is being guided by a steering committee of senior officers from the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The review is in addition to a pilot study operating in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.

Also, Commonwealth and State Environment Ministers recently agreed to set up a working group to develop standards for recycled paper for government use and to examine further uses for low grade recycled paper. In addition, all portfolio Ministers have been asked by the Prime Minister to report to Senator Richardson on the wastepaper recycling strategies which their departments have adopted and ways in which those strategies may be improved or extended.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister intends to issue a report early next year on the progress being made in relation to the measures announced in the Statement, including the results of the current investigations into the use of re-cycled paper by departments and their wastepaper re-cycling strategies.

       The Australia/New Zealand Quarantine Consultative Group held its second meeting in July in Canberra. A review of progress since the Group's first meeting in October last year shows some positive developments with the finalisation of several quarantine agreements covering trade in a number of areas. The agreements set out the conditions for the importation of tomatoes, grapes, cucurbits (cucumbers, squash and zucchinis) and cooked poultry into New Zealand, and pigmeat and cooked poultry meat into Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Consultative Group re-affirmed that: quarantine agreements should be as concise as possible; the industry consultative process should be formalised, time-bound as much as possible and its transparency improved; and risk assessments for importation policies should focus on real, rather than hypothetical or conceivable risks. The meeting also agreed that work should commence on clearer definitions of Australasian concepts which could be promoted internationally on harmonised procedures and systems for plant, animal and fish quarantine.

       Following numerous consultations, I wrote to the Principal Member of the Board on 28 June 1989 advising him of my decisions concerning the future size of the Board, the location of Board panels and the terms of appointment of members. On 13 July 1989 I wrote to national ex-service organisations calling for nominations within four weeks for the positions of Services Member with the Board. Advertisements appeared in the national press on 19 August 1989 for the positions of Senior Member and Member with the Board.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The precise answer to this question depends on the criteria used for determining statehood. There are currently 159 States members of the United Nations. Of these two members, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic would not normally be considered as sovereign states. There are in addition a number of States which meet the criteria of statehood under international law-a permanent population, a defined territory, a Government, and a capacity to enter into relations with other States-but which are not members of the United Nations. A number of these States participate in certain UN or regional activities. They would include the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Holy See, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, the Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, the Republic of Korea, San Marino, Switzerland, Tonga and Tuvalu.

       (4) As at 1 August 1989, of the states referred to in (1) Australia does not maintain either resident or non-resident diplomatic accreditation with the following: Afghanistan, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Mali, Mauritania, Monaco, Niger, Rwanda, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Suriname, Togo and Zaire. Diplomatic relations with the DPRK have been suspended since 1975. Australia maintains consular relations with Liechtenstein.

       (6) A list of current Heads of Mission at each Australian Diplomatic Mission including the countries to which they are accredited in a non-residential capacity is supplied.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) and (7) The term diplomatic accreditation is primarily applicable to relations between States rather than between States and international organisations. Australia's participation in the multilateral system takes form in its membership of international organisations at a Government level. In a number of instances, that participation involves formal accreditation of an Australian head of mission to particular international organisations.

       CUSTOMS DIVING UNITS
      </para>
      <para>
       For a number of years the Australian Customs Service (ACS) maintained Diving Units in both Sydney and Brisbane. The New South Wales Unit consisted of one full-time supervisor and part-time divers while the Queensland unit comprised only part-time divers. The ACS reviewed the operations of both units in 1987-88 and consequently they were disbanded at the end of 1988.

      <para>
       NEW SOUTH WALES UNIT
      </para>
      <para>
       The operation of the New South Wales Unit was reviewed in July 1987 by Senior Officers of the New South Wales Region. That review examined the effectiveness of the unit, running costs and the feasibility of having other agencies conduct diving on behalf of the ACS. It was revealed that:

      <para>
       (1) I am aware of concerns expressed for the survival of Purdie's Donkey orchid.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The orchid was considered endangered before 1982 by some authorities. It was listed as endangered in the 1981 edition of `Rare and Threatened Plants of Australia'. In the 1988 edition its status was revised to vulnerable.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I understand that this is the case but because the orchid emerges and flowers only after hot summer fires, other undiscovered populations may exist.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) I understand that this is the case. Research funded by the developer is being conducted by State Government agencies with a view to
      </para>
      <para>
       translocating specimens of the orchid to one or more suitable sites which can be securely reserved; and
      </para>
      <para>
       propagating the plant in nurseries so that further translocation can be attempted in the future.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No, but see response to (6).
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The matter is primarily a State Government responsibility and the West Australian Government has instituted a program to conserve the orchid. If further funding is required for research or management the West Australian Government and other interested organisations are welcome to apply for funding under the Commonwealth Endangered Species Program which was announced by the Prime Minister in his July Statement. Advertisement has already appeared announcing the availability of such funding and inviting applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) It would be more appropriate to address the matter of conservation of the orchid through the Endangered Species Program or other relevant Commonwealth programs rather than seek a legislative solution.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The Western Australian Government's State Conservation Strategy is modelled on the National Conservation Strategy for Australia which was endorsed by the Commonwealth Government in June 1984 and by the Western Australian Government in February 1985. The Government supports the development by the States and Territories of appropriate conservation strategies and welcomed release of the WA State Conservation Strategy in February 1987.

In this situation information on the fee currently paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Postal Corporation is being treated on a ``commercial-in-confidence'' basis.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Is the Minister aware that the reason that the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia (NMAA) is seeking specific listing under section 78 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act as an organisation eligible for tax deductable donations is because its grant of $76,200 in the 1988-89 Budget to assist with the training of breastfeeding counsellor, administration and coordination has been cut to zero in 1989-90?
      </para>
      <para>
       The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       The NMAA has been funded since 1975 under the National Community Health Program and more recently, since 1986-87, under the National Health Promotion Program. The NMAA was funded to provide training programs for counsellors on breastfeeding. For example, in the three years since 1986-87, $219,200 has been provided to the NMAA to conduct training programs which qualify some 800 Association members as breastfeeding counsellors. During this time, counselling services were provided to several hundred thousand mothers and the Association has maintained a 24 hour assistance and advice service throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Funding under the National Health Promotion Program is not available on a continuing basis to any organisation. Grants are provided, at the discretion of the Minister for Community Services and Health, to community organisations, State and Territory Governments and tertiary institutions. In May 1987, the Minister advised the Association that funding would continue until June 1989. During the intervening period, the Association was requested to review its fund-raising capacity so that in the longer term it would move towards complete self-sufficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       The training program which was funded up until June 1989 is only one component of the Association's activities. The Association makes a small trading profit and, because it is a voluntary organisation, all income is applied solely towards the activities of the Association.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that the Association, in addition to seeking approval to become listed as eligible for tax deductible donations under s78 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, is also looking to obtain funds from corporate sponsorship.
