       Pornography
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the `Porn Capital' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State Legislation:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the A.C.T., with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG, and M-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R rated video-cassettes, so that R rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of `X' rated or `N.V.E.' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and
      </para>
      <para>
       2. To give whole-hearted supported to Senator Walters's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and
      </para>
      <para>
       3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;

       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects,

       Violent Television Programs

       Home Ownership

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.

       We are concerned that the National Party in Queensland is diverting money given by the Federal Government to the Queensland Government to alleviate natural disasters; that it might not be finding its way to its intended targets; and that it is being diverted to the coffers of the National Party itself or otherwise to expansion projects promoted by members or supporters of the National Party.

These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed.

       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy.

      </para>
      <para>
       All Australians should have equal access to our health care system and that there should not be two tiers of medical insurance rebates for general practice and we reject the concept of a vocational register for general practitioners.

        The delays and inconvenience experienced at the Airport affects my family and its antiquated air traffic control equipment endangers our lives. Additionally, many jobs will be at risk if the commercial services of the Airport are limited due to its lack of capacity. And many small and large businesses depend on the tourist dollar. This quickly growing and significant industry is at risk due to the neglect of Sydney's Airport.

         â€”The Opposition does not oppose the motion which has been moved by Senator Coates. It is our understanding that there is still further work to be done on that report and we regard the inquiry which the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is undertaking as an important one. However, I want to speak on this motion because I think it would have been desirable if this report could have been available in time for the debate which the Senate will shortly undertake on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation and other legislation affecting the administration of Aboriginal affairs.

        I would just like to remind the Senate that at the time this reference was sent off to the Committee, it was pointed out that there were some rather odd features of the report and some rather odd omissions from it. No doubt the Committee will be doing its best to obtain an explanation for those omissions for the edification and information of the Senate. However, since that reference we have seen nothing to reduce our concern about the administration of Aboriginal affairs. Only yesterday Warwick Smith, the Opposition shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, released a draft Cabinet submission which had been provided to him and which relates to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). I take this opportunity to say to the Government that I trust that it will not use its financial power over the ADC to anticipate the eventual outcome of the legislation before the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is proposed in this draft Cabinet submission is a series of options which would involve using the appropriation power effectively to deprive the Aboriginal Development Commission of its functions. While it may be due to the legislative process that will occur at the end of the day, it is not a process which, in the view of the Opposition, should occur using this underhand administrative and financial tool. I seek leave to table the press release issued by Mr Smith yesterday and the attachment, which is a draft Cabinet submission. That submission makes it quite clear that currently, within the bureaucracy, if not within the Government, the means that could be adopted to short-circuit the legislative process are being canvassed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Aboriginal Development Commission was established after an extensive legislative process in which this Senate was prominently involved. It involved the introduction of draft legislation which was then extensively discussed with the Aboriginal community, using as the source of communication a working party of public servants, not politicians. I believe it was a thoroughly successful consultative exercise. It resulted in a substantial number of amendments to the legislation after Aboriginal input had been received. In the view of the Opposition, the Government is pursuing a course without the support of the Aboriginal community, after a Clayton's form of consultation which the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has indicated did not leave the Aboriginal people with the understanding that the Bill would proceed without further consultation with them. The public evidence of the consideration of the undermining of the whole legislative process, which is contained in this draft Cabinet submission, should be of concern to all senators and, indeed, all members of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        On what is a busy afternoon, I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I trust that the Government will not use the Budget to make the debate which we will be having over the next couple of weeks about the future direction of the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country a nullity and a farce. If the Government chooses, prior to obtaining the legislative sanction of the Parliament, to denude the ADC of all resources other than the internal resources generated by it, largely because of the grants made through the previous Government, I think that would be a real abuse of the legislative process and the process of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask Ministers who are present to consider the implications of this matter: I would have thought that, when he was in opposition at least, a Minister like Senator Evans would have been concerned at this subversion of the process. I hope that in Cabinet, Ministers have defended due process and made sure that this technique is not used to undermine the Aboriginal Development Commission further. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

I refer to the enormous disruption in terms of personal inconvenience and cost inflicted on Australians by the refusal of domestic airline pilots to abide by a direction of the Industrial Relations Commission. In view of this, the threat of further action by the pilots and the clearly stated intention of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to accept the result of the national wage case only if it succeeds in getting all it wants, does the Government now accept the need for effective procedures to ensure enforcement of Commission decisions to replace the existing provisions which, two years ago, Mr Willis said had fallen into disrepute and were moribund?

         â€”Senator Chaney has asked his question in the context of the current airline pilots dispute. The Government deplores the recent rolling strike action by domestic aircraft pilots which contravenes directives from the Industrial Relations Commission. The Government is committed to the centralised wage system at present and it would like to see the airline pilots dispute resolved within this system. That system has both rights and obligations for those within it. If the pilots refuse to abide by their obligations within the centralised system, then the Government would support any application for the cancellation or suspension of existing pilots awards and agreements. This would cancel all the rights and protections that are provided to them by the centralised system. If the pilots choose to go outside the system, then the Government will fully support any action by the airlines to bring the dispute to an early end.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As far as the Government is concerned the matter concerning the airlines is quite straightforward-either the pilots accept the obligations of the award system that entitles them to its rights or they forfeit those rights. I think that principle is generally true across the industrial relations system. It is a slight touch of licence for Senator Chaney to say that the ACTU has said that it will walk outside the system if it does not get all it wants. Only this morning-I think this is correct-the ACTU wages committee accepted the principles enunciated in the decision of the national wage Bench. That will now be progressed through the system in accordance with the restructuring principles.
       </para>
       <para>
        In answer to the two specific points which Senator Chaney made I make those comments. In the context of those comments it is not necessary for me to consider the other part of the question which has been the burden of Senator Chaney's public argument recently-that is, that the Commission should be empowered to enforce its decisions in particular ways. That course has been followed in Australia before without much success. I do not see that there is any reason, when we have had a comparatively successful series of wage outcomes over recent years--

         â€”I am pleased that Senator McKiernan asked this question, because there has been a great degree of misinformation, particularly in Western Australia, about the Sarich Technologies Ltd engine and the move to manufacture it in the United States in the State of Michigan. As a senator from Western Australia, the questioner knows full well that there has been a lot of misinformation, some of which I would like to correct. First of all, in terms of Commonwealth assistance of a broad nature-that is to say, Commonwealth assistance which is applicable across industry-the following grants have been received by the Orbital Engine Co., or Sarich Technologies Ltd: under the industry research and development program, $4.8m for developmental work on the engine; under the export market development grants scheme, $800,000-over a period of years; and under the demonstration grants scheme-from governments of both political persuasions, Liberal and Labor-$200,000. The company has a carry forward benefit of $5.7m under the 150 per cent tax concession scheme and the Government financed up to $0.25m for a commercial feasibility study of the Sarich engine.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A substantial amount of further support from a range of existing Commonwealth and State government programs would have been available if the projects had proceeded to the manufacturing stage in Australia. For example, $15.25m would have been accessible under the motor vehicles and components development grants scheme. There have of course been further approaches from Mr Sarich and others to the Government for additional assistance. On the basis of assessment of the Sarich engine made by the Government and the Australian Industry Development Corporation and confirmed by the Sarich Orbital Engine Co., it is quite clear that manufacture of the engine would have been viable in Australia but the return on investment in Michigan would be somewhat larger and marginally more attractive than for manufacture at home in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has participated in feasibility studies and in a major program of financial advisory work. Recently, a high level interdepartmental committee was established to advise on the alleged cost disability and whether external economic benefits warranted special government action. This sort of special attention to single projects is unusual, however potentially significant, and it is not common for the Government at Commonwealth level to take this sort of action.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the suggestion which has been made that the Commonwealth Government took no interest in this program. I have mentioned the financial incentives which were made available under the general incentives programs which are available to all industries. Quite apart from that, there were suggestions that Ministers and the Prime Minister and others took no interest in the developments at Sarich Technologies. I note that between 1987 and 1989 the Prime Minister and I both visited Sarich Technologies, as did two members of my staff, seven officers of my Department at various times and the Director of the Automotive Industry Authority, Mr Sexton. There were also visits by an officer of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, an officer of the Treasury and an officer of the Department of Finance. These visits all took place in the last 18 months or so.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put those matters of fact on the record because I am, to say the least, somewhat disappointed by some of the comment and misinformation which is being distributed, particularly in Western Australia. I remind the Senate that it is only six or seven weeks since Mr Sarich came to see me personally and advised me that he would probably establish this engine plant in Michigan. The specific purpose of his visit was to ask me, if I can use a colloquial expression, not to bag his decision to take that plant to Michigan. That was the specific purpose of his visit to me. Since his return from Michigan I cannot say that, honouring as I did the spirit of that request from Mr Sarich, perhaps naively, I have been treated with any equity in this matter.

         â€”I am only putting facts on the record, nothing else-no comment. I must say here that we admire the technology, we admire Mr Sarich's inventiveness and, of course, we wish him well in his venture in Michigan. I also add that, in addition to Mr Sarich, so members of the Western Australian Government have had things to say about this enterprise. In terms of consideration of industry policy issues and what moneys should be made available to particular firms, this Government does not need the advice of politicians in the Western Australian Government. We do not need that at all. Those who were the architects of Western Australia Inc. are not well placed to advise the Commonwealth Government what it should do about this issue. I do not for a moment share Senator Chaney's description of Western Australian Government Ministers as a bunch of thugs. They are a compassionate, sensitive, likeable group of people, but on this particular issue they have not proved to be particularly right.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The question really extends to how much governments should be involved in putting taxpayers' money into enterprises of a particular kind, picking one out in favour of another. I said earlier in the course of my response that the Federal Government made available to Mr Sarich some $11m over a number of years and made an offer of a further $16m or $17m and that those offers were added to by very generous offers made by State governments. But the offers the Federal Government made to Mr Sarich were made as part of industry granting systems of universal application; that is, not specific to any particular firm or company. If we do not accept that principle, we run into the question of what happens if we choose Mr Sarich and somebody else whom we do not choose proves to be equally successful, an argument which is usually characterised as an argument about picking winners.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a general principle, this Government will not be part of the process of picking one firm over another. I will just illustrate the point. Only two weeks ago I had the pleasure of opening a Comalco plant at Bell Bay which has received no specific government assistance. It is a highly competitive international plant, entirely for export. It has been developed by the good work of the Comalco company in terms of both research and development and marketing.

         â€”I may be able to answer some of those questions. The Australian citizen is caught up in a very distressing circumstance. It occurred when Ms Hamill and her companions, members of the Joyful Assembly of God, were conducting a service at the metropolitan district command detention centre in the Philippines city of Davao. The prisoners holding the hostages demanded one bus, to be provided by 3 o'clock yesterday, to go to an undisclosed location with the hostages. This deadline has been extended by 24 hours. The prisoners holding the hostages have threatened the lives of those hostages if their demands are not met but have not singled out Ms Hamill specifically. The hostages involved are Ms Hamill and seven Filipinos, and the prisoners in question number some 15. The negotiations are continuing.

       <para>
        Since my brief was written I have had some rather confused reports over the wire service, supplemented very briefly by a report from a consular official just a few minutes ago, suggesting that some hostages have escaped. I am not clear but I think that Ms Hamill is not among those who have escaped. There is a report that Ms Hamill has a slight facial wound but is not seriously hurt. I am sorry that my answer sounds a bit disjointed but I do not have all the details. One or more remaining prisoners are still holding hostages. The authorities have sent in the mother of the main prisoner involved to negotiate with him, so there is some hope or expectation that some sanity will prevail in this very difficult situation. I will report further to individual honourable senators with an interest in this matter as soon as the situation becomes clearer.

I preface my question by congratulating the Minister on his stand taken on the Channel 10 Face to Face program on Sunday 30 July, that he would fight to protect the South Alligator River in the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park. Obviously, the Minister is well cognisant of his powers under section 9 of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. Will he give an undertaking that if Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) deems the exploration stage of the Coronation Hill mine to be successful and indicates its intention to go ahead with the mine, he will declare the South Alligator River to be endangered and will take action similar to that taken in respect of the Franklin River in Tasmania? Secondly, of course, the Minister will be aware of the probability that any mining in the Koongarra Project area would be very detrimental to the South Alligator River, as Koongarra lies in the catchment area of that river near the Nourlangie Creek. In the light of his determination to protect the river, will the Minister give an undertaking to support my private member's Bill to repeal the partially unproclaimed Koongarra Project Area Act passed illegally by the Fraser Government on the last day on which it held the balance of power in the Senate and against which the Australian Labor Party spoke so vehemently at the time?

But, of course, the proviso to that has always been that the environmental impact statement, which took so long to prepare but was handed to me just a couple of weeks ago on site at Coronation Hill, revealed that the mining could proceed without damaging the South Alligator River. Of course, it is that river which gives life to so many of the things that make Kakadu the very special place that it is. I undertook to make sure that I did my job of protecting the river and, once we have examined that fairly weighty document that has been handed to us by the joint venturers, I will be in a position to at least make a recommendation to the Government.

        In so far as the Koongarra mine is concerned, of course, any mining, if it were to take place there, could only take place if the Government, or, in particular, the Labor Party, were to change its uranium mining policy. The Prime Minister has announced that there will be no consideration of such a change by the Party until its 1991 conference, which is some time away. If a vote were to be held on the subject today, I think there would be no change to the policy and Koongarra would not go ahead. But it is difficult to predict what will happen in two years' time, so I can say no more than that. As far as what possible damage uranium mining at Koongarra might do to the South Alligator, from my inspections of Koongarra-which are not backed up by scientific evidence, but are based on having a look-I would have thought it somewhat easier to prevent environmental damage at Koongarra than at perhaps any uranium mine in the country. I doubt very much if it would present the environmental problems that other mines might. From my inspections it certainly appears that mining could be done there without damage to the environment. But of course there is the larger question of uranium mining and whether or not it ought to take place.

At the introduction of the Bill the Government made it clear that it had a number of objectives in this area. One was to tackle the whole question of positive reporting and another was to apply the privacy principles to the credit reporting industry. As I said at the time, and to representatives of the Credit Reference Association of Australia who came to see me on the day of the introduction of the Bill, we were prepared then, and are now, to have constructive consultations on the Bill. In fact, at that meeting we canvassed the question of amendments to the Bill and got a positive response to that. It is fair to say that since then there have been two strata of contribution to the debate: there has been a whole range of constructive bilateral discussions with sections of industry, and there has been the somewhat irrational campaign.

As I said, there have been some quite constructive consultations and there has been the alternative campaign, which has been based very much on deliberate misinformation. In those consultations the Government has made it clear to the people with whom it has been discussing the Bill that it will maintain the original intention of the Bill, which is to allow a whole range of credit providers-in fact, 90 per cent or thereabouts of the existing users. The Government also made it very clear that the whole question of whether there should be a distinction between personal and commercial files and a bar of access on one when accessing the other is very hard to maintain, although that matter initially came out of consultations and discussions with industry. There will of course be amendments to cover the constructive outcome of the consultations in those two areas and others as well. Out of the consultations has also come a growing awareness of the Government's position-a position that was adopted and endorsed by both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, who were in opposition to positive reporting. The Government's position on that point has been getting growing support and recognition throughout the community.

        In conclusion, the bilateral consultations with industry have been quite constructive and useful. They will lead to industry's legitimate concerns being taken into account. The Government's commitment ensures that the privacy of individuals with regard to this particular legislation will not be compromised. I must also say that the quite hysterical campaign which has been run has been of no real value to industry and individual members of organisations involved in it. Unfortunately, they will be concerned by some of the reports that have emanated from their peak organisation. However, we have had constructive consultations; they are continuing. I warn those who may be inclined to listen to the Credit Reference Association of Australia or the Australian Credit Forum to have a second thought about that.

I do not know what he means by that question. Of course, one must always be concerned about a rate of inflation which is higher than that of one's trading partners. As a matter of fact, I suspect that, compared with that of our trading partners, it is less high now than it was 12 months ago. That is not to the credit of policies adopted in this country, but it is a fact of life that the inflation rate in Australia is not so significantly different from that of our trading partners as it was 12 or 15 months ago.

        Senator Watson went on to say, `Look, you have foreshadowed wage increases of 6.5 per cent. Should not wages be related to productivity?'. My answer to that question is; yes, as much as possible, wages ought to be related to productivity, and that is what the award restructuring matters in the Industrial Relations Commission's recent decision are about, as far as possible. It is implicit in Senator Watson's question that we have been enjoying a degree of wage inflation in Australia. In my view that is not correct. That was a characteristic of the period of Liberal Party Government, but in the period of this Government we have not been suffering from what is normally known as wage inflation. Whether that will occur in the future is a matter which will ultimately be determined by the success of the Government's wages policy following the recent decision of the Industrial Relations Commission.

But there are many other problems in terms of the productivity of Australian industries, and so on, which go wider than the question which the honourable senator now asks me by way of a supplementary question. As I am answering Senator Watson's question, I will concentrate on that. We have arguments about productivity change in Australia and what is happening there.

However, I have to say that detailed information about that remains very scarce, and the precise state of her health is simply unknown to us at this stage. There has been a lot of speculation about it, but no hard information. The Australian Government has also made representations to the Myanmar Government on several occasions through its embassy here in Canberra and through the Australian Embassy in Rangoon, or Yangon as it is now called, against these detentions. We have also made representations about the actions taken against political parties more generally, and also on the death sentences that have recently been passed by a military tribunal on three individuals who are allegedly implicated in the bomb attack on 7 July.

Decisions on the resumption of other Australian aid project activities will be subject to our ongoing assessment of the overall situation, including the administrative, logistic and infrastructural environment. I have to say that I am not inclined to pursue the question of reviewing that situation unless there is substantial evident progress toward the restoration of human rights and electoral democracy in that country.

Given those figures and the Government's estimate of 6.5 per cent average earnings growth this financial year-a figure on which even the Treasurer has cast doubt; a more realistic estimate is probably 8 to 9 per cent-does the Minister really believe that the current wage fixing system is helping Australian industries' international competitive position?

         â€”The honourable senator has now corrected his original question and asked me a supplementary question. The question he has now asked by way of a supplementary is essentially the question I was asked by Senator Watson some time ago. The point I make about that is that, as far as possible, wage growth should be related to and dependent on productivity increases. I acknowledged that in an answer to Senator Watson. I went on to explain to him that the award restructuring program and the Industrial Relations Commission's current decision were very much designed to enhance productivity. All sorts of things can enhance productivity-not just award restructuring and things of that kind, but the levels of investment by industry and a whole range of matters which affect productivity. As I understand it, the honourable senator's supplementary question is as to whether our wage growth is exceeding that of some other countries. I think the answer to that question is probably yes, but whether wage levels in this country are anywhere near those of many of those countries which have lesser wage growth at present than Australia is a totally different and a relevant question.

Is the Minister aware of the deal organised by this joint venture and the Broome Shire Council for transferring control and ownership of the existing airport site to the Broome shire to be later handed over to the joint venture in exchange for funding the new McAlpine international airport-a deal which would give ACP a real estate profit of at least $100m? Is the Minister aware that three of the nine Broome shire councillors are employees of Ansett Airlines Ltd, one of the joint venturers for the proposed international airport? Has this project been referred to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories for a full environmental impact study and have alternative sites been considered? In light of the fact that a Federal review of the terms and conditions of the aerodrome local ownership plan has not yet been considered by the Government, and in light of the fact that a Western Australian Government State Strategic Transport Committee has been established to examine this matter, should not all further discussions of the ACP-Ansett Transport Industries plans for an international airport at Broome be put on hold?

        I am told by the Minister that she is aware that the shire is separately negotiating with the consortium of Australian City Properties and Ansett for the consortium to operate the airport should transfer negotiations be successfully concluded and for the subsequent development of a new airport by the consortium. The question of whether any new airport would be designated as an international airport has not been raised. The designation of international airports is the responsibility of the Federal Government. Any application for designation of a new Broome Airport or approval of international flights would be considered by the Federal Government on its merits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Press reports have mentioned very large figures, as Senator Vallentine tells us today, of $50m to $100m for the value of the existing airport. However, such figures bear no relationship to the evaluations available to the Government. The Minister has seen reports to the effect that three of the nine Broome shire councillors are employees of Ansett. At present, she is not able to confirm them. Clearly, the Commonwealth is negotiating with the shire council as the duly elected representatives of the community. The current negotiations concern the transfer of the existing airport. However, before any new airport was constructed, the proponent would be required to meet the requirements of environmental legislation. I am advised that a tentative site for a new airport has been selected but has not yet been fully evaluated. We are not aware of the extent to which alternative sites have been investigated.

        Finally, the review of the aerodrome local ownership plan is still under consideration by the Government. Nonetheless, the model for airport transfers, established in recent transfers of airports at Kalgoorlie, Mackay, Mount Gambier and Camooweal, is clearly to the benefit of local communities. It is the judgment of the Minister that Broome would benefit from equivalent arrangements.

There are already a very large number of international gateways into Australia, given our population size. I think the onus would be very much on someone wanting to establish a new international status to make a very compelling case, because of the infrastructural costs with customs, quarantine and everything else that is associated with that. I do not say that in any spirit of negativism so far as the entrepreneurial enthusiasms of those in the Broome area are concerned, but just as a small matter to be borne in mind, given the long history of entrepreneurs in various parts of Australia talking about new international gateways in an environment where we already have a large number of those.

The electoral program, in terms of bureaucratic arrangements for an election timetable within the period that has been broadly identified, has been on track-or, at least, was on track in July. A degree of scepticism about the seriousness of purpose of the present military regime is entirely justified, given the variety of things that have been happening in the last couple of months, in particular in Myanmar.

The two go together. I am not satisfied that there has been such progress in recent times. I share Senator Hill's perception and concern about that. I do not think it is an issue on which to be scoring partisan points. I think we both share a concern about the situation there. I would hope that we can work together, with violins playing accordingly, to articulate a joint view of the world in the hope that that may have some impact on a regime that is notoriously insensitive to such international pressure.

For example, a headline in the Sun on 12 August referred to `a $250m aid waste bungle'. A number of other assertions of that kind appeared in the print media. The particular claim that was made on the television program was that there was waste in Australia's overseas aid program amounting to some $200m to $250m over an unspecified period-that is, up to one quarter of our annual aid budget. The actual press release that was issued by the Committee on 3 August identified specific instances in the aid area of what it claimed was waste which, even on the most optimistic or broad ranging reading of the claims, totalled $61m, not $250m, spread over eight financial years. If one looks at the specific allegations that were made, it is clear that any such claims are utterly without foundation.

        I will mention as quickly as I can some of the projects that were referred to. The proposed construction of a bridge over the Mekong River between Thailand and Laos was the largest item identified by the Committee as wasteful. The preliminary estimate for the design and construction was $35m over a five-year period. This project-the so-called Kangaroo Bridge, as it has been identified by the Thai and Loatian governments-is potentially of enormous economic and political significance to the countries of the region, and indeed to Australia. It will be the only bridge across the Mekong. It will be a very important trade conduit, having regard to the fact that the whole of Indo-China is potentially about to explode in terms of its economic development. It is enormously significant in terms of the total regional politics of the region and is an expression of Australia's commitment to it. A quite bizarre claim was made in respect of that.

        On the face of it, there was a slightly more plausible criticism of our aid to Brunei, Jamaica, Barbados and the Bahamas. The great majority of Australia's assistance to these countries in recent years has been in the form of subsidies to private overseas students. Although this scheme has served its purpose effectively in the past, it has been the subject of a full review over the last 12 months and is being phased out from the end of this calendar year. The savings that will be so made will be directed, in whole, to a new aid scholarship scheme which is targeted to focus much more precisely on the needs of particular deserving students, not just from developing countries worldwide but from developing countries within Australia's priority area. None of the four countries will be the subject of scholarships under the new scheme-certainly not the Caribbean ones-in the way the Committee mentioned.

        There is an allegation that in Myanmar-Burma-$68,000 was wasted on the purchase of agricultural motorbikes as part of a dairy development project. The motorbikes were supplied for use by veterinarians and artificial inseminators. This is the first time I have ever heard of a motorbike being used for artificial insemination, but that is another question. After the bikes were provided it was realised that some of the intended users, in particular women, had difficulty in handling them. We are now looking at the possibility of providing smaller machines. The bikes were chosen by the Burmese Government because of the height of the body of the bike above ground level. This is important given the roughness of the terrain. The question related particularly to what has happened to those bikes that cannot be ridden by the inseminators. Surplus bikes have not been thrown on the scrap heap or given away to other needy persons; they are currently in storage and it is expected that they will be used when the project is fully operational.

        Again, the Committee considers that our assistance to small Indian Ocean island countries-the Maldives, Mauritius and the Seychelles-was a questionable form of aid support. But all those three countries have particularly low standards of living. For example, in the Maldives the per capita income is just $300 per annum. Tourism is one of the very few sectors in each of these economies that show some signs of generating income. That industry deserves the kind of Australian support that was given in the aid projects funding in question.

        I have just two more specific examples I want to mention. The Committee identified Australian support for a women workers conference in Hong Kong as being questionable. That was a regional conference of Asian women workers from the entire area held in Hong Kong but it was designed to benefit all the countries of the region. The final specific item mentioned was the provision of $26,000 for a day care centre for poor children in E1 Salvador to assist in the training of women in child-care. I think it is just a demonstration of prejudice to claim that that is wasted or questionable aid. It is part of our women in development program. It might be argued that it would be better directed to priorities in the region rather than in Central America. I can understand that argument, but a particular project of that kind is entirely justifiable in its own terms. It is wholly extravagant to talk in terms of waste.

        Let me finally say, Mr President, that while I recognise that there are risks in managing an aid program of some $1.1 billion spread over a very large number of countries, things can go wrong in terms of targeting strategies, delivery and accountability in particular projects. Nonetheless, the Australian taxpayer can be satisfied that very rigorous risk management practices are in place. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau has developed a very effective system of project monitoring, evaluation and financial management. The whole program is subject to detailed scrutiny through the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, as well as other vehicles such as Estimates committees. It is a matter of concern that unfounded allegations of this kind can be made. They do tend to undermine bipartisan support, which is very important for the Australian aid program. It is a cheap and shoddy little exercise that does those participating in it no credit at all.

During the latter part of Question Time a further note was passed to me which helps redress some of the confusion that was earlier experienced. The situation is that Ms Hamill, on the latest information, remains a hostage in captivity. On our current estimate of numbers, four of the original hostages sought to escape. Three succeeded, but one was killed in the course of the attempt. Fifteen prisoners conducted the original hostage-taking exercise, one of whom is now dead. Two prisoners among the 15 were leaders or negotiators, one of whom was the person I referred to as having been killed. The mother of the other one has been sent in to endeavour to break the impasse which presently exists. So far as the condition of Ms Hamill herself is concerned, as reported by one of the successfully escaping hostages she has a slight facial wound but is not seriously hurt. That is the most recent information available to us as at just a few minutes ago. No assistance has been sought by the Philippines negotiating authorities from the Australian official there present and none has to date been offered by us, but obviously we will keep the situation under close review and if there is any way we can usefully help, we will.

         â€”On 16 June Senator Boswell asked me a question concerning consultation with the Norfolk Island Government on the telecommunications Bill, and I have the answer. Commonwealth legislation does not extend to Norfolk Island unless expressed so to do. Since the grant of self-government in 1979 the Government has pursued a policy of consultation with the Norfolk Island Government, so far as is practicable, on proposals to apply Commonwealth laws to the Territory. The policy is reflected in the Cabinet and legislation handbooks. On occasion it is not practicable to consult for reasons of urgency or where, by convention, consultation normally does not occur-for example, Budget legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The telecommunications Bill establishes Austel, which the Government was committed to having in place by 1 July. By the time the Bill was available there was little time for consultation prior to the introduction of the legislation. The 70-page exposure draft of the Bill sent by the Department of Transport and Communications on 22 March 1989 was received in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories on 29 March 1989. Comments were sought by 3 April. The Bill was forwarded to Norfolk Island on 30 March in a departmental bag. Unfortunately, the Bill did not arrive on the island until 10 April. It was immediately referred to the Norfolk Island Government, whose comments were received by my Department on 20 April and forwarded to the Department of Transport and Communications the same day. The legislation was not passed by the Senate until 7 June.
       </para>
       <para>
        My Department devotes considerable resources to consulting with the Norfolk Island Government on the application of Commonwealth legislation to the Territory but the process relies, among other things, on initiating departments following the established procedures for consultation outlined in Cabinet and legislation handbooks. The Norfolk Island Government often makes sound suggestions to improve legislation; however, it is the prerogative of the relevant Minister to decide whether or not to agree to amendments proposed by the Norfolk Island Government. Periodically my Department writes to all departments emphasising the need to consult with the Norfolk Island Government at an early stage on all legislative proposals affecting the Territory. The last such occasion was in January 1988. A further reminder will be issued in the near future.

         â€”During the course of Question Time we have had an unusually full set of public galleries. To the rear of the Opposition benches we have had a large number of pensioners who are probably here to keep an eye on the Government's Budget performance, and sitting behind the Government benches have been quite a number of school children. Looking at the people in the gallery has reminded me of how important the issue of the Australian economy is to the future of those children and to the continued welfare of those elderly citizens.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The debate on industrial relations which the Opposition is promoting on Budget day relates to the concern which is felt in the community about where Australia is going. It is quite clear to any of us who have spent time with those in the Australian community during the recess that there is a very deep concern about the future of Australia. I do not think there is any doubt that that concern flows not from the immediate pain of interest rates, it does not flow so much from the immediate concern of people who feel that 40c in the dollar on the extra dollar of overtime is an excessive tax impost, although they are the sorts of things that people raise as one moves around Australia. Far more fundamentally, people are concerned about the spectre of foreign debt, the general sense of declining living standards and, indeed, the general sense of national decline in a comparative sense.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the course of talking to people around Australia, on a couple of occasions I have compared the cents in Australia of 25 years ago with the cents in Australia today. The situation is very different. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), makes some muttered interjection but my point is that over that generation, that 25-year period, there has been a growth not in the certainties of Australian life but in the uncertainties, and I think that economic uncertainties are at the head of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        This morning in the Australian newspaper an article by Maxwell Newton helped to encapsulate some of the concern expressed. In Queensland, for example, there is a concern about the level of foreign investment-Japanese investment in particular. In Maxwell Newton's article we read an account of our comparative wealth today in our region as compared with that of a few years ago and we see a process of steady decline and a situation where the purchase of Australia by foreigners has become increasingly cheap. The simple reality is that a Japanese person wishing to buy a slice of Queensland in 1989 does so at half the yen cost of 1983. All of these things are simply part of a pattern of decline which the Opposition has been talking about and is deeply concerned about; and it reflects the deep concerns felt within the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight a Budget will be handed down. The truth is that no Budget will alter that decline. It may be that good macro-economic settings will improve the situation and poor macro-economic settings will make it worse, but the truth is that we will not solve Australia's problems by sleight of hand or the passage of Acts of Parliament, and we will not solve Australia's problems in a Budget. We will solve Australia's problems if we become a more effective producer of the goods and services that our people and the rest of the world want. There is a widespread understanding of that in Australia, and a widespread desire for change and for the Government to come to grips with that reality.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the things which should encourage any government of Australia at the end of the 1980s is what Mr Keating talked about, and that is the increased understanding by the Australian people-I think they certainly do understand it-that we in Australia have to become more competitive and more productive if we are to overcome the pressures of which, as I said before, high interest rates are merely a symptom. They are a very unpleasant symptom for those Australians who are buying a house, running a small business or a farm and who need to borrow working capital. Of course, they are a very unpleasant symptom, but they are a symptom rather than a cause of our present problems and the uncertainty that exists in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is in Australia's national interest as far as possible to find the common ground which exists as to what our problems are and how they ought to be solved. When one looks at the explosion in our foreign debt and its growth from a net figure of $23 billion in March 1983 when this Government came to power to a net figure, just six years later in March 1989, of $103 billion, the worsening situation since then, and the rapid growth of assets in Australia held by foreigners-which is again simply a symptom of the relative weakness of Australia in our region and elsewhere-one must ask: What are the causes?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Keating did us some service. In 1986 he described us as heading for a banana republic status. In April 1989 he said that our fundamental problem is that we consume more than we produce. The fundamental Keating, Button and Hawke strategy has been to impose very high interest rates on the Australian people so that their consumption is reduced. It is a simple application of one of the tools that the Treasurer and the Government have to reduce the consumption of the people of Australia. That is on the record. As recently as 12 July the Treasurer said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . if we did not slow the demand down so that the economy can live within its own product other than simply spilling into imports and overseas debt, then the catastrophic change which would then come by years and years of neglect-if that were to be the position-it would be very harmful to those people.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be very harmful to the young children and the elderly who are in the gallery today. The point that the Opposition has been hammering is the point which has finally been acknowledged by Mr Keating-that is, perhaps there is a more positive approach to solving Australia's problems. The suppression of Australian living standards has to be seen as an unpleasant, temporary expedient-not an expedient that should have been the Government's agenda from 1983 to 1989. The agenda should have been to increase the productive capacity of Australia. We find, from looking at statements made by Mr Keating a little later last July, that lifting production was very clearly becoming the national economic imperative. We find Mr Keating swinging around to the view that the imperative is to do something about production. In a radio interview in that same week he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Factories needed to lift production and workers needed to work double shifts ``to pull more product out''.
       </para>
       <para>
        We saw a sudden embracing by the Treasurer of the idea that the real approach to Australia's problems is to do something about the production of wealth. That reflects a view which has long been expressed by the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), who will take part in this debate, and I welcome that, is often very slick and glib and pushes aside the issues raised by the Opposition. He did it again in his response to a question by Senator Parer today. Senator Parer again raised the imbalance between wage rises and the increase in productivity in Australia. The Leader of the Government pushed that aside and accused Senator Parer of accusing members of the Australian work force of being bludgers. That is quite untrue. The fact is that Senator Button seems to find it very difficult to come to grips with the simple proposition that if we have money wage increases which are not underpinned by capacity to pay, then the whole thing is a lie: the wage rise is taken by the next round of inflation. Senator Button knows that has been the pattern and he knows that Australian workers, who he says have shown wage restraint, have in fact received money wage increases far higher than their foreign counterparts but they have not received real wage increases because the inflation rate has gobbled them up. The Government has robbed the Australian work force.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The final quote from Mr Keating recognises again a truth which the Government has not acted upon-that it is fundamental to our success that we move to a more flexible labour market. In May last year Mr Keating declared that labour market reform was `the last great area of change to be overcome'. He said that the policy objective was to create a flexible industrial relations system in which wages and conditions reflected the different levels of prosperity in different industries. That reflects again some of the thinking advanced by the Opposition for some years now.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this debate, on a day when all our attention is focused on the economic future of our country, the Opposition is fundamentally saying that the Government must adopt a new approach to industrial relations if it is to have any chance of getting Australia out of its present difficulties and easing the gloom and depression, the sense that Australia does not have a good future, the sort of future that we are entitled to. We think the Government needs to move to an enterprise based approach to industrial relations, which will encourage Australians to work together productively. The Government must cease its support for the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) promotion of 20 large trade unions without regard for the fundamental truth that to get a productivity lift in Australia we want not a smaller number of trade unions per se but a single trade union in each enterprise, if there is to be a trade union there at all. We want to do away with the multiplicity of unions in workplaces, which promotes workplace inefficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise that if we are to have an industrial relations system that works, we need to have a system which is enforceable, which is fair to both sides. As Mr Willis said in 1987, `If we are to have an effective arbitration system, it has to be one where there is compliance and both sides are bound'. He said that the present system and the present remedies are moribund. He then proposed that the system be made accountable and enforceable. He withdrew his proposals in the teeth of ACTU opposition. We say that there is a need for that trio of changes in the approach to industrial relations adopted by the Government and hence in the community-a move to an enterprise based approach which will encourage Australians to work together productively, promotion of a union structure which will complement that, and a system where both sides are bound to the rules and do not simply go their own way. These are not new propositions from the Opposition. In our industrial relations policy, which was reissued a year ago, we made our views clear. I quote from the policy:
       </para>
       <para>
        The key to good industrial relations and higher productivity is the strength and quality of the relationship between employer and employee. We need a system where employers and employees work as a team.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current system places the emphasis of industrial relations away from the workplace, thereby encouraging destructive `them and us' attitudes. It creates the perception that industrial relations is about winners and losers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our policy is about ensuring that the focus of industrial relations is where it belongs-at the level of the individual enterprise. At workplace level employers and employees can see most clearly that they have a common interest in the success of the enterprise.
       </para>
       <para>
        We reaffirmed that view in Future Directions, issued last December, when we said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We want to encourage management and employees to work more closely together to raise productivity. This will lead to higher real wages, and more satisfying and secure jobs. We also want to see people gaining a stake in their enterprise through employee share ownership, profit sharing and employee participation.
       </para>
       <para>
        We went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The current industrial relations system is based on the old adversarial approach, where workers and bosses were assumed always to be fighting each other. This is no longer the case. Employers are beginning to realise that their employees are their best asset, while most employees understand that their own prosperity and security is tied up with the success of their enterprise. People want to be treated as individuals, able to have control over their own working arrangements, not to have them dictated by union rules.
       </para>
       <para>
        I welcome the extent to which the present system and the Government have tried to move in some small way down the path that we have indicated. I know that the Leader of the Government in the Senate will get up and start talking about award restructuring, how this is very much along the lines of what is being sought and that this is the key to improved efficiency. The truth is that a survey of employers has shown that 80 per cent do not believe that they will not get any productivity gain from award restructuring. The sad fact of the matter is that if one reads the leading agreement in the award restructuring area-I invite the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce who is at the table, if he has not already done so, to read the metal trades agreement which is at the foremost of the push for award restructuring-one finds in that document on its face an acknowledgment of the enormous difficulty of moving that theoretical restructuring of award arrangements down into what is actually happening in the workplace, and the establishment of committees and arrangements. There is a desperate attempt-supplemented by taxpayers' funds from the Government-to translate a theory entered into by the leaders of the industry at both the trade union and employer level into reality within the workplaces of Australia. There are one million workplaces in Australia-I exaggerate, perhaps it is 800,000-and we cannot get those Australians working together productively in the way that is required by some centralised direction. The system has to encourage the process to be one that grows from the bottom up.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Business Council of Australia is doing some valuable work in trying to isolate what makes Australian enterprises more productive. It has yet to release its report, but it was interesting to see an interview with Mr Fred Hilmer who has headed up that task force and who is now moving in as the Dean of the Graduate School of Management in Sydney.

What Professor Hilmer had to say in an interview which was reported in the industrial relations and management newsletter makes clear that there really is a more satisfactory way of getting Australia out of its difficulties than the suppression of demand and the impoverishment of the Australian people, whether it is through high interest rates, high taxes or any of the other mechanisms which are available to Mr Keating to suppress the demand and the living standards of Australians.

One area which is most central to getting more effective work in Australian workplaces is off the agenda as far as the ACTU is concerned. That gives honourable senators some idea of the difficulties faced in individual enterprises. Honourable senators should look at the example that Mr Hilmer chooses to air in this interview. He looked at plants operating in Australia and overseas and he compared two operations which were similar, having the same machinery and product. He stated:

        Yet when we compared their productivity, the Australian plant was 20 per cent behind the European operation.

        We are not talking here about lazy workers, we are talking about people who, at both the management and employee level, have seen too much of the running of the enterprise taken out of their hands by bureaucrats of one sort or another. What we are promoting and saying is that we must push the affairs of the workplace back to the individual enterprise so that efficiencies will be obtained, so that Australia has the future that it deserves and so that we cease to head inexorably towards being the poor white trash of Asia. The workplace focus is central to our view. We have specific proposals as to how to promote it.

        Let me touch very quickly on union structure: demarcation disputes do not flow from a multiplicity of small unions. The statistics make it quite clear that the demarcation disputes that bedevil production in Australia are a product of conflict between large unions. There is no evidence that the union structure being promoted by Mr Kelty will reduce the number of unions within enterprises. The truth is that this Government has sought to get greater efficiency-I give it credit for having done so-in some of our defence industries. It has worked hard to reduce the number of unions within the enterprises. It reopened a dockyard on the condition that the number of unions was reduced, I think to three. The same condition applied with the submarine project. We say that the Government should be joining with us to encourage a structure of trade unions which will ensure that the movement is towards single enterprise bargaining units. This is not an anti-union bash or a policy which is against trade unions. Our policy, even in voluntary agreements, is that if workers wish to use trade unions as their agent, then that is their right and we would defend that right as strongly as we would defend their right not to join a trade union. The unions have a place if they can earn a place by performance, but the structure which is being promoted by the ACTU with the cooperation of the Government is not a structure which is in the interests of efficient production in Australia.

        Finally, I will touch on the question of enforceability. I have already quoted Mr Willis. In May 1987 he acknowledged that for the system to work properly it must bind both sides. It is notorious that the airline pilots ignored the direction of the Industrial Relations Commission. They even ignored the requirement that they attend before the Commission at specific hearings and they have said that they will go on ignoring it if it suits their purposes. The ACTU has made statements about the extent to which it will accept the national wage case depending on the outcome of the application of the case to five key industries-take it or leave it, according to whether the decision suits. In May 1987 Mr Willis said that it was not good enough, it was not the way the system should work. In August 1987, the leader of the ACTU, Mr Crean, said, `You cannot have a Bill with improved compliance provisions', and this Government caved in. I say to the Government, `We will bring on that Bill of which I have given notice today and give you another opportunity to reconsider that'. We want a system that is accountable, flexible and fair and which will be productive for Australia and get it out of the mess that is causing such depression and pessimism around the country. I commend this matter to the Minister's attention. I hope that he will do more in this response than the backhand, offhand efforts that he showed in Question Time in response to the matters which were raised with him by us.

In looking at this matter of public importance, I certainly agree with the need for a better approach to industrial relations. I certainly agree with Australians working together more productively to reduce the foreign debt and stop the slide in living standards.

        I want to say something about the observations which Senator Chaney made at the beginning of his speech before he got on to the subject of the matter of public importance. Before doing so, I must say that I did expect this matter of public importance today. After all, it is essentially the speech which Senator Chaney was going to give to the luncheon in Perth last week which was cancelled because, as I understand it, nobody was interested.

Senator Chaney began his comments with an expression of deep concern about the future of Australia-something which I and many Ministers in this Government and some in the Opposition share. He cited examples of his concern being reflected in what he referred to as general talks around Australia. He went on to say, for example, that people in Queensland were concerned about the level of foreign investment, particularly Japanese investment, in Australia. He said that these investments were being made at half the 1983 yen cost. Senator Chaney's speech could be made in the United States, in Canada, and in a number of other countries as a result of the enormous appreciation of the yen in the last few years. The fact that Japan is now the richest country on earth means that it can determine the future of the United States economy--

The yen is included in that basket. Senator Chaney went on to say that we need to become a more effective producer and to deal with the problem of consuming more than we produce. He referred to Mr Keating making that statement with which I entirely agree. After all, only in two of the last 13 years has Australia exported more by value than it has imported. Those two years were 1985 and 1986. Of course, that has some relevance to Senator Stone's interjection. Senator Chaney talked about the Treasurer's view that lifting production should be on the agenda, and I cannot but agree with that. He then went on to say that I cannot come to grips with the fact that money wages cannot be paid unless there is the capacity to pay. That proposition is quite sensible in itself, but it is totally unrelated to the reality of the current situation in Australia where employers are not backward in being prepared to pay higher wages-not at all.

         â€”I will stop talking to Comalco if the honourable senator wants me to-but I have not been doing so. I can come to grips with Senator Chaney's proposition, but I do not think it has much bearing on the current wages problem, which the honourable senator was concerned to address. If Senator Stone will stop talking for just a minute, I will continue with the rest of what I have to say. Again, Senator Chaney came back to the question of relative productivity. There are all sorts of arguments about the measure of productivity and there are many arguments about what induces better productivity, whether they be issues in the labour market, whether they be issues relating to investment, or whether they be issues relating to the use of capital investment. There are a whole range of issues which determine productivity. It is not just about labour market issues on their own, although I agree that they are very important.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What Senator Chaney is advocating in the course of his remarks is a system which, as he put it, would put industrial relations at the enterprise level; it would provide for flexibility in wage negotiations at that level, and so on. There are two warnings I would have to offer about that. I agree absolutely that the more we can introduce flexibility into the wages system and the more we can have industry and enterprise level negotiations on wages and other matters, the better the system will be. But if there is a rapid introduction of enterprise based wage bargaining, as advocated by the Opposition, I believe we are likely to face two major problems. The first problem relates to the fact that currently the non-traded goods and services sector of the economy has been growing at a faster rate than the traded goods sector. There is a very real danger that the more protected non-traded sector-which includes sections of the public services throughout Australia-is likely to bid for scarce skilled labour by paying higher wages, to the detriment of the traded sector and eventually our trade and inflation performance. Secondly, such an approach will risk the loss of control over one of the most important economic parameters-aggregate wage growth. The ability to maintain moderate wage growth in the face of a wide variety of labour market circumstances is absolutely critical. It is no good having a policy which says that the Industrial Relations Commission is to monitor the rate of wages growth. Governments, I believe, have to be prepared actively to influence the level of wage growth. This was recognised on 8 August by no less an authority than the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, when he was describing some of his reasons for his current optimism about Australia. He said that we have had a good farm season. He also said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We also get the benefit of the strengths of the world economy and we are also, unlike 1982 and 1974, we are not experiencing a major wages breakout . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The importance of the question of aggregate wages, of having some capacity to influence aggregate wage levels, and the importance of wage growth in the traded goods sector as against the non-traded goods sector cannot, in my view, be overestimated and lightly danced over by references to some of the admitted deficiencies in the present and historically based system of dealing with these issues in Australia. I hope-and I think we would all agree-that enterprise flexibility can be achieved through plant level implementation of new awards, certified agreements and the relaxation of demarcation rules even under the present system. The current wage approach policy of the Government and of the Industrial Relations Commission towards wage fixing guidelines maintains a framework for a sustainable wages system. It maintains the national framework but it also allows for productivity negotiations and workplace reform at the individual enterprise level. I want to refer to some examples of that in a minute. I must say again that an enterprise approach under present economic conditions will lead to a wages explosion-or could do-akin to those in 1974 and 1982, which were referred to by Mr Howard in his comments on 8 August.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present wages system allows quite revolutionary changes in the Australian context in dealing with questions relating to work practices at the enterprise level, especially from the reduction in the number of unions and awards which individual companies presently face. Whether they be companies, unions or employees, they have to work at it. A number of companies and unions are taking advantage of sections 115 and 118 of the new industrial relations legislation to implement special certified agreements. These agreements enable parties to achieve their mutual goals in a more workable environment than they have had in the past. They allow for greater flexibility in negotiations over wages and conditions, and the procedures of the Industrial Relations Act provide a safeguard against the risk of exploitation by either party or decisions which are totally inconsistent with the problems of national wage case principles and whether those decisions are inconsistent and contrary to the national interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me give examples of some of the success stories where people and companies have worked at these issues. For example, two certified agreements were ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission for ICI Australia Ltd-one at Mayfield in New South Wales and one at Gladstone in Queensland. Each of these agreements, which were certified under Industrial Relations Commission rules, contains employment conditions common to managers and production employees alike. They contain performance-based pay provisions. Demarcation is no longer an issue, with all production employees classified as plant technicians. Ultimately, ICI hopes to have individual agreements setting wages and conditions at each of its plants in Australia. Its priority is to develop training and career paths within the context of restructuring awards. The company is in the process of having discussions to implement these things throughout its plants in Australia. That is the result of a company which is prepared to work at it with its employees, as my colleague Senator Chaney would enjoin people to do. People ought to deal with these things at the plant or enterprise level. When a company comes along and does it we do not hear too much about it, but how many companies are doing it?
       </para>
       <para>
        I will give another example-and Senator Stone will probably interject because I have been talking to Comalco Aluminium Ltd again. Comalco is using the new Industrial Relations Act to process through the Commission an arrangement with the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia at its joint venture Southern Aluminium plant in Tasmania. When this agreement is ratified one union will cover the workers doing all classifications of work regardless of traditional demarcation lines. These things are happening under the existing systems where companies, employees and unions are prepared to work at them. That is very encouraging, in spite of all the concerns Senator Chaney expressed about these matters, I felt in a much more general way.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are various views about these issues and about whether the pace of reform is sufficient. Senator Chaney made reference to the metal trades award restructuring and said that a lot of people believed that nothing would happen. It will happen if they work at it.

         â€”No. It will happen if they work at it. Let us go back to the 4 per cent wage increase of a few years ago. Some companies worked at it and they got significant benefits out of it. Some companies will work at award restructuring and they will get benefits out of it; those who do not will not. The impediments which Senator Chaney identified in his speech-and I shuddered because I think he and the companies are right about this-are really bureaucratic impediments in the Australian system; not bureaucratic in the sense of public servants but bureaucratic in the sense of employer organisations, unions and everybody else having bureaucratic structures for dealing with these things. I understand that and I think it is a legitimate criticism which is frustrating but can be overcome by commitment and hard work, as has been done by ICI and Comalco, the two examples I used by way of illustration. Senator Chaney mentioned others in the public sector, such as the Williamstown Naval Dockyard, the submarine project and so on. So we are really left with the decision not so much about the direction of reform --

It is now clear that everything that goes on in individual workplaces is up for discussion and secondly, they can be discussed at both award level and enterprise level. That's very important because productivity will come from changes that actually occur in real live workplaces.

        That is a perspective from the Executive Director of the Business Council of Australia. I quote particularly from Mr McLaughlin's comment that `individual companies really have no excuse'-one could translate that as being no impediment by government-`if they fail to get productivity improvements of quite large dimensions'. While I share many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Chaney in his speech, although not necessarily the conclusions he draws, I am entitled to ask: What is this matter of public importance, which is directed at us, all about?

         â€”I think Senator Button posed a very valid question when he asked, `What is this matter of public importance all about?'. On the surface, the proposition Senator Chaney is arguing seems attractive. Let us look at the components of the proposition. It is being suggested by Senator Chaney and the Opposition that it is a matter of public importance that the Government change certain things; that the Government adopt a new approach to industrial relations which is enterprise based; that the Government encourage Australians to work together more productively to reduce our foreign debt; and that the Government stop the slide in Australia's living standards.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are three inherent propositions in this matter of public importance. The Australian Democrats, like the Government, are attracted to a certain extent by some of those components. For instance, it is unarguable and unquestionable that Australians should be encouraged to work together more productively to reduce our foreign debt; we accept that. It is unquestionable that the slide in Australia's living standard should be arrested. We accept that. However, we contend that it is questionable as to whether this would be the outcome of the Government adopting what is really the Opposition's industrial relations policy, namely, a policy based on the concept of enterprise based unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said in this place in previous debates, particularly the debate relating to the Industrial Relations Bill 1988, which passed in this Senate last year, essentially there are two fundamental concepts and approaches to industrial relations. They are represented on the one hand by the Government and on the other hand by the Opposition. The Australian Democrats see legitimacy and validity in arguments advanced by both sides on the industrial relation issue. However, we are not prepared to accept outright that all will be resolved by a sudden transition from one model to the other. Indeed, in the passage of the Industrial Relations Bill we argued that it was in the best interests of this nation that there be a gradual transition. In fact, we observed that there has been a significant transition in the nature of industrial relations in this country in the last decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chaney has pointed out, I believe quite rightly, that when the Opposition comes to power, as indeed it eventually will-I would not like to predict when-Australian industrial relations will move in the direction inherent in the fundamentals of this proposition, namely, towards an industrial relations model based on enterprise unions. We accept that that will be an outcome as a result of a change of government. However, the Australian Democrats see an inherent danger in the ultimate power and responsibility for industrial relations being given as glibly, strongly and overtly to employers as it has lain in the hands of employees in this country for a number of decades. The possible use of the principle of `divide and conquer' is quite obviously an inherent danger in the alternative model. In the same way as unionism grew out of the fundamental reality of `united we stand, divided we fall', so, alternatively, in the Opposition's model of industrial relations, there is the inherent danger of pursuit of the principle of `divide and conquer'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even now, this is apparent in some of the frayed edges of industrial relations: for example, the proposal to do away with maternity leave in defence related industries, a proposition that has been debated in those industries in just the last few weeks, and which has been resolved. We believe that inherent in that proposition of denial of the right to maternity leave was an indication that privileges must be, and will inevitably be, conceded one by one when the alternative model prevails. In other words, we see the possibility of the erosion of hard won pay and conditions as the real issue that must be addressed by Australian workers when confronted with the alternative model. There has been a long, hard toil for the conditions of pay and allowances won by Australian workers. We suggest that they will need to guard them very closely when the Opposition is at the industrial relations reins.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats support the current industrial relations system for three basic reasons. It is based on conciliation rather than confrontation. The objective in Australian industrial relations for decades has been to move from confrontation to conciliation. That has been achieved substantially in Australian industrial relations in the last couple of decades. That fundamental reality is now incorporated in a rational Industrial Relations Act which was enacted last year. The Australian Democrats believe that the present industrial relations system retains the best features of what has evolved in industrial relations in Australia. It has put aside the worst and retained the best. We see that gradual transition of capitalising and building upon the best as being appropriate. It was also developed in consultation with the relevant industrial organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It rests on the principle of accord. What about this principle of accord? The prices and incomes accord is still holding up rather well, although with some difficulty, after a number of years. Indeed, it is a principle that has received the praise of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The President of South Korea, Mr Roh Tae Woo, recently invited an Australian delegation consisting of Mr Simon Crean, President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bert Evans, Executive Director of the Metal Trades Industry Association, and Mr Ross Garnaut, an adviser to the Prime Minister, to visit South Korea and explain the workings of the accord system. This must be an indication that something about the Australian industrial relations system is working. It certainly is working. It has been an effective system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats have a positive attitude towards some aspects of enterprise based unions, which would allow for greater involvement of workers and management in the setting of long-term goals for a particular enterprise, such as increasing productivity and output, increasing skills of workers and management through training and re-training schemes, and increasing the penetration of foreign markets. That is one advantage of the enterprise based unions model. It would facilitate increased sharing by workers of management decisions and possibly profit sharing once a company had achieved its output, productivity and profitability aims. Of course, we note that the profitability aims could be jacked up to the point where there would be little left for workers to share after shareholders have made their claims on profit.
       </para>
       <para>
        We acknowledge that the certified agreements provisions in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 enable enterprise bargaining after Industrial Relations Commission approval has been gained. This could indicate that we are already slowly moving towards enterprise based unions in some situations. However, we must see how well the current provisions work before going further in that direction. In other words, we do not believe it is sensible or reasonable to expect a rapid transition from one model to the other. It will be rejected by the Australian worker unless that process is gradual. We acknowledge the merits in the alternative model, but we warn against a hasty transition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Do the Liberal and National parties really want enterprise based industrial relations or do they want something else? The current leadership espouses compromise and negotiation. I attribute both of those qualities to Senator Chaney's position on industrial relations. However, the New Right is deregulationist to the point of hysteria, as exemplified by the President of the Liberal Party and the assorted New Right ideologues who have taken over the Liberal Party's policy making mechanisms. In other words, will moderation prevail?
       </para>
       <para>
        What about deregulation of the labour market? At worst-and we must consider the worst proposition, the worst possible outcomes from the alternative model-the coalition's industrial relations policy stands for complete deregulation of the labour market. It would phase out the Industrial Relations Commission and eliminate the principle of minimum rates of pay. The strongest unions, whose labour services are in short supply, would extract the biggest pay rises. People working in unskilled areas where labour is plentiful would be forced to take the lowest rate for their work with no minimum awards. Their wages would drop. That is a possible worst outcome from the alternative model.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chaney raised the possibility of Australia becoming a banana republic. Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) cited that possibility some years ago and Senator Chaney has repeated it today. Another of the Opposition's aims is to put a time limit of six months on the payment of unemployment benefit. If it succeeded in that, as well as in deregulating the labour market, we would fast become a real banana republic-a country in which 30 per cent of the population would be forced into pseudo-slavery. They would be forced to work for whatever pay was available with no social security safety net and nowhere to live. This would be especially pertinent in my State of New South Wales where Sydney home prices are now beyond the wildest dreams of the bulk of the population. This would create a class of cheap servants willing to work ridiculous hours for food and shelter. This is where the New Right would lead us. This is what it would expect a Liberal-National Party industrial relations Minister to implement. That is the worst possible outcome, and we should be considering the worst possible outcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should be encouraging Australians to work together. Deregulation of the labour market would not achieve that. The union movement would simply revolt and we would revert to a situation similar to that of the last days of the Fraser Government, with wage explosions, industrial unrest, increasing unemployment and soaring inflation. Those were the characteristics of the last days of the Fraser Government. Those were the characteristics which typified a period when we had a government which was advocating this alternate model.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me turn briefly to the question of foreign debt and living standards. Ordinary Australian wage earners, pensioners, home buyers, rural producers and small businessmen have already experienced a decline in living standards through the expenditure cutting and high interest rate policies of this Government. We do not deny that. The Australian Democrats have acknowledged and cited that over and over again in this place. We are told that Australians must suffer to reduce our foreign debt. But whose foreign debt is it? The private sector debt accounts for well over half of our level of foreign indebtedness. The Bonds, Elliotts and Murdochs of our society borrow overseas and ordinary Australians are forced to tighten their belts because, we are told, we are borrowing too much. We are not borrowing too much; they are borrowing too much. Those who borrow overseas should be asked to pay for it, not the pensioners and home buyers. Currently, foreign borrowings by Australian companies to finance takeovers are subsidised by taxpayers. We do not have to wreak havoc with our industrial relations system to resolve these problems. We can simply disallow the tax deductions to companies which borrow overseas to finance takeovers.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are simply citing the fact that there are dangers inherent in the alternate model. Senator Chaney's proposition really says that it should be a matter of public importance that we implement the Opposition's industrial relations policy. We believe that it is a matter of public importance that this chamber and the Australian people are warned about the inherent dangers in both of them. We see the merits and demerits of both sides of the argument.

         â€”At the conclusion of Senator Button's remarks he asked-Senator McLean echoed the question-what this matter of public importance debate directed at the Government was all about. I understand Senator Button's state of bemusement because that seems to characterise his general state of mind these days. It was not so long ago-only a few weeks-that Senator Button was being interviewed on the Face to Face television program. After being cross-examined on what his industrial policies have achieved over the past few years he simply did not say very much. When he was asked how he would go about it if he had it all to do again, I felt rather sorry for Senator Button because he simply spread his hands apart and said, `I don't know'. If Senator Button does not know what this matter of public importance is all about-unfortunately he has left the chamber-I will, vicariously, direct his attention to some of the things that it is about.

        Today is Budget day. This will probably, although not certainly, be this Government's last Budget. Since the Budget is, after all, the single most important economic statement that any government makes in any given 12 months, as a rule, it will therefore probably be this Government's last opportunity to address Australia's fundamental-I emphasise the word `fundamental'-economic problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Chaney quite rightly said, if we go around this country and talk to average Australians and some of the small businessmen to whom, apparently, Senator Button does not talk-he talks to the great corporate chieftains-and we ask people what they feel about Australia, the almost universal response is that they are very worried about the future of this country. Depending upon their family circumstances they may be very worried about the future of their children. There is a state of growing concern characterised most pithily by people's concern about the extraordinary explosion of foreign indebtedness. In the last six years between March 1983 and March 1989 the foreign debt of Australians-that is, governments, private corporations and private individuals-has risen in net terms from $23 billion to nearly $104 billion. A great many people do not know those sorts of figures but they do understand, because they can see the evidence all around them, that this country is sliding into a morass of foreign debt at a frightening pace. They can also see-this is sometimes even more directly visible; Senator Chaney also referred to this and I believe it is particularly true of my own state of Queensland-the accelerating pace of foreign ownership of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mention this matter not in order to indulge in any sort of xenophobia about foreign investment in this country; on the contrary. Yet it is a matter of very great concern to Australians, who can see it happening around them, that somehow or other we are losing control of this country; we are losing control of our future. People may not understand all this economists' jargon, which, I must confess, I still sometimes fall into the error of using. They understand that when a family lives beyond its means at the pace at which this country has been living beyond its means under this Government for the past six years, and when that family accumulates debts in proportion to the magnitude of those that Australia has already accumulated-goodness knows, we will have accumulated another $15 billion before the next election at the pace things are going-when a family is in that situation and is being forced to sell off some of its assets, as Australia has been doing during the life of this Government, they know from their own observation of families that they have seen in those unfortunate circumstances that it is increasingly difficult to get themselves out of that situation. So they are concerned about the future of this country and about our ability to control that future and whether this control will not simply be taken out of our hands.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we come right down to fundamentals and discuss this with people in a commonsense way and with not too much economic jargon, everybody will agree in the end that it all stems from our fundamental inability to pay our way in the world. Our deficit in our balance of payments stems from the fact that we are not competitive. Our productive game is just not good enough. Our productivity performance-that is a bit of jargon, I suppose-the efficiency of our operating processes in our factories and other areas of production is simply dismal.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we see the Budget Papers tonight we will ask what this Budget will do to redress that situation. Although we have not seen the documents as yet I suspect that the answer will be nothing. If the press is to be believed, we will probably get some words as to how Mr Keating is going to restructure the Industries Assistance Commission, the Industries Commission and half a dozen other bodies to add to his own power base, and this new body will be given a task of reporting on this and that-but it will be just words, verbiage. It will not be actually doing anything to repair the parlous situation in which we find ourselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        If ever there was one major area that is crying out for reform it is the area to which the matter of public importance referred to by Senator Chaney relates-namely, the whole structure of our trade union movement in this country. During this century Australia has moved from being a country which at the beginning of the twentieth century was the richest country in the world in per capita terms. People in this country enjoyed the highest living standards and the highest income on average of any country in the world. Because we were a more egalitarian country-a matter with which I agree-our working people were even more ahead of their counterparts in other countries than those average figures would imply. What has happened in the past 89 years to move us to a situation in which we are no longer enjoying that admirable pre-eminence, in which we have declined more or less continually relative to other countries, in which we are sliding back to seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth or twentieth position in the world, depending on precisely which figures we look at?
       </para>
       <para>
        We are well back in the field of nations, having been in the very first rank 100 years ago. Although I do not have time in these brief remarks to develop this thesis to the length it deserves, the truth is that we have throughout this period been burdened with a system for the determination of wages and other conditions of employment as well as a system of trade union organisation which is a product of the nineteenth century. The craft union dominated trade union organisation brought to us largely from Britain is a product of the nineteenth century which increasingly is totally unfitted and inappropriate to the problems of the twentieth century, let alone the twenty-first century, which we are only 10 or 11 years away from entering.
       </para>
       <para>
        If Senator Button does not understand why this matter of public importance on this subject is directed to this Government today then all I can say is that he has not understood that basic point. It is about time that he and the Government he represents did. I accept what Senator Button said about one or two specific instances which he was able to cite-including the Southern Aluminium instance, which has not been finalised. They are precisely the forms of enterprise union to which the Opposition's industrial relations policy is directed and to which Senator Chaney was directing his remarks. Senator Button, in responding to that, said, `We the Government are already moving in that direction'. If we continue at that sort of snail's pace, which is the product of this Government's performance, it will be the twenty-second century before we get there, and by that time Australians will not be running this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week we saw what I can only describe as an irresponsible national wage case decision by the new Industrial Relations Commission-a decision which that body and the Government say will produce an increase in average wages this year of 6 1/2 per cent, but which every independent private commentator whom I have noticed remarking on the subject has indicated is likely to produce an increase of about 7 1/2 to 8 per cent. Why do I call that decision irresponsible? I call it irresponsible because the Commission noted, before moving to provide these awards, Australia's parlous economic state. The Commission said that in the light of that situation:
       </para>
       <para>
        There are substantial economic grounds for rejecting any notion of wage increases at the present time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding those words, the Industrial Relations Commission, having made its bow in the direction of what we might call economic propriety, then proceeded to move to economic irresponsibility with the decision that it handed down.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only the day after that decision was handed down the Australian Bureau of Statistics produced a paper entitled `Australian National Accounts March Quarter 1989: Gross Product Employment and Hours Worked', which said that labour productivity estimates continue to show very little change from the 1984-85 base year. That is to say, the real product per hour worked per worker employed has hardly changed over the past five years. What a record! What a performance by the present Government! How does that compare with overseas countries? We all know how it compares but I do not have time to go into it in detail. I used an analogy a moment ago of a family living beyond its means. How does a family that is in that situation deal with it? As we all know, there are only two ways: one is to pull in the belt; the other is to lift its productive game to bring more income into the household.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight I suppose we will have the product in Mr Keating's Budget of a process of telling people to pull in their belts. For some time now Mr Keating has been forcing Australians to pull in their belts. He has been doing that through exorbitantly high interests rates. We hear a lot about 17 per cent home loan rates; but the rates being paid by small businessmen, which in many ways are more important in terms of the productivity of this country, are 22 or 23 per cent, not 17 per cent. Mr Keating's view, however, is that the private sector should pull in its belt. He also believes the State governments should pull in their belts. He has told them that they will get less in funds this year. We will see how much sign there is in the Budget Speech tonight of the Government pulling in its belt. I predict confidently that tonight the Government will not be showing any sign of recognition that there is another and better alternative: lifting our productive game. It is that better alternative, through the recognition of the fundamental interdependence of the interests of employers and employees as reflected in enterprise unions, to which Senator Chaney's remarks were properly directed.

It is happening apace. In some establishments it is happening very fast but in other establishments it is happening not quite so fast. But have no fear; change is happening in Australia today. It is most certainly and most decidedly happening in the industrial relations area. We need to give this matter of public importance some attention and to examine the ramifications not only for the workers in industry, those that are producing the wealth of the nation, but also for Australians as a whole, those that depend on the welfare benefits that come from the taxation paid by workers.

        Senator Chaney gave an estimate of 800,000 work places in Australia today, an estimate which I hold him to. He initially said that there were between 800,000 and one million work places. It is quite conceivable that in a completely deregulated labour market a single union could emerge in each of those enterprises. One of the great cries in Australia today is that there are far too many unions, a sentiment that is agreed with by Labor senators and one that is supported by the Government. Its actions in bringing in the new industrial relations legislation last year is proof of that. How could we move from a position of having 300-odd unions to one of having nearly one million single unions? It is absolutely crazy! However there may be some merit in it for those who hold great influence within the Liberal Party of Australia today. Senator Button alluded to that. He talked about the New Right influences. In recent months we have seen a spate of preselection results from a number of individuals who were pre-eminent in the industrial relations sphere if not on a hands-on basis, as some of them would have liked, then certainly as speakers and writers on the subject of industrial relations. I refer to people like David Kemp, Peter Costello, Rod Kemp, Ian McLachlan and our own Senator Stone, the previous speaker, who has aspirations to move to the other place. We have also heard about Charles Copeman. Charles Copeman came to prominence in the area of industrial relations because of his involvement in an enterprise in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. What was then Cliffs Robe River Iron Associates was taken over and became Robe River Iron Associates, an iron ore mining operation operating out of Pannawonica and Cape Lambert. We saw industrial relations turned on its head. We are seeing it and witnessing it today in Western Australia. It demonstrates the ramifications of a single `union enterprise' thinking.

        That happened some years ago, but let us see what has happened in recent months. I just happened to have in my drawer in the chamber on the first day back after the recess an article that was printed in the West Australian of Tuesday, 23 May 1989. The headline states, `Paymistress quits after refusing to drive truck'. A paymistress is presumably a person with secretarial skills, perhaps one who operates a computer in an office, and such a person was told to drive a truck. Those honourable senators who have visited iron ore mines would appreciate the size of those trucks. This lady, Miss Sainsbury, was instructed to drive a truck. She was an employee of the enterprise and as such was subject to the directives of her master, Robe River-one of the leading New Right companies in this country. Such a company, along with Mudginberri and so forth, can be held up as an example of what would happen if the Opposition were in government.
       </para>
       <para>
        A few days later, on 26 May, another article appeared in the West Australian. I notice my colleague, Senator Foreman, has fairly rapidly left the chamber. He must have known what headline I would next refer to. The article was headed, `Foreman told to get out of town'. In part, the article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A mine foreman has been given a week to get out of town after protesting against the forced resignation of Pannawonica paymistress Andrea Sainsbury.
       </para>
       <para>
        So Robe River Iron Associates hits not only the hands-on workers, but also the supervisors-an enormous change. The individual who is credited with taking most of the action and with being the driving force behind the happenings at Robe River is one Charles Copeman.

        A couple of days after the leadership change I had to stand in for Fred Chaney at a Killara Liberal Party lunch.

It is merely a matter of implementing it.

        Senator Chaney had a few words to say about demarcation disputes. Anybody who has had any real contact with the trade union movement in Australia would know that most unions despise demarcation disputes and go out of their way to avoid them. In a demarcation dispute, we end up with no winners. Many thousands of disputes are resolved between unions; they never reach the formal dispute stage. Senator Chaney apparently has statistics to prove his assertion that only the large unions cause demarcation disputes. My brief involvement with the Australian union movement-Senator Crichton-Browne would appreciate that I am only very young-has given me the experience of seeing that not only large unions but also small unions-indeed, a preponderance of small unions-engage in demarcation disputes or are involved in matters that reach a real dispute stage.

        Senator Stone made great play about the size of our foreign debt. That is a worry to all, including the Government. It is something that has been addressed previously in a number of forums. He made the point that there is a fear in the community about the growth in foreign debt. But if we relate what Senator Stone had to say to the wording of the matter of public importance, we find a great conflict. The majority of the money that has been brought into Australia, which it now costs the Australian community to service, has been brought in to finance takeovers, mostly unproductive takeovers. We have had debates in this place about that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone also made the point that the level of foreign debt has grown over a period of years. He spoke about the decline in the standard of living of Australians, that we have gone from being at the top of the tree 89 years ago to being now at position No. 17, 18 or 19, depending on which graph one looks at.

        In reply to that comment, I make the point that for the majority of the 89 years that he referred to, this nation was governed by conservative governments.

        Senator McLean made a point about `divide and conquer' or `divide and rule'. That is something that pervades the industrial relations system in Australia. The industrial relations system is and has been structured as an adversarial system, but that is slowly being overcome. Despite the fact that the adversarial system is in place at the moment, there are many fine examples in Australian industry of employers and employees working together hand in glove-at different degrees and with different results, but it is happening. Change is occurring. It will occur with cooperation and with a will to achieve a real Australia for Australians.

        The Australian Labor Party has now been in government for 6 1/2 years-during 6 1/2 years of world prosperity. There is now no world recession or nationwide drought, as was the case during the last years of the Fraser Government; there is world prosperity. During this period, in recent years in particular, Australia has had high commodity prices, high volumes of sales of our basic commodities, and very much increased tourism. Under this Government there has been a substantial fall in the value of the Australian dollar. All of these opportunities have been wasted because it is now clear that this Government's policies have failed miserably. Since this Government came into office our foreign debt has increased from $23 billion to about $104 billion, an increase of about 400 per cent, a figure which is growing every year by a massive rate-at the rate of $17.75 billion or thereabouts this year, and at an estimated $20 billion next year, because that is the level of the current account deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        As my colleagues Senator Chaney and Senator Stone have well and truly pointed out, there is now vast concern in the community about these failed policies, the fall in living standards under this Government, and the level of foreign investment in Australia. Under this Government foreign investment in Australia, particularly in land, has become a cheap investment. Japanese people can now buy Australian land cheaply. Similarly, people from the United Kingdom and the United States and foreign companies operating in Australia now find that it is cheap to buy valuable Australian assets because of the great deficit which this country faces every year. Each year we need to make up this current account deficit. As I say, it is currently $17.75 billion or thereabouts and next year it is estimated to be about $20 billion. We have to borrow that amount of money from overseas or sell assets to people overseas to make up the deficit. This is now causing much concern in the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is wrong? The simple answer is that we are not producing enough goods of the kind that people in Australia and overseas want to buy. We are simply not producing enough. We cannot expect to get much more from our commodities being sold overseas; we cannot expect to get much more from our tourist dollar-although we are hoping to get a little more, undoubtedly. Clearly we have to make up the shortfall in our manufacturing industries. Companies have gone offshore rather than continue to produce in Australia. I quote in this regard the Hon. Joe Thompson, a former secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union. I am not quoting an employer; I am quoting a former secretary of a trade union. In a recent IPA Review article Joe Thompson said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . over the past 20 years, substantial sections of our manufacturing industry have ceased operating here and moved offshore . . . Much of this has been caused by what can only be termed the sabotage of our manufacturing industry by those unions which have exploited the present industrial relations system for short-term advantage.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:

        What has happened in Australia is that, as a result of the system introduced to suit the conditions of last century, Australian productivity improvement has been consistently below the average for major industrialised countries. We are simply not keeping pace. Since 1985 under this Government productivity has edged up at a miserable 0.4 per cent a year as the output per unit of labour. We are now at a stage where a Minister as senior as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is prepared to concede that the Government has got it wrong. That takes us back to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in 1987-that micro-economic reform would be-and I quote

        What has happened to that micro-economic reform? The Government started off by changing government business enterprises in a small way but then ran into a brick wall as it tried to push some minor changes to micro-economic reform through Caucus, which simply refused to endorse them, as did the Cabinet. Of course, the last straw so far as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) was concerned was the Government's failure to make a decision on the third runway at Mascot. At that time Senator Walsh said to his colleagues, `If you can't make that decision, how are you ever going to face up to some of the really tough decisions which have to be made to get this country right?'. According to the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 August, it was on again in Federal Cabinet last week when there were angry clashes between the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and his colleagues over micro-economic reform. It was reported that at one stage:

This Government's policies are simply to squeeze demand with high interest rates whereas our policies are to increase productivity. The Government will not solve the problems of this nation by its rhetoric. What needs to be done is to increase production. When we get into government-as soon as this Government is prepared to call an election-we propose to attack the basics: to attack inflation, to attack interest rates, to attack micro-economic reform and, in particular, to attack labour market reform, which is the subject of this debate today.

        According to a recent publication in the United Kingdom industrial disputation in Australia is 24 times higher than in Japan, about 50 times higher than in West Germany, about 2 1/2 times higher than the United Kingdom, and twice as high as the United States. This was referred to recently in an editorial in the Australian Financial Review dated Friday, 30 June 1989. Dealing with the report of the Japan External Trade Organisation, which had severely mauled Australian manufacturing industry, the editorial stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The painful truth is that Australia's current account agony-

       <para>
        that is referring to massive deficit every year-
       </para>
       <para>
        is not so much a matter of excess demand, as of inadequate production and sluggish productivity improvement . . . The JETRO report rightly rounded on the inflexibility, lack of loyalty, rigid award system and diversity of unions in the labour force. And the current round of ``restructuring'' already appears to equate more to cautious reorganisation, than to the revolution in attitudes and work practices that is truly required.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why our industrial relations policy is aimed at trying to improve the strength and quality of the relationship between employer and employee. Our policy does not attack employees. Our policy is designed to provide good industrial relations at the enterprise level. We want enterprise based organisations on behalf of employees dealing with employers and coming up with agreement binding on both parties, agreements which are enforceable in the courts and which will produce greater productivity to the mutual benefit of the company and its employees. We are not talking about cutting wages. We are talking about increasing wages by increasing productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987, when Mr Willis was Minister for Industrial Relations, he described the current system as moribund. That was over two years ago, yet still this Government has done nothing to change the system described by the Minister as moribund. The Government has not done anything to change the system because it is simply unable to do so. Its Caucus committee will not allow it to do anything about changing the system. We will change the system. Our central objective will be to improve efficiency in the Australian workplace. That is essential because our fundamental national problem is that we consume more than we produce. Becoming better producers is the only alternative to reducing our living standards. High inflation and high interest rates are just symptoms of our basic production problems. We will improve productivity by enabling employers and employees to negotiate pay and conditions at the enterprise level. Those employers and employees who choose to stay under the award system may continue to do so, but we will ensure that there are effective penalties for those who defy the orders of the Industrial Relations Commission. We will encourage employee share ownership and profit sharing. We will reduce the number of unions in each workplace. It is my ambition that we end up with, at the most, one union in each workplace-certainly one negotiating group of people, representing the employees in the workplace, entering into an agreement with the employer. We will ensure that there is genuine voluntary unionism.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are the fundamental reforms which need to be effected in the industrial relations market. Until such time as these reforms are effected Australia will continue to go down the drain at the rate it is going down the drain at the present moment. Australia will continue to be in a situation where every year it needs to borrow from foreigners to maintain some form of living standards, or where we need to sell our basic asset-our land-to foreigners in order to make up the deficit which continues to grow under this Government. This Government's policies have been shown to have been a total failure. Nowhere else in the world is a country going down the drain at the rate at which this country is going down the drain. At a time when there is no world recession, no Australian drought, this Government should have turned the country around so that it was more productive and able to pay its way in the world. As soon as the Liberal and National parties get into government we will take the basic steps-attack on the basics-to produce that sort of result.

The Opposition wants to give all power to the employers. That is what the Opposition is talking about. It is saying something that is absolutely unfair and unjust. Taking a small business enterprise of 100 people, according to the classic Opposition policy the 100 people employed in that enterprise will be encouraged to have their own union. It is said they should have their own union of 100 people, but the employer may have access to an employer's organisation-to the legal brains and the economic and management skills that are necessary to conduct a campaign against the 100 employees of that enterprise. The Opposition cannot see that there is no equity or fairness in a system which will allow the employer all the rights in the system of a myriad of unions that it wants to create. At the same time 100 people are expected to elect and finance their officials and to have the skills needed to negotiate in a modern system. It is just impossible. The Opposition bases its policy on the premise of destroying the ability of wage and salary earners to be fairly represented in the contest with capital. That is what it is about.

        In contrast, this Government is presiding over one of the greatest changes in existing practices that Australia has ever seen. At every level covered by this matter of public importance the Government is seeking to change people's attitudes-and it wants genuine change. We want change so that there will be progress. We are not following an ideological path, as the Opposition is. For example, there are 300 unions in Australia. For the first time the Australian Council of Trade Unions at its national congress has sought to persuade all sorts of unions to look at amalgamation so that we might have a smaller and more rational union arrangement in Australia, so that we might have efficiency, and so that we might reduce the number of unions represented in each enterprise. That process is taking place, but it must take place in a secure environment. People know that in struggles over many years the unions they have been associated with have preserved their interests and before they give anything away they want to feel comfortable with the people representing them. Hence they need to see their role in newer and larger enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process is also about democracy. We have to make sure that the rank and file in an enterprise are able to have their say in the new unions. That process is taking place, and it is taking place at a far greater pace than changes have previously occurred in the trade union movement. At the same time this Government, through the accord and with the cooperation of the union movement, is seeking to change enterprise work practices more than they have ever been changed in the history of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is congenitally incapable of understanding that to get change people really have to be free to change their attitude, free to take the first tentative step towards doing something differently, towards doing something that is qualitatively different from the life experience of the oldest employee and the newest employee in any enterprise. If people want the sorts of benefits that have been referred to, then they could well look to the quite sensible and scientific approach of using the union management as a catalyst to convince people in the arguments that take place and to encourage them to change their attitudes.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has provided a secure, sensible and comfortable relationship. People know that they will be given wage increases because of the guarantees of the tax and wage trade-offs that have occurred over a period. In other words, there is a complete package. People know that they can prepare for change, that they can change their work practices in a supportive environment. That is our way of doing things, and it has been successful. The only danger is that, were the coalition with its ideological blinkers to come to power, through some catastrophe, it would set us back. People would not have confidence. They would know, from what is inherently behind this matter of public importance, that the Liberal and National parties do not understand. One cannot wish for things to occur. This is an Opposition that wishes things would happen. The process is much harder.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process I have just described is difficult. People are uncertain. They look to their leaders. They trust the middle management union official, the organiser who has been calling at the work place for a number of years and who reassures them and works with them as they go through the process of change. It is that very positive approach that will allow people finally to say, `Yes, we will forgo something that has existed for 10 years or 30 years. We will change our practices. We will try to become more efficient'. If there is a way of doing this in Australia, with its long tradition of arrogant management and British shop stewards, as some people have epitomised it-I pay due deference to my Whip--

         â€”I know; that is why I said it in that way. If we are to change that situation-the inherited class-ridden system that has had such an influence in Australia-as we are gradually trying to do in industry, we must look to the successful manufacturing countries, which have shown that a cooperative type of management will achieve change. The back-of-the-axe style of leadership will not work. Even if it is hidden in a velvet glove, as it might be by the Opposition, it is still innately a New Right policy of unfairly altering the balance of forces in industry. We cannot achieve change in that way. Countries such as Sweden, West Germany and Japan have been successful once they have got people to cooperate. Opposition senators know from their party meetings that when they fight and argue with each other, as they so often do, they will not get the cooperation necessary to enable them to move forward. I am saying that they should apply the same principles when they talk about changes we want in enterprises, in factories or in offices.

       <para>
        The future of Australia lies not in talking in an almost neo-racist way about the Japanese buying our property and matters of that nature but in looking at what Japan has done. It is a country where the emphasis is on persuading people to contribute to arrangements for change in an enterprise because they know they will benefit. This Government believes that people who participate in change have to be guaranteed benefits. Those benefits have been demonstrated by this Government. Through the accord process we have persuaded wage and salary earners to look past their pay packets to see other goals that have to be achieved. As a result of wage and salary earners sacrificing the increased pay packets they might have obtained, more than one million jobs have been created. They have done this so that we will not have the chronic lists of people whose lives are destroyed through unemployment. That has been a conscious decision of this terrible trade union movement that Opposition senators traduce when they speak in this debate!
       </para>
       <para>
        Superannuation ensures that people have longer term security in their employment. Part of the process in an enterprise is to persuade people to do things that they have not done before, all of which have the effect of increasing productivity in that enterprise. This Government believes that it cannot just grab ideological positions and back them with statements about what should be done at an enterprise level. People will always take what a government says they should. There has been a long history in the trade union movement in Australia of people trying to use unequal power on others to make them comply, but they have fought back. That is not the way to go. It is the Opposition's way, and I acknowledge that, but it is not the way that this Government intends to go. We believe that productivity should be increased in a cooperative way. It can only occur in a modern industry where people are actually making suggestions. People who are sullen or unhappy will not make suggestions for improvements in productivity. This Government believes that it is carefully putting together a policy that will increase Australian productivity and solve foreign debt. Tonight we will take just another step in following the process through. The Budget which will be brought down tonight will take us further in the process of increasing productivity in this country.

        â€”by leave-During the debate on the matter of public importance, Senator McKiernan and Senator Childs both made reference to the New Right. There was a reference to my support of Mr Charles Copeman who is, of course, a Liberal candidate in New South Wales-a fact which I warmly welcome. The simple point that I wish to make is that of course I support Liberal candidates particularly when, as in the case of Mr Charles Copeman, they publicly advocate the settled policies of the coalition parties. In the particular matter referred to by Senator McKiernan that was the situation. Members of the Opposition have a very carefully considered and worked out industrial relations policy. It has the support of all members of the Opposition and of our candidates, and I am delighted when they promote it. Whether they then attract the label `New Right' from Senator McKiernan or any other honourable senator is a matter for them, but I reject the implication that there is in some way a supporting of extreme policies which are not the policies of the coalition.

       Administration of Aboriginal Affairs: Mr Menzies' Final Report
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable Members will recall that, on 11 April 1989, I made a statement in this House reporting on the outcome of a series of inquiries into the administration of Aboriginal Affairs. Those inquiries were established in response to allegations of serious shortcomings in the administration, including financial management, of the Aboriginal Development Commission and of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       At that time, while the bulk of the inquiries had been completed, I advised the House that a further report was expected from the Auditor-General in relation to some particular enterprise projects in the Aboriginal Development Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also indicated that the Government was awaiting a final report from Mr Andrew Menzies, AM, OBE, on certain matters which had not in his view otherwise been dealt with to finality.
      </para>
      <para>
       I made the point that, pending Mr Menzies' final report, it would be inappropriate to comment on the conduct of any individual. I also made it clear that, with the bulk of the inquiries then completed, the Government felt in a position to inform the Parliament of its views and intentions concerning organisational arrangements for the future, and I advised the House of actions which the Government proposed to take, while standing ready to refine our response and undertake any further action should that be necessary when remaining reports were received.
      </para>
      <para>
       Madam Speaker, the final report from Mr Menzies was received by the Government during the parliamentary recess.
      </para>
      <para>
       That report has four parts, but Mr Menzies has recommended, and the Government accepts, that Part 4 not be published, given that it contains only names and addresses of certain persons and one Aboriginal agency who made submissions in confidence.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report makes reference elsewhere to the inputs of the persons and agency concerned but their identities are not central to the issues discussed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Copies of Part 4 of the report have been made available to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the Leader of the National Party (Mr Blunt), the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines).
      </para>
      <para>
       For the information of honourable members, I now table in the House the final report from Mr Menzies, other than Part 4.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable members will find that Part 1 of the report is an introductory chapter, including an overview.
      </para>
      <para>
       Part 2 covers the inquiries into three matters involving Mr Charles Perkins, to which I shall return shortly.
      </para>
      <para>
       Part 3 of the report deals with a number of miscellaneous allegations which Mr Menzies has investigated. In the case of two of these allegations, the report indicates that they have been referred to police for investigation. By agreement with Mr Menzies, the Auditor-General will be reporting on one other case.
      </para>
      <para>
       In none of the cases in Part 3 on which Mr Menzies himself has reported was corruption or serious illegality established.
      </para>
      <para>
       While Mr Menzies finds some cases of questionable practice, he recognises that action is already in hand to respond properly in those cases.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Part 3 of the report, the only formal recommendation made by Mr Menzies relates to the activities of an organisation which is not a Commonwealth agency but is in receipt of Commonwealth funding. The relevant department, the Department of Community Services and Health, is acting on this recommendation. That Department is also following up the recommendation that the activities of a South Australian Aboriginal agency be reviewed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to that part of the report which deals with matters involving Mr Charles Perkins.
      </para>
      <para>
       By way of introduction, I remind honourable members that various allegations made about Commonwealth administration in the Aboriginal Affairs area over the past months have attracted a great deal of publicity.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many of the accusations have been extremely serious.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some, for example, alleged patronage, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Others alleged or implied corruption.
      </para>
      <para>
       The name of Charles Perkins was linked with many of those allegations and much of this publicity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The facts are that none of the several inquiries conducted for the Government, including this final report from Mr Menzies, supports allegations of that kind.
      </para>
      <para>
       I advised this House in April that the Public Service Commissioner did not substantiate allegations of patronage, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       None of these reports has substantiated in any way allegations of corruption.
      </para>
      <para>
       It can and should be firmly said, therefore, that these serious allegations, so prominently publicised, have been grossly unfair to Mr Perkins and his family.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is nothing which emerges from any of these intensive inquiries to suggest that Charles Perkins ever took any action out of self-interest or self-reward.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is true that he has occasionally been a controversial figure; but only, I believe, where he saw this as important to his continuing effectiveness as a leader of his people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable members will see that this final report from Mr Menzies brings out some further shortcomings in administration in the area of Aboriginal Affairs-in some cases shortcomings for which Mr Perkins, as the departmental Secretary over much of the period, has to bear ultimate responsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although such shortcomings are identified, however, Mr Menzies does not find that Mr Perkins' role in any of the three issues addressed in this final report amounts to failure to fulfil his duty as an officer such that disciplinary action should or could be taken against him.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would add, Madam Speaker, that the bulk of the deficiencies identified in the various inquiries conducted for the Government were in the Aboriginal Development Commission and not in the Department for which Mr Perkins carried ultimate responsibility. And even within the Department, there would be incongruity in any attempt to find the blame for most of these deficiencies in Charles Perkins personally. As the Public Service Commissioner found, there were deficiencies in systems and procedures going well beyond the realm of Mr Perkins' personal responsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is only one of the three issues relating to Mr Perkins on which I wish to comment further.
      </para>
      <para>
       This relates to the source of the $50 which Mr Perkins paid for taxi fares for some of the persons who were demonstrating outside the RSL Headquarters on 9 September 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the conclusions in his report, Mr Menzies expressed regret that Mr Perkins had refused to disclose to him the source of this $50.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report notes at paragraph 3.10 that Mr Perkins gave an ``unequivocal assurance that the $50 used for the taxi fares did not come from any political source at home or abroad or from any corporation or organisation. Neither did the money come from any official source''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact that Mr Menzies was not satisfied with this response has caused Mr Perkins' advisers to write to me submitting further information. I now table their letter.
      </para>
      <para>
       The letter points out that Mr Perkins' refusal to disclose the precise source of the funds was based on legal advice first in relation to a dispute over Mr Menzies' jurisdiction in this matter and, secondly, on what was seen as an undue invasion of personal privacy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given the conclusions on this matter reported by Mr Menzies, however, and notwithstanding their continuing concerns about privacy, Mr Perkins and his legal advisers have now provided in their letter to me an unequivocal assurance from Mr Perkins that he paid for the taxis out of his own pocket.
      </para>
      <para>
       I accept that assurance.
      </para>
      <para>
       I state again that none of these various and extensive inquiries commissioned by the Government has found any evidence of misconduct or other actions by Mr Perkins of a serious kind warranting disciplinary action or censure.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is time this House and this Parliament put those matters behind it and instead expressed its recognition of the substantial contribution Charles Perkins has made throughout his working life in the interests of advancing the cause of the Aboriginal people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Perkins was at the vanguard of Aboriginal people to have a degree conferred on him from an Australian university, and while at university was President of Student Action for Aborigines.
      </para>
      <para>
       He became more widely know during the period from 1965 to 1969 when he was Manager of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       He then moved into the government arena and for some 20 years has been applying all his energy, and drawing deeply on his commitment, to advance the cause of his people from his various positions within the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       He has been a path-breaker for his people in working his way up through public service ranks in a competitive environment until he reached the top-the position from which he was best able to guide the development of policies and programs of value to Aboriginal people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Charles Perkins believed that one of his most important roles was to keep in close touch with as many individual Aboriginal people, and as many Aboriginal communities, as he possibly could. Accordingly, he travelled extensively, and was able to bring to this and previous governments an invaluable insight into the concerns and attitudes of his people.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is the context in which Honourable Members should view the reflections in these various inquiry reports on administrative shortcomings in organisational areas for which Mr Perkins has had responsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       Madam Speaker, Charles Perkins advised me some time ago that he wished to retire from the public service as soon as possible to pursue an alternative career, and has recently arranged to do so in the normal way through the Public Service Commissioner. I am advised his retirement will take effect from today.
      </para>
      <para>
       I express, on behalf of the Government, regret that his services as a full-time officer will be lost to the Government, and I hope Honourable Members will join me in wishing him well in his future career.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the Government's part, it will be actively seeking appropriate opportunities to engage Mr Perkins in appropriate part-time activity so that the wealth of his knowledge and experience is not totally lost to the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I want to turn to the central issue in all of these inquiries-the quality of administration in Aboriginal Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       I remind the House of the Government's approach set out in my statement of 11 April: that we should draw upon the lessons from these inquiries and look to the future, ensuring that mechanisms are put in place and support provided so that future administration is enhanced.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since then, steps have been taken in both the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to respond to findings in the earlier inquiry reports which were addressed in my statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of the Aboriginal Development Commission, the adequacy of the Commission's procedures, systems and management controls has been audited by Price Waterhouse in the light of the findings in the earlier inquiries, and the recommendations from Price Waterhouse have now been implemented. A Budget Management Committee and Audit Committee consisting of senior managers have been established in order to strengthen financial management and accountability. The Commission has also established a computer-based reporting system on program and project performance using monitoring indicators similar to those used in its reports to the Senate Estimates Committee. Program and project performance reports are provided regularly to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of the Department, substantial progress has been made in the development of program budgeting and in the provision of training for implementation of program budgeting and continues to be made in the administration of grant programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Ways in which aboriginalisation may be advanced are under discussion with Unions, the Public Service Commission and the Department of Employment, Education and Training.
      </para>
      <para>
       New guidelines have been issued for official hospitality and for use of consultants; travel practices have been reviewed; and corrective action has been taken in regard to classification matters as recommended by the Department of Finance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most importantly, priority has been given to staff development and training which will provide the specialist skills required for the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude by reminding Honourable Members of what I said in this House about ATSIC in my statement on 11 April.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's view then was and still is that this new Commission is the logical and appropriate next step for the advancement of both the great principles of self-management and ministerial accountability.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nothing in the earlier inquiry reports, nor in this final report from Mr Menzies, has shifted that belief on that part of the Government. Indeed as I said in April, the inquiry reports give us encouragement that the proposed structure of ATSIC will be beneficial. As Prime Minister I fully support, and the Government as a whole fully supports, the initiatives the Minister has taken in proposing the creation of ATSIC.
      </para>
      <para>
       As Honourable Members know, we have made some amendments to the ATSIC legislation in the light of these various inquiry reports and the report of the Senate Select Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having done so, we are now firmly committed to proceeding with this legislation and establishing this body as quickly as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       I hope this House and this Parliament will now accept that passage of this legislation and establishment of ATSIC is clearly in the best interests both of good government and of the necessary advancement of the administration of aboriginal policy and programs for the benefit of the aboriginal people of this country.

       This statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is the latest in a series of statements and reports which touch upon the administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. Most of the statements, if not all of them, have been prompted by the assiduous attention to this area of policy by a significant number of Opposition senators. It is almost invidious to start naming names because I will leave some out, but Senator Tambling from the Northern Territory is actually referred to in this report. Senator Short, who is behind me, has taken a very active interest, as have Senator Crichton-Browne, you, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Boswell, and I, as the official spokesman in this matter. A number of others, such as Senator Stone, have given very solid service.

      <para>
       The reports encompass a tragic tale of maladministration and failure. The occasion of the tabling of this particular report, which is the end of the series of formal reports that we are to receive, and the receipt of the Prime Minister's statement is not the time to enter into a debate on the whole range of issues which have been canvassed and which will be canvassed again in the no doubt lengthy debate we will have on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation over the coming weeks.

       I do want to say that I do not think there is any doubt that the Opposition's pursuit of these matters has been vindicated in the various reports issuing out of the many inquiries, including this inquiry. I think indeed the Prime Minister's statement today admits as much. If honourable senators examine the report they will find under the heading `General observations' on page 6 it is stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . nothing I-

      <para>

      <para>
       have seen in the course of my investigations throws doubt on the recommendations made by Mr Bruce MacDonald in his Report as delegate of the Public Service Commissioner on Allegations as to Certain Aspects of Personnel Management in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs . . . and endorsed by the Public Service Commissioner that a senior-level Task Force supported by seconded expert officers should be established to assist D.A.A. to improve its administration.
      </para>
      <para>
       Before I make any other comments, let me make it quite clear that the Opposition's view about the maladministration which has been uncovered is that it is in no way to be laid at the feet of the public servants involved. The Opposition has at all times made it clear that it regards this as a singularly deficient area of administration at the ministerial level. Those of us who have had close experience of this portfolio-and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, were a Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, as I was too, in the late 1970s-would know of the many difficulties and we have not tried in our pursuit of these matters to disguise the real difficulties which are faced by any administration and any set of public servants.
      </para>
      <para>
       The central charge that we have brought has not been a charge against Mr Perkins or Mr Gray, the present Secretary, or any of the other officers who have worked so hard in this area for some decades. The two officers that I have mentioned have certainly put 20 years and more of service into this area. It is a charge against the extraordinary failure of the Government to ensure that the Ministers, Mr Holding and Mr Hand, should devote attention to the key matter which needs attention from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand; namely, the examination of the impact of the highly expensive programs which were undertaken on the Aboriginal community in Australia, and the need to direct continuous attention to the propriety of administration in a most difficult area which is substantially administered by Aboriginal people themselves, by Aboriginal organisations and communities-often people with a legacy which has ill-fitted them for responsibility but in accordance with the generally acknowledged social theory that the best way to help a deprived and disadvantaged people is to give them responsibility for their own affairs and some assistance with resources to ensure that they can do something about their own situation. That course, which was really commenced in the mid-1970s and which has proceeded on a bipartisan basis, really puts an enormous obligation upon government, and I believe upon Ministers, to put in the sort of time-I know you did, Mr Acting Deputy President, and, indeed, I think it has been the pattern of Ministers in this portfolio-to try to keep a close contact with what is happening on the ground and not to accept any narrow part of the Aboriginal community as the source of advice, but rather to seek the widest possible advice and to keep in touch with the widest possible group of people.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have seen the dismissal of the National Aboriginal Conference by this Government, the undermining of the Aboriginal Development Commission and the dismissal of the ADC commissioners when they disagreed with the Government. So many things can be said about the failures, but essentially I lay the blame at the feet of the Prime Minister and of the two Ministers-the Prime Minister for his grandstanding, self-indulgent approach to this portfolio which has given rise to intermittent involvement on a theatrical basis without an underpinning of careful preparation or concern for the practical outcome and, on the part of the Ministers, the chasing of mirages.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have the Prime Minister's theatrical efforts in the Northern Territory when he re-awoke the question of a treaty which we confirmed by inquiry in the Senate. The Estimates Committee was not preceded by any detailed work by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We had the embracing of national land rights as the central policy objective by Minister Holding under circumstances where anyone with experience in the area knew that that would never happen, that it was simply not a legal, constitutional, administrative or political possibility. The subsequent chasing of an entirely new approach by Minister Hand and the terrible dangers that the Aboriginal community now faces through ATSIC are matters which are of great concern to the Opposition and on which we have spoken and will continue to speak. In a funny way the Menzies inquiry into the allegations which went to certain individuals bears out the concerns which the Opposition has had.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having laid the blame where we think it lies, mainly with the Prime Minister and the Ministers, let me turn to Mr Perkins. Charles Perkins is a man who, according to the Prime Minister's statement, was at the vanguard of Aboriginal people to have a degree. He was widely involved in working for the Aboriginal people and so on. All of that is a matter which is well known to me and which I accept. The Prime Minister said:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is true that he has occasionally been a controversial figure . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not think any of us who have dealt with Mr Perkins would deny that. He was for any Minister at times a difficult working companion because he would be outspoken on matters which perhaps were not the province of a public servant but rather the province of those who were actively engaged in the political process. But it is a matter of satisfaction to me that Charles Perkins has been exonerated of any illegal conduct or any serious impropriety. There is some questioning of his personal involvement in the matter of the trip of Hetti Perkins when she was sent to New York as part of an artistic delegation. That is an area of judgment which is recorded. In Mr Menzies very careful way it is drawn out, and he reaches the conclusion, that no action should be taken other than that the matter should be drawn to Mr Perkins's attention. But it so fits in with the way this Government has approached Aboriginal affairs that we now have the Prime Minister saying all these nice things about Mr Perkins such as, `There is nothing wrong with Mr Perkins, but we sacked him'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. Why did Mr Hand sack Mr Perkins if he did nothing wrong? I find the Prime Minister's statement rather sickening. Whilst Mr Perkins will get satisfaction from his public exoneration, he must be left in a very puzzled state as to why the Minister sacked him. This is a man who was difficult at times for our side of politics. Members of the National Party in here will recall some of his rather political statements relating to the National Party of Queensland. I can remember being in government and having to deal with the difficulties that Mr Perkins did at times create for the Government when he was serving as a public servant, but I appointed him to head up the ADC.
      </para>
      <para>
       He was the Deputy Secretary to the Department when I was Minister and I worked with him in perfect harmony because, with the inspired leadership of the Department by Tony Ayers, the Deputy Secretary was able to work in a framework with his departmental head and Minister. He knew where he stood and where the rules were established and I believe that, subject to those occasional outbreaks-which I do not think occurred during my period as Minister-Mr Perkins performed in a quite extraordinary way when we consider that he is a man who, like so many Aboriginals of his generation, was taken away from his family to be educated in an institution, who put himself through university by playing professional football, who was one of the first, if not the first, Aboriginal graduate, and who has put in a pretty inspired 20 or 30 years. He was instrumental in raising the consciousness of white Australians with the freedom rides in New South Wales which preceded the great growth of interest in the plight of the Aboriginal people and was instrumental in drawing it to the public's attention. This whole statement of the Prime Minister is just so typical of the pathetic approach to Aboriginal affairs in this Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now we have sitting in a front bench position but not on the front bench the senator from the Australian Capital Territory who chaired the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs which looked at ATSIC. It produced a fascinating report. I hope when the honourable senator is an old man he reads the things he wrote about the failures of consultation and the clear expectation of the Aboriginal community that there would be further consultation before this proceeded and in the end in some way rationalise that with the majority view of the Committee which sits so oddly with the evidence that was given to the Committee as described. I think that was a source of great disappointment to me and to other people in the Opposition. The truth of the matter is that this report exonerates the man who was sacked by Mr Hand. I think one is therefore entitled to ask why.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not wish to say anything which contests the positive things which have been said at this late stage, on the day when the Government can say as many nice things as it likes because Mr Perkins is leaving the Public Service today. He leaves having achieved the status of having been a departmental head, a member of the First Division and with a quite extraordinary record of achievement. It will be interesting to see what he does to add to that achievement now that he has left the Public Service. I certainly wish him well and I have no doubt that he will find other ways to contribute to the Aboriginal community.
      </para>
      <para>
       It needs to be recorded that during the period of Mr Perkins's administration there were faults which are still being addressed in the administration of his Department. I think there is a fair description of the reason why that could develop under Mr Perkins's secretaryship because I agree with what is said by the Prime Minister at page 9 of his printed statement:
      </para>
      <para>
       Charles Perkins believed that one of his most important roles was to keep in close touch with as many individual Aboriginal people, and as many Aboriginal communities, as he possibly could. Accordingly, he travelled extensively, and was able to bring to this and previous governments an invaluable insight into the concerns and attitudes of his people.
      </para>
      <para>
       They are the Prime Minister's words and I think they accurately describe both the way in which Charles Perkins worked and the role which he played. But that is not new. That element of Mr Perkins's administration was clearly understood by all of us who worked with him. What that demonstrated, or made clear, was that there was a need to ensure that the orderly administration of the Department was guaranteed by those other people in the Department who worked with Mr Perkins. I do not think that any Minister can escape the responsibility for not knowing, if the Ministers claim a lack of knowledge or, if they did know, doing nothing about the failures of administration which are recorded in the Menzies report as they have been recorded in other reports. The truth is that the Ministers cannot escape one charge or another. The charge either is that they were not close enough to the Department to know that this maladministration was occurring or, alternatively, they knew and did nothing about it. I suppose none of the inquiries produced so far tell us which was the particular fault that the Ministers fell into. Any dispassionate observer of the administration of Aboriginal affairs under the Hawke Government would say that it is the shabbiest and least successful area of Government administration. I think we would base that on the facts which have been disclosed so fully over the last 12 months and more. I do not think any dispassionate observer could fail to note the focus, the concentration and the near obsession on totemic objectives-the things that I have already referred to.
      </para>
      <para>
       Within the bureaucracy in the late 1970s clear advice was available on the unlikelihood that national land rights could ever be a realistic option for the Commonwealth. That was not based on an assessment of whether it was desirable; it was based on an assessment of how the Australian Constitution works, how the State administration works and on all the factors which would influence it. Clear information was available that on a constitutional, legal, administrative as well as political basis, it was not on. I remember one piece of the advice was that if people had national land rights which took the administration of Aboriginal land out of the hands of the States and if the States sought to not cooperate, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to establish effectively a mini-State administration in those areas. That is the sort of advice that was available. Yet for 4 1/2 years into the life of this Government that mirage was kept alive; that distraction from the tasks which could and should have been undertaken was allowed to continue; and that deception of the Aboriginal people continued.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other totemic issue-the issue of a treaty-was raised, as I said a few minutes ago, by the Prime Minister without any detailed consideration of its implications for Australia or the Aboriginal community and it was grossly irresponsible. These reports do not give us an expert inquiry into the role of the Prime Minister and the two Ministers. I will tell honourable senators that I do not think they will ever allow themselves to be subjected to that sort of inquiry, because I think Charles Perkins would come up smelling like a rose and they would come up smelling like something very different.
      </para>
      <para>
       I welcome the statement in so far as it makes clear that the blame for the problems is not to be laid at the door of this public servant, who today is leaving the Public Service. I think it is a further, clear indication that the blame lies with the Australian Labor Party, and in particular the three senior members of the Labor Party that I have mentioned. I do not believe that it is proposed to prolong this debate today. Under those circumstances, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       </para>
       <para>
        The report entitled Disodium Carbonate (Soda Ash) was prepared by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). The Industries Assistance Commission has today made what may well be its last report to this chamber. I suppose for some time the whole future of the IAC has been under some kind of threat because this Government has set out to undermine it and to remove from its agenda its capacity to initiate its own inquiries. If we can go by press reports last week, the IAC has been the subject of major disputes within the Ministry and within the Cabinet. There is no doubt that these heated debates show exactly how reluctant this Government has been to grasp the nettle of micro-economic reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        We understand from press reports that the IAC has little more to do, unless the Government does something dramatic. This report on disodium carbonate-soda ash-is one of the last in the pot before the Government empties the whole thing out and tries to start again. One report on non-taxed government charges and one report on travel and tourism are still to come next month, but after that the IAC appears to have little or no work to do. Why has the Government set out to emasculate what should be one of the most effective bodies in bringing about micro-economic reform and encouraging industry to become less protected and less subject to the sorts of pressures that exist under a protective device where the union movement tends to take advantage of that cosseted state in order to encourage what, on many occasions, are work practices which are unsustainable and which unfortunately maintain, perpetuate and worsen the uncompetitive nature of so much of Australian industry?
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the additional things the IAC has been doing has been getting lots of people within the bureaucracy of this Government very much offside. The IAC has been pointing out how inefficient are so many of the Government's own bodies and how charges by so many of them are excessive. It certainly took a role in seeking to improve the efficiency of the maritime industry. We saw how its inquiries into the waterfront and into coastal shipping have been totally supported by the Inter-State Commission in a much more detailed and much more expensive inquiry. But there is no doubt that the IAC's major conclusions have been supported by a far more detailed inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that the IAC has been the subject of massive internal disputes within this Government because this Government does not have the capacity to grasp the nettle-the need for major micro-economic reforms if this country is to get itself out of the enormous economic crisis that governmental policies have put it into. Senator Button was evidently enraged by losing control of the IAC a couple of years ago. Apparently Senator Button has been on the receiving end of severe criticism within the Cabinet over this. Yet, as I understand it, there is major resistance within this Government to any suggestion that the IAC might be given, say, additional power. For example, if got the backing and support that the Inter-State Commission has, which is a constitutional support, and it was merged with that body, there is no doubt that it would have the capacity to do what this Government does not want-in other words, have its own references, its own independence, its capacity to be strong and vibrant again, rather than to be subject to the sorts of negative controls that this Government has imposed on it, particularly the control of starving it of work, status and the capacity to bring about the micro-economic reforms that this nation needs.

         â€”I would also like to address the motion that the Senate take note of the report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) entitled Disodium Carbonate (Soda Ash). Today could be a momentous day in the history of the IAC. Over the years the Industries Assistance Commission has served Australia well. Its preceding 418 reports and other information papers have highlighted the cost to Australia of industry protection and have pointed the way to various micro-economic reforms which would increase the international competitiveness of Australian industry. But this Hawke Government, and particular Ministers, have not wanted to hear the IAC's messages. There may very well be substantial changes to the IAC in tonight's Budget. I have been referring to the possibility of those changes since the April-May statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when I believed he was about to announce the changes which he will probably make tonight.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is very interesting to read a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 August which states that the Treasurer, Mr Keating:
       </para>
       <para>
        Reacting to a comment by Senator Button that Mr Keating had `not sent a new reference to the IAC in the last nine months', the Treasurer let fly with a stream of invectives about the reluctance of his Cabinet colleagues to embrace micro reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cannot disagree with any of that. I do not disagree with Senator Button that Mr Keating has not sent a reference to the IAC in the last nine months. I do not disagree with the Treasurer that his colleagues in Cabinet are reluctant to embrace micro-economic reform. On this side of the chamber, we have been reminding the Senate for many, many months, and again today, that micro-economic reform was supposed to be the key element of the Government's third term agenda and that, while this Government is continually talking about micro-economic reform, it is failing to deliver those reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987 the Treasurer seized control of the IAC from Senator Button. It was clear at that time that Mr Keating did not believe that Senator Button was making full use of the IAC. Having taken over control of the IAC, the Treasurer continued to waste its resources, as I pointed out in numerous press releases at the time. It took the Treasurer until Australia Day 1988 to announce the forward work program for the IAC. There was a grand three or four page press release saying, `This is the forward program of the IAC', and then it took him five months to actually deliver the references to the IAC. He is good on the rhetoric, on the press conference and on telling the journalists what he is going to do, but he is not good on the detail of actually doing it, which is delivering the references, and not good at all on implementing them. He is correct in criticising his colleagues such as Senator Richardson. He is not interested in micro-economic reform. There has been no meaningful reform by this Government on the waterfront, coastal shipping and the labour market, despite lots of talk. It is not interested in implementing reform; it is interested in perceptions. It does not want the actual reform; it wants a perception.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what we will hear a bit about tonight from the Treasurer. There will be a lot of rhetoric about changes that he will make under this Government and all the rest of it. We want to see some action on the actual micro-economic reform, not a lot of talk about micro-economic reform. The truth is that Australia is bleeding from the jugular. As we mentioned before, the current account deficit is running at over $17 billion for this year and estimated to be $20 billion for the next year. We desperately need the reforms that the IAC has been talking about to increase our international competitiveness. No doubt tonight the Treasurer will be hoping that announcements of changes will give the impression that the Government is undertaking meaningful micro-economic reform, but those who understand what that term means will realise that the Government's actions since 1987 in relation to micro-economic reform have in fact been a complete sham.

It is perhaps to be described in rather different terms to the last maladministration that I was addressing.

          â€”Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 15 June 1989, I lay on the table the fourth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune: minimising the risks of funding political campaigns, which was presented to me on 4 August 1989. In accordance with the terms of the resolution, I have authorised the printing and circulation of the report.

        I am Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which produced the fourth report of the Joint Standing Committee into the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referendums. I speak to the report, which very unfortunately is entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune, and which deals with the question of the payment of political advertising in the electronic media during election campaigns and the question of the general funding of those campaigns. The report also deals with the disclosure of donations to political parties. However, that was only six pages out of a report of a much larger size. They are matters that I believe go to the core of the democratic political system in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report was divided very much along party lines. The members of the Government, who of course had the majority on the Committee, supported one set of recommendations. They were supported in those recommendations by the Australian Democrats member, Senator Jenkins, and on one of the major sets of recommendations by Senator Harradine. The Opposition members, Mr Michael Cobb, Dr Wooldridge and myself, with the support of Senator Harradine on one of the critical recommendations relating to political advertising payments, were in opposition to the majority findings of the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the brief time available this evening, I say on behalf of the Opposition that the findings or recommendations of the majority of the Committee in relation to political advertising and the payment for political advertising during the election campaigns in the electronic media were, in our view, the most undemocratic recommendations that have ever been brought into the Parliament of this country. They were not only undemocratic but also formed a colossal set of censorship rules.

        â€”Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is delivering in the House of Representatives his Budget Speech for 1989-90. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In presenting last year's Budget I said that Australia was on the way to a systematic restructuring of its economy, making it more dynamic and more able to compete in the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tonight, I can report that we are much further down the road of that fundamental restructuring than we were a year ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is because the past year has seen the consolidation of the most significant investment phase since Federation.
      </para>
      <para>
       And it is investment which is the key to a successful fight back on the trade front.
      </para>
      <para>
       But we have had our set-backs and still have a long way to go-a generation of neglect cannot quickly be put right.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are under no illusion that there have been disappointments.
      </para>
      <para>
       Last year inflation was too high.
      </para>
      <para>
       And the balance of payments did not fall as we expected, leading to higher interest rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       This has been the price we paid for the massive modernisation of Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The challenge before us now is to get the best from this stronger economic structure.
      </para>
      <para>
       To turn it against our trade and inflation problems-the only way we can secure sustainably lower interest rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, tonight's Budget takes up this challenge.
      </para>
      <para>
       It declares a record surplus-the third Budget surplus in a row.
      </para>
      <para>
       Real Government spending is cut for the fourth year in succession, to its lowest share in 16 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       It tackles Australia's savings problem-the proper way, with a far-sighted restructuring of retirement incomes policy to encourage today's working Australians to save for their retirement through superannuation.
      </para>
      <para>
       And as we promised in April, the Budget fully funds the largest tax cut and family package in our history.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, it is a Budget without gimmicks-without resort to quick fixes.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a Budget which puts the nation's interests first.
      </para>
      <para>
       THE BUDGET OUTCOME
      </para>
      <para>
       A year ago I forecast a Budget surplus of $5 1/2 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       The result was even better, close to $6 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Budget being brought down tonight will deliver a surplus of $9.1 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       A massive deposit in the savings account of the nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       What a contrast with the situation left to us by the Liberals in 1983!
      </para>
      <para>
       Then Australia's Budget was in the red by a record $9 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Today, it is in the black by $9 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is prudent government the Labor way.
      </para>
      <para>
       In six years we conquered the largest and most profligate fiscal deficit in the nation's history, reducing it to zero-we have now produced a surplus of the same enormous dimension.
      </para>
      <para>
       And the Government has refunded more in tax cuts than if we had fully indexed the tax scales for inflation since 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of special importance, this year's Commonwealth surplus will more than offset the borrowing by all State and local Governments in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       This year the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to be in surplus by 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).
      </para>
      <para>
       Every cent of the Commonwealth's $9 billion surplus will be used to pay back debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will mean that over a four-year span total Commonwealth debt as a proportion of GDP will have been reduced by half.
      </para>
      <para>
       SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, in recent times there has been a lot of talk about measures to boost domestic savings.
      </para>
      <para>
       Higher national savings are undoubtedly part and parcel of overcoming our balance of payments problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is one basic reason why we have moved the Budget so heavily into surplus, to increase public savings and to pay off debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       But there is a distinction to be made between good and bad schemes intended to stimulate private savings.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is not about to grasp half-baked ideas on savings simply to satisfy some passing fashion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rather, our approach over six years has been to plan and pursue a structured and certain path, cutting tax rates and extending the benefit of superannuation savings to the whole workforce.

       The task before us now is to plan for early next century when the large post-war `baby boom' generation will be reaching retirement age.
      </para>
      <para>
       This year about 13 per cent of the population is of pensionable age-that will rise to around 25 per cent by the year 2030.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consequently, tonight I am announcing a comprehensive reform of the retirement income policies of this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       A detailed statement is being simultaneously released by my colleague the Minister for Social Security.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our goal is to encourage those now in the prime of their working lives to provide a higher standard of living for themselves in retirement.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will do that by maintaining and improving the age pension and by providing better opportunities and incentives to save for retirement through superannuation-to supplement rather than to diminish the pension.
      </para>
      <para>
       A key feature of this package is a far-reaching plan to integrate the taxation and social security income testing systems.
      </para>
      <para>
       It builds on the April Statement change which exempted the pension income test free area entirely from tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       That change alone ensures that 80 per cent of all age pensioners will be totally excluded from any requirement to pay tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tonight I announce that the tax-free income area for pensioners will in future be indexed to keep pace with the cost of living.
      </para>
      <para>
       Beyond that, the Government tonight commits itself to an even more far-reaching reform.
      </para>
      <para>
       From 1995 all age and service pensioners-that is both full rate and part rate pensioners-will be totally removed from the tax system.
      </para>
      <para>
       In other words, all age and service pensioners will be subject only to the social security income test-they will not have to pay tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will make it much more rewarding for retirees to have an additional source of income to the pension.
      </para>
      <para>
       The message to today's working Australians is that saving for your retirement will be rewarded, not penalised.
      </para>
      <para>
       A whole range of complementary changes will be implemented to make superannuation more worthwhile.
      </para>
      <para>
       Chief among these are effective rules to ensure that superannuation paid on behalf of employees is not lost to them when they change jobs.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the same time the requirements to preserve these superannuation payments until people actually retire will be enhanced. The limit on tax deductions self-employed people can claim for putting aside superannuation will be increased, and in future, other workers on low or modest incomes with relatively small employer-funded superannuation will be able to top-up those funds and claim tax deductions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, the maximum permissable superannuation benefit available to low and middle-income workers is to be dramatically increased.
      </para>
      <para>
       But to add further momentum, to private provision in retirement and provide an extra boost to national savings, the Government will consider as part of the wage system for next financial year the gradual introduction of a further 3 per cent award for occupational superannuation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, these historic reforms confirm superannuation as the Government's preferred savings vehicle.
      </para>
      <para>
       Over time this policy will be central to the national imperative to lift savings.
      </para>
      <para>
       Already the shift in superannuation savings since 1983 has been remarkable, especially since superannuation was made available to the entire workforce.
      </para>
      <para>
       Last year superannuation assets grew by $15 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       That increase in a single year was about the same size as the total assets of superannuation funds when this Government came to office in 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       Today total assets stand at $105 billion-larger than Australia's net overseas debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our reforms will build dramatically on that base.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the basis of present trends, by the turn of the century more than $60 billion a year will be flowing into superannuation funds-a massive injection to the nation's savings pool.
      </para>
      <para>
       A savings program which will really enhance national savings and not a gimmick which would grotesquely distort the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       In this way the retirement incomes policy is a strategy for coming decades, not just coming years.
      </para>
      <para>
       But I stress that the maintenance of an adequate age pension system will remain the essential element underpinning our retirement incomes policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Labor Party's long-standing commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will be put beyond any shadow of a doubt in this Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       Next April the normal indexation increase will lift the single rate pension by about $9 a fortnight.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tonight I am announcing that over and above that rise, the pension will be increased by $4 a fortnight, a total rise of $13.
      </para>
      <para>
       From April 1990, the return of the after-tax purchase price of annuities will be freed from the social security income test.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, from November this year age pensioners will be able to borrow up to $40,000 against the value of their home without having this extra money counted in the social security income test.
      </para>
      <para>
       Pensioners who do not own their own homes are also to be further assisted.
      </para>
      <para>
       From this December basic rental assistance will be increased from $15 to $20 per week, with two further $5 rises to follow next year.
      </para>
      <para>
       That will mean that from September 1990 rent assistance of up to $30 a week will be provided for pensioners without children, rising to $40 per week for families with three or more children.
      </para>
      <para>
       For aged pensioners the measures announced during this year will cost over $700 million, while the full-year cost of all social security measures will be $1.7 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       OUTLAYS
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to the outlays side of the Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1989-90, outlays or Commonwealth spending will represent 23.7 per cent of the economy, the lowest level since 1973-74.
      </para>
      <para>
       A fall of 6 percentage points of GDP in six years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The forward estimates, now published in the Budget documents, point to further decline.
      </para>

      </para>

       Need I say, Mr President, we reject completely the notion that Australia will somehow be a better place by walking away from the community's collective responsibility to assist the least well off.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is because of this better management of public finances that we have also been able to address other high priority areas in this Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       These have included the Prime Minister's environment statement, his re-commitment to a multi-cultural Australia and the initiatives outlined to enhance our scientific effort.

       The first is to assist the most needy experiencing difficulties with rent and mortgage repayments.
      </para>

       A National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy is to be established, drawing together a number of hitherto separate programs, to tackle the severe educational disadvantage of this group.
      </para>
      <para>
       Expenditure is estimated at $89 million at 1990-an increase of $34 million on 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Employment Service will be revamped to provide even more help for those having difficulties in the labour market, including the older unemployed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payments to the single unemployed aged between 60 and 64 and out of work for six months or more will be aligned with the single age pension rate and increased by $17 per fortnight.

       REVENUE
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to the revenue side of the Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       This year revenue as a share of the economy is estimated at 26.2 per cent, the same level as last year and 1.5 percentage points lower than in 1986-87.
      </para>
      <para>
       Just as importantly, Mr President, the Government has reformed the Australian taxation system, making it both fairer and more efficient.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tonight I announce further changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       First to the company tax system.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under current arrangements company tax is collected with much greater lags than taxes paid by individuals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because of these delays companies enjoy an interest free loan from the Government for up to two years.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have decided to narrow this concessional arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will bring forward $885 million in revenue this year but, more significantly, will generate an ongoing saving in public debt interest of about $330 million per year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Deferral of tax payments also arises with monthly remittances of PAYE tax withheld by employers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The government has decided that, from 1 December 1989, the 800 or so largest employers, with annual remittances exceeding $5 million, will be required to make payments twice a month rather than once.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will bring forward $550 million of revenue and will further reduce public debt interest by $70 million in a full year.
      </para>
      <para>
       To assist long-term business planning, the seven-year carry forward of losses is to be removed, allowing unlimited carry forward of losses incurred in 1989-90 and beyond.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sales tax on small business will be reduced by substantially increasing the manufacturers' exemption from $12,000 to $50,000; aids to manufacture provisions are also being extended.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has also undertaken a major review of the taxation treatment of Life Offices.
      </para>
      <para>
       From 1 January 1990, expenses incurred by life insurance companies in gaining the investment component of premium income will be tax deductible.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has also decided to exempt from tax non-profit sports and games clubs, such as pony and fishing clubs.
      </para>
      <para>
       As well, community service organisations such as Lions and Rotary clubs will be exempted from tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will also relieve some 130,000 taxpayers from paying quarterly provisional tax by raising the threshold to $8,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's relentless war on tax avoidance will continue.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am announcing tonight further anti-avoidance measures in the areas of capital gains tax, dividend selection schemes and share-based financing arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is proud of its tax reforms and will continue to pursue the objective of a fair and reasonable taxation system.
      </para>
      <para>
       ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND POLICY
      </para>
      <para>
       I return now to economic conditions and policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the outset I referred to the surge of business investment which last year grew by a massive 15 per cent in real terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       But at the same time as companies were spending heavily on investment goods, private spending elsewhere in the economy was also rising strongly.
      </para>
      <para>
       The overall effect was that domestic demand in Australia grew too fast, spilling over into imports, diverting export goods to the local market, and rekindling inflationary pressures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me underline that point.
      </para>
      <para>
       Last financial year national spending increased by nearly 8 per cent in real terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       Yet gross domestic product-the measure of everything we produce in Australia-grew by under 4 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       That big gap-spending at 8 per cent and production at 4 per cent-sums up our trade problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a gap which must be closed.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the short term that can only be done by bringing that high demand down to a more realistic level.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is where interest rates have played an appropriate role.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also why the Government has continued with tight budgetary and wages policies.
      </para>
      <para>
       But moderating demand is only half the story.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other half is lifting our local supply of goods and services-our production.
      </para>
      <para>
       This involves more investment but spread more evenly over time.
      </para>
      <para>
       It involves more entrepreneurial management.
      </para>
      <para>
       It involves better work practices and greater skills in the workforce.
      </para>
      <para>
       And it involves more efficiency in our economic structure-being even smarter in the way we get things done.
      </para>
      <para>
       These are reasons why the Government welcomes the recent Industrial Relations Commission decision, completing the framework for the most far-reaching overhaul of industrial awards since Federation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Wages policy has also been fundamental to our economic success.
      </para>
      <para>
       Throughout the past six years the Government's unique Accord with the Australian workforce has delivered unprecedented wage restraint.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are now 1.5 million more Australians in jobs than there were six years ago-a phenomenal figure and one of this Labor Government's proudest achievements.
      </para>
      <para>
       The unemployment rate has fallen from 11 per cent to 6 per cent, its lowest level for 8 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       At this very moment the Accord is protecting the employment gains of the past six years from the ravages of a wage explosion.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has enabled the Government to negotiate a wage/tax trade off to protect investment and to fend off recession.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the period immediately ahead the award restructuring process will bring about a much more adaptable and flexible labour market.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those historic changes build upon the other economic reforms that this Government has aggressively pursued.
      </para>
      <para>
       A modern financial system, a fairer tax system, reduced trade barriers and better education and training systems.
      </para>
      <para>
       More recently these far-reaching reforms have extended to the waterfront and the communications industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the only Government in Australia's post-war history that has attempted such structural changes to the economy, we are well aware of the need to press on with reform.
      </para>
      <para>
       To this end we have decided to restructure the existing Industries Assistance Commission, greatly broadening its charter to act as a catalyst for dynamic change in industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Reflecting these changes, the expanded body will be renamed the Industry Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer is announcing details of these changes, together with a major two-year work program for the Commission, in a separate statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to Australia's economic prospects.
      </para>
      <para>
       From what I have said before it is clear that in the past year the major preoccupation of policy was with an economy which was too buoyant.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fallout from that was higher than expected prices and greater than forecast imports.
      </para>
      <para>
       But during the course of the current year we expect this momentum to moderate in response to past tightening of policies.
      </para>
      <para>
       So in the period ahead we plan for a necessary slowdown in spending.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I stress this does not mean a recessed economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is production, not spending, that generates jobs and spending has a long way to fall before it reaches our production potential.
      </para>
      <para>
       Vital business investment will still stay strong with growth in the plant and equipment component expected to remain robust.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will ensure the economy maintains sufficient momentum for growth in gross domestic product of 2 3/4 per cent and employment growth of the same magnitude.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are confident of achieving the transition to a more sustainable growth path without destroying activity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The pattern of moderating demand will mean that many key aggregates will be lower in the second half of the financial year than in the first.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is the case with inflation and the balance of payments, where recent momentum will carry on for a time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thus, while the increase in the CPI is expected to be little changed at around 7 1/2 per cent for the year as a whole, it will be running noticeably below that in 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is determined to secure that lower inflation trend.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a community we must reduce inflation.
      </para>
      <para>
       With demand slowing, the growth of imports will also slow, and quite sharply as the year progresses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Even so, for the full year the current account deficit is forecast to be equivalent to about 5 per cent of GDP, only a slight improvement on last year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, however, by the second half of the year the deficit will be running a good deal below that, as the much weaker trend in imports and the pickup in exports emerge.
      </para>
      <para>
       But to stabilise our international debt the current account deficit will have to continue to be reduced.
      </para>
      <para>
       The full force of this Government's resolve will be directed to this end.
      </para>
      <para>
       All in all, the substantial Budget surplus, the forecast slowing in demand and the expected improvement in the balance of payments, establish a framework for lower interest rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I stress that rates cannot and should not fall until it is economically responsible.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government is not prepared to countenance a premature fall in interest rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the time is right, we are confident that the economic fundamentals will produce a sustainable fall.
      </para>
      <para>
       CONCLUSION
      </para>
      <para>
       As a result of the Government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.
      </para>
      <para>
       This will occur because the Government has kept sight of its objectives and has not been diverted by superficial solutions to fundamental problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has never sought to minimise its responsibilities or shy away from the issues of substance.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian people have responded to these realities by adopting a highly responsible attitude.
      </para>
      <para>
       They have quite sensibly rejected sham solutions to the country's difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       They are looking for value and consistency.
      </para>
      <para>
       In short, they are looking for the meat rather than the feathers.

         â€”Further information has just come to my attention by courtesy of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) with respect to the subject of a question that I raised today about Miss Jacqueline Hamill, a Tasmanian citizen, who was being held captive by criminals in a Filipino gaol. Unfortunately the Minister told me tonight that he had received news of the death of Miss Hamill. As a Tasmanian senator I am deeply shocked, as would be all other senators, that this occurred. I express my appreciation to the Minister for his being so courteous and quick in letting me know about this matter. I believe the Minister has instructed his Department to stay in close contact with Miss Hamill's parents in this time of stress and need.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I make the point that Miss Hamill was a true Christian who was doing what she thought was the right thing for her faith in ministering to people in the Philippines. As a true Christian, I believe that in dying as a martyr she will be at peace in heaven and I would hope that all people in the Senate tonight would remember what she has done for this country and for her faith. I conclude by saying that as a Senate we should take note of the wonderful work in this field that people from Australia do and the sacrifices they make.

This is something that is an example, I am sure, to all of us.

I am sure that her family in Strahan, on the west coast of Tasmania, will be heartened to know that the killing has been noted in this chamber and that expressions of heartfelt sympathy for the family are extended, I am sure, from all sides of the chamber and from all parts of Australia thereby.

        Obviously Miss Hamill has gone to the Philippines, as many young Australians go abroad, full of great ideals and with high expectations as to what she might achieve on behalf of her fellow human beings there in a very difficult and perilous situation. Great courage is shown by many young Australians when they go abroad as volunteers either on service of a more secular nature or as missionaries as in this particular instance. On this occasion it is brought home to us just how perilous and vulnerable many of our fine young Australians are. Jacqueline Hamill has now been killed. I agree with Senator Calvert and I am sure with the sentiment of many honourable senators who have faith, and with that of her family, and give her family the assurance that this death has not been in vain. I am sure that much more will be said over the next several days and I am sure that all honourable senators would wish to indicate to that family on the west coast of Tasmania our sympathy in its very sad loss.

If the same percentage increase had been applied to the pensioner rebate threshold it would have moved from $6,142 to $6,558 with a corresponding increase in the maximum pensioner rebate from $250 to $350 for the 1988-89 income year. In fact, the pensioner rebate was increased to $430, and the pensioner threshold to $6,892. While indexing the threshold would have cost about $130 million, it is estimated that the increase in the rebate to $430 will cost $195 million, of which $55 million will be reflected in reduced provisional tax liabilities this year.

       As announced by the Treasurer in the April Economic Statement income and tax thresholds will be aligned from 1989-90 to generally exempt full rate age and service pensioners from tax. This measure will be introduced in full for married pensioners in 1989-90 and will be fully phased in for single pensioners from July 1990. With an additional 300,000 pensioners exempted from tax by this action about 80 per cent of all pensioners will no longer be required to pay tax.

       The pensioner rebate was introduced in the 1982-83 Budget by the former Government which, according to the 1982-83 Budget Papers, declared that ``the maximum rebate is $167 in 1982-83 and $250 in subsequent years (with the pensioner threshold to be) $5,007 in 1982-83 and $5,429 in subsequent years''. No mechanism was announced which would permit increases in the pensioner threshold; in particular, in designing the threshold, the former Government had no intention that it be indexed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The present Government has increased the threshold on a number of occasions. For the present year, 1988-89, it stands at $6,892, and the pensioner rebate is $430. If the threshold for 1988-89 had been increased in line with the percentage increase in the standard pension from 1987-88 it would have been $6,558. As noted, the threshold actually provided by the Government exceeds this figure.

       The NSCA was contracted during the past 6 years to undertake aerial search and/or rescue operations in response to marine distress incidents or overdue vessel reports. Whenever the need for an aerial response to a marine incident arises the standard procedure is for an air search request to be sent to the appropriate Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regional operational control centre. Prior to the establishment of the CAA, this function was performed by the then Airways Division of the Department.

       The CAA Senior Operation Controller, having regard to the area to be searched and the calculated track spacing, then charters appropriate aircraft for the task.

       Also in relation to the SeaSafety Education program, there was an informal sponsorship arrangement between the Department and the NSCA (Vic) that the latter would fund a series of SeaSafety posters.

       Accounts have been rendered on the NSCA (or its agent) for survey work on the vessel the ``Blue Nabilla'' and were regularly paid. Currently the Department is owed approximately $10,000 for recent survey work. However, at the time of the appointment of the liquidator, an account had not been rendered on the NSCA. In regard to the funding of the SeaSafety posters, it was arranged that the supplier would bill the NSCA direct for their design and production costs. As part of this arrangement the Department guaranteed payment. The design costs were met by the NSCA but the account for production costs was not, since the NSCA had by then gone into voluntary liquidation. The Department is paying the $13,667 outstanding.

       Furthermore, through an accounting firm operating on the behalf of the NSCA (Vic) major creditors, the Department has been asked to substantiate some of the NSCA records indicating departmental debts to the NSCA of some $13.3m for pump hire and $10.9m for aircraft standby hire. In both cases after systematic review of departmental records, it was concluded that the invoices are bogus.

       Furthermore, throughout the past five years this organisation, either as a Department or an Authority, has paid annual debts to the NSCA (Vic) of less than $100,000 per year. The CAA currently owes the NSCA (Vic) $13,993.66 for search and rescue chartering.
      </para>
      <para>
       The CAA has the NSCA (Vic) listed as owing $116,802.69 for aviation charges. Against $114,631.44 of this debt, the CAA has applied Statutory Liens on 17 of the NSCA (Vic) operated aircraft. The CAA has been liaising with the liquidator and these debts may be substantially settled as assets of the NSCA (Vic) are either released or disposed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Through an accounting firm operating on behalf of one of the NSCA (Vic) major creditors, the CAA has been asked to substantiate some of the NSCA records indicating CAA debts to the NSCA of some $10 million. Advice has been that there was never any operational requirement for the CAA to have sought the services recorded ie placing the NSCA aircraft on long term standby. Therefore, according to CAA records, these accounts would appear bogus.
      </para>
      <para>
       TELECOM: Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The NSCA (Vic) was very prompt in paying their accounts. A current debit of $396,176.14 is outstanding but at the time the liquidator was appointed this amount had not been billed to the NSCA.

      </para>
      <para>
       some jobseekers remain registered with the CES although they have either independently found employment or left the labour force but have not notified the CES;
      </para>
      <para>
       not all persons seeking employment register with the CES for assistance;
      </para>
      <para>
       jobseekers may be registered as unemployed looking for full-time work with the CES even though they are working part-time or on a casual basis and classified as employed by the ABS;
      </para>
      <para>
       coverage of jobseekers can vary over time as a result of variations in administrative procedures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, the Government's announced figures regarding unemployment are from the labour force survey part of the monthly population survey undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). This population survey is based on an area sample of private dwellings (about 31,000 houses, flats, etc) and a list of non-private dwellings (hotels, motels, etc), covering about three-fifths of one per cent of the population of Australia. ABS estimates of unemployment collected via the monthly labour force survey utilise definitions which conform closely to the international standard definitions specified by the International Labour Office (ILO). The definition of employed persons was changed from April 1986 to include unpaid family helpers who worked without pay between one and 14 hours per week in a family business or on a farm.

       (1) In February this year the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel expressed the wish that the existing purpose built child care centre at the Endeavour House Naval Accommodation facility be activated as a joint centre for the care of children of local community, Navy and Army families.

       The Committee is negotiating with NSW child care organisations and State and Federal departments on the modifications required to bring the previously unlicensed child care centre up to acceptable standards for registration.

       (3) The Government remains committed to utilizing the Endeavour House child care centre. Sited as it is in the centre of the Endeavour House complex, the facility cannot be used until the extensive refurbishment of Endeavour House is completed, early in 1990.

       (3) There is no Commonwealth Government requirement for Australian equity in any new pulp mill. However, the establishment by foreign interests of a new pulp mill or similar venture involving a total expenditure of $10 million or more would be subject to examination under the Government's foreign investment policy. In its examination the Government would take into account economic, environmental and other relevant considerations to determine whether the proposal was contrary to the national interest. If those considerations were affected by the pulp mill developer also owning other related operations in Australia the Government would have regard to the implications, but there is no presumption under existing policy that common foreign ownership of different operations in related industries will necessarily be undesirable.

      <para>
       (1) The Protected Zone Joint Authority (PZJA), comprising the Commonwealth and Queensland Ministers responsible for fisheries matters, uses the services of three separate government organizations in administering its decisions with respect to the management of those fisheries in the Australian part of the Protected Zone over which it has jurisdiction: the Australian Fisheries Service (AFS), the Queensland Fish Management Authority (QFMA) and the Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol (BFP). The fisheries concerned are listed in the reports of the PZJA. The BFP acts as the surveillance and enforcement arm of the PZJA in the TSPZ.
      </para>
      <para>
       The PZJA has no establishment or separate funding. It does not of itself incur expenditure.
      </para>
      <para>
       The cost of fisheries management, including enforcement and surveillance in the Australian part of the Protected Zone is met through the normal funding processes of AFS, QFMA and BFP. The Commonwealth and Queensland have entered into an agreement (CSA) for sharing those costs. Under the CSA, the Commonwealth and Queensland share the recurrent costs equally. The Commonwealth funds an approved program of initial capital items in full and the two Governments share the cost of replacement of capital items. This basis of funding is the same as that which the Commonwealth and Queensland have entered into for the operation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.
      </para>
      <para>
       The cost of funding surveillance and enforcement activities including the purchase of capital items undertaken by BFP on behalf of the PZJA during 1987-88 was $3,429,889, which comprised:
      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The cost to the Commonwealth of the above activities was $3,117,288. This comprised (a) $312,603 for recurrent expenditure, salaries and related expenses, (b) $2,556,069 on initial capital items which under the CSA are funded entirely by the Commonwealth, and (c) $248,613 on charter of an interim patrol boat. The capital expenditure during the period included $2,101,000 for the patrol boat ``Wauri'', $358,386 for a site on Thursday Island for redevelopment as a joint fisheries/quarantine administrative centre.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) During 1987-88 in the Torres Strait Protected Zone 11 illegal fishing activities were observed and 11 persons and 11 vessels were apprehended. This led to 5 prosecutions being actioned resulting in 3 convictions and 2 case dismissals. Of the remainder, 3 were cautioned, 1 case was withdrawn and 2 cases were dismissed.

        â€”The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Potential has always existed for chemical residues to be used as non-tariff barriers to trade. All countries have the sovereign right to set limits on the levels of chemical residues that will be permitted in products imported into their territories. The potential thus exists for countries to set unreasonable and unjustifiable levels for chemical residues or unreasonable or unjustifiable testing requirements. Of course, countries may voluntarily restrict their freedom of action through international agreements or through adopting internationally agreed standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       The need to balance Governments' desire to set standards, against the potential for arbitrary trade restrictions, is acknowledged in Article XX (b) of the GATT which recognises the right of all Contracting Parties to apply measures, as necessary, to protect human, animal or plant life or health but makes it clear that such measures should not be used as disguised restrictions on international trade. Also, Article III of the GATT provides that regulations should not be applied to imported or domestic products so as to afford protection to domestic production.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia is seeking to ensure this question of balance in the use of sanitary and phytosanitary barriers is addressed in the Agricultural Negotiations Group in the current Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, the Uruguay Round. The negotiations aim to facilitate international trade taking into account the work of the international organisations, such as the joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, which establish appropriate and acceptable chemical residue limits.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Agreement on Technical Barriers to trade (popularly known as the Standards Code) was negotiated during the last Round (Tokyo Round) of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. One objective of the Code is to encourage the development of international standards and certification systems.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is presently liaising with State/Territory Governments to enable Australia to become a signatory to the Code. Earlier this year a draft National Agreement on Standards Accreditation and Quality (NASAQ) was considered by Federal/State and New Zealand Ministers meeting as the Australian Industry and Technology Council (AITC).
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the provisions of NASAQ is that, upon its signature, Australia would give notice of its intention to join the Standards Code. AITC Ministers were well disposed towards NASAQ and agreed that the principles it contained constituted a good basis for negotiations.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is expected that the Agreement, including the provision on the Standards Code, will be adopted at the next meeting of the AITC in October 1989. It is also expected that the procedural aspects of implementing Australia's rights and obligations in acceding to the Standards Code will be discussed between Commonwealth Departments and with the States/Territories in the near future.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Australia is a member of, and plays an active role in, the work of the joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, particularly in its subsidiary Committees on pesticide residues, residues of veterinary drugs in food, and food additives and contaminants. The work of these Committees is, through consensus, to establish maximum residue limits in foods entering international trade. Australia sees the standards set by these three Codex Committees as one of the main international mechanisms for preventing residues from being used as non-tariff technical barriers to trade.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Government is keen to adopt Codex standards as it sees them as a means of facilitating food exports. To date, however, this has not been possible because responsibility for the administration of domestic food standards presently rests with the States/Territories. Further, acceptance depends on uniform adoption by all States/Territories.
      </para>
      <para>
       Acceptance of a Codex standard makes incorporation of the standard into a country's domestic legislation obligatory. As a result, much work has been done to provide for the adoption of the Uniform Food Standards Code into the food legislation of each State and Territory of the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       To facilitate the adoption of Codex standards, the Australian Food Standards Committee aims to align national standards, as far as practicable, with Codex standards. Recent emphasis on this aspect has led to a much closer alignment of national standards with those of Codex than in the past.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) As the above answers indicate, the GATT Standards Code and the Codex Commission have different but complementary mandates. The Code does not itself set standards; rather it sets rules and procedures to ensure that technical regulations or standards adopted for reasons related to safety, health, quarantine and consumer or environmental protection do not create unreasonable barriers to trade. Membership of the Code would require Australia to use appropriate international standards as the basis of technical regulations and standards; which would include the international food standards, codes and guidelines prepared by the Codex Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government considers that membership of the Code will assist its efforts to achieve improved access to world markets for Australian exports facing unreasonably restrictive or discriminatory standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       By comparison, the Codex Commission prepares international food standards, codes, and guidelines in order to facilitate international trade through the removal of non-tariff technical barriers caused by different national food standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       Participation in Codex enables us to provide input into the development of standards and requirements with which our food exports usually have to comply. All of Australia's significant trading partners are members of Codex and, given that Australia needs to meet the standards imposed by other countries which import Australian products, exporting will be easier if Australian food standards are the same as those in the countries to which we export. For this reason, the Federal Government is working actively to enable Australia to become a signatory to the standards of the joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.

        â€”The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) My Department is not aware of any comprehensive and objective comparative construction cost data on Australian process construction projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       A soon to be released report commissioned by the Victorian Department of Industry, Technology and Resources, has examined the predictability of Australian engineering construction project performance against initial project budgets and schedules.
      </para>
      <para>
       The study reveals that:
      </para>
      <para>
       at least  3/4 of Australian project owners regarded the cost and time performance of their projects as good.
      </para>
      <para>
       the primary cause of poor cost performance on private sector projects was monetary fluctuation through exchange rate variation and escalation change. This reflects the high level of change in the economy during the study's time frame.
      </para>
      <para>
       workforce productivity was on par or better than budget assessments in 95% of projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The study also compared a sample of UK and Australian projects with respect to performance against cost and time targets. The comparison showed that UK projects perform more predictably to cost and time targets than Australian projects. However, these figures do not represent a comparison of the standard of productivity or the relative economy of engineering construction between countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       Preliminary results of two studies commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Council show that capital costs per tonne of annual capacity for establishing a zinc or titanium dioxide processing plant in Australia were directly comparable to costs in the four or five most important competitor countries, including Canada and Singapore.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Victorian Government report I referred to earlier, identifies a range of areas where the competitiveness of Australian engineering construction project capability can be improved and where Australia can become a more competitive location for geographically mobile projects. These include:
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>

      </para>

      <para>
       (1) The Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16 aircraft accident rate is high. Any comparison, however, between RNAF and RAAF accident rates could be misleading. The RNAF's modus operandi and operating environment are so different to those of the RAAF that a valid comparison of RNAF F-16 and RAAF Hornet accident rates cannot be made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Since the introduction of the Hornet to RAAF service in 1985, the RAAF has lost one aircraft. The pilot of this aircraft was a student on the Hornet conversion course hence inexperienced on type. He was nevertheless an experienced Mirage pilot with some 1 000 flying hours.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The accident rate for all RAAF aircraft for FY87/88 was 8.3 accidents per 100 000 flying hours compared to a 12 year average of 5.4 per 100 000 hours. For FY88/89 the accident rate is presently running at a significantly lower rate than the long term average. The Hornet accident rate, one loss since introduction to service, means very little so early in the aircraft's service life but can be described as below the traditional accident rate experienced during the introduction of a new fighter aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Increases in pilot salaries are determined by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal (DFRT). The DFRT is required to base its deliberations on current Industrial Relations Commission guidelines. The following inducements for pilots to remain in the RAAF are now in force:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Flying allowance was substantially increased in 1988, from $4529 to $11330 per annum (for a Squadron Leader employed in a flying post).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Pilot Retention Bonus (PRB) has been offered to 242 RAAF pilots. With effect 6 June 1989, 117 pilots have accepted the PRB, and are thus committed to serve for a six-year period. Further offers of the PRB will be made in FY89/90. The PRB scheme is due for Government review in 1992.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The Aircrew Specialization Option is now available to selected RAAF pilots. The scheme provides continued employment in flying posts for a period of five years, and aims to improve retention of aircrew and increase experience levels on operational flying units. The scheme will build to its mature complement of fifty Flight Lieutenants and ten Squadron Leaders over the next five years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Pilots, along with other RAAF officers, may receive further salary increases as a result of the present ADF study into a wage case based on work value principles.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The inducements identified for pilots to remain in the RAAF, combined with an increase in Return of Service Obligation for pilot's course to eight years, should result in a long term improvement in pilot experience levels. The current reduced levels of experience in the RAAF are undesirable, but posting and personnel management policies have been reviewed to ensure that the average experience in operational squadrons/units is sufficient to maintain flying safety standards.

       (2) The South Australian Institute of Technology (SAIT) has advised that in 1989, a number of its courses were revised due to a need to adapt from a three-term to two-semester academic year. The Bachelor of Social Work degree course underwent a number of academic changes at the same time and was reaccredited under normal procedures. The new program contains additional subjects, the content of which was not covered in the previous version of the course. Students have moved to the new program in 1989. Those who had partially completed the old course by the end of 1988 are in a transition phase where their annual course programs do not easily fit the `normal full time program' specified in the new degree schedule.

      <para>
       (2) Development of the new Scales and Standards has involved a great deal of consultation both within and outside Defence. Initially, the Scales and Standards development was undertaken jointly by Defence, the Department of Finance and the then Department of Housing and Construction (DHC). The Administrative Arrangements Order of July 1987 resulted in the withdrawal of the Department of Finance from direct involvement, and with the establishment of the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), that authority assumed the DHC responsibilities. Further consultation between Defence and DHA then resulted in some changes to the Scales and Standards to take account of the commercial nature of DHA operations. Once the Scales and Standards were agreed between Defence and the DHA, coordination comments were sought from the Department of Industrial Relations. These have now been obtained. Some matters of detail regarding implementation are now being finalized within Defence, before submission to Minister Simmons.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Commissioner of Taxation has no record in any of his offices of the receipt of a letter from Professor Leeder.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I understand that the letter dealt with difficulties likely to be encountered by elderly or disabled people who wish to apply for a tax file number.
      </para>
      <para>
       In order to protect the integrity of the Tax File Number System, it is imperative that adequate proof of identity be required on application for a tax file number. When compiling lists of acceptable proof of identity documents, the Commissioner included as large a variety of documents and combinations of documents as he could, in order to ensure that people who did not have the usual ones readily available, could choose some other acceptable combination of documents.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where people genuinely have a problem obtaining the necessary number of documents, the Commissioner will assist by accepting some other forms of proof of identity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner contracted with Australia Post to receive tax file number applications on behalf of the Tax Office and to sight proof of identity documents as a service to the public to make applying for a tax file number more convenient. The training of Post Office staff was conducted internally by Australia Post and there have been some problems with staff's understanding of the procedures. The Commissioner is undertaking a review of the system of lodging applications for tax file numbers at Post Offices and of the training of Post Office staff in administering the system.
      </para>
      <para>
       People who are unable to visit a Post Office or a Tax Office can send their application and their proof of identity documents to the Tax Office by mail.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, I believe the Professor complained of difficulty in getting through to the Tax Office's Tax File Number Hotline. The strategy employed in managing the Hotline was to begin with a small facility and then to increase it in proportion to the volume of calls being received. Around 1 April, when all existing employees were brought into the Tax File Number System, the volume of calls increased beyond expectations and it took some two or three weeks to recruit the necessary number of operators to deal with the level of calls. This, combined with industrial action being taken by unions at that time, caused some inconvenience to callers for a short period of time. By 30 June, the volume of calls being received by the Hotline had decreased to such an extent that maintaining the Hotline was no longer justified and it was discontinued.

       (1) The Department of Defence makes every effort to fill civilian positions within 12-14 weeks from the date of gazettal of each vacancy. Delays may occur at various stages of the selection process. For example, internal delays may be occasioned by leave absences of applicants or members of selection committees. Delays may also be caused by external agencies, for example in processing security clearances or scheduling Commonwealth Medical Officer examinations.

        â€”The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) DSTO has a corporate goal of assisting local industry by providing it with early access to research and development initiatives. The decision to pass specific project work to industry is shaped by the availability of suitable skills in industry to achieve project objectives. These objectives are endorsed by the project sponsor within the Department of Defence. Specific industry contractors are selected in accordance with the Government's Purchasing policy, prevailing Finance regulations and financial delegations within the Department. For example, within the DSTO this would include the Chief Defence Scientist, Laboratory Directors and Chiefs of Division.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The strategy of involving industry more and DSTO less, especially in the later stages of engineering development, does not represent an immediate operational saving to the DSTO following the reorganisation, but does reduce the Government's future expenditure in the acquisition, maintenance and upgrading of specialist design and manufacturing capabilities required for the later phases of engineering development. Contracts for these later phases would be placed on those sections of industry capable of undertaking the development required.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Development projects undertaken by the DSTO are usually divided into a number of discrete phases. Depending upon the nature and scope of each development phase it would be funded from DSTO or Service(s) minor capital equipment allocations or the Department's major capital equipment allocations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The Department has awarded some 4,100 contracts since the DSTO reorganisation. It would be necessary to examine each of these contracts individually to assess fully whether or not the basis of the contract stems from DSTO R&amp;D. The attached table includes a significant, but not comprehensive, number of those contracts that could be readily identified without substantial investigation. The identification of further industrial development contracts during this period will not be pursued as it would require the employment of a disproportionate level of resources.

        â€”The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I am informed that the question refers to the restructuring, as part of the wider DSTO reorganisation, of the three laboratories located at DSTO, Salisbury. These laboratories had themselves grown from the Weapons Research Establishments set up in the 1950s. Prior to the reorganisation the three laboratories were:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Advanced Engineering Laboratory
      </para>
      <para>
       The Electronics Research Laboratory
      </para>
      <para>
       The Weapons Systems Research Laboratory
      </para>
      <para>
       The reorganisation of the DSTO was announced on October 12, 1987 by the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Ros Kelly.
      </para>
      <para>
       The announcement advised that the reorganisation was designed to meet three principal objectives:
      </para>
      <para>
       Responding to priorities identified in the Defence White Paper;
      </para>
      <para>
       Streamlining the transition of work from DSTO research into industry; and
      </para>
      <para>
       Further developing Australia's expertise in critical defence technologies.
      </para>
      <para>
       To achieve these objectives, three out of five DSTO laboratories now have significantly changed functions.
      </para>
      <para>
       At Salisbury the new Surveillance Research Laboratory comprising much of the former Electronics Research Laboratory concentrates on electromagnetic surveillance, but with greater effort on over-the-horizon radar.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new look Electronics Research Laboratory has main thrusts in Command and Control, Information Technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       Communications and Electronic Warfare. It includes some functions of the former Advanced Engineering Laboratory whose remaining engineering capabilities have been integrated into the other DSTO Laboratories. Less extensive changes occurred at the Weapons Systems Laboratory in Salisbury and Sydney.
      </para>
      <para>
       With this information by way of background, the responses to the questions posed are as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The economic and scientific benefits are those outlined in the principal objectives. To these may be added an increase on the DSTO capacity for research through a gradual adjustment of staff profiles, increasing the proportion of scientists and engineers by a reduction in supporting and workshop staff. DSTO is now able to provide more cost-effective support for the Australian Defence Organisation and increase the transfer of technology to industry to the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) and (c) DSTO is a dynamic organisation that is continually adjusting its priorities and structure to meet Australia's defence needs. The 1987 reorganisation brought together many changes that would have occurred over a period of time including some that affected other DSTO establishments in Melbourne and Sydney. Consequently it is not possible to isolate costs to the Salisbury laboratories. However, the cost of the total reorganisation of DSTO, including the laboratories at Salisbury, has been contained within DSTO's annual budget.

       (2) and (3) In drafting a response to a Parliamentary Question on Notice which is directed by a Senator or Member to me and a number of other Ministers, it is common practice for departments to consult with my department, particularly when the question is ambiguous or complicated. On 9 March 1989, Senator Archer directed a question on notice relating to Commonwealth expenditure to Senator Button, as Minister representing me in the Senate, and 17 other Ministers (Senate Questions 882-899). Many departments consulted with my department about the meaning of the question.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Question could have been interpreted in several ways. My department requested advice from the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance advised that, following consultation with Senator Archer's office, the Question should be interpreted as requesting the total of Commonwealth payments made to recipients, by each State and Territory. The Department of Finance indicated that departments may not have ready access to this information as the standard accounting records for Commonwealth expenditure is compiled in terms of the place where payment is authorised, not where payment is received.
      </para>
      <para>
       My department accordingly responded to enquiries from other departments concerning Senate Questions 882-899 by noting that the advice to be given to individual Ministers by their departments remained, of course, a matter for their own determination. It did, however, refer to the views of the Department of Finance concerning the accessibility of the information sought.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of my own department, I determined that I would not authorise the use of the considerable resources required to answer the question as it stood.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) and (5) The system of program management and budgeting focuses on forming judgements about program effectiveness by clarifying program objectives and linking program inputs to outputs and outcomes. Information collection will ideally be directly related to program objectives.
      </para>
      <para>
       The discrepancy between information obtainable from different programs/departments is explained as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of programs for which client location is a significant factor in judging performance, such information is routinely collected. It is these programs which can readily provide data on geographical distribution of payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       For those programs for which client location is not significant in deciding program effectiveness, such information is not routinely collected. In these cases considerable resources would be required to obtain the information sought by Senator Archer.

      </para>
      <para>
       The second level comprises ships of lesser capability, suitable for dealing with lesser forms of military pressure which could arise in Australia's resource zones and proximate waters or in Australia's area of direct military interest. A new class of vessel-a light patrol frigate-has been proposed for this level of capability. Eight ships will be constructed in Australia. They will be designed so that their sensors and weapons can be enhanced to enable them to contribute to operations in more substantial contingencies and to complement the first level of capability in operations in the direct defence of Australia. They will need endurance, sea-keeping and combat capabilities commensurate with these tasks, and will be able to embark Sea- hawk helicopters. A significant influence on their selection will be the need to achieve the required numbers within reasonable cost . . .' (Para 4.48, p. 44, The Defence of Australia, March 1987)

       I mention for the honourable senator's assistance that the ALAO currently operates only in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. In the other States and the ACT, legal aid is provided through independent legal aid commissions. Under a forum test applied by each legal aid commission/ALAO, legal aid is generally available through the legal aid commission/ALAO in the jurisdiction in which the proceedings are sought to be instituted.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ALAO is currently participating in a scheme coordinated by the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria which has been modelled on the successful arrangement used in the Copper 7 IUD test cases coordinated by the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed agreement is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) each commission/ALAO will receive applications for legal assistance from its own residents and will assess those applications by applying its own eligibility tests and contribution policy.

       (c) the grants of legal assistance will be administered through the Victorian Commission being the Commission of the State in which the solicitors acting in the test cases are practising.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) approval for expenditure is to be made through the Victorian Commission on a uniform basis. The assigned solicitors may not exceed specified limits. The costs estimated for the preliminary stage for the test cases is $285,000. It is proposed that assistance for solicitors fees, counsels fees and disbursements be limited to that sum. Once the preliminary stage has been completed, requests for an extension of assistance will then be considered.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) The administrating commission (LACV) will arrange for accounts to be rendered by the solicitors on a regular basis and will then on a regular basis bill each participating commission/ALAO.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) The amounts to be contributed by each commission/ALAO will be in the same proportion to the total costs as the number of persons assisted by that commission bears to the total number of assisted persons throughout Australia. The amounts to be contributed by each commission will reflect recognition of the extra costs to the administering commission in administering the grants. (The basis of this extra cost is yet to be determined.)

       As the Minister noted in his response to the Cross Committee report on Australian Defence Force wastage, work is progressing steadily in directions which will ensure that more comprehensive and less labour intensive statistics are produced in the short term. In the longer term the Manpower Systems Redevelopment Project (MSRP) is seen as the vehicle to provide the basis for development of a modern computerised and centralised database.
      </para>
      <para>
       MSRP is a long term project which covers a number of important sub-projects. During 1989-90 approval for implementation of computerised Reserve pay and civil personnel management systems will be sought and subject to such approval progressively implemented over succeeding years. At the same time the requirements for and possible technical solutions to provide enhanced Service personnel systems will be considered.
      </para>
      <para>
       MSRP funding for 1989-90 has yet to be resolved. However, it should be noted that as with all significant investment programs, progress will depend on the continuing availability of funds and the relative priority of the project against other investment programs.

AIRDIB granted two extensions of time bringing the completion date to 31 December 1985. A further request to extend the project by 18 months to June 1987 was rejected because the company had not successfully negotiated suitable financing, marketing and manufacturing arrangements to commercialize the electric vehicle.

      <para>
       (3) The company may apply for funding again but as 80% of the R&amp;D on the project had been completed in December 1985, there may now be very little actual R&amp;D associated with the project.
      </para>
      <para>
       The view of AIRDIB in 1985 was that no further funding was justified as the company had been un- able to interest a joint venture partner who could provide the financial, management and marketing expertise necessary to commercialise the electric vehicle. Unless the situation has changed, it is unlikely that further funding would be provided.

      <para>
       Is it a fact that only one Medicare schedule fee now applies to cover maternal confinements, regardless of such variable factors as the number of antenatal consultations or the method of delivery? Did the present Government change the Medicare schedule in August 1987 so that only one schedule fee of $425 now covers all births? Can the Minister advise why the Government believes that the skills and time involved in a straightforward birth are the same as those for a complicated forceps delivery or a caesarean section. Is it the intention of the Government that obstetricians should be forced to change their clinical practices through a system of financial disincentives? Is the Government aware that consumers who have caesarean sections or other forms of surgical intervention in delivery have, in most cases, no choice in the matter and, therefore, can be faced with substantial unscheduled out of pocket expenses in giving birth? Does the Minister accept that this is just one more penalty on people trying to raise families under this Government's anti-family economic policies?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The obstetrics items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule were restructured from 1 August 1987 in line with a recommendation of the Medicare Benefits Review (Layton) Committee that a comprehensive item be introduced to cover antenatal care, confinement with delivery by any means (including Caesarean section) and post-natal care. The comprehensive fee was introduced on medical advice that it was in the best interests of both mother and baby. It was unanimously recommended by the Layton Committee-two of whose five members were senior nominees of the Australian Medical Association (AMA)-after extensive consultation with the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Federal AMA Coordinating Committee of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The current Schedule fee for this comprehensive item when performed by a specialist obstetrician is $425.
      </para>
      <para>
       Separate items have been retained for use when the comprehensive item is not appropriate (e.g. when obstetric care is provided by more than one medical practitioner), for attendances involving antenatal complications and for a number of other additional services which might be required.
      </para>
      <para>
       The schedule fee of $425 is substantially higher than the previous fee for care in a normal pregnancy, labour and delivery and recognises the proportion of labours in which more complex procedures are needed. Instead of the doctor using add-on items for these extra procedures, they are allowed for in the new comprehensive fee. The restructuring removed the financial incentive for doctors to intervene in the natural birthing process and removed the multiple patient gap payments that existed where separate fees were raised for individual component services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The obstetric items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule have been the subject of continuing review since the restructuring and a number of amendments have been implemented. The next meeting of the Consultative Group on Obstetrics and Gynaecology, which is scheduled for 18 July 1989, will be devoted to discussion of obstetric matters. This liaison group, which comprises representatives from the Royal Australian College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the Australian Medical Association, the Department of Community Services and Health and the Health Insurance Commission, forms part of the Government's consultative process which permits input from the medical profession on Medicare Benefits Schedule reviews.

       In its Policy Paper on Budget Reform (April 1984) the Government stated the objectives of its reforms as being about:
      </para>
      <para>
       improving the processes of decision making on budget priorities by the Government itself;
      </para>
      <para>
       improving the information base and processes for public and parliamentary scrutiny of the budget and of the subsequent implementation of programs funded from the budget; and
      </para>
      <para>
       upgrading the financial management of programs in all Government agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       A comprehensive package of financial management improvements is now in place under the broad heading of the Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP). Progress in implementation of the FMIP by departments was reported on recently in the 1988 FMIP Report, copies of which are available through the Australian Government Publishing Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       Key elements of the FMIP have been the adoption by departments of management systems which assist managers to focus on results and the development of improved accountability arrangements, under which the emphasis is shifting from accounting for stewardship of resources to a concern with achieving results. Program Management and Budgeting (PMB) has been the primary vehicle for bringing about these changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Among other things, the PMB framework requires departments to set program objectives which reflect the desired outcomes of Government policy, to be able to account for resource inputs against those programs, to develop performance information systems which will enable informed judgements to be made about both the effectiveness of programs in achieving their stated objectives and the efficiency with which they do it, and finally to report these matters to the Parliament. All departments and budget funded agencies have now adopted PMB.
      </para>
      <para>
       The principal vehicle through which departments and agencies report on their performance is the Explanatory Notes provided to Parliament at Budget time. (Other documents, notably Annual Reports and Budget Paper No. 3, also play an important role in this respect.) Since 1987-88 the Explanatory Notes have set out program objectives, the resources allocated to programs, the results achieved in the previous year and expectations for the coming year. Recognizing the importance of the Explanatory Notes in this format the Government has incorporated them among the formal budget documentation as Budget Related Papers.
      </para>
      <para>
       In short, Parliament is now receiving the sort of information referred to in the question. This is a great advancement on the level of information provided, say five years ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       Departments and agencies are progressively improving the quality of the performance information they are able to provide. The process of review and refinement is seen as on-going, responding to improvements in performance information systems within departments and routine processes of policy adjustment.

       The Commonwealth is not forcing amalgamations. In my statement tabled in The House of Representatives on 15 June 1989 on Supplementary Funding Decisions on Higher Education for the 1989-91 Triennium, I reiterated the Commonwealth Government's support for amalgamations only on explicit agreement of the institutions involved and the relevant State Government.

      <para>
       Negotiations are well under way in all Australian States on restructuring arrangements with some States at a more advanced stage than others. For example, the New South Wales Government has passed legislation restructuring the higher education system in that State.

       Legislation to amalgamate the Australian National University (ANU), the Canberra College of Advanced Education and the Canberra Institute of the Arts to form a new ANU has been introduced. The Government will not proceed without the agreement of the institutions.

       In my joint Press Release of 6 June 1989 with the Hon. B. G. Littleproud, MLA, Queensland Minister for Education, Youth and Sport we agreed that the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education as a separate entity will not be a member of the unified national system (UNS) and that its future development would be enhanced through an association with an existing university. It is understood that the College is seeking to develop a relationship with one of the existing universities in Brisbane.

       In 1989 there has been a first step towards consistency of rates for those aged 21 or over or with dependants, through payment of special higher rates of AUSTUDY to some students judged to be particularly disadvantaged. A maximum rate equivalent to the single adult unemployment benefit rate applied from 1 January to students aged 21 or over transferring to AUSTUDY from long-term receipt of a social security pension or benefit. This rate is also payable to students of any age with a dependent spouse or child, and to migrants aged 21 or over undertaking courses in English as a second language.

        â€”On 5 June 1989 (Hansard, page 3306), Senator Puplick asked me a question without notice concerning the alleged environmentally damaging consequences of draining the Guthega Reservoir earlier that day by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. I can now provide the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The drainage was carried out as part of a normal operational procedure to calibrate instrumentation under zero load conditions installed to monitor dam load under varying conditions necessary to determine the integrity and safety of the dam. Previous draining (eg 1984 and 1985) had not adversely affected the Snowy River environment downstream and this, together with monthly test operation of the dam's river outlet gate, suggested that any silt residues would be low.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority does not seek clearance for operational decisions from its Minister or any other Minister. Consultations on environmental issues with NSW officials occur on an on-going basis and, on this occasion, they expressed some concerns. As a result, NSW officials accepted an invitation to attend the drainage and sample the released water. Enquiries of NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service officials also indicated that no platypus colonies were present on the stretch of river involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most of the water was drained via the pressure tunnel in the normal turbining process. Only 170 million litres (or about 10%) remained for release through the dam's river outlet gates. This water was released in an environmentally sensitive way at a controlled rate of between 20 to 30 cubic metres per second (about 1/10th of the flood capacity of the river) but nevertheless, as planned, the quality of the water was monitored by Authority and NSW officials. Drainage, calibration and commencement of refilling the reservoir took less than one day.
      </para>
      <para>
       Monitoring has shown that there is no silt in the river bed. While there were a few millimetres of silt deposits above normal water level, additional water was released on 9 June to flush some of the remaining silt, with further flushes to occur as necessary with the snowmelt in the spring. There have been no apparent effects on fish or other fauna.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is correct that the Authority is not obliged to comply with NSW environmental legislation. However, the Authority is sensitive to environmental issues and fully recognises the need to act in a caring and responsible manner. The Authority's record over the years demonstrates its commitment to taking every reasonable effort to protect the environment, while continuing effective day-to-day operations of the Scheme. On-going consultations with relevant NSW agencies are a matter of course.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the existing arrangements for prior consultation with NSW agencies are seen as adequate, I have reinforced with the Authority the need to ensure this in relation to any future drainages of Guthega Reservoir.

        â€”On Thursday, 15 June (Hansard, page 4111), Senator MacGibbon asked me a question without notice about the tender process for the new Coastwatch contract. The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Coastwatch contract(s) were called by the Purchasing and Sales Group of the Department of Administrative Services (DAS). DAS is acting on behalf of the Australian Customs Service as Customs has operated Coastwatch since 1 August 1988. The requests for tender are open for 10 weeks, closing on 10 August 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       This highlights a major change in Government tendering procedures for coastal surveillance. The Government's tendering specialist organisation, DAS, is now responsible for the tender and not the department with policy responsibility for Coastwatch, as used to be the case.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the first time tender documentation was prepared jointly by DAS and Customs and approved by the Attorney-General's Department. Further all tender documentation and the development of evaluation procedures are in strict compliance with the findings and recommendations of the 1987 Review into Tender Procedures for the Coastwatch contract. That Review, ordered by the Government, was undertaken by a Committee chaired by Mr Andrew Menzies, a former Deputy Secretary in the Attorney-General's Department. The committee's report was tabled in the Senate on 19 November 1987. References of a contract administrative nature made in the judgement of Judge Beaumont in recent litigation over the previous Coastwatch contract have also been taken into account in developing procedures and documentation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Evaluation procedures have also been developed jointly between Customs and Administrative Services. DAS is primarily responsible for all administrative aspects of the Coastwatch tender which will be run just like any other Government contract. DAS will evaluate commercial aspects of tenders and will make final decisions on awarding the contract(s). Customs, which is responsible for technical and security aspects of tenders, will co-opt specialists from outside organisations on a needs basis to assist in the technical evaluation. A two tiered committee structure has been developed within Customs to meet its responsibilities. Tasks have been clearly outlined and participants' roles specifically defined.
      </para>
      <para>
       The projected timetable for the evaluation process forecasts completion by the end of this year-that is four and a half months for evaluation. I am advised this will be sufficient time for necessary assessments, however if not more time will be allowed. There will be no rushed decisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The procedures outlined above are a considerable improvement on those implemented during previous tender evaluation processes. They have been designed specifically to overcome previous shortcomings in administrative procedures.
      </para>
      <para>
       The general aviation industry should be well aware of administrative arrangements for this tender. Details of the objective evaluation criteria against which tenders will be judged are already incorporated in the publicly available request for tender document. The evaluation process was fully explained during an industry briefing to potential tenderers in Canberra on 23 June.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) In September 1987, a limit value of 600 becquerels per kilogram was set, above which permits were not granted for the importation of foodstuffs into Australia. This is the same value as that adopted by many European countries as the limit for their domestically-consumed foodstuffs. It was known to be a conservative limit. In July 1988, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organization jointly recommended a guideline value of 1000 becquerels per kilogram for a diet in which all major foodstuffs are contaminated with caesium-137.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The two shipments concerned were quantities of oregano and bay leaves from Turkey (permit number 16 and 21 in Table A). The quantities of the herbs in the two shipments were very small in relation to the total quantity consumed in Australia, virtually all of which remained free from radioactive contamination. The permission to import the two shipments was granted subject to the requirement that the oregano (or bay leaves) be diluted with other oregano (or bay leaves), or incorporated into manufactured products, such that the caesium-137 concentration in the foods made available for consumption by the public did not exceed 600 becquerels per kilogram. On this basis, it was deemed that the shipments would not present any hazard to health, as the added risk of fatal cancer for an individual eating the food would be less than one in ten million.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) (d) and (e) See Table A.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) See answer to (1) (b).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) In July 1986, a caesium-137 concentration of 100 becquerels per kilogram was set, above which a permit to import was required. The value was not a limit; rather, it was a trigger point to make it possible to gauge the levels of radioactivity in foodstuffs entering the country. It served to highlight those types of foods where closer scrutiny might be desirable. Consumption of food at this level corresponds to a very low risk of radiation-induced cancer. Using the internationally accepted risk factors, it can be shown that the risk of contracting cancer following consumption of one kilogram of food containing 100 becquerels of caesium-137 is about one in fifty million. This would result in an insignificant increase in the present death-rate in Australia from cancer. (b) (c) (d) and (e) See Table A.

      <para>
       Yes. The national Preference Agreement applies to contracts for goods and related services. The contract referred to was for a service and was therefore not subject to the Agreement. In the Request for Proposals, potential registrants were told that the components of the Joint Islands Supply System had been `provisionally identified' as including stevedoring and sea carriage at Fremantle. This was based on an assessment that most goods to be shipped to the Islands originated in the Perth area and that most goods shipped from the Islands were for delivery in Perth. However, there was no bar to alternative proposals being put forward. Potential registrants were told that `any logical and practical solution which can be up and running before the start date of the System' would be considered. All three proposals received suggested shipment through Fremantle. Consequently, the request for tender was based on the service being provided from Fremantle.

       (1) It is not possible to provide an average figure across the Australian Defence Force nor is there a central data bank from which such information could be drawn. The time which a soldier or sailor spends away from home varies greatly across the Services and the durations of such absences are influenced by operational requirements, exercises, category of employment, duty rosters, training requirements and personnel shortages. However, Land Headquarters has estimated that soldiers spend 17 to 20 weeks, of a training year of approximately 45 weeks, away from home. This figure is based upon Land Command Units but does not include headquarters such as Land Headquarters which would distort the figure considerably. With regard to sailor absences an examination of the 1989-90 Fleet programme for six Destroyer size ships showed the average time to be 175 days. This figure compares favourably with Naval planning data which allocates an average of 135 sea days to Fleet units.

        â€”On 1 June 1989 (Hansard, page 3227), Senator Patterson asked me a question without notice concerning underexpenditure in Austudy and labour market programs. The Minister for Employment and Education Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The underexpenditure in AUSTUDY of about $35 million (6.4%) is the result of an overestimation of the number of students expected to be assisted in 1988-89. It had originally been estimated that about 331,000 students would be assisted in 1988-89. As at June 1989 only 295,000 are now expected to receive assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Factors which may have affected the number of recipients include:
      </para>
      <para>
       success in applying fraud control measures, the effect of the assets test
      </para>
      <para>
       a lower than expected impact of decentralisation of AUSTUDY into the CES Network on take-up by secondary students, but precise data is not available.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reduction in numbers was offset, but not to a significant extent, by a higher than expected average expenditure per student.
      </para>
      <para>
       The level of parental income at which maximum allowance is payable ($16,950) is not a factor in the AUSTUDY underspend.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although AUSTUDY expenditure is less than the Budget estimate, expenditure in 1988-89 will be 15% higher than in 1987-88.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of trade training programs, the overall shortfall in expenditure as at 30 June 1989, was $2.6 million (1.9 per cent). The most significant shortfalls occurred in:
      </para>
      <para>
       Apprentice Training Incentive, and
      </para>
      <para>
       Off-the-Job Training
      </para>
      <para>
       Apprentice intakes for 1987-88 and 1988-89 are at record levels. Budget allocations for 1988-89 were in accord with this trend. The reason for underexpenditure in these programs to the end of June is that employers have been slow in making claims.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is expected that the Innovative Training Projects component of the Skills Training Program will be $1.0m below estimated expenditure due to a slower than planned development of training proposals by industry and industry based skill centres. This has resulted from the requirement for a tripartite approach and sizeable industry contributions to the projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       Administrative measures taken in 1987-88 to avoid an excessive Budget overrun in the JOBSTART program, affected program take-up lead times in 1988-89. Recent buoyancy in the labour market has also dampened demand for assistance under this program. Underexpenditure in 1988-89 is estimated as being in the order of $27 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of the JOBTRAIN program, underexpenditure will occur due to greater efficiency in administration. Approved targets were achieved by more competitive pricing of courses and a reduced average period of training. It is estimated that final expenditure for 1988-89 will be around $6 million below the JOBTRAIN appropriation.
